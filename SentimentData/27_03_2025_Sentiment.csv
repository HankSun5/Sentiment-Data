Analyst Predicts Breakout Beyond $2,100",https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/ethereum-rally-incoming-analyst-predicts-breakout-beyond-2100/,"Ethereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency, is getting a lot of attention right now. Some experts who watch the market closely think its price could go above $2,100 soon. They’ve been looking at how Ethereum’s price has been moving and see patterns that suggest it might be heading up. Related Reading: Shiba Inu ETF Proposal—Could This Be SHIB’s Breakout Moment? Short-Term Signs Point Upward One analyst, Crypto Patel, shared his thoughts on the social media platform X. He pointed out a setup on the Ethereum chart that looks promising for a price increase. Patel said Ethereum made a strong move upwards, which changed the way the market is structured. This happened after the price reacted to a level he had already identified as a good place for buyers to step in. #Ethereum Prints Bullish Displacement – Swing High Liquidity in Sight$ETH Price respecting bullish POI with clear displacement on tap. Currently testing mitigation block post-retest.

This area is called a mitigation block, and it often shows strong buying interest from big investors. The idea is that these investors use this zone to adjust their previous orders before continuing to push the price in a certain direction. Patel suggests that buying in this upper part of the mitigation zone lines up with how these big players often operate. The target price Patel mentioned is $2,128. This level is what’s known as a swing high liquidity zone. These zones often have a lot of stop-loss orders and pending buy orders clustered together. If the price moves into this area, it could trigger those orders and cause a sharp move, allowing investors to profit before the price possibly changes direction. Patel set a stop-loss for this trade at $2,027, just below the mitigation block. This helps limit potential losses if his prediction is wrong. Long-Term Pattern Looks Familiar Another analyst, TimeFreedomROB, also posted on X. He compared Ethereum’s current weekly price pattern to what happened between 2018 and 2020. His chart shows Ethereum breaking below an ascending triangle pattern, which is similar to how it broke below a descending triangle before its big recovery in 2020. Back then, Ethereum’s price hit a low point and then soared from under $100 to almost $4,800. #ETH 1W Price is showing the Same type of Break below support as last Cycle 👀 Will Price Recover Rapidly Like Last Time? 📈 pic.twitter.com/uoIDTd5w8L — TimeFreedom ®️0️⃣🅱️ ⚡ (@TimeFreedomROB) March 25, 2025 Currently, Ethereum is trading near $2,060. It recently dropped below the $2,300 mark and tested a lower trendline around $1800. This area also lines up with price levels where there was a lot of demand in previous years.

The analyst’s chart suggests this could be the final dip before a significant price increase, similar to what happened in past cycles. The area between $1,800 and $2,000 has acted as a strong support level in the past. For Ethereum’s price to confirm a return to an upward trend on the weekly chart, it needs to climb back above the $2,200 to $2,400 range. As of now, Ethereum is trading at $2,064. Over the last week, it has gained 6%. Its total market value is $250 billion, and the amount of Ethereum traded in the last 24 hours is $11.71 billion. These analysts are presenting scenarios based on how Ethereum’s price has behaved in the past, but it’s important to remember that the cryptocurrency market can be unpredictable.

42450446,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143577,1743032406,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Justice Served: T3 Freezes Massive $9M in Crypto Stolen from Bybit Hack,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/t3-freezes-bybit-hack-funds/,"In a significant win for the crypto space and a stark warning to cybercriminals, the T3 Financial Crime Unit has acted swiftly to freeze over $9 million in digital assets linked to the recent Bybit Exchange security breach. This decisive action highlights the increasing sophistication and collaborative efforts within the cryptocurrency ecosystem to combat illicit activities and safeguard user funds. Let’s dive into how this unfolded and what it means for the future of cryptocurrency security . What’s the Buzz About the Bybit Hack and the $9 Million Asset Freeze? If you’ve been following the crypto news, you’ve likely heard about the recent hack targeting the Bybit Exchange. While details of the exploit are still emerging, the immediate aftermath saw a substantial amount of digital assets siphoned off. This is where the T3 Financial Crime Unit stepped in. But who exactly is T3, and how did they manage to pull off such a significant asset freeze ? The T3 Financial Crime Unit isn’t your average watchdog. It’s a powerful collaboration, a trifecta of expertise combining the strengths of: TRON DAO : Known for its decentralized blockchain platform, TRON DAO brings its technological prowess and community-driven approach to the table. Tether : The issuer of USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin, Tether’s involvement underscores the critical role stablecoins play in the crypto ecosystem and their commitment to security. TRM Labs : A leader in blockchain intelligence, TRM Labs provides the cutting-edge technology and investigative tools necessary to trace and track illicit crypto flows. This powerhouse partnership was specifically formed to tackle financial crime within the digital asset space, and their recent success in the Bybit hack case is a testament to their effectiveness. Decoding the $9M Crypto Asset Freeze: How Did They Do It? Freezing digital assets in the decentralized world of cryptocurrency might sound like trying to catch smoke, but T3’s operation demonstrates that it’s increasingly possible. Here’s a simplified look at the process: Rapid Response & Identification: Following the report of the crypto hack on Bybit, T3’s team sprang into action. TRM Labs’ blockchain analytics tools are crucial here, allowing for the rapid tracing of the stolen funds as they move across different wallets and exchanges. Collaboration with Exchanges and Authorities: Freezing assets isn’t a solo act. It requires close cooperation with cryptocurrency exchanges (like Bybit in this case) and potentially regulatory bodies. T3 leverages its network and established relationships to coordinate these actions. Smart Contract and Wallet Freezing Mechanisms: Depending on the nature of the assets and the blockchain involved, various technical mechanisms can be employed to freeze funds. This might involve working with smart contract developers or engaging with exchanges to freeze accounts associated with the illicit transactions. Legal Framework and Compliance: While the crypto space is still navigating regulatory landscapes, established legal frameworks related to asset recovery and financial crime are utilized to legitimize and enforce these freezes. The $9 million freeze isn’t just a number; it represents a significant portion of the stolen funds potentially recovered, preventing further laundering or use by the perpetrators of the Bybit hack . Why is this Asset Freeze a Big Deal for Cryptocurrency? This successful stolen funds recovery operation carries weight beyond just the monetary value. It sends several powerful messages across the crypto ecosystem: Enhanced Security Perception: For users and potential investors, this action reinforces the idea that the crypto space is not a lawless Wild West. Proactive measures are being taken to protect users and their assets. Deterrent to Cybercriminals: The news of swift asset freezes can act as a significant deterrent to would-be hackers. It demonstrates that illicit gains are not easily attainable and that there are consequences. Legitimacy and Mainstream Adoption: Successful recovery operations contribute to the growing legitimacy of cryptocurrencies. It shows that the industry is maturing and taking security and user protection seriously, which is crucial for attracting mainstream adoption. Industry Collaboration is Key: The T3 unit exemplifies the power of collaboration. TRON DAO, Tether, and TRM Labs, each with their unique expertise, working together achieve far more than they could individually. This model of industry-led security initiatives is likely to become more prevalent. In essence, this asset freeze is a victory for the good guys in crypto, showcasing that security and accountability are becoming increasingly paramount. Are There Challenges in Crypto Asset Recovery? Absolutely. While the T3’s success is commendable, it’s important to acknowledge that stolen funds recovery in cryptocurrency is not always straightforward. Significant challenges remain: Challenge Description Decentralization and Anonymity The very features that make crypto attractive – decentralization and pseudonymity – can also hinder asset recovery. Tracing funds across multiple blockchains and anonymous wallets is technically complex. Jurisdictional Issues Cryptocurrency transactions are often borderless, making jurisdictional issues a major hurdle. Coordinating legal processes across different countries to freeze and recover assets can be lengthy and complicated. Technical Sophistication of Hackers Cybercriminals are constantly evolving their tactics. They employ sophisticated techniques to obfuscate transactions, use mixers and tumblers, and move funds across various exchanges to complicate tracking. Regulatory Uncertainty The evolving regulatory landscape around cryptocurrencies adds another layer of complexity. Lack of clear and consistent global regulations can impede cross-border asset recovery efforts. Despite these challenges, the T3 Financial Crime Unit’s achievement offers a beacon of hope and demonstrates that progress is being made in overcoming these obstacles. Looking Ahead: What Can We Learn from This Crypto Security Win? The successful freezing of assets linked to the Bybit hack provides valuable lessons and actionable insights for the crypto community: Proactive Security Measures are Essential: Exchanges and crypto platforms must prioritize robust security measures, including regular audits, advanced threat detection systems, and strong KYC/AML protocols to prevent hacks in the first place. Collaboration is Crucial: The T3 model highlights the importance of industry-wide collaboration. Sharing intelligence, resources, and expertise is vital to effectively combat crypto crime. Blockchain Analytics is a Game Changer: Tools like those provided by TRM Labs are becoming increasingly indispensable for tracing illicit crypto transactions and enabling asset recovery. User Awareness and Education: Users also have a role to play in cryptocurrency security . Practicing safe storage habits, being vigilant against phishing scams, and choosing reputable exchanges are all important steps. Conclusion: A Strong Message for a Safer Crypto Future The swift and decisive action by the T3 Financial Crime Unit to freeze over $9 million in assets linked to the Bybit hack is more than just a financial recovery; it’s a powerful statement. It signals a maturing cryptocurrency ecosystem that is actively fighting back against cybercrime, prioritizing user protection, and building a more secure and trustworthy digital asset space. This victory, while significant, is just one step in the ongoing battle for cryptocurrency security . Continued innovation, collaboration, and vigilance are crucial to stay ahead of evolving threats and ensure a safer future for all participants in the crypto revolution.

Speaking from the Oval Office, the president made his remarks during an event where he also introduced a new 25% duty on automobile imports. The comments come as part of a broader effort by the president to reshape trade relations with China, following the 20% levies he has already imposed on Chinese goods. The president predicted that he could secure at least an outline of a deal for TikTok by next week. However, he added that if an agreement is not reached, he would extend the deadline. “We’re going to have a form of a deal, but if it’s not finished, it’s not a big deal. We’ll just extend it,” Trump said, “I have the right to have the deal and to extend it if I want.” His remarks show that he’ll go one step ahead to complete the negotiations. He added, “We have a lot of interest in TikTok.” Trump speaking about the TikTok deal at the Oval Office. Source: Bloomberg Trump also mentioned that there are various ways to acquire TikTok, and he wants to find the one that’s best for the US. He clarified that China will ‘possibly’ have to play a role in it, such as in the form of an approval. He said, “I think they’ll do that. Maybe I’ll give them a little reduction in Tariffs or something, to get it done.” Trump thinks that’s justified, and probably a good offer, because “every point in Tariffs is worth more money than TikTok.” There was a time when Trump wanted to ban TikTok. However, the app helped him reach younger voters and helped him with the 2024 election campaign. This turned the President into a major supporter of the app. TikTok’s recent past in the US was troubled but now it appears that Trump will go to any lengths to change that for good. Negotiations have been underway with four unnamed bidders Under a law signed last year by President Joe Biden, ByteDance Ltd.—TikTok’s Chinese parent company—was required to sell the US operations of the app by January 19. TikTok briefly paused its service earlier this year, but a full shutdown was narrowly avoided when Trump signed an executive order delaying the law’s enforcement by 90 days, extending the deadline to April 5. Earlier this month, Trump confirmed that negotiations were underway with four potential bidders for TikTok. Although he did not name all the parties, publicly known bidders include a group led by billionaire Frank McCourt and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, another group featuring tech entrepreneur Jesse Tinsley and YouTube star MrBeast, and a merger offer by San Francisco-based Perplexity AI. In addition, Oracle Corp. is weighing a proposal that would see it provide security assurances and take a small stake in a new American entity while possibly allowing ByteDance to retain TikTok’s influential algorithm. Any final deal would need the approval of not only Trump but also ByteDance and the Chinese government. Allowing ByteDance to keep the algorithm might smooth the way for Chinese approval; however, it could risk noncompliance with the divestiture law.

The calm waters of the crypto market might be about to get choppy. Leading research firm K33 Research is sounding the alarm, predicting a potential surge in crypto volatility as we approach April 2nd. Why is this date circled in red on the crypto calendar? It’s the day former U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to unveil his tariff plans, a move analysts are dubbing “Liberation Day.” Why is Trump’s Tariff Announcement Triggering Crypto Volatility Fears? While Bitcoin has shown resilience, climbing nearly 5% in the past week, and U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs are enjoying a wave of inflows, raking in a hefty $896.6 million in just eight days, a sense of unease lingers in the trading community. According to insights from The Block, traders are treading cautiously, and for good reason. The potential catalyst for this looming market uncertainty ? Trump’s tariff announcement. K33 Research analysts pinpoint Trump’s stance as the critical factor. Here’s a breakdown of how different approaches could impact the crypto sphere: Softer Tone = Potential Price Lift: If Trump adopts a less aggressive stance on tariffs than anticipated, it could inject optimism into the broader markets, including crypto. This could be seen as a signal of reduced economic tension, potentially leading to a positive price movement for cryptocurrencies. Ambiguity or Hardline Approach = Sharp Swings: Conversely, if Trump’s announcement is vague or leans towards a hardline tariff policy, brace yourselves. History suggests that such pronouncements can trigger significant market turbulence. Think back to past tariff-related sell-offs – the crypto market could experience similar sharp downward swings. Decoding the Market Sentiment Amidst Trump Tariff Announcement To truly understand the current market pulse, let’s delve deeper into the factors contributing to this cautious optimism mixed with underlying anxiety: Bitcoin’s Recent Gains and ETF Inflows: A Sign of Strength? Bitcoin’s recent price surge and the continued positive flows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs are undeniably positive indicators. These inflows suggest sustained institutional interest and growing mainstream adoption. However, seasoned traders know that in the volatile world of crypto, past performance is not always a predictor of future outcomes. The market’s reaction to the Trump tariff announcement could easily overshadow these positive trends. Trader Caution: Reading Between the Lines The reported trader caution is a crucial signal. It indicates that despite the positive momentum, a significant segment of the market anticipates potential headwinds. This caution is likely rooted in the understanding of how macroeconomic factors, such as tariff policies, can ripple through all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Experienced traders are adept at anticipating and reacting to such macro-driven risks. Navigating the Impending Crypto Volatility: Key Strategies So, how can crypto investors and traders prepare for this potential wave of crypto volatility ? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on news related to Trump’s tariff announcement. Reputable financial news sources and crypto market analysis platforms will be invaluable in providing real-time updates and expert interpretations. Risk Management is Paramount: Now is the time to review and potentially tighten your risk management strategies. Consider adjusting your portfolio allocation, setting stop-loss orders, and being prepared to reduce exposure if market conditions warrant it. Diversification: While Bitcoin is the leading cryptocurrency, diversification across different crypto assets can help mitigate risk. Explore established altcoins and consider spreading your investments to reduce the impact of volatility in any single asset. Cash is King (Optional): In times of heightened uncertainty, holding a portion of your portfolio in stablecoins or fiat currency can provide a safety net. This allows you to capitalize on potential buying opportunities if prices dip sharply. Understand Market Sentiment: Pay attention to market sentiment indicators. Crypto fear and greed indices and social media sentiment analysis can provide clues about the prevailing market mood and potential shifts in momentum. The Road Ahead: Beyond the Tariff Announcement The Trump tariff announcement is just one piece of the puzzle in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. While it presents a potential near-term volatility trigger, the long-term trajectory of the crypto market is shaped by a multitude of factors, including technological advancements, regulatory developments, and broader economic trends. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for navigating the inherent volatility of this exciting asset class. The coming days could be pivotal for the crypto market. Whether Trump’s announcement unleashes a storm of volatility or proves to be a non-event remains to be seen. However, being prepared, staying informed, and having a robust risk management strategy in place are essential for weathering any potential market turbulence and positioning yourself for long-term success in the crypto space. Conclusion: Brace for Potential Swings in the Crypto Market The crypto market stands at a potential crossroads. K33 Research’s warning about impending crypto volatility related to Trump’s tariff announcement is a timely reminder of the external factors that can significantly influence digital assets. While positive undercurrents like Bitcoin ETF inflows exist, the shadow of political and economic uncertainty looms large.

Following the latest surge, the price appears strong, advancing bullish on the day. The past months have been rough and tough for most meme coins as they dropped heavily to their multi-month lows. This came as a result of wide correction, but they recently found a solid ground. Meanwhile, Pepe mounted support two weeks ago and started to show signs of recovery, although it was less significant due to low volatility. This led to a serious squeeze throughout last week and closed at a loss. However, this week has been interesting for Pepe and other top meme coins as they find their way back into buying mode after struggling with volatility since they rebounded over the past weeks. This bearish break may last long if the bulls show strong commitment in the coming days. Failure to commit strongly might bring an end to the latest surge. This may trigger a new sell order capable of rolling the price back before breaking down the current monthly low. If the bulls defend the monthly low well, we may see a fresh increase with a new bullish pattern. Pepe’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The current surge is targeted at the $0.0000108 resistance. If the price increases above this resistance, a higher level to consider for a test would be $0.0000127 and potentially $0.0000148. Resuming the downtrend, the $0.000007 and $0.000006 levels might pose a threat before reclaiming the monthly low of $0.00000522. Losing it could send the price to a low of $0.000004 in the near term.

The token has surged more than 16% in the past week and is presently hovering at $0.00000915 after breaking through the 50-day Exponential Moving Average. This may be an indication that the trend is developing a bullish reversal which may lead to a Pepe coin rally. Pepe Coin Rally Continues as Price Approaches $0.0000100 Level Top meme coin PEPE could remove a zero from its price amid the Pepe coin rally, which saw a sharp 13% rise in 24 hours. The token reached $0.00000906, breaking a major technical resistance at the 50-day EMA. The RSI has climbed to 58, reflecting a rise in bullish momentum. The price action also shows a breakout above the upper Bollinger Band. This move aligns with increased market activity and expanding volatility. According to analyst Satori , if the current indicators continue to trend upwards, the recently broken resistance level could solidify as a new support zone. Source: X Similarly, experts revealed that the top meme coin is positioned for a potential explosion, urging investors to accumulate now or risk missing out on substantial gains. With PEPE holding strong support and outperforming other meme coins, analysts believe it could see a 100% surge PEPE Futures Market Shows Strong Trader Interest PEPE futures open interest surged to $324 million, the highest since February 2, 2025. This marks a sharp increase from earlier levels in March when it stood at $166 million. A rising open interest indicates more active futures positions. It reflects a growing interest in the top meme coin among derivatives traders during the ongoing Pepe coin rally. Source: Coinglass Additionally, data from Nansen shows PEPE exchange reserves dropped by 0.73% over the past week. The current level stands at 240.7 trillion tokens held on exchanges. This movement suggests investors are withdrawing their holdings from exchanges. Reduced reserves often point to long-term holding behavior and lower short-term sell pressure. Next Resistance Levels and Technical Outlook The next price resistance is at $0.00001094. If broken, the PEPE Coin rally may test $0.00001180, a level that previously acted as a support zone. PEPE price rebound began after hitting $0.000005895 on March 10, matching its August 2023 low. Since then, it has steadily gained, supported by technical strength and investor positioning during the Pepe coin rally. Moreover, a recent analysis shows that Pepe Coin is forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern, a classic bullish reversal signal indicating a breakout. Analysts suggest that a confirmed move above the $0.0000075 neckline could trigger a sharp surge, with some even predicting a 40x meme coin rally . At press time, Pepe coin price was up 5.59% in the last 24 hours, trading at $0.000008430. Its 24-hour trading volume had surged by 96.50% to reach $1 billion, while the market cap climbed by 5.60% to $3.54 billion.

Though it remains bearish despite the latest surge. In the last leg down, Shiba managed to stay above the psychological $0.00001 level after breaking through several support levels since the start of the year. While the sell-off seemed to have temporarily cooled off, the price increased as it showed strength on the daily chart. This started after bouncing back above the mentioned psychological level two weeks back. The bounce produced a substantial gain in the past week and briefly changed the trading landscape, while the trend remains bearish on the daily chart. Looking back from where it started to drop at $0.000034 in December, Shiba still maintains a swing low trend. As we can see, the latest bounce is considered a retracement of the short-term bearish. The drag down will likely continue if the bulls fail to sustain momentum. If not, more surges could bring a bigger recovery before the bears step back. Currently, they are taking a break, and from the look of things, they will likely release pressure again. It will be too early to say the bulls are back in the market. Shiba’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Right now, Shib aims to test a nearby resistance level at $0.0000173. A rejection there may bring selling back in the market, but if it pushes higher, the next resistance to watch above it is $0.000019, followed by the $0.0000223 level. On the daily chart, there’s support for Shiba at $0.0000138, $0.0000123 and the $0.0000109 level marked as the current monthly low. If the price breaks below it, a new low may surface at the $0.000009 level.

Regulatory Dynamics Shape Adoption: Clear regulations foster trust and attract investment, but overly stringent policies risk stifling innovation, especially in emerging markets. Technological Innovations Push Boundaries: Advances in cryptography, smart contracts, and AI are addressing scalability, security, and efficiency challenges, expanding possibilities in the digital economy. Crypto Promotes Financial Inclusion: Cryptocurrencies provide access to financial tools for the unbanked, empowering individuals while transforming global workforce dynamics. Challenges Remain Critical: Security risks, environmental concerns, and market saturation are ongoing hurdles that require innovative solutions to sustain crypto’s growth. I’ve always been fascinated by how technology transforms the way we live, and cryptocurrency is one of those innovations that feels like it’s reshaping the future right before our eyes. From decentralised finance to blockchain-powered solutions, the digital economy is evolving at an incredible pace. It’s not just about Bitcoin or Ethereum anymore—it’s about the vast ecosystem driving change across industries. Understanding the forces behind this dynamic world has been both exciting and eye-opening for me. The blend of technology, economics, and community-driven innovation creates an environment full of potential. Whether it’s the promise of financial inclusion or the push for greater transparency, crypto’s impact is undeniable. Exploring these forces isn’t just about staying informed; it’s about grasping the opportunities and challenges shaping tomorrow. Analysing The Core Components Of Cryptocurrency Cryptocurrency operates within an intricate framework that’s both fascinating and transformative. I’ve always found breaking down its core elements helps in making sense of its revolutionary potential. Understanding Blockchain Technology Blockchain technology forms the backbone of cryptocurrency. It’s a secure, immutable ledger that records transactions across a distributed network. I’m amazed by how it eliminates intermediaries, ensuring transparency and accountability. Experts, like Andreas Antonopoulos, call it the “internet of money” for good reason. Each block contains data, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash. This structure ensures that altering data in one block would require changing all subsequent blocks. It fosters trust, especially in a decentralised system where no central authority exists. Its robustness excites me. Transactions are verified using consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake. The absence of centralised verification speeds up processes and reduces costs. Blockchain, beyond finance, impacts healthcare, supply chains, and even voting systems. Role Of Decentralisation In Cryptocurrencies Decentralisation defines cryptocurrencies and differentiates them from traditional currencies. By distributing control across a global network, it removes reliance on central authorities. I’ve seen how this feature empowers individuals in regions with unstable economies. Nodes within the network validate transactions, preventing centralised control or censorship. Vitalik Buterin describes decentralisation as “a key to resistance against systemic corruption.” This aligns with cryptocurrency’s foundational ethos of financial sovereignty. Users hold private keys, ensuring only they control their funds. Peer-to-peer transactions reduce inefficiencies, increasing inclusivity. I believe decentralisation drives trust, making cryptocurrencies attractive to those seeking alternatives to traditional banking. Examining Tokenisation And Crypto Assets Tokenisation transforms real-world assets into digital tokens on a blockchain. Each token represents ownership or usage rights, enhancing liquidity and accessibility. I’m intrigued by how it democratises ownership, allowing smaller investors to participate in high-value assets. Crypto assets can be utility tokens, security tokens, or non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Utility tokens power ecosystems, while security tokens represent investments. NFTs are unique and bring digital art and collectibles into mainstream markets. This diversity is thrilling. Tokenisation ensures transparency through blockchain-based verification. Regulators like the FCA are moving to clarify frameworks, which could spur adoption. I view crypto assets as symbols of the paradigm shift in how we perceive, trade, and store value. Exploring Market Trends Shaping Cryptocurrency Cryptocurrencies are evolving rapidly, bringing fresh opportunities and challenges. With dynamic forces influencing the market, it’s clear that understanding key trends is crucial to navigating this digital economy effectively. Volatility And Price Mechanics Price volatility defines the crypto market, driven by speculators, investor sentiment, and rapid news cycles. I’ve noticed that significant events, like regulatory announcements or technological updates, can cause sharp price swings. Supply mechanics also play a crucial role. Cryptos like Bitcoin, with a capped supply of 21 million, exhibit scarcity value, amplifying demand during market upswings. Low liquidity often exacerbates volatility, especially for emerging altcoins. Adoption By Businesses And Consumers Business and consumer adoption is redefining cryptocurrencies’ practical uses. I’ve seen global firms like Tesla accept Bitcoin for payments, showcasing their legitimacy. Payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard are integrating crypto transactions, simplifying cross-border payments. Consumers are also warming to using crypto-backed cards for everyday purchases. DeFi platforms allow earning and borrowing, making crypto an economic alternative. These examples highlight growing trust in crypto products. Key Investment Trends In The Crypto Space Investment trends in crypto have shifted towards institutional participation. According to Bloomberg, over £40 billion flowed into crypto hedge funds and ETFs in 2023 alone. I’ve personally observed rising interest in utility-driven projects like Ethereum Layer-2 solutions, reducing transaction costs. NFTs and metaverse assets are gaining traction, offering new digital ownership pathways. Staking and earning opportunities through Proof-of-Stake networks also attract a growing investor base. Investigating Regulatory And Legal Dynamics Governments and agencies are continually shaping the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies. I find this part of the digital economy fascinating, as it establishes how innovation and governance coexist. Government Policies Across The Globe Global regulatory efforts aim for consistency to protect investors and economies. The IMF has stressed the importance of coordinated frameworks, warning against naming crypto as legal tender due to risks for emerging markets. I think these moves balance innovation with financial stability. In countries like Japan and Switzerland, regulators classify cryptocurrencies distinctly to integrate them within their financial systems. Meanwhile, India and China continue imposing strict bans, focusing on reducing risks like illicit financing. These varying stances define the global crypto policies today. Challenges Of Compliance And Legal Frameworks Crypto firms face challenges adapting to diverse regulations worldwide. Regular shifts in the legal framework demand constant re-evaluation of compliance strategies. I often hear industry leaders expressing frustration over uncertainties in enforcement, especially across borders. Regulators like the SEC and CFTC in the US have differing views on crypto as securities or commodities. This overlapping jurisdiction adds layers of complexity for innovation. Trustworthy industry voices, like Coinbase’s CEO, advocate clearer rules for fostering growth. Impact Of Regulations On Crypto Adoption I think regulations play a key role in mainstream crypto adoption. Clarity in rules encourages institutional investors while reducing market volatility. For example, US guidelines have attracted firms looking to legitimise crypto operations within a safe, regulated framework. However, excess restrictions could stifle innovation. Emerging economies rely on crypto for financial inclusion but risk exclusion due to heavy-handed policies. Striking the right balance can create trust, enabling more users to embrace crypto securely and confidently. Understanding Technological Innovations In Crypto Technological advances in the crypto space are reshaping the digital economy. I find it fascinating how these developments are addressing challenges like scalability and expanding possibilities for decentralised finance (DeFi) and blockchain networking. Emerging Cryptographic Protocols Cryptographic protocols ensure secure, efficient communication in blockchain systems. Zero-knowledge proofs, for example, let parties verify transactions without revealing sensitive data. Innovations in quantum-resistant algorithms are also emerging to counter future threats from quantum computing. Chainlink’s verifiable random function (VRF) stands out for generating tamper-proof randomness in blockchain processes. Role Of AI And Machine Learning In Crypto AI and machine learning are transforming crypto trading and security. Algorithms predict price trends, enabling data-driven decisions. I’ve seen machine learning help prevent fraud by detecting unusual transaction patterns. AI also optimises blockchain management by automating tasks like resource allocation. OpenAI’s insights on blockchain scalability showcase AI’s potential in improving decentralised networks. Advancements In Smart Contracts And DeFi Smart contracts have taken digital agreements to the next level. Platforms like Ethereum and Solana enable programmable agreements that execute automatically. DeFi boosts financial inclusion through innovations like yield farming and decentralised lending. High-level automation in protocols like Aave has impressed me with its efficiency in offering secure, accessible, and interest-based crypto loans. Social And Cultural Impacts Of Cryptocurrency Cryptocurrencies are reshaping societies and challenging cultural norms. They empower individuals, promote global inclusion, and redefine value exchange in the digital age. Democratising Finance For The Unbanked Cryptocurrencies open access to financial tools for people without bank accounts. Over 1.4 billion adults globally remain unbanked, according to the World Bank. With just an internet connection, anyone can send or receive money, borrow, or save. This fosters inclusion and economic participation. Blockchain-based microloans are transforming lives in developing countries. Platforms like Celo let users access lending markets without credit histories. This bypasses traditional institutions, offering hope to those once excluded. I see this as a powerful force for empowerment. The Influence Of Cryptocurrencies On Workforce Dynamics Cryptocurrencies are altering workforce structures by introducing borderless payments. Freelancers now secure payments in Bitcoin or Ethereum, cutting delays from traditional transfers. This flexibility encourages cross-border collaboration, especially for remote workers. Start-ups in the blockchain space are thriving. Many hire employees through token compensation schemes instead of salaries, aligning interests. I’ve noticed friends joining crypto firms because they value transparency and shared growth potential. It’s a revolutionary change. Crypto Communities And Global Collaboration Crypto communities unite people across countries, fostering innovation. Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) like MakerDAO govern assets globally, enabling democratic participation. Leaders like Vitalik Buterin cite them as crypto’s cultural backbone. Social media amplifies collaboration among enthusiasts. Platforms like Twitter and Reddit host thriving crypto discussions. From coding to marketing ideas, these communities build ecosystems together. I feel inspired witnessing this collective, borderless teamwork grow. Challenges And Risks In The Crypto Economy The crypto economy has brought significant opportunities, but it isn’t without its challenges. From security issues to environmental concerns, these risks must be addressed to sustain its evolution. Addressing Security Threats And Fraud Security issues are a major worry in the crypto market. Crypto Ponzi schemes, ICO scams, and thefts often target inexperienced investors. I’ve seen friends fall victim to phishing attacks, losing their funds. Experts recommend using hardware wallets and two-factor authentication for protection. Transparency in transactions and blockchain tracking tools, like CipherTrace, can help authorities tackle money laundering and fraud effectively. Navigating Environmental Concerns Of Mining Crypto mining’s energy consumption harms the environment. Bitcoin alone uses more energy annually than some countries. I know developers shifting to Proof-of-Stake systems to reduce energy needs, like Ethereum did. Renewable energy sources could make mining sustainable. Reports suggest miners are exploring green solutions, cutting emissions in the process. Governments are also scrutinising environmental impacts to encourage eco-friendly crypto practices. Managing The Impact Of Market Saturation The growing number of cryptocurrencies has led to market saturation. Over 10,000 tokens now compete for investor attention, diluting value and confusing users. I’ve invested in lesser-known coins only to see poor returns. Experts often advise focusing on projects with strong use cases. Decentralised finance (DeFi) and established tokens offer better stability. Staying informed is key to avoiding unreliable or short-lived crypto projects. Conclusion: Navigating The Future Of The Digital Economy The crypto landscape is evolving at a breathtaking pace, reshaping how we perceive value, ownership, and financial systems. It’s clear that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology hold immense potential to drive transparency, inclusion, and innovation across industries. As we navigate this dynamic space, balancing technological advancements with regulatory clarity will be essential to unlocking its full potential. By embracing the opportunities while addressing the challenges, we can foster a digital economy that’s more equitable, efficient, and sustainable for everyone. The journey ahead is both exciting and complex, but with the right focus, the transformative power of cryptocurrency can truly redefine our global economy.",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BUSINESS|ETH|BTC,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-03-26 23:59:59

For instance, the ONDO market cap has recently decreased by 12%, despite the initiative’s expansion into real-world asset tokenization with partners like Mastercard. Conversely, the cryptocurrency community has noted an Aptos (APT) price surge following Bitwise’s ETF application. Yet, perhaps the most captivating development is from BlockDAG (BDAG) . Its new Ambassador Program offers every blockchain enthusiast a chance at leadership, exclusive perks, and a firsthand experience of Web3 innovations. Given BlockDAG’s impressive growth—rising 2,380% in value—this program is seen as an opportunity to join one of the most promising ventures in the current market. Market Cap of Ondo Finance Falls Despite Forward-Looking Strategies At present, the ONDO market cap is about $3.25 billion, showing a 12% reduction over the last day. This decline comes in stark contrast to the company’s ambitious plans in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Ondo Finance has recently teamed up with Mastercard’s Multi-Token Network (MTN) to integrate its Short-Term U.S. Government Treasuries Fund (OUSG). This collaboration marks a significant step toward the broader acceptance of tokenized assets. Despite recent price fluctuations, these strategic partnerships highlight Ondo’s dedication to merging conventional financial systems with decentralized technologies, setting up the ONDO market cap for potential future growth as more traditional assets become tokenized. Aptos (APT) Price Surge Following Bitwise’s ETF Proposal Aptos (APT) saw a significant price increase of about 12% on March 5, 2025, subsequent to Bitwise Asset Management’s application for a cryptocurrency-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF). This Aptos (APT) price surge signifies a growing institutional interest in this digital asset. The ETF intends to offer regulated access to APT, enhancing its appeal in the broader market. Prior to this move, Bitwise had established an Aptos trust in Delaware, indicating a strategy to enlarge its cryptocurrency investment options. The recent Aptos (APT) price surge mirrors the market’s optimistic reaction to these developments. Exploring BlockDAG’s Ambassador Program: A Path to Engagement and Rewards BlockDAG offers blockchain enthusiasts a unique opportunity to not just observe but actively influence the market. The Ambassador Program by BlockDAG goes beyond merely promoting the project—it’s a platform to gain firsthand Web3 experience, connect globally, and engage with the core team of the project. Participants in the program receive updates directly, attend workshops, and collaborate with peers who are equally passionate. To join, applicants simply complete an online form, and upon acceptance, can immediately start contributing. This initiative is central to fostering community engagement, which is vital to BlockDAG’s expansive goals. More than just participation, being an ambassador comes with tangible rewards. Participants earn BDAG coins, gain access to exclusive events, and receive unique merchandise. Active ambassadors can ascend to leadership roles, increasing their influence within the community and gaining prominence at significant blockchain events. With over $206 million gathered from the BlockDAG coin presale and BDAG’s price increase from $0.001 to $0.0248 through multiple batches, many regard this period as the best time to buy crypto. An expanding community enhances the project’s strength, pushing it toward a $600 million presale target. BlockDAG continues to progress rapidly. Having sold 18.8 billion BDAG and with projections of substantial returns for early participants, the success of the Ambassador Program is instrumental in this growth. As the ecosystem evolves, buying crypto now means joining a dynamic movement poised to make a significant impact. Final Thoughts on Ondo, Aptos & BlockDAG’s Future Which cryptocurrency stands out as the best to purchase? Ondo Finance is pushing forward with its strategy for tokenizing real-world assets, though the ONDO market cap fluctuates with market reactions to its latest initiatives. Meanwhile, the Aptos (APT) price surge after Bitwise’s ETF application highlights increasing institutional interest, though its future potential is still forming. BlockDAG distinguishes itself with considerable momentum. Its Ambassador Program offers more than community engagement—it’s a gateway to leadership, exclusive benefits, and early involvement in one of the fastest-growing cryptocurrency projects.

Pseudonymous analyst The Flow Horse tells his 266,500 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks crypto is still bearish and the latest rally will probably lead to another leg down. According to the analyst, the current bounce has not changed the bearish market structure of crypto. “Bearish still on the high time frame until proven otherwise. I can’t see any reason why this isn’t a relief rally and markets won’t continue to suck the next few months. Chart is still broken.” Elaborating on his bearish stance on crypto, the trader says on the instant messaging platform Telegram that the downtrend will likely persist unless Bitcoin ( BTC ) flips a key price area into support. “I think we are at the part where the correction can be, as I said the other day, one that is more through time than through price. I will be looking at how FARTCOIN, HYPE, PEPE, ENA and BERA continue to trade. Being that it is a Bitcoin dominance macro trend, there is no reason to assume that changes, and any success in alts is going to come down to if BTC can turn this $90,000-$93,000 level into support.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $87,813.

The Avalanche (AVAX) price rally has picked up pace, with technical indicators and funding data hinting at more room to climb. At the same time, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) burn rate has surged after a massive 1 billion token burn, reinforcing long-term efforts to reduce supply. But while both tokens ride current trends, one project is creating its own. BlockDAG (BDAG) has its Keynote 3 release set for March 28, and speculation is high—updates on exchange listings, new strategic partnerships, and even major rewards for early holders are expected. The Keynote 3 could be the mega event that cements BDAG as a top crypto to buy in 2025. Traders Eye Gains as Avalanche Price Rally Continues The Avalanche (AVAX) price rally showed continued strength on Monday, with the token climbing over 7% and trading above $21. Recent price action broke a descending trendline, and AVAX is now targeting resistance levels at $24.99 and potentially $30. On-chain indicators support the bullish sentiment. The Relative Strength Index is trending above 50, and a bullish MACD crossover appeared last week. Coinglass data further reinforces positive momentum, as AVAX’s long-to-short ratio hit 1.18—its highest in more than a month. As funding rates turn positive, the Avalanche (AVAX) price rally may still have room to run in the near term. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Surges Following 1B Token Burn The Shiba Inu (SHIB) burn rate saw a dramatic 8,470% increase after an anonymous wallet removed 1 billion SHIB tokens from circulation in a single transaction. Recorded by the community tracker Shibburn, this burn took place at 14:55 UTC and was valued at approximately $13,050. Etherscan data suggests the same wallet has conducted multiple similar burns, including two additional 1 billion SHIB transactions since August 2024. In total, over 1.004 billion SHIB were burned across 14 transactions within 24 hours. This sharp rise in the Shiba Inu burn rate reflects ongoing efforts to reduce supply and support long-term value. 2 Days Until BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 Drops! Could This Be BDAG’s Plot Twist? BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 is almost here, and the excitement is hard to ignore. March 28 is shaping up to be a milestone moment. The project’s earlier keynotes already proved its flair for high-impact reveals—Keynote 1 lit up Tokyo’s Shibuya Crossing, while Keynote 2 went viral for its unique, moon-themed video. Now, the third Keynote brings Hollywood-level production into the mix, raising expectations for something even bigger. Anticipation isn’t limited to visuals or theatrics—it’s tied directly to what this could unlock for the coin itself. Plenty of chatter surrounds what might drop. Some expect a confirmed mainnet launch date. Others are betting on centralised exchange listings or sizable rewards for early holders. These types of announcements often drive a shift in market perception—and with BDAG already up 2,380% since its presale began, the stakes feel higher than ever. Confidence in the project has grown steadily, and momentum continues to build as each presale batch sells out. For a growing number of analysts and crypto followers, BlockDAG is becoming a top crypto to buy in 2025 . Now priced at $0.0248 in batch 27, BDAG is attracting attention from both early adopters and latecomers. The limited window before Keynote 3 is creating urgency, not hype. As demand increases and supply tightens, the value proposition becomes harder to ignore. For holders, this moment marks a shift—from potential to pressure, from build-up to breakout. Final Takeaways The Avalanche price rally continues to hold market interest, especially as traders watch for a breakout above key resistance. Meanwhile, the sudden spike in the Shiba Inu burn rate has reignited talk about its deflationary model and long-term value prospects. But while both have their eyes on incremental gains, BlockDAG is staring down a potentially game-changing moment. Keynote 3 drops in just days, and the clock is ticking. If even half the rumors—such as updates on exchange listings, bigger partnerships, and exclusive holder rewards—prove true, BDAG’s $0.0248 price would quickly become a thing of the past as its value will jump. Among the top cryptos to buy in 2025, BDAG is racing ahead.

42451870,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=30115,1743033645,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png,The Future of Finance: How Crypto and Blockchain are Revolutionising the Financial World,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/the-future-of-finance-how-crypto-and-blockchain-are-revolutionising-the-financial-world/,"Key Takeaways Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are revolutionising finance by enabling decentralised, secure, and transparent transactions without intermediaries. Blockchain’s key applications include facilitating cross-border payments, smart contracts, and decentralised finance (DeFi), which improve efficiency and reduce costs. Cryptocurrencies offer financial access to the unbanked, fostering global inclusion while also lowering transaction fees for individuals and businesses. Significant challenges to adoption include regulatory uncertainty, scalability issues, and public mistrust, though strides are being made to address these concerns. The future of finance includes mainstream cryptocurrency adoption, innovative blockchain advancements, and balanced regulations from governments and central banks. I’ve always been fascinated by how technology shapes our world, and nowhere is this more evident than in finance. Over the past decade, crypto and blockchain have gone from niche concepts to transformative forces, reshaping how we think about money, transactions and trust. It’s incredible to see how these innovations are breaking barriers and creating opportunities that felt impossible just a few years ago. For me, what stands out most is the sense of empowerment these technologies bring. Blockchain’s transparency and decentralisation offer a refreshing alternative to traditional systems, while cryptocurrencies are opening doors to financial inclusion for millions. It’s not just about disrupting the old ways—it’s about building something better, more accessible and more secure. This evolution isn’t just exciting; it’s redefining the rules of the game, and I can’t wait to see where it takes us next. Understanding the Basics of Crypto and Blockchain Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology have redefined how we think about financial systems. Their innovative features make them compelling tools for creating a decentralised and secure future. What Is Cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency is digital money built on blockchain technology. Unlike traditional currencies, it operates independently of governments or central banks. Bitcoin and Ethereum are popular examples. I find its transparency fascinating; every user can verify transactions, fostering trust in the system. How Does Blockchain Technology Work? Blockchain is a shared digital ledger that records transactions in blocks. Each block is linked to the previous one using cryptography, ensuring data can’t be altered. It’s efficient and secure. Developers I’ve spoken to praise its decentralised nature, which empowers users by removing intermediaries. Key Differences Between Traditional Finance and Blockchain Finance Traditional finance relies on centralised institutions, such as banks, to verify and process transactions. Blockchain finance eliminates middlemen by enabling peer-to-peer exchanges. It also operates 24/7, unlike banks with limited hours. I appreciate that it grants financial access globally, even to the unbanked. Exploring the Benefits of Cryptocurrency in Finance Enhanced Security and Transparency Cryptocurrency uses blockchain to secure transactions with immutable records. Each entry is tamper-proof, which builds trust in the system. Cryptographic techniques shield identities, reducing fraud risks. Public ledgers allow anyone to verify transactions, ensuring transparency. Lower Transaction Costs Crypto eliminates intermediaries like banks, cutting transaction fees. When I’ve sent payments abroad using Bitcoin, it was faster and cheaper than traditional methods. For small businesses, this is a game-changer. Blockchain’s efficiency means fewer charges for transfers, even across borders. Accessibility for the Unbanked Blockchain opens access to financial tools for the unbanked. People without traditional bank accounts can store, send, or receive funds via mobile wallets. I’ve seen how crypto empowers communities by offering global financial inclusion. It’s a step towards equal economic opportunities. Revolutionising Industries with Blockchain Technology Blockchain is reshaping industries with its transparency and efficiency. From cross-border payments to automation and decentralised finance (DeFi), its potential is vast. I’ve seen how it’s already transforming some sectors, and the future looks promising. Transforming Cross-Border Payments Blockchain is streamlining international transactions. I’ve noticed how blockchain eliminates intermediaries like SWIFT, cutting costs and delays. According to the World Bank, traditional cross-border remittance fees average 6.3%, but blockchain reduces them to nearly zero. Payments settle almost instantly, which is crucial for businesses and migrants supporting families abroad. Ripple, for instance, uses blockchain to connect banks, offering real-time global transactions. It’s a change I find incredible compared to dealing with outdated systems. Smart Contracts and Automation Smart contracts automate processes securely. These self-executing contracts reduce paperwork and eliminate disputes by enforcing terms automatically. Ethereum’s blockchain made smart contracts mainstream, and I’ve seen them in use for insurance claims, supply chains, and property deals. They save time and reduce human error. For example, companies like Slock.it use them to manage rental contracts efficiently. The potential for transparency and cost-cutting in industries is unmatched. It’s like having a neutral referee overseeing transactions. Decentralised Finance (DeFi) and Its Applications DeFi is creating financial tools without banks. It enables borrowing, lending, and trading through blockchain-powered platforms. I’ve used platforms like Aave, which let users earn interest or secure loans within minutes. DeFi removes centralised control, making finance accessible to everyone. As reported by DeFi Pulse, this sector holds over £39 billion in assets, growing rapidly. Start-ups and individuals benefit from this new, trustless system. I believe DeFi could define future finance, making it fairer and more inclusive globally. Challenges Facing Crypto and Blockchain Adoption Crypto and blockchain are reshaping finance, but several obstacles slow widespread adoption. From regulatory uncertainties to concerns over scalability and trust, these challenges need solutions for full potential realisation. Regulatory Uncertainty and Compliance Issues Undefined rules around cryptocurrencies make global operations tough. Countries label them differently, as securities, currencies, or commodities, leading to confusion. I’ve seen businesses hesitate to invest due to unclear legal landscapes. Regulatory clarity would boost confidence, as highlighted by leading financial experts. Scalability and Energy Concerns Blockchain struggles with processing speed, limiting use. Bitcoin handles 7 transactions per second compared to Visa’s 24,000. The energy use of proof-of-work systems also raises flags. My experience with Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake shows steps towards improving efficiency while reducing impact. Public Perception and Trust Barriers Mistrust in crypto stems from scams and market volatility. Many still link it to criminal activities despite advancements. When I first started using blockchain apps, scepticism from peers was common. Mainstream adoption requires transparency and education to break these barriers, as experts frequently suggest. Predictions for the Future of Crypto and Blockchain Blockchain and cryptocurrency are reshaping finance. I see their potential to drive innovation, boost global inclusion, and transform industries further. Here’s what’s next: Mainstream Adoption of Cryptocurrencies Cryptocurrencies are becoming widely accepted by businesses and individuals. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) add an exciting dimension, even though they differ from decentralised crypto. Experts believe DeFi platforms and NFTs will continue accelerating adoption globally. Major companies like Tesla and PayPal already accept Bitcoin. This trend seems unstoppable as crypto payments become part of everyday life. I’ve noticed how small businesses in my circle are exploring crypto-friendly transactions, which signals a broader move towards its normalisation. New Innovations in Blockchain Technology Blockchain innovation isn’t slowing down. From scaling solutions like Ethereum’s Layer 2 updates to interoperability projects such as Polkadot, developers are creating efficient systems. These advancements might solve previous bottlenecks like high fees and slow networks. Its applications across voting systems, healthcare data storage, and supply chain transparency amaze me. Seeing energy-efficient consensus protocols like Proof of Stake rise gives hope for sustainable progress. Even friends in tech are excited about pioneering breakthroughs. The Role of Governments and Central Banks in Crypto Regulation Governments now realise crypto regulation is critical as adoption grows. China’s digital yuan and the European Central Bank’s digital euro are examples of how central banks shape future finance. Clear policies offering protection without stifling freedom can balance crypto evolution. Authorities will seek to prevent misuse without halting innovation. Conversations with legal experts reassure me that collaboration between regulators and crypto developers will define fair frameworks. It’s encouraging to see this dialogue narrowing the gap between control and innovation. Conclusion Crypto and blockchain have already begun reshaping the financial world, offering solutions that challenge traditional systems. Their potential to drive innovation, enhance inclusivity, and streamline processes is undeniable. While hurdles like regulation and scalability remain, these technologies are evolving rapidly, with promising advancements on the horizon. As adoption grows and more industries embrace decentralisation, the financial landscape will continue to transform. I believe the future of finance lies in finding the balance between innovation and regulation, unlocking opportunities for a fairer, more accessible global economy.

Buckle up, because the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is gearing up for a series of crucial roundtables that could significantly shape the digital asset landscape. If you’re invested in cryptocurrencies, pay attention – this is information you absolutely need to know! What’s Happening with SEC Crypto Regulation? The SEC’s Crypto Task Force, a dedicated team focused on the burgeoning world of digital assets, has announced four pivotal industry roundtables. These aren’t just casual chats; they are structured discussions designed to gather insights and perspectives from industry experts, stakeholders, and the public. The aim? To better understand and ultimately regulate the rapidly evolving crypto space. Eleanor Terrett, a well-known name in financial journalism, broke the news on X, sparking immediate interest and anticipation within the crypto community. Why are Crypto Regulation Roundtables Important? Think of these roundtables as open forums where the SEC can directly engage with the crypto industry. This proactive approach is vital for several reasons: Direct Dialogue: It fosters direct communication between regulators and those being regulated. This two-way street allows for a more nuanced understanding of the complexities and innovations within the crypto world. Informed Policy Making: By hearing directly from industry participants, the SEC can make more informed decisions when crafting regulations. This helps to avoid a one-size-fits-all approach that might stifle innovation. Transparency: Public roundtables offer a level of transparency, allowing the crypto community and the general public to understand the SEC’s concerns and the issues being discussed. Industry Input: These discussions provide a platform for the crypto industry to voice their concerns, challenges, and suggestions directly to the regulators. In essence, these roundtables are a critical step towards creating a regulatory framework that is both effective in protecting investors and conducive to innovation in the digital asset space. Breaking Down the Crypto Regulation Roundtable Schedule Let’s take a closer look at the schedule and the specific topics each roundtable will address: Date Topic Focus Area April 11 Crypto Trading Regulation and oversight of cryptocurrency exchanges, trading platforms, and market manipulation. April 25 Custody Secure storage and safeguarding of digital assets, addressing concerns around investor protection and asset security. May 12 Tokenization Legal and regulatory implications of tokenizing real-world assets, including securities laws and potential benefits and risks. June 6 DeFi’s Role in the U.S. Financial Landscape Examining the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, its impact on traditional finance, and potential regulatory approaches. Crypto Trading Roundtable: What’s on the Agenda? The first roundtable on April 11th will tackle crypto trading . This is a hot topic as the way cryptocurrencies are bought, sold, and exchanged is fundamental to the entire ecosystem. Expect discussions around: Exchange Regulation: Should crypto exchanges be regulated like traditional securities exchanges? What specific rules should apply? Market Manipulation: How can regulators combat market manipulation in the often volatile crypto markets? What tools and surveillance are needed?

This roundtable is crucial for setting the stage for fairer and more transparent crypto trading practices. Custody Roundtable: Securing Your Digital Assets Next up is the custody roundtable on April 25th. Crypto custody – the safe storage of digital assets – is a major concern for both institutional and retail investors. Key questions likely to be addressed include: Qualified Custodians: What standards should be required for entities holding large amounts of crypto assets? Should traditional financial institutions play a larger role in crypto custody ? Security Protocols: What are the best practices for securing digital assets against theft and hacking? How can regulatory frameworks encourage robust security measures? Liability and Insurance: Who is liable if custodied crypto assets are lost or stolen?

Tokenization has the potential to revolutionize various industries, and this roundtable is crucial for understanding its regulatory needs. DeFi Regulation Roundtable: Navigating the Decentralized Frontier Finally, on June 6th, the SEC will delve into DeFi regulation and DeFi’s role in the U.S. financial landscape . DeFi , or decentralized finance, is arguably the most disruptive force in the crypto space, aiming to recreate traditional financial services in a decentralized, permissionless manner. Expect discussions on: Regulatory Perimeter: How can regulators effectively oversee DeFi protocols and platforms given their decentralized nature? Where does regulation fit in a world without intermediaries? Smart Contract Risks: What are the risks associated with smart contracts that underpin DeFi ? How can vulnerabilities be addressed and investor protection ensured? Financial Stability: Could DeFi pose systemic risks to the broader financial system? What measures are needed to maintain financial stability in the face of DeFi growth?

Mind of Pepe and Arctic Pablo Coin are two meme coins that have captured attention with their unique concepts. Mind of Pepe combines AI integration with meme culture, offering automated insights through its self-evolving agent. Arctic Pablo Coin takes a storytelling approach, weaving an adventurous narrative into its presale phases while providing staking opportunities. Yet, among these, Dragoin ($DDGN) truly stands out by going beyond mere concepts. With practical features like Play-to-Earn gaming, staking, and a deflationary burn mechanism, Dragoin delivers real value, making it a sensible early investment in the meme coin market. Mind of Pepe: Revolutionizing Meme Coins with AI Integration Mind of Pepe ($MIND) launched its presale on January 13, 2025, introducing an innovative blend of meme culture and artificial intelligence. Specifically, this Ethereum-based token features a self-evolving AI agent designed to analyze real-time crypto market data, engage with social media platforms, and provide strategic insights to its community. Furthermore, the presale consists of 70 stages, starting at a price of $0.00310100 in Stage 1 and incrementally increasing to $0.00382150 by Stage 70. Consequently, the project quickly gained traction, raising over $3.5 million within two days of the presale launch. By February 14, 2025, MIND of Pepe had already surpassed the $6 million milestone, reflecting strong investor interest. In terms of allocation, the token distribution includes 25% for AI agent development, 30% for project growth, 20% for marketing, 15% for rewards, and 10% for exchange listings. Therefore, this strategic distribution aims to enhance the token’s utility and value over time. Arctic Pablo Coin: An Adventurous Narrative with High-Yield Potential Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) distinguishes itself through a narrative-driven presale, following the fictional journey of Arctic Pablo, an explorer uncovering hidden treasures. Notably, each presale phase represents a unique location in Pablo’s adventure, adding an immersive element to the investment experience. As of March 25, 2025, the presale has reached its 16th phase, “Crystal Cove,” with the token priced at $0.000083. As a result, the project has raised over $2 million to date, indicating robust community support. Moreover, Arctic Pablo Coin employs a deflationary mechanism by burning unsold tokens weekly during the presale, reducing supply and potentially increasing value. Additionally, investors can participate in a staking program offering a 66% Annual Percentage Yield (APY), with staked coins vested for a two-month period from the launch date. Significantly, the projected listing price is $0.008, suggesting a potential return on investment of approximately 9,552.41% from the current phase to the listing. Redefining Meme Coins: Dragoin’s Practical Utility Sets It Apart Dragoin ($DDGN) breaks the mold of typical meme coins by offering real-world utility and meaningful community involvement. Unlike many meme coins that thrive solely on hype, Dragoin brings practical features that give it lasting value and purpose. One standout aspect of Dragoin is its Play-to-Earn gaming platform, where users control their own dragons, take on challenges, and earn $DDGN tokens. As a result, this gaming ecosystem isn’t just for fun—it creates a continuous incentive for users to engage and hold tokens, driving demand and strengthening the community. In addition, Dragoin’s staking capability allows holders to lock their tokens and earn rewards. This not only encourages long-term investment but also reduces the circulating supply, potentially increasing the token’s value over time. Furthermore, Dragoin’s commitment to decentralization is evident in its governance model. With a renounced smart contract, no single entity holds control, promoting transparency and community trust. Moreover, one of Dragoin’s most strategic moves is its burn mechanism, where unsold tokens from the presale are permanently removed from circulation. As a result, this scarcity model directly supports price stability and creates an urgency for early investment. Consequently, investors seeking more than just short-lived hype will find Dragoin’s blend of utility and community focus appealing. By prioritizing long-term value and real user engagement, Dragoin makes a solid case as a smart early investment. It’s not just about holding a coin—it’s about being part of an ecosystem that rewards active participation and community trust. The Future of Meme Coins Lies in Practical Utility As meme coins continue to evolve, the focus is shifting from mere hype to genuine utility. Mind of Pepe and Arctic Pablo Coin both offer unique concepts that set them apart from traditional meme coins. Mind of Pepe leverages AI-driven insights, while Arctic Pablo Coin blends storytelling with staking opportunities. However, Dragoin ($DDGN) takes it a step further by integrating real-world value through Play-to-Earn gaming, secure staking, and a robust burn mechanism that drives scarcity. This thoughtful approach not only enhances user engagement but also makes Dragoin a more sustainable choice in the meme coin space.

The firm suggests that the market has not yet decided whether Bitcoin will break out from these levels or be rejected. MakroVision also raises a broader question about Bitcoin’s position in the overall market cycle. “Are we still in a bull market or have we entered a transition phase?” the firm asked in its latest market update. Its main reports examine macroeconomic correlations, historical patterns, and potential scenarios for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market.

However, although the 24-hour change saw the coin pump over 10%, analysts say the setup does not look like it could take the coin higher. This is because investors' confidence is still low from the bearish hit that dropped the price below a 5-month low. But with the rising number of investors in the crypto market in the last few months, if the Dogecoin price does not reflect a long-term surge, where is the money going? Why The Dogecoin Price Is Seeing A Growth Delay While Dogecoin remains the biggest meme coin in the world, its price action in the last few months has not been impressive. Many analysts have tried to analyze why Dogecoin's price has continued to find new lows. Still, the only logical conclusion has been that investors are losing confidence in the coin. One of the top factors that drove the Dogecoin price to its ATH in 2021 is the Elon Musk Influence and its many promises. However, while there were different sentiments and speculations, the promise to add Dogecoin as a payment option for Tesla effectively drove the price higher. Four years after the Dogecoin price ATH of $0.7375, the price continues to struggle under $0.4850. The recent 10% price surge increased the coin from a $0.1847 low. This has continued to cast a shadow on the future of the Dogecoin price, causing a sharp drop in investors' interest. Analysts still believe the Dogecoin price could recover with some significant change to the ecosystem; for example, the final implementation as a Tesla payment method could add more strength to investors' confidence.

Leading crypto exchange TruBit has announced a groundbreaking partnership with DeFi lending protocol Morpho. This collaboration is set to introduce a novel DeFi earn product, promising to bridge the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) usability and the innovative world of decentralized finance (DeFi). Are you ready to explore how this powerful alliance could reshape crypto earning opportunities in the region? What is DeFi Earn and Why is it a Game Changer? DeFi Earn , at its core, refers to earning yield or interest on your cryptocurrency holdings through decentralized finance protocols.

This new offering from TruBit and Morpho aims to simplify access to these complex DeFi mechanisms, making it user-friendly even for those new to the crypto space. Here’s why DeFi earn is creating waves: Higher Yield Potential: DeFi platforms often offer significantly higher annual percentage yields (APYs) compared to traditional savings or fixed deposits. Transparency and Control: Transactions are recorded on the blockchain, offering transparency. Users typically retain control of their assets in non-custodial wallets. Financial Inclusion: DeFi can provide access to financial services for the unbanked and underbanked populations, particularly relevant in regions like Latin America. Innovation and Growth: The DeFi space is constantly evolving, with new protocols and earning strategies emerging regularly.

For those keeping a close eye on the cryptocurrency and tech landscape, understanding where major players are placing their bets is crucial. And here’s a fascinating development: Amazon’s Alexa Fund, initially focused on voice technology, is now making a bold pivot towards the booming field of AI startups . This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a significant expansion signaling where Amazon sees the future of tech heading. Let’s dive into what this exciting shift means for the AI ecosystem and beyond. Why is Amazon’s Alexa Fund Now Targeting AI Startups? Launched in 2015, the Alexa Fund was originally conceived to fuel innovation in voice-first technologies, aligning perfectly with the rise of Alexa and voice assistants. However, the tech world doesn’t stand still. The monumental advancements in large language models and generative AI have created a paradigm shift. Amazon, recognizing this transformative wave, is strategically repositioning the Alexa Fund to capitalize on this new frontier. With Amazon itself launching Gen AI-powered Alexa+ and a suite of multimodal AI models, it’s a natural progression for their investment arm to follow suit. Paul Bernard, the leader of the Alexa Fund , articulated this evolution in a recent blog post. He explained that while the Fund’s core mission has always been about pushing technological boundaries, the “rapid developments in AI present an inflection point”. This inflection point allows the Fund to embrace cutting-edge AI investment while staying true to its original goal of fostering innovation. The Fund is now actively seeking to invest in startups that are pioneering: AI-enabled Hardware : The next generation of devices infused with artificial intelligence. Smart Agents : Intelligent assistants that go beyond voice commands, anticipating user needs and acting proactively. Generative Media : Startups creating novel forms of content using AI. Emerging AI Architectures : Companies developing the foundational technologies that will power future AI breakthroughs. To get a clearer picture of this evolving strategy, Bitcoin World had an exclusive conversation with Paul Bernard, diving deep into the renewed mission and recent investments of the Alexa Fund . What Kind of AI Startups is the Alexa Fund Investing In? The Alexa Fund isn’t just talking the talk; they’re walking the walk with concrete investments in promising AI startups . Recently, they’ve added four new companies to their portfolio, each tackling unique challenges and opportunities within the AI space: NinjaTech AI : Imagine an AI Swiss Army knife. NinjaTech AI is developing an all-encompassing AI platform. Their chatbot is not just about text; it can generate code, conjure images and videos, conduct in-depth research, and even manage your schedule. Think of it as a supercharged AI assistant, similar to Quora’s Poe, offering access to a range of powerful models from OpenAI, Meta, Anthropic, Google, and Deepseek. Notably, Amazon highlights that NinjaTech AI’s infrastructure is built on AWS, showcasing synergy within the Amazon ecosystem. Hedra : For the creatives out there, Hedra is an AI media company that’s making waves in content generation. Their studio empowers users to create stunning visuals, audio, and video using AI . With the recent launch of Character-3 AI , Hedra is pushing the boundaries of AI -driven content creation. Having already secured $10 million in funding last year from prominent investors like a16z Games Speedrun, Abstract, and Index Ventures, Hedra is a startup to watch. Ario : Balancing family life can be chaotic. Ario steps in as an AI -powered family management app designed to bring order to scheduling and task management. One of its standout features is a “school email decoder” that intelligently extracts events and action items from school communications. Paul Bernard from the Alexa Fund praised Ario’s ability to understand the personal context behind tasks, a crucial element for effective family organization. While other startups like Hearth Display and Maple are also tackling family schedule management, Ario’s AI -driven approach offers a fresh perspective. HeyBoss : If you’re online in tech circles, you’ve likely encountered the buzz around “vibe coding.” HeyBoss is a startup firmly in this space, enabling users to create websites, apps, games, and prototypes simply by describing their vision. This low-code/no-code approach is gaining momentum, with companies like Cursor, Lovable, Replit, and Bolt.new also innovating in this area. HeyBoss democratizes development, making it accessible to a wider range of creators. What are the Strategic Benefits for Amazon? For Amazon, AI investment in these startups isn’t purely altruistic; it’s a strategic move with multiple layers of benefits. These startups become invaluable proving grounds for Amazon’s extensive cloud and AI stack. Many gain early access to private APIs and SDKs, essentially becoming living laboratories for Amazon’s technologies. Furthermore, Amazon provides these startups with access to senior executives and opportunities within Amazon Business, fostering a symbiotic relationship. This strategy mirrors a broader trend in the tech industry. Major players in AI are actively funding promising startups to expand their ecosystems and drive innovation. OpenAI’s startup fund, for example, has backed numerous ventures across healthcare, robotics, edtech, and creative tools. Anthropic has partnered with Menlo Ventures to create an investment vehicle, and Google has recently invested in companies like Glance and Toonsutra, offering them access to their AI models. The Future of AI Investment and Innovation Amazon’s redoubled focus on AI startups through the Alexa Fund is a clear indicator of the immense potential and transformative power of artificial intelligence. By strategically funding and nurturing these early-stage companies, Amazon is not only expanding its own ecosystem but also contributing to the broader advancement of AI technologies. This wave of AI investment from tech giants signals a dynamic and rapidly evolving landscape, promising exciting innovations and applications in the years to come. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, the underlying technologies driving AI , such as decentralized computing and data management, may find increasing synergy and relevance as AI continues its exponential growth. The convergence of AI and blockchain could unlock entirely new paradigms, and Amazon’s proactive stance in AI investment positions them at the forefront of this technological revolution.

When incidents occur, how platforms respond can significantly impact user confidence and the future of the ecosystem. Recently, Hyperliquid, a prominent decentralized exchange (DEX), faced a challenging situation involving its JELLY perpetual futures market. Following evidence of suspicious market activity, Hyperliquid made a decisive move: delisting JELLY and, more importantly, pledging to compensate affected users. This article dives deep into the Hyperliquid compensation plan, the details surrounding the JELLY incident, and what it all means for the broader crypto landscape. What Exactly Happened with the JELLY Incident on Hyperliquid? To understand the gravity of Hyperliquid’s decision, let’s break down the sequence of events that led to the JELLY incident : * Suspicious Activity Detected : Hyperliquid’s monitoring systems flagged unusual trading patterns in the JELLY perpetual futures market. * Massive Short Position: A trader opened an extraordinarily large short position of 430 million JELLY tokens. This is a highly leveraged bet that the price of JELLY would decrease significantly. * Liquidation and Margin Withdrawal: The trader strategically liquidated a smaller portion (30 million JELLY) of their position, seemingly to manipulate the market and then withdrew a substantial margin of 2.76 million USDC. * Forced Liquidation: This initial activity triggered a cascading effect, leading to the liquidation of a massive 398 million JELLY tokens from other traders’ positions. * Price Skyrocket & Losses: As the market reacted, the price of JELLY unexpectedly surged. This price spike caused significant unrealized losses on the Hyperliquid liquidation address, exceeding $10 million. * Liquidation at Profit: Interestingly, the Hyperliquid liquidation address managed to close out the JELLY short position at $0.0095, ultimately making a profit of around $700,000 despite the earlier losses. This suggests a complex and potentially manipulative trading strategy was at play. This chain of events highlights the volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets and the potential for sophisticated trading strategies to exploit vulnerabilities, even on advanced platforms like Hyperliquid. Hyperliquid’s Response: Prioritizing User Compensation In the wake of the JELLY incident , Hyperliquid’s response has been swift and user-centric. Here’s a look at their key actions: * Immediate Delisting: Recognizing the ongoing risks and potential for further manipulation, Hyperliquid acted decisively by delisting the JELLY perpetual futures market. This was done through a validator vote, showcasing a degree of on-chain governance. * Investigation and Transparency: Hyperliquid launched an investigation into the suspicious market activity to understand the full extent of the manipulation and identify the responsible parties. * Commitment to Compensation: Crucially, Hyperliquid announced its commitment to compensate users who suffered losses due to the incident, excluding those involved in the suspicious activity. This pledge is a significant step towards restoring user trust. * Hyper Foundation Backing: The compensation will be provided by the Hyper Foundation, indicating a strong financial backing and commitment to making users whole. * Details to Follow: Hyperliquid has promised to release further details on the compensation method soon, assuring users that a fair and equitable process will be implemented. This proactive approach to Hyperliquid compensation demonstrates a commitment to user protection that is crucial for the long-term health and credibility of DeFi platforms. Addressing Crypto Exchange Centralization Concerns The JELLY incident has reignited discussions around crypto exchange centralization , even within the DeFi space. While Hyperliquid is a decentralized exchange, certain aspects of its operation have come under scrutiny: * Validator Vote for Delisting: The decision to delist JELLY through a validator vote, while showcasing on-chain governance, also raises questions about the level of centralization within the validator set and their influence on market decisions. Is this truly decentralized if a small group can make such impactful changes? * Risk Management and Monitoring: While Hyperliquid detected the suspicious activity, questions arise about the effectiveness of risk management systems in preventing such incidents in the first place. Can DeFi platforms be truly resilient against sophisticated market manipulation tactics? * Transparency of Operations: Critics argue that more transparency is needed regarding Hyperliquid’s operational processes, including its risk management protocols and the decision-making processes of its validators. Greater transparency can foster trust and allow users to better assess the risks involved. These concerns are not unique to Hyperliquid but are pertinent to the broader DeFi ecosystem. The balance between decentralization, efficiency, and security remains a critical challenge. DeFi Risk Management: Lessons from the JELLY Incident The JELLY incident serves as a stark reminder of the inherent DeFi risk management challenges in decentralized finance. Here are some key takeaways: * Market Manipulation is a Real Threat: Even in supposedly decentralized environments, sophisticated actors can attempt to manipulate markets for their gain. Robust monitoring and risk management systems are essential. * Liquidity and Volatility: The incident highlights the interplay between liquidity and volatility in crypto markets. Low liquidity pairs can be particularly susceptible to manipulation, and rapid price swings can amplify losses. * Importance of Audits and Security: While not directly related to smart contract vulnerabilities in this case, the incident underscores the ongoing need for rigorous audits and security measures to protect DeFi platforms and users. * User Education is Crucial: Users need to be aware of the risks associated with trading volatile and less liquid assets, and understand the mechanics of leverage and liquidation. * Platform Responsibility: DeFi platforms have a responsibility to implement robust risk management systems, provide transparent information, and act decisively to protect users when incidents occur, as Hyperliquid is demonstrating with its compensation plan. Rebuilding User Trust in DeFi Incidents like the JELLY situation can erode user trust in DeFi platforms. Hyperliquid’s proactive approach to Hyperliquid compensation is a vital step in rebuilding that trust. Here’s why their response is important for fostering user confidence: * Demonstrates Accountability: By taking responsibility and offering compensation, Hyperliquid shows that it values its users and is accountable for events on its platform, even when caused by external actors. * Sets a Precedent: This action sets a positive precedent for other DeFi platforms facing similar challenges. It signals that user protection should be a top priority. * Encourages Responsible Platform Behavior: Knowing that they may be held responsible for user losses due to market manipulation incentivizes platforms to invest in better security and risk management. * Strengthens DeFi’s Reputation: By addressing issues transparently and fairly, the DeFi sector as a whole can build a stronger reputation for reliability and user-centricity. owever, rebuilding user trust is an ongoing process. Hyperliquid needs to follow through on its compensation promise and provide clear details on the process. Furthermore, continued efforts to enhance security, transparency, and risk management are essential for the entire DeFi space to thrive. Actionable Insights for Crypto Users What can crypto users learn from the JELLY incident and Hyperliquid’s response? * Diversify Your Holdings: Avoid concentrating your portfolio in highly volatile or low-liquidity assets. Diversification can mitigate risk. * Understand Leverage and Risk: If you trade leveraged products, fully understand the risks of liquidation and potential losses. Use leverage responsibly. * Choose Platforms Wisely: Research DeFi platforms thoroughly. Look for platforms with robust security measures, transparent risk management practices, and a track record of user support. * Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with news and developments in the crypto space. Understanding market dynamics and platform responses to incidents can help you make informed decisions. * Engage with Communities: Participate in platform communities and discussions. Sharing information and experiences can help identify potential risks and best practices. Actionable Insights for Crypto Users Conclusion: A Critical Moment for Hyperliquid and DeFi The Hyperliquid compensation plan in response to the JELLY incident is a significant development. It showcases a commitment to user protection and a willingness to address the challenges inherent in decentralized finance. While questions about crypto exchange centralization and DeFi risk management remain, Hyperliquid’s decisive action provides a glimmer of hope and a potential roadmap for other platforms facing similar crises. The success of the compensation process and Hyperliquid’s ongoing efforts to enhance security and transparency will be crucial in determining whether this incident ultimately strengthens or weakens user trust in the platform and the broader DeFi ecosystem. This is a critical moment for Hyperliquid and a valuable learning opportunity for the entire crypto space.

BNB Chain introduced a $100 million liquidity fund with the aim to increase decentralized finance capabilities and attract users back through the platform. Investors now focus on Remittix because they consider it to be the contemporary implementation of XRP. Through its $0.0734 pre-sale phase Remittix earned $14.1 million as it pursued remittances as its core business following the goal of cutting down worldwide fees affecting millions of people. This part reveals the growing strength of Solana alongside BNB Chain and Remittix in this time period. Solana’s Price Prediction on Speed and Ecosystem Expansion Solana initiated a rapid cost increase which aggregated to nearly $145 while maintaining a $4 trillion daily transaction volume. Solana has become a magnet for developers building DeFi and NFT projects because of its feature of quick settlements coupled with low fees. Social activity on the network now runs against the initial network problems that caused diminishing support. Rapid increase of Solana: Coingecko The aggregator data suggests users are partially returning to network functions although intermittent performance setbacks remain potential risks according to critics statements. The Solana price prediction depends on a loyal user base if they continue steady performance which will enable them to take some market share back from competing chains. The rally potential of institutional participants remains unclear since their new disclaimers could limit further price increases until DeFi usage expands. The future success of Solana's dominance depends on continuous positive data reports from aggregator sources regarding DeFi transactions. BNB Chain Launches $100M Liquidity Boost The Binance chain's $100 million liquidity program serves to intensify DeFi dApps because stakeholders feared user adoption growth was slowing down. The network has managed success because of low transaction fees and big exchange user counts yet its connection to centralized systems creates potential regulatory issues. Binance demonstrates their commitment to maintain BNB as a top network choice through this new funding initiative despite existing competitor networks recorded in aggregator data . Efficient dApp adoption and stable yield generation through this program could help BNB Chain match the rise of alternative cryptocurrencies. Some investors experience regulatory concerns that threaten their investments because the chain needs to establish clear protocols for this liquidity strategy to sustain a substantial price increase. Why Investors Are Flocking to Remittix, the “New XRP” New XRP nowadays typically references Remittix (RTX) because market participants have shifted their attention from Solana price prediction and BNB coverage. Through its successful presale funds of $14 million at $0.0734 Remittix provides PayFi solutions for the remittance services operating in the $190 trillion market. Remittix connects with DeFi users while drawing both unbanked families and unbanked people and freelancers through its speedy cost-effective swapping system. The initiative diverges from common superficial or failing development methods which neglect real cost-saving solutions. Expert opinions conclude that agent partnerships alongside user-pleasing applications and appropriate licensing must exist for attracting mainstream customers. Remittix financial advantages extend to every demographic group thus luring both institutional investors along with regular holders to the platform. In order to protect new crypto tokens from rug pulls a three-year liquidity lock combined with renounced post-presale contracts should be applied. Analysis indicates that the future success of Remittix depends on maintaining evidence of rising user interest from aggregator sources because experts believe the coin demonstrates better promise through fast problem-solving aimed at real user needs. Those intrigued can review the presale at Remittix and track official updates at Linktree . Practical Solutions vs. Legacy Networks: The Battle for Relevance Solana’s rocket-like price prediction and BNB Chain’s $100 million liquidity program emphasize altcoins striving for user growth and DeFi relevance.The market considers Remittix to be a fresh variant of XRP because its simple solution for daily financial transfer meets the requirements of international customers who currently face expensive wire transfer charges. The three methods provide separate benefits with Solana enhancing dApp operation while BNB allocates funds for DeFi liquidity growth and Remittix delivers direct payment reductions for wires. The market demonstrates its categorical preference for utility-driven coins combined with steady user attraction yet no project bears an absolute guarantee of success. Real financial integration could make Remittix surpass older cross-border solutions because of the failing hype-based ventures. The success of Remittix in local currency solutions could establish ""New XRP"" status which sets the platform for future bull runs in 2025.

The remaining 6.4% said they weren’t sure, the report stated. Percentage of trust that Argentines have in Milei after the Libra scandal. Source: Zuban Córdoba This was the first time the question was asked within a Zuban Córdoba poll. However, several other metrics, such as Milei’s image and the national management approval rating, have plummeted considerably in recent months. The latter of those metrics, for example, fell from 47.3% in November to 41.6% in March. “Fifty-eight percent disapprove of Javier Milei’s management. Negativity increases slowly but steadily and seems to find no ceiling,” Zuban Córdoba said. “The change in tone and evaluation of the government is consolidating as more and more problematic fronts appear on the political agenda.” Zuban Córdoba conducted its study between March 12 and March 14, and the sample size of 1,600 participants had a confidence level of 95% and a sampling error of 2.45%. Another survey from the University of San Andrés conducted between March 11-20 with 1,020 respondents found that Milei’s approval rating dropped to 45%. However, not all polls paint the same picture of President Milei. Data collected from Morning Consult between Feb. 27 and March 5 indicates that Milei still possessed a 62.4% approval rating after the Libra scandal. Related: LIBRA memecoin orchestrators named as defendants in US class-action suit Milei has distanced himself from Libra since the scandal, arguing he didn’t “promote” the LIBRA token in a controversial Feb. 14 X post — as fraud lawsuits filed against him allege — and instead merely “spread the word” about it. The Libra (LIBRA) token soared to a $4.6 billion market cap shortly after Milei’s X post before tanking nearly 94% over the next few hours. Argentina’s opposition party called for Milei’s impeachment but has had limited success thus far. President Milei’s party still in lead as election looms The controversy comes as the next Argentine election is set to take place on Oct. 26. Despite the negative results, Milei’s La Libertad Avanza party is still most likely to take out the next Argentine election, with 36.7% in favor of the libertarian party, while Unión por la Patria comes in next at 32.5%. However, only 43% of Argentine respondents believe that Milei — an economist prior to taking office — has sufficiently controlled inflation, while 63% of those polled oppose Milei’s efforts to secure a new loan from the International Monetary Fund.

XRP, currently priced at $2.39, is set for a 300% rally to $7.17, driven by increasing adoption in cross-border payments. Cardano (ADA), now at $0.71. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is riding strong bullish momentum, positioning itself as top performers for explosive growth in the coming months. The project is in phase 3 of its presale priced at $0.02. Over 80% of the presale has been sold out meaning it won’t stay long before it concludes. Mutuum Finance’s presale surges past $4.9 million with over 6900 investors already onboard. As Mutuum Finance enters Phase 4, the price will jump 25% to $0.025. MUTM could be the next big winner for those who seek greater gains and long term investment. Ripple and Cardano: Strong Performers for 2025’s Bull Run The price of Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) is set to jump substantially by 2025 because growing organizations worldwide are adopting their systems as well as broadening their ecosystems. XRP is expected to climb 300% to achieve a value of $7.17 in the next few years because its capabilities in international transactions will drive its growing influence in financial services. Continued network upgrades and expanding DeFi applications drive Cardano (ADA) toward a 5x price jump from its current value of $0.71 until it reaches $4. These undertakings host solid base fundamentals that lead to practical use cases because they create strong investment options for the long term. The crypto market watches Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as analysts expect explosive growth due to its rising market presence alongside two other dominant altcoins. Transforming DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Model Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending by merging both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model allows users to lock stablecoins like USDT in liquidity pools backed by smart contracts, receiving passive income while making it easy for borrowers to borrow money easily. Meanwhile, the P2P model eliminates middlemen, allowing lenders and borrowers to directly negotiate with each other. This two-pronged approach maximizes security, efficiency, and decentralization and positions Mutuum Finance at the forefront of the DeFi universe. By giving users full control over their lending decisions, the platform is appealing to conservative and high-yield investors, and facilitates a more open and flexible financial system. A Secure and Sustainable DeFi Ecosystem Mutuum Finance establishes its security foundation through the launch of an entirely collateralized stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The over-collateralization requirement in this model eliminates volatility risks that break algorithmic stablecoins due to their instability. The platform establishes investor confidence by employing multiple auditing activities on smart contracts together with financially transparent systems to repair DeFi lending platform vulnerabilities. Mutuum Finance emphasizes sustainability and security thus establishing itself as an excellent option for investors making long-term decisions. Exclusive Rewards and Community Incentives The initial supporters of Mutuum Finance can benefit from multiple enticing rewards which offer both generous giveaways of $100,000 awarded through $10,000 MUTM token distributions to ten winners alongside a referral program that rewards its users for new investor acquisitions. The referral system of Mutuum Finance motivates users to recruit new investors while providing rewards to these referrals. Users who join early receive privileged access to future staking pools and they obtain governance privileges while receiving first access to platform upgrade updates. The incentives provided by Mutuum Finance motivate users to join initially while developing better long-term retention of token holders. Mutuum Finance is rapidly emerging as a DeFi leader, with $4.8 million raised and 6,600+ investors onboard. Its hybrid lending model and strong fundamentals set it up for explosive growth. With a 200% return potential, the presale is selling out fast. Don’t miss out join now before prices rise.

According to crypto analyst (basictradingtv), the meme coin is playing out a trend of rounding bottom patterns and parabolic rallies, which have always sent its price to all-time highs. The current setup suggests that Dogecoin’s ongoing recovery from its March low may not just be a temporary bounce, but there’s a 100% chance it is the beginning of a much larger parabolic rally. Dogecoin Trading In A Familiar Cycle: 100% Chance Of Rally At the core of the bullish forecast is the recurrence of a well-known price pattern, the rounding bottom. Dogecoin is known for trading in multi-year cycles that start with a gradual bottoming formation, eventually leading to explosive rallies. This pattern, visible on longer-term charts, has formed again over the past several months. Related Reading: Dogecoin Activity Levels Crash To 4-Month Lows, Does This Spell Doom For The Meme Coin? As shown in the monthly candlestick timeframe chart below, the rounding bottom played out during the time period between Dogecoin’s all-time high in 2021, the bear market in 2022, and the recovery phase in late 2024. The recovery led to Dogecoin pushing to new highs since 2021, which was probably the start of the parabolic rally phase. However, this time around, the anticipated parabolic rally was temporarily interrupted by a strong resistance zone. After reaching highs around $0.48 in December 2024, Dogecoin saw a rejection that has seen its price going on a correction path until it reached $0.1477 in early March. But rather than breaking below, this level acted as a solid support. Since then, the price rebounded slightly and has recovered to $0.2 at the time of writing. With this in mind, the analyst predicted that the bullish cycle is intact, with the parabolic leg of the pattern expected to unfold anytime soon. Monthly Candle Needs To Close Above Support Right now, the most important step is for Dogecoin to close its monthly candlestick for March above the key support level established during the recent market correction. If this is successful, it will certify 100% that a bullish parabolic rally will follow. The analyst also pointed out two important levels for Dogecoin in the coming weeks and months: $0.15 and $0.5. The $0.15 level was tested during Dogecoin’s sharp pullback earlier this month, when the price dipped to as low as $0.1477. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Enters Order Block Zone That Could Trigger Rally To ATHs $0.15 now acts as the support level that should not be broken. The longer Dogecoin tests this support level, the longer the delay for the parabolic rally. Fortunately, the recovery from that zone has added technical strength to the argument that buyers are going to step in at that level. Meanwhile, $0.5 is identified as the primary resistance target ahead. Breaking through that resistance will confirm the start of a full-fledged parabolic rally, similar to the one that sent Dogecoin to its all-time high in 2021. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2052, up by 10.8% in the past 24 hours.

BTC Bull Token and Best Wallet Token have both managed to capture attention with their unique approaches. BTC Bull Token offers rewards based on Bitcoin milestones, while Best Wallet Token integrates practical utility within a multi-asset management platform. Yet, it’s Dragoin that truly stands out by blending gaming and crypto in a way that feels natural and rewarding. With its Telegram mini-game, Dragoin doesn’t just promise returns—it lets players earn tokens through immersive gameplay. BTC Bull Token: Riding the Bitcoin Wave BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) launched in early 2025, aiming to capitalize on Bitcoin’s success. Notably, the token’s primary attraction is its innovative mechanism: holders receive Bitcoin airdrops when BTC reaches specific price milestones, with the first reward set at $150,000. Consequently, this unique approach attracted significant investor interest, raising over $4 million during its presale phase. Starting at a presale price of $0.002425, BTCBULL has experienced impressive growth as Bitcoin recently surged to $87,000. Furthermore, token burns at various price points also reduce the supply, creating potential for increased value. As a result, the community-driven nature and the excitement around Bitcoin’s future prospects have fueled the token’s popularity. Therefore, early investors have already seen their holdings appreciate significantly, with projections indicating further gains as Bitcoin climbs higher. Best Wallet Token: Empowering Crypto Management Best Wallet Token ($BEST) launched in 2023 as the native utility token for the Best Wallet ecosystem, which facilitates seamless management of digital assets across multiple blockchains. Notably, with features like reduced transaction fees, staking rewards, and early access to token presales, $BEST quickly became popular, attracting over 250,000 active users. Moreover, the presale raised more than $11.3 million, reflecting strong investor confidence. Initially priced at $0.0225, $BEST has appreciated to $0.02445 as of March 26, 2025, marking an 8.67% increase. Additionally, the token’s success is driven by its integration within the Best Wallet app, which supports thousands of cryptocurrencies, making it one of the most versatile wallets available. Dragoin’s Telegram Mini-Game Pays Investors to Play Dragoin’s Telegram mini-game is more than just entertainment—it’s an opportunity to boost your token holdings while having fun. Specifically designed with both casual and dedicated gamers in mind, the game combines excitement with real rewards, making it a favorite among Dragoin investors. As players control their own dragon, they take on challenges and missions that keep them engaged while earning $DDGN tokens as they progress. Whether you’re aiming to build a strong token reserve or simply enjoy gaming, the mini-game offers a perfect blend of strategy and enjoyment. From the moment Dragoin hit the scene, it promised more than just another meme coin—it aimed to build a community that’s both engaged and rewarded. In fact, the mini-game is at the heart of that vision. Notably, what sets it apart is its instant reward system. Unlike typical investments, where returns take time, players can start multiplying their tokens right after joining. Consequently, as Dragoin’s value continues to grow, these earned tokens become even more valuable, giving early adopters an edge. For presale buyers, the game is an especially enticing feature. Instead of just holding onto tokens and waiting for market movements, players can actively increase their holdings by participating in this interactive experience. Furthermore, the sense of accomplishment that comes with earning tokens through skillful gameplay makes the process not only rewarding but genuinely enjoyable. Ultimately, Dragoin has made it clear—being part of its community means more than just holding coins. It means playing, earning, and thriving together. Play, Earn, and Thrive: The Future of Crypto Engagement Crypto investors are no longer content with passive holding—they want interactive experiences and tangible rewards. BTC Bull Token brings a strategic approach with its Bitcoin milestone airdrops, while Best Wallet Token enhances asset management with practical features. However, Dragoin takes things to the next level by turning token earning into a gamified adventure. Its Telegram mini-game allows users to grow their holdings while actively enjoying a fantasy-inspired experience. This engaging approach makes Dragoin more than just a meme coin—it’s a dynamic community space where gameplay meets real financial opportunity.

You’re not alone. Deepfakes are no longer just a futuristic worry; they’re a present danger, costing companies millions and posing serious national security risks. But there’s a beacon of hope in the fight against this emerging threat: GetReal. This startup, armed with $18 million in funding and a client list that speaks volumes, claims to have cracked the code on AI deepfakes . Let’s dive into how GetReal is revolutionizing deepfake detection and safeguarding our digital world. Funding Fuels the Fight Against AI Deepfakes GetReal, co-founded by Dr. Hany Farid, a pioneer in deepfake detection technology, has successfully raised $17.5 million in Series A equity funding. This significant investment, led by Forgepoint Capital, with participation from Ballistic Ventures, Evolution Equity, and K2 Access Fund, will propel GetReal’s research and development, expand its team, and accelerate business development. This financial backing underscores the urgency and importance of addressing the growing threat of AI deepfakes . The funding coincides with the launch of GetReal’s groundbreaking forensics platform as a service. This platform offers: Web Interface: User-friendly access to deepfake analysis tools. API: Seamless integration for automated media analysis. Media Analysis-as-a-Service: Scalable solution for various organizational needs. Key features of GetReal’s platform include: Threat Exposure Dashboard: Provides a comprehensive overview of potential deepfake risks. “Inspect” Tool: Specifically designed to protect high-profile executives from impersonation attacks. “Protect” Tool: Screens media content to proactively identify and block deepfakes. “Respond” Service: Offers in-depth analysis by GetReal’s expert human teams for complex cases. The Brains Behind the Breakthrough in Deepfake Detection GetReal’s origins are deeply rooted in expertise. Incubated at Ballistic Ventures since 2022, the startup emerged from stealth mode in June 2024. Ballistic’s founder, Ted Schlein, also serves as GetReal’s chairman and co-founder, highlighting the venture capital firm’s strong belief in GetReal’s mission. Adding to this powerhouse team is CEO Matt Moynahan, a seasoned cybersecurity veteran with decades of experience leading companies like Symantec and Forcepoint. He emphasizes the critical gap GetReal is filling in the cyber forensics landscape, stating, “If you think cybersecurity has a shortage of people, get ready for forensics.” However, the true linchpin is co-founder Dr. Hany Farid. A renowned academic from UC Berkeley, Farid has spent years pioneering techniques for identifying manipulated digital images, long before AI deepfakes became a mainstream concern. Moynahan aptly describes GetReal’s core offering as “Hany as a service,” explaining how they’ve transformed Farid’s deep expertise into a scalable, cloud-based platform. Farid himself notes the fascinating blend of cutting-edge technology and timeless principles in their approach: “There are techniques we developed 20 years ago that still work today,” showcasing the enduring foundation of their deepfake detection methods. Strategic Backing and Real-World Validation for AI Forensics The Series A funding round isn’t just about the amount raised; it’s about the strategic investors involved. Cisco Investments, Capital One Ventures, and In-Q-Tel (linked to the CIA) are among the backers, signaling strong industry and government interest in GetReal’s AI forensics capabilities. Alberto Yépez of Forgepoint Capital points out that regulated industries, particularly financial institutions, are proactively seeking solutions like GetReal’s due to board-level concerns about deepfake impersonations, especially after instances of CEO voice impersonations. Notable clients like John Deere and Visa further validate the platform’s real-world effectiveness. While GetReal’s current focus is on audio, video, and image deepfake detection , the recent incident involving The Atlantic’s editor being mistakenly added to a Signal group chat planning a military attack highlights the emerging threat of text-based impersonations. Farid acknowledges that text is a “different beast” but confirms that expanding to address all forms of deepfake and impersonation threats is a long-term goal. Is GetReal the Ultimate Weapon Against AI Deepfakes? GetReal’s emergence with significant funding, a stellar team, and an impressive client roster strongly suggests they are a leading contender in the fight against AI deepfakes . Their platform, built on decades of expertise and cutting-edge technology, offers a comprehensive suite of tools for detection and response. However, the battle against deepfakes is constantly evolving. Here’s a quick look at the landscape: Pros of GetReal Challenges for Deepfake Detection Expert-led technology with proven methods. Deepfake technology is rapidly advancing. Strong funding and strategic partnerships. Detecting text-based deepfakes is a new frontier. Comprehensive platform with various tools and services. The ‘fun’ deepfake apps contribute to the problem. Addresses a critical gap in cyber forensics talent. Phishing tactics are becoming more sophisticated. While GetReal appears to have made significant strides in deepfake detection , the ongoing arms race between deepfake creators and detection technology means continuous innovation and adaptation are crucial. The $18 million investment and the caliber of clients and investors signal a powerful vote of confidence in GetReal’s approach. Whether they have definitively “cracked the code” remains to be seen, but they are undoubtedly a formidable force in safeguarding the digital realm from the insidious threat of AI deepfakes .

Here is the summary of the detailed interview and the most important points to know. Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) explained that the company chose Abu Dhabi as its home base due to its regulatory environment and strategic location rather than its financing needs. According to CZ, the UAE’s compliance framework provides Binance with a stable foundation for global expansion. CZ acknowledged that the memecoin ecosystem is growing, attributing the rise to community-driven imagination. However, he warned that memecoins carry high risks, indicating a need for user education and clear risk warnings. Referring to US President Donald Trump’s memecoin launch, CZ explained that most celebrity coins are launched by third parties for publicity purposes, and urged public figures to focus on long-term, value-driven projects instead. Binance aims to maintain a balanced market where institutional investors do not disproportionately benefit individual users. CZ stated that the exchange should not act as a gatekeeper, but instead promote transparency. He encouraged projects to disclose their token locking mechanisms and leverage third-party smart contracts to increase trust. Looking forward, CZ expressed optimism about the rise of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) as the future of the industry. Related News: According to Onchain Data, the Founder of this Altcoin Starts Selling Again CZ assessed the industry’s transition from requiring a private blockchain for token issuance to the widespread adoption of the ERC-20 standard. He believes that despite the lowering of technical barriers, community consensus remains the primary driver of value. He urged the crypto space to move beyond financial speculation and explore real-world applications such as government authentication and decentralized science (DeSci). While CZ admitted to missing out on an early Ethereum investment, he acknowledged ETH’s fundamental role in DeFi. However, he noted that Ethereum’s real problem lies not in its technology, but in its lack of innovation at the application layer. CZ, who recently evaluated the legal troubles he has experienced, shared that his four-month prison sentence has reshaped his perspective on life. Underlining the importance of family and health, CZ stated that he lost six kilos during his time in prison but is physically healthier. He noted that the biggest challenge is coping with the uncertainty of the situation. CZ introduced Giggle Academy, an educational initiative that aims to address global learning inequalities through gamified experiences. The project aims to equip users with job-related skills, such as AI data annotation, to improve employment opportunities around the world. *This is not investment advice.

Investors actively looking for the best crypto to buy for 2025 want projects with innovative features and utility which serve practical purposes. There is a new Defi payment token that has begun to divert investor attention from XRP price predictions as it presents solutions for important problems for both businesses and individuals throughout the global remittance framework. The crypto market shows an increasing need for effective solutions to manage cross-border payments. XRP maintains its financial institution partnerships but faces slower market acceptance which enables emerging projects to find new grounds for innovation.

This unexpected shoutout, highlighted by Chainlink’s Communications Director Chris Barrett on X (formerly Twitter), has sparked considerable interest and speculation within the crypto community. Let’s dive into why this mention is noteworthy and what it could signify for the future of Chainlink and the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. Why is the World Liberty Financial and Chainlink Mention at the DC Blockchain Summit Significant? The DC Blockchain Summit is a prominent event that brings together policymakers, industry leaders, and innovators in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. It serves as a platform for discussions, announcements, and networking, shaping the regulatory and developmental trajectory of the industry. World Liberty Financial, co-founded by Zach Witkoff, choosing this stage to recognize Chainlink is significant for several reasons: Legitimacy and Mainstream Attention: World Liberty Financial’s association with the Trump family brings a level of mainstream attention and political relevance to the DeFi space. Their public acknowledgment of Chainlink at such a summit can be interpreted as a nod towards the growing acceptance and importance of decentralized technologies within traditional financial and political circles. Validation for Chainlink: For Chainlink, a project focused on providing secure and reliable data to smart contracts, this shoutout serves as further validation of its crucial role in the blockchain ecosystem. It highlights Chainlink’s growing recognition beyond the core crypto community and into more traditional finance adjacent sectors. Potential for Collaboration: While just a ‘shoutout’ for now, this public acknowledgment could hint at potential future collaborations or integrations between World Liberty Financial and Chainlink. For a DeFi project like World Liberty Financial, leveraging Chainlink’s oracle services could be instrumental in enhancing the security, reliability, and functionality of their platform. Broader DeFi Implications: This event underscores the increasing maturity and interconnectedness of the DeFi space. It signals a move towards greater collaboration and recognition between different projects, potentially fostering a more robust and integrated decentralized financial ecosystem. Chris Barrett’s X post, further amplified by Zach Witkoff’s repost, quickly circulated within the crypto community, igniting discussions on social media platforms and crypto forums. The brevity of the initial communication leaves room for interpretation and fuels speculation about the nature of this acknowledgment. What is Chainlink and Why Does it Matter in DeFi? Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that plays a pivotal role in the functionality and security of smart contracts, particularly within the DeFi space. In simple terms, oracles are bridges that connect blockchains to the real world, enabling smart contracts to access external data, APIs, and payment systems. Here’s why Chainlink is crucial: Bridging the Data Gap: Blockchains, by design, are isolated environments. Smart contracts operating on blockchains cannot inherently access data from the outside world. Chainlink solves this by providing a secure and reliable way for smart contracts to receive external data feeds. Ensuring Data Integrity and Security: Chainlink’s decentralized nature is key. Instead of relying on a single point of failure, Chainlink uses a network of independent node operators to source and verify data. This decentralized approach enhances the security and reliability of the data provided to smart contracts, mitigating risks like data manipulation or single points of failure. Enabling Complex Smart Contracts: Many sophisticated DeFi applications rely heavily on real-world data. Price feeds for decentralized exchanges, weather data for insurance contracts, and random number generation for gaming platforms are just a few examples. Chainlink empowers the creation of these complex and data-driven smart contracts, expanding the possibilities of DeFi. Variety of Services: Beyond price feeds, Chainlink offers a suite of decentralized services, including Proof of Reserve (PoR) to verify the collateralization of assets, Verifiable Random Function (VRF) for provably fair randomness, and Keepers for automating smart contract functions. In essence, Chainlink is the infrastructure that enables smart contracts to interact with the real world in a secure and trustworthy manner, making it an indispensable component of the growing DeFi ecosystem. Its importance is reflected in its widespread adoption across numerous DeFi protocols and its recognition by projects like World Liberty Financial. World Liberty Financial: Trump Family’s Foray into DeFi? World Liberty Financial has garnered attention primarily due to its co-founder, Zach Witkoff, and its reported connection to the Trump family. While details about the project are still emerging, its association with such a prominent political family immediately places it under a spotlight. Here’s what we know and what it implies: Trump Family Ties: Reports suggest that World Liberty Financial is linked to the Trump family, although the exact nature and extent of this connection are not fully transparent. This association inevitably brings a certain level of political and public interest to the project. DeFi Ambitions: World Liberty Financial is positioned as a DeFi project, indicating its aim to operate within the decentralized finance space. This likely involves leveraging blockchain technology to offer financial services in a decentralized and potentially more accessible manner. Limited Public Information: As of now, detailed information about World Liberty Financial’s specific products, services, and roadmap is relatively scarce. Their website and public communications are still developing, leaving many aspects of their project shrouded in some mystery. Speculation and Scrutiny: Given the Trump family connection and the nascent stage of the project, World Liberty Financial is subject to both significant speculation and scrutiny. The crypto community and the broader public are keenly watching to see how this project evolves and what impact it might have. The involvement of individuals connected to prominent political figures in the DeFi space is a developing trend. It could signal a bridging of traditional political and financial spheres with the decentralized world of crypto. However, it also raises questions about regulatory implications, transparency, and the potential for political influence within the ostensibly decentralized realm of DeFi. What Does This Mean for the Future of Chainlink and DeFi? The Chainlink shoutout from World Liberty Financial at the DC Blockchain Summit, while seemingly a minor event, could have broader implications for both Chainlink and the DeFi sector as a whole. Here are some potential takeaways: Increased Institutional Interest in Chainlink: Recognition from a project with political connections like World Liberty Financial might attract further attention from institutional investors and traditional financial entities towards Chainlink. This could lead to increased adoption of Chainlink’s services in more mainstream financial applications. Growing Convergence of Traditional Finance and DeFi: This event may be another indicator of the increasing convergence between traditional finance and decentralized finance. As projects like World Liberty Financial, with links to established political and financial networks, enter the DeFi space, it could accelerate the integration of these two worlds. Heightened Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased mainstream and political attention on DeFi, partly driven by projects like World Liberty Financial, could also lead to heightened regulatory scrutiny. Policymakers may become more focused on understanding and regulating the DeFi space as it gains prominence in traditional circles. Potential for Mass Adoption of DeFi: Ultimately, events like these, which bring DeFi into the broader public consciousness, can contribute to the gradual mass adoption of decentralized finance. As more people become aware of and potentially interact with DeFi through projects with familiar connections, the path to wider adoption could be paved. In conclusion, World Liberty Financial’s public acknowledgment of Chainlink at the DC Blockchain Summit is more than just a casual mention. It’s a noteworthy event that highlights the evolving landscape of DeFi, the increasing recognition of Chainlink’s vital role, and the potential for greater convergence between the crypto world and traditional finance. As the DeFi space continues to mature and attract attention from diverse sectors, such seemingly small events can serve as significant markers of broader industry trends and future directions.

42454093,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143597,1743038417,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Suspicious Funds Unveiled: OKX & Binance Wallets Linked to Hyperliquid JELLY Attack,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/okx-binance-hyperliquid-jelly-attack/,"The crypto sphere is buzzing with the latest developments in the Hyperliquid JELLY attack saga. On-chain data has unveiled a potentially significant piece of the puzzle: the funds utilized to orchestrate the JELLY short position attack on Hyperliquid originated from prominent cryptocurrency exchanges, OKX and Binance. This revelation, initially reported by LookOnChain via X (formerly Twitter), throws a new light on the incident and prompts crucial questions about exchange security and the flow of funds in decentralized finance (DeFi). What We Know About the Hyperliquid JELLY Attack and Fund Withdrawal For those unfamiliar, the Hyperliquid JELLY attack involved exploiting vulnerabilities in the platform to open substantial short positions in JELLY, a relatively new cryptocurrency. This maneuver reportedly caused price fluctuations and raised concerns within the Hyperliquid community. Now, LookOnChain’s findings suggest that the capital fueling this attack was traced back to withdrawals from two of the largest centralized exchanges in the world: OKX and Binance. Here’s a breakdown of the key details: On-chain Investigation: LookOnChain, a reputable blockchain analytics firm, conducted an investigation into the flow of funds related to the Hyperliquid JELLY attack. Exchange Identification: Their analysis pointed towards OKX and Binance as the source of the funds used to execute the attack. Withdrawal Confirmation: Data indicates that the attacker withdrew cryptocurrency from these exchanges prior to initiating the JELLY short positions on Hyperliquid. Rumor Debunking: The news indirectly addresses earlier rumors suggesting Binance’s direct involvement as the orchestrator of the JELLY incident. While funds were withdrawn from Binance, this doesn’t automatically imply Binance’s complicity, but rather highlights the exchange as a platform used for fund movement. To visualize the flow, consider this simplified representation: Why is the Origin of Funds in the Hyperliquid JELLY Attack Important for Crypto Security? Understanding where the attack funds originated is critical for several reasons, particularly concerning crypto security and the overall integrity of the digital asset ecosystem: Exchange Security Protocols: The fact that funds could be withdrawn from major exchanges like OKX and Binance and then used for a market manipulation attack raises questions about Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols. Were there any red flags missed? Can exchange security measures be further strengthened to prevent such incidents? Traceability of Funds: This incident underscores the importance of blockchain analytics in tracing illicit activities. The ability to follow the flow of funds on the blockchain is a crucial tool for investigations and for deterring malicious actors. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Vulnerabilities: While the funds originated from centralized exchanges, the attack targeted a DeFi platform, Hyperliquid. This highlights the interconnectedness of CeFi and DeFi and the potential for vulnerabilities in one area to impact the other. Crypto security needs to be robust across both centralized and decentralized platforms. Market Manipulation Concerns: The JELLY attack is a stark reminder of the risks of market manipulation in the cryptocurrency space, especially for newer and less liquid tokens. Understanding the source of funds helps in analyzing the motives and scale of such attacks. Binance and OKX Under Scrutiny: What Does This Mean for Exchange Reputation? While the report doesn’t directly implicate Binance or OKX in orchestrating the attack, the revelation that attacker funds were withdrawn from these platforms inevitably puts them under scrutiny. Does this tarnish their reputation? Not necessarily, but it does raise pertinent questions: Enhanced Monitoring: Will Binance and OKX enhance their transaction monitoring systems to detect and prevent suspicious withdrawal patterns that could precede market manipulation attempts? User Accountability: Should exchanges implement stricter measures to ensure user accountability and deter the use of their platforms for illicit activities, even if indirectly? Transparency and Cooperation: Will these exchanges cooperate with investigations into the Hyperliquid JELLY attack and share information to help identify the perpetrators? Transparency in such situations is crucial for maintaining user trust and demonstrating a commitment to crypto security . Fund Withdrawal and the Future of Crypto Investigations The fund withdrawal from OKX and Binance, as revealed by on-chain analysis, sets a precedent for future cryptocurrency investigations. It demonstrates the power of blockchain forensics in uncovering the origins of illicit funds and tracking their movement. This capability is increasingly vital as the crypto space matures and faces more sophisticated forms of attacks and financial crimes. Here are some potential implications for the future: Increased Reliance on On-Chain Analytics: Expect to see a greater reliance on on-chain analytics tools and firms like LookOnChain to investigate crypto-related incidents and provide crucial insights into fund flows. Collaboration Between Exchanges and Analytics Firms: Closer collaboration between cryptocurrency exchanges and blockchain analytics firms could become more common to proactively identify and mitigate risks related to money laundering and market manipulation. Regulatory Scrutiny: Incidents like the Hyperliquid JELLY attack, and the subsequent tracing of funds to major exchanges, might attract further regulatory scrutiny on exchanges and their security measures. Advancements in Crypto Security Technology: The need for more advanced crypto security technologies, both for exchanges and DeFi platforms, will become even more pressing to stay ahead of evolving attack vectors. Actionable Insights: What Can Crypto Users Learn? This incident offers valuable lessons for crypto users and the wider industry: Diversification of Exchange Usage: Consider diversifying your cryptocurrency holdings across multiple reputable exchanges to mitigate risks associated with any single platform. Stay Informed About Crypto Security Practices: Keep yourself updated on the latest crypto security best practices, including secure wallet management and being cautious of new and unaudited DeFi platforms. Support On-Chain Transparency: Advocate for greater transparency and on-chain data availability within the crypto ecosystem, as it is crucial for accountability and security. Exercise Caution with New Tokens: Be particularly cautious when trading newly launched or low-liquidity tokens, as they can be more susceptible to market manipulation. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for Crypto Security The revelation that funds used in the Hyperliquid JELLY attack were withdrawn from OKX and Binance serves as a potent reminder of the ongoing challenges in crypto security . While it doesn’t confirm any wrongdoing by these exchanges, it underscores the need for continuous vigilance, enhanced security protocols, and greater transparency across the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. The ability to trace funds is a powerful tool, but proactive measures and industry-wide collaboration are essential to prevent future incidents and foster a safer environment for all participants.

This streamlines the advertising process and potentially opens up new avenues for businesses and creators to reach their target audiences within Telegram. Exclusive Withdrawal Method for Creators and Developers: For those building bots, creating content, or developing within the Telegram ecosystem, TON serves as the primary method for withdrawing earnings. This is a game-changer, offering a potentially faster and more efficient way to access revenue compared to traditional banking systems, especially for a global user base. Trading Telegram Assets via TON-based NFTs: Ever wanted to own a unique Telegram username? Or perhaps send a digital gift that truly stands out? TON underpins the trading of Telegram assets like usernames and digital gifts through NFTs . This introduces a new layer of digital ownership and scarcity within Telegram, leveraging the booming NFT space. Backbone for Telegram Mini Apps: Those engaging and interactive Telegram Mini Apps , used by hundreds of millions, are built entirely on TON. This signifies a massive scale of operation and trust in TON’s infrastructure to support a significant portion of Telegram’s user activity. Decoding the Technology: Why TON Blockchain is Telegram’s Choice Durov didn’t just randomly pick a blockchain. He specifically emphasized TON’s scalability as a crucial factor. In a world where blockchain networks often struggle with transaction speeds and high fees, TON stands out. But what makes the TON blockchain so special, and why is it the ideal fit for Telegram’s ambitious plans? Sharding for Scalability: TON utilizes a technique called sharding. Imagine dividing a massive database into smaller, more manageable parts. Sharding does something similar for the blockchain, allowing it to process transactions in parallel across multiple shards (sub-blockchains). This dramatically increases throughput and allows TON to handle a significantly larger volume of transactions compared to blockchains without sharding. Designed for Billions of Transactions: Durov explicitly mentioned TON’s potential to support billions of transactions. This isn’t just marketing hype; it’s a testament to TON’s architecture, which is built from the ground up to handle massive scale, aligning perfectly with Telegram’s ever-growing user base and transaction demands. Real Fundamental Value: In a crypto landscape often filled with projects lacking tangible utility, Durov boldly stated that TON is “one of the few blockchains with real fundamental value.” This endorsement from a tech leader like Durov carries significant weight and suggests that TON isn’t just about speculation; it’s about providing real-world utility and infrastructure. The choice of TON underscores Telegram’s commitment to building a robust and scalable in-app economy that can accommodate its massive global user base. It’s not just about adding crypto features; it’s about fundamentally rethinking how transactions and interactions happen within the platform. Pavel Durov’s Vision: A Decentralized Future for Telegram? Pavel Durov ‘s endorsement of TON goes beyond just technological integration; it hints at a broader vision for Telegram’s future. By embracing blockchain technology and decentralization, Telegram could be positioning itself as a leader in the next evolution of social platforms. What could this vision entail? Empowering Creators and Users: By using TON for payments and withdrawals, Telegram potentially empowers creators and users with more control over their earnings and digital assets. Decentralized systems can often reduce reliance on intermediaries and potentially lower fees, benefiting both creators and users. Building a Web3 Ecosystem within Telegram: The integration of NFTs and Mini Apps on TON suggests Telegram is building a mini-Web3 ecosystem within its platform. This could attract developers and entrepreneurs looking to leverage Telegram’s massive user base to build decentralized applications and services. Future Decentralization of Telegram Infrastructure? While not explicitly stated, the deep integration with TON raises questions about the potential for further decentralization of Telegram’s infrastructure in the future. Could we see aspects of Telegram itself, beyond just the in-app economy, becoming more decentralized and community-driven? Durov’s statements suggest a long-term commitment to TON and a belief in the power of blockchain to enhance Telegram’s ecosystem. This could mark a turning point, not just for Telegram, but for how social platforms integrate with cryptocurrency technologies. Streamlining Transactions: Telegram Crypto Payments Powered by TON One of the most immediate and impactful applications of TON is in Telegram crypto payments . The shift to TON for Telegram Ads payments and creator withdrawals is more than just a technical upgrade; it represents a fundamental shift in how value is exchanged within the Telegram ecosystem. Let’s explore the benefits and implications: Feature Traditional Systems TON-Powered Telegram Payments Payment Method for Telegram Ads Credit Cards, Bank Transfers, etc. TON Withdrawal Method for Creators Bank Transfers, Payment Processors TON Transaction Speed Varies, can be slow Potentially Faster Transaction Fees Can be higher Potentially Lower Accessibility May have geographical limitations Potentially more globally accessible By embracing TON for crypto payments, Telegram is potentially offering a more efficient, cost-effective, and globally accessible payment infrastructure. This is particularly beneficial for creators and businesses operating in regions with limited access to traditional financial systems. Scaling for the Future: Can TON Scalability Handle Telegram’s Growth? The question on everyone’s mind is: Can TON scalability truly handle the demands of Telegram’s massive and ever-growing user base? Durov’s confidence is reassuring, but let’s delve deeper into the technical aspects of TON’s scalability and its potential limitations: Theoretical Limits of Sharding: While sharding significantly enhances scalability, it’s not a silver bullet. There are theoretical limits to how much a blockchain can scale, even with sharding. However, TON’s architecture is designed to push these limits further than many other blockchains. Real-World Performance Under Load: The true test of scalability is real-world performance under heavy load. As Telegram’s in-app economy grows and transaction volumes increase, TON’s network will be continuously tested. Ongoing monitoring and optimization will be crucial to ensure smooth performance. Future Upgrades and Developments: Blockchain technology is constantly evolving. TON, like other blockchains, will likely undergo continuous upgrades and improvements to further enhance its scalability and performance over time. Staying adaptable and innovative is key to maintaining long-term scalability. While challenges may arise, TON’s sharding architecture and focus on scalability position it well to handle Telegram’s future growth. The integration is a bold bet on the future of blockchain technology and its ability to support mainstream applications at scale. Conclusion: Telegram and TON – A Powerful Partnership for the Future Pavel Durov’s announcement is a clear signal: TON is not just a side project; it’s the engine driving Telegram’s in-app economy and potentially shaping its future trajectory. From revolutionizing Telegram crypto payments to powering Telegram in-app economy , TON’s scalability and utility are being put to the test on a massive scale. Pavel Durov ‘s vision of a decentralized and efficient platform is taking shape, leveraging the power of the TON blockchain . This partnership is one to watch closely, as it could set a new precedent for how social platforms integrate with cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, unlocking a world of possibilities for users, creators, and the entire crypto ecosystem.

While investors are still scratching their heads over Slerf’s accidental $10 million burn and Goatseus Maximus’ AI-fueled rise, another project is silently stacking massive gains for its community— BTFD Coin (BTFD) . In a market where volatility is the norm and headlines move prices, BTFD Coin has raised over $6.41 million, sold more than 72 billion tokens, and is serving up a limited-time 100% bonus for anyone brave enough to buy the dip. The presale is sitting at Stage 15 out of 16, and with the price currently at $0.0002, it’s only going up from here. LAUNCH100 is the code everyone’s using to double their BTFD coins—but heads up, this wild bonus ends March 30. Let’s dig into why BTFD’s presale may be the best play in town right now, while Slerf and GOAT deliver their own (kinda bizarre) headlines among the top new meme coins to join today. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – Built for Bulls, Ready to Charge Imagine getting in on a meme coin that’s not just vibes and volatility, but backed by utility, rewards, and one of the most relatable mottos in all of crypto: Buy The Dip . That’s BTFD Coin for you. But this isn’t just some internet meme dressed up as the top new meme coin to join today. It’s a community-powered ecosystem with staking, a P2E game that’s already live, and the heart of it all—the Bulls Squad. Let’s talk about this squad. Baby Bull leads with memes and momentum. Raging Bull fuels the visuals. Nerdy Bull’s building the tech, and People’s Bull? He’s out here making sure every new buyer feels like they’re in on something real. This isn’t some random Telegram group—this is a movement of 11,600+ holders, all chasing opportunity instead of fearing dips. And that P2E game? It’s not just hype—it’s live and paying out. Users can now jump into the BTFD Bull Run Game, climb levels, invite friends, and earn real BTFD tokens while playing. Combine that with staking that’s delivering a solid 90% APY, and you’ve got a token that pays you for holding and playing. Literally. Then there’s the presale. Stage 15 is where things are cooking. The current price is $0.0002, but once it hits $0.0006 at launch, that’s a 200% ROI just from getting in now. Let’s put that in perspective. Drop $1000 today at $0.0002, and you’ll get 5 million tokens. Use the LAUNCH100 bonus code , and that turns into 10 million tokens instantly. Once BTFD hits $0.0006, those 10 million coins? They’re worth $6000. Oh, and don’t miss this—March 30 is the deadline for that 100% bonus. This isn’t one of those “limited time” deals that stick around forever. After March 30, LAUNCH100 is gone. Hey Bulls, this one’s for you: 100% BONUS CODE: LAUNCH100 – Buy now and your tokens get doubled. That’s right—twice the tokens, zero extra cost. But you gotta act fast. How to Claim the LAUNCH100 Bonus: Step 1: Head to the BTFD Presale Step 2: Connect your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, whatever works for you) Step 3: Enter LAUNCH100 in the bonus code field and hit “Apply” Step 4: Choose your purchase amount and click “Buy Now” Step 5: Confirm everything in your wallet, and boom—you just doubled your stack Remember: LAUNCH100 must be entered in ALL CAPS. Don’t miss that. Oh, and if you’ve got friends in the game, bring ‘em in. BTFD’s referral program is giving away 10% of the raised amount in BTFD tokens for the top 20 referrers each month. If your code makes the top list by month’s end, you’re getting some serious rewards. The competition resets at 12:01 UTC on the 1st of every month. Bottom line? BTFD is more than a meme coin presale —it’s a moment. A chance to lock in value while everyone else waits for the next crash to “maybe” buy. You don’t need to wait for dips when you’re buying at dip prices right now. Slerf (SLERF) – The $10M Mistake That Created a Meme Legend SLERF was already a playful sloth on the Solana blockchain, but it made waves after its developer accidentally burned $10 million in presale funds. Yep, just—poof—gone. Instead of tanking, the price spiked, and SLERF became a legend overnight. Now trading at around $0.068174, with a market cap of $34.35 million, SLERF’s community is all-in on chaos and comedy. Still, with only ~500 million tokens circulating, volatility is a constant. SLERF’s wild start is great if you’re into high-risk, high-reward bets—but if you’re looking for stability and a guaranteed bonus? BTFD is a safer bet with real utility. Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) – From Meme to Meme Religion? GOAT’s origin is about as bizarre as it gets. An AI called “Terminal of Truths” tweeted about a “GOAT singularity,” and boom—someone launched a meme coin to match the vibe. With a total supply of 1 billion and a circulating supply of ~999.99 million, GOAT is now trading at $0.0638 with a market cap of $63.82 million. Its AI-backed cult following and lore-filled community called the “Gospel of Goatse” give it a unique twist. But with an all-time high of $1.35, it’s down massively. It could rebound—or it could stay weird. Either way, GOAT is fascinating, but again, it doesn’t hold a candle to BTFD’s reward-packed presale and live ecosystem. Conclusion – Time to Charge with the Bulls Crypto’s wild. We get it. Some days, it feels like you need divine intervention or AI prophecies just to make sense of the madness. But based on what we’re seeing—from market trends to community momentum— BTFD Coin stands out as the most solid, value-packed project among the top new meme coins to join today. The presale is real. The P2E game is live. The staking is juicy. The LAUNCH100 bonus ends March 30. Miss it, and you’re leaving 100% of your gains on the table. This is your shot to be part of something where utility meets meme, and community meets conviction. Don’t just scroll and think “maybe later.” Join the BTFD Coin presale right now—before Stage 16 hits and the bonus disappears! Find Out More: Website: https://www.btfd.io/ X/Twitter: https://x.com/BTFD_COIN Telegram: https://t.me/btfd_coin FAQs What is BTFD Coin’s LAUNCH100 Bonus? It’s a limited-time offer where buyers get 100% extra BTFD tokens during Stage 15 by entering the code LAUNCH100. It ends on March 30. How do I buy BTFD Coin in the presale? Visit the BTFD site, connect your wallet, enter LAUNCH100 in the bonus field, and confirm the purchase. What makes BTFD Coin different from other meme coins? BTFD isn’t just hype. It’s got a live P2E game, 90% APY staking, Ethereum security, and a presale with real rewards. Is Slerf a good investment? SLERF is high-risk with unpredictable moves. It gained fame from an accidental $10M burn but lacks core utilities like staking or gaming. What’s the story behind Goatseus Maximus? GOAT was born from an AI’s meme prophecy. It has a loyal fanbase, but no staking or presale bonus—unlike BTFD.

The current market situation has brought renewed speculation about which promising tokens such as Remittix would offer investment returns like Pepe Coin's projected 2024 rise and Shiba Inu's historic 2021 performance. Let us find out why analysts think Remittix is the best crypto to buy in 2025. Is Pepe Coin Dead Or Still Riding the Meme Coin Wave The meme coin Pepe Coin uses nostalgic branding combined with viral promotional activities to build a strong community base among speculators. The price of Pepe stands at $0.00000912 while showing a 22% weekly gain through speculative trader interest seeking risky investment opportunities. The market momentum of Pepe Coin shows signs of deceleration since investors are moving toward initiatives that present better fundamental values. The key market insights indicate that despite the RSI standing at 50, which is neutral, other short-term technical indicators like MACD and moving averages are indicating a 'buy', albeit in spite of long-term moving averages still indicating some bearish pressure. Additionally, open interest has increased by 8.47%, indicative of increased trader activity. If PEPE is able to break past the resistance zone at $0.00000980 , it may target $0.000011 levels in the forthcoming weeks. However, the meme coin market remains unpredictable, even though the bulls appear to be in control, with the long-term direction of PEPE not yet clear, the next few days will be crucial in knowing whether the coin is actually ready for a significant breakout Pepe faces sustainability risks as a speculative asset because it must prove its ability to move past hype-based trading while developing practical applications which Remittix demonstrates successfully. Can Shiba Inu Soar In 2025; Or Is The Hype Over? Shiba Inu remains one of the most popular cryptocurrencies available today with its reputation of building life-changing wealth for early adopters. Currently trading at under $0.000016, SHIB has seen a calm after being characterized by extreme volatility in the first part of this year. Its fan base keeps expanding with ecosystem initiatives like Shibarium a Layer-2 infrastructure with the objective of enhancing scalability and reducing transaction fees which has helped maintain investor demand for the token. Market forecasts indicate that Shiba Inu may experience a steady increase to $0.000025 by the end of 2025 if adoption of its ecosystem speeds up. Nevertheless, as SHIB matures, its growth potential might be capped against newer entrants in the market with new concepts and innovative technologies such as Remittix. Others believe Shiba Inu is set for an explosive 12x surge as its ecosystem team supports a bullish call, with upside potential for a 1,137% rise that will leave the meme currency smashing through levels to hit $0.0001833. Analysts See A Safe Path to Exponential Gains Following Remittix Aggressive Presale Success Through its presale Remittix has established a digital finance revolution that has already delivered more than 300% return on investment to its early investors. The crypto market adopted an exceptional positive stance toward the Defi project because of its promising potential to break into 2025’s top altcoins list. The DeFi coin, RTX, powers Remittix’s PayFi technology that makes international fund transfers easier for users. Blockchain technology allows the platform to offer fast and cost-effective money transfers that modernize global money transfer processes with transactions occurring in mere minutes. The smart contract safety of Remittix has been completely tested by BlockSAFU for maximum reliability. Through rigorous testing the platform achieves both reliability and robustness which brings stakeholders full security assurance. Those who join now with prices below 10 cents at $0.0734 have exceptional chances to take part in this revolutionary shift. Potential investors should seize this opportune period to buy Remittix tokens because the presale currently promises to produce substantive financial yield. Analysts think Remittix will yield up to 30x returns on investment when it eventually lists on top exchanges like Binance, Coinbase and Bybit thus making Remittix a noteworthy competitor in the crypto industry.

42454841,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143617,1743039605,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial Crypto Bills Update: Congress Nears Landmark Vote on Stablecoins & FIT 21,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/congress-crypto-stablecoin-bills/,"Are you ready for a potential seismic shift in the crypto landscape? Washington D.C. is buzzing with activity as Congress edges closer to making decisive moves on crypto bills and stablecoin bills . For crypto enthusiasts, investors, and industry players, this is a moment to watch closely. The future of digital assets in the US could be defined in the coming days as lawmakers work to establish a clear regulatory framework. Let’s dive into the details of these potentially groundbreaking developments. What’s the Buzz Around Crypto Bills in Congress? The momentum is building on Capitol Hill. Rep. French Hill, a key figure in these discussions, has indicated that a revised version of the highly anticipated FIT 21 bill will be unveiled within days. This is not just another piece of legislation; FIT 21 , or the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, is designed to create a comprehensive market structure for the crypto industry. Think of it as a blueprint for how digital assets will be governed in the US. But what exactly does FIT 21 aim to achieve? Expanding CFTC Oversight: One of the core goals of FIT 21 is to broaden the authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This would mean the CFTC would have a greater role in overseeing the crypto market, particularly concerning digital commodities. Defining the SEC’s Role: Equally important is clarifying the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) jurisdiction. The bill seeks to delineate where the SEC’s regulatory perimeter ends and where the CFTC’s begins, aiming to eliminate the ambiguity that has plagued the industry. Clarity for Crypto Businesses: For crypto businesses operating in the US, this clarity is paramount. A well-defined regulatory landscape can foster innovation, encourage investment, and provide a stable environment for growth, reducing the fear of inadvertently crossing regulatory lines. Rep. Hill’s announcement signals that lawmakers are serious about advancing crypto regulation . The revised draft likely incorporates feedback and revisions from previous discussions, suggesting a collaborative effort to create a workable framework. Stablecoin Bills: Are We Nearing a Breakthrough? Parallel to the FIT 21 developments, significant progress is also being made on stablecoin bills . Rep. Bryan Steil has confirmed that the text of the House stablecoin bill is imminent, with a markup expected shortly after its introduction. This is a crucial step towards regulating stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar. Why are stablecoin bills so important? Systemic Risk Mitigation: Stablecoins have grown exponentially in popularity and market capitalization. Their widespread use means that their stability (or instability) can have broader implications for the financial system. Regulation aims to mitigate potential systemic risks. Consumer Protection: Ensuring that stablecoins are backed by adequate reserves and operate transparently is crucial for consumer protection. Regulations can establish standards for reserves, auditing, and disclosure. Payment Innovation: Stablecoin bills can pave the way for the responsible innovation of stablecoins as payment mechanisms. Clear rules can encourage adoption while safeguarding against misuse. The fact that both House and Senate versions of the stablecoin bill are reportedly about 80% aligned is a very encouraging sign. This level of consensus suggests a strong bipartisan push to get stablecoin regulation across the finish line. Unified digital asset regulation appears to be a shared goal, transcending partisan lines. The Push for Unified Digital Asset Regulation The overarching narrative here is the drive towards unified digital asset regulation . Lawmakers are recognizing the need for a cohesive and comprehensive approach to governing cryptocurrencies and related technologies. Fragmented or conflicting regulations could stifle innovation and create unnecessary compliance burdens. A unified framework, on the other hand, can provide: Benefit Description Clarity and Certainty Businesses and investors gain a clear understanding of the rules of the game, reducing uncertainty and fostering confidence. Reduced Compliance Costs A unified framework can streamline compliance, making it less costly and complex for businesses to operate within the regulatory perimeter.

These cryptocurrencies are catching the eyes of investors with promising growth signals. Dive into the analysis of why Cardano could hit $2 and XRP might reach $5 soon. Discover the key factors driving this expected upward movement. Cardano Shows Strong Long-Term Momentum Despite Recent Lull During the past month, Cardano experienced a minor dip of 0.26% despite a healthy weekly gain of 9.56%. Over the half-year period, a striking increase of 91.04% highlights notable investor interest and a period of significant upward movement. These figures reveal a coin that has built momentum over time, even though recent short-term performance appears subdued. Currently, Cardano trades within a range of $0.44 to $0.88 with a nearby resistance at $1.15 and support at $0.25. Indicators such as an RSI of 52.06 and a near-neutral Awesome Oscillator suggest a balanced market with a slight tilt toward bulls. Trading strategies could focus on buying within this range and monitoring moves toward key resistance levels for potential exits. XRP Market Insights: Past Trends and Current Price Dynamics XRP price declined by 4.45% over the past month, while a staggering 316.93% gain over six months underscores a strong long-term rally. A weekly increase of 7.74% hints at periodic momentum despite recent pullbacks. Historical performance shows volatility with significant upward movements punctuating shorter-term dips. The data highlights potential strength when examined across different periods, reflecting both short-term fluctuations and a robust long-term recovery signal. Current levels show a trading range from $1.60 to $2.88, with support near $1.06 and resistance at $3.61, followed by a secondary resistance at $4.89. Bulls and bears appear relatively balanced, with no clear trend dominating. Traders may look to buy near support and sell at resistance if bulls can push the price higher while monitoring key indicator signals. Conclusion ADA shows strong potential to reach the $2 mark. XRP is also demonstrating signs that it could soon hit $5. Both coins are exhibiting bullish trends. Investors are closely watching the market for a potential breakout. The sustained momentum could lead to significant gains for both ADA and XRP. The current market indicators suggest promising times ahead for these cryptocurrencies.

42455244,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143619,1743040259,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Warning: Bitget CEO Exposes Hyperliquid FTX Threat After JELLY Incident,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitget-ceo-hyperliquid-ftx-threat/,"Is history about to repeat itself in the volatile world of cryptocurrency exchanges? The crypto community is buzzing after Bitget CEO Gracy Chen issued a stark warning about decentralized exchange (DEX) Hyperliquid. Chen publicly stated that Hyperliquid’s handling of a recent incident, known as the JELLY incident, bears an uncanny resemblance to the events leading up to the colossal FTX collapse. Could Hyperliquid be the next domino to fall in the crypto space? Let’s dive into the details of this developing crypto exchange controversy and understand what’s at stake for crypto users. Why is Bitget CEO Gracy Chen Sounding the Alarm on Hyperliquid? The core of the issue stems from what Bitget CEO Gracy Chen describes as Hyperliquid’s “immature, unethical, and unprofessional” response to the JELLY incident. In a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter), Chen didn’t mince words, suggesting that Hyperliquid’s actions not only caused financial losses for users but also severely damaged the exchange’s credibility. This is a significant accusation, especially considering Hyperliquid markets itself as an innovative decentralized exchange. Here’s a breakdown of Chen’s key concerns: Immature Handling of JELLY Incident: Chen criticized Hyperliquid’s approach to resolving the JELLY incident, implying a lack of transparency and user-centric solutions. User Losses: She highlighted that Hyperliquid’s actions resulted in tangible financial losses for users, a critical breach of trust in the crypto exchange environment. Damaged Credibility: According to Chen, the incident has significantly eroded Hyperliquid’s credibility, questioning its reliability and trustworthiness as a DEX platform. FTX 2.0 Potential: The most alarming aspect of Chen’s statement is the direct comparison to FTX, suggesting that the JELLY incident could be a precursor to a larger crisis at Hyperliquid, mirroring the catastrophic downfall of FTX. Chen’s commentary raises serious questions about the operational standards and user protection mechanisms within the decentralized exchange sector, particularly when compared to regulated centralized exchanges. Decentralized Exchange (DEX) vs. Centralized Exchange (CEX): Are User Funds Really Safer? The rise of decentralized exchange DEX platforms was largely fueled by the desire for greater user control and transparency, contrasting sharply with the opaque nature of some centralized exchanges. DEXs, in theory, eliminate the need for intermediaries, allowing users to trade directly from their wallets. However, Chen’s critique throws a spotlight on the potential pitfalls even within the DEX space. Let’s compare DEXs and CEXs in light of this controversy: Feature Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Centralized Exchange (CEX) Custody of Funds Users retain control of their private keys and funds. Users deposit funds into the exchange’s custody. Transparency Transactions are typically recorded on a public blockchain. Transparency can vary; some CEXs are less transparent about their operations. Regulation & Compliance Often operates with less regulatory oversight. Subject to regulations and KYC/AML compliance. Risk of Incidents Smart contract vulnerabilities, protocol risks, operational immaturity. Exchange hacks, mismanagement, regulatory risks. User Protection User protection mechanisms can be less defined and harder to enforce. Often have established customer support and some level of regulatory protection (depending on jurisdiction). Chen’s statement suggests that while DEXs offer the promise of decentralization, they are not immune to operational failures and user harm. Her comparison of Hyperliquid to “offshore centralized exchanges that facilitate illegal activities without KYC/AML” is particularly damning. It implies that Hyperliquid, despite being a DEX, might be exhibiting similar risky behaviors and lack of accountability that contributed to the FTX debacle. The JELLY Incident Crypto: What Actually Happened? To understand the gravity of the JELLY incident crypto controversy, it’s crucial to know what transpired. While specific details of the JELLY incident require further investigation and official statements from Hyperliquid, the core issue seems to revolve around a significant operational or technical glitch that led to user losses. Based on available information and Chen’s comments, the JELLY incident likely involved: A Technical Issue: Potentially a smart contract vulnerability, a platform bug, or an exploit that affected trading or asset management on Hyperliquid. User Losses: This technical issue resulted in direct financial losses for users who were trading or holding assets on the platform at the time of the incident. Hyperliquid’s Response: Chen’s criticism focuses on how Hyperliquid handled the aftermath – allegedly in an “immature, unethical, and unprofessional” manner, suggesting a lack of adequate communication, compensation, or resolution for affected users. The lack of detailed public information about the JELLY incident itself further fuels concerns about transparency and user protection within the DEX space. A robust and transparent response to such incidents is crucial for maintaining user trust and the long-term viability of any crypto exchange, whether centralized or decentralized. Hyperliquid FTX: Is History Repeating Itself? The most alarming takeaway from Bitget CEO’s statement is the direct comparison of Hyperliquid FTX . The collapse of FTX sent shockwaves through the crypto industry, exposing the dangers of centralized control, lack of transparency, and alleged fraudulent activities. Chen drawing parallels between Hyperliquid and FTX is a serious accusation that warrants attention and scrutiny. Why is the FTX comparison so potent and concerning? Sudden and Unexpected Collapse: FTX’s downfall was rapid and largely unexpected by many, highlighting how quickly trust can erode in the crypto space. User Fund Mismanagement: Allegations of FTX mismanaging and misusing user funds were central to its collapse, leading to massive user losses. Lack of Transparency and Accountability: FTX was criticized for its opaque operations and lack of accountability, contributing to the crisis. Industry-Wide Contagion: The FTX collapse had ripple effects across the crypto market, impacting numerous projects and investors. If Hyperliquid is indeed exhibiting similar patterns of questionable practices or inadequate user protection, as suggested by Chen, the potential for a similar catastrophic outcome cannot be dismissed lightly. The crypto community remembers the lessons of FTX, and any hint of history repeating itself is bound to trigger alarm bells. Actionable Insights: Protecting Yourself in the DEX Era This crypto exchange controversy serves as a crucial reminder for all crypto users, especially those venturing into the world of decentralized exchanges. While DEXs offer exciting possibilities, they also come with inherent risks. Here are some actionable insights to protect yourself: Due Diligence is Key: Thoroughly research any DEX platform before using it. Understand its operational model, security measures, and community reputation. Risk Diversification: Don’t put all your crypto assets on a single platform, especially a relatively new or less established DEX. Diversify across multiple platforms and cold storage solutions. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of news and developments related to the DEX platforms you use. Follow industry experts and monitor social media for any red flags or user concerns. Understand Smart Contract Risks: Be aware that DEXs rely on smart contracts, which can have vulnerabilities. Opt for platforms with audited and well-vetted smart contracts. Prioritize Transparency: Favor DEXs that are transparent about their operations, incident response protocols, and user protection mechanisms. The evolving landscape of crypto exchanges demands vigilance and informed decision-making. The Hyperliquid situation, highlighted by Bitget CEO Gracy Chen, underscores the importance of critical evaluation and risk management, even within the decentralized realm. Conclusion: A Stark Warning for the DEX Future? Bitget CEO Gracy Chen’s shocking allegations against Hyperliquid have ignited a crucial conversation about the state of decentralized exchanges and user safety. The comparison to FTX is a grave warning, urging both users and the industry to take a closer look at the operational practices and accountability mechanisms within the DEX sector. While decentralization offers numerous benefits, it doesn’t inherently guarantee safety or immunity from failures. The JELLY incident and its aftermath serve as a potent reminder that robust security, transparency, and user-centric responses are paramount for the sustained growth and trust in the decentralized crypto ecosystem. The crypto community will be watching closely to see how Hyperliquid responds to these serious accusations and what steps the broader DEX industry takes to ensure user protection and prevent potential “FTX 2.0” scenarios.

A glance at the charts reveals that crypto price today exhibits dour sentiments with BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP in bleed mode. Crypto Price Today: Top Coins Suffers Are In The Red According to CoinMarketCap data , flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) has dipped by nearly 2% today to trade at $87,000, quelling enthusiasm for a run toward $90K. Bitcoin’s decline is pulling other assets underwater with the largest altcoin Ethereum down by 3.1% at just above $2,000. The fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has shed nearly 4% as it exchanges hands at $2.36. The asset has failed to rally following the dismissal of the Ripple SEC Case, wallowing at 38.27% from its all-time high of $3.84. Furthermore, Solana (SOL) has lost 5% of its value as it trades at $137. The sixth-largest token has erased previous gains despite rising institutional interest from Polymarket enabling SOL deposits and BlackRock’s BUIDL fund launching on the network. On the other hand, Cardano (ADA) is bleeding at $0.7, after shedding nearly 5% of its market capitalization in the correction. Predictions for ADA to $10 seem far off for the ninth-largest cryptocurrency with daily trading volumes of under $1 billion confirming widespread optimism. Chainlink (LINK) trades at $15.19 with a respectable 1.68% decline for the asset. Daily trading volumes of over 12% are signaling a potential upswing for LINK price in the near future. Memecoins Are Recording Impressive Gains While the rest of the market is bleeding memecoins are bucking the trend to notch upswing. Shiba Inu (SHIB) has surged by nearly 4% as it seeks to eliminate a zero from its present price. Dogecoin (DOGE) continues its upward trend, climbing by 2% to trade at $0.1945 on the heels of a Dogecoin Reserve . DOGE’s daily trading volume is matching the enthusiasm of price predictions touting the memecoin to embark on a strong rally. The biggest gainer of the lot is PEPE with its near 7% spike over the last day. The memecoin has a daily trading volume of $1 billion, a 96% jump over the last day as it eyes an increase in its market value. Despite the rallies, Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood says memecoins will lose value in the coming days. However, the memecoin rally was unable to stop the global market capitalization for crypto price today from sliding by 2% to settle at $2.84 trillion.

According to Rector, the SEC Commissioners will hold a vote on March 27 to finalize their decision to end the appeal against Ripple. He stated that an official announcement would follow soon after. This development comes after the SEC agreed to dismiss its appeal against Ripple, marking a significant moment for the cryptocurrency industry. The image attached to the Rector’s post showed a Sunshine Act notice for a closed SEC meeting scheduled for March 27, 2025. While the official agenda of this meeting has not been disclosed, the timing suggests it could include discussions related to the Ripple case. According to Rector, the first hearing to confirm Paul Atkins as the new SEC Chair will happen the same day.

Over the years, the case has seen multiple notable rulings, including Judge Analisa Torres’s 2023 decision that XRP was not a security in secondary sales and the August 2024 ruling that imposed a $125 million penalty on the company. The SEC’s subsequent appeal attempts have not changed any of these rulings, and the regulator’s decision to drop the appeal follows recent dismissals of other crypto-related lawsuits and investigations. This dismissal would mark a major victory for Ripple and the broader cryptocurrency industry, and the results could be a notable precedent for digital asset regulation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The SEC Meeting and Possible Announcement The SEC’s Sunshine Act notice confirms that a closed meeting will occur on March 27, 2025, at 2:00 p.m. ET. While the notice does not specify the topics under discussion, Rector and others in the cryptocurrency community speculate that the formal vote to end the Ripple appeal could be included. If the vote occurs as expected, an official announcement could follow. This dismissal is a major step toward the future. It coincides with the confirmation hearing of Paul Atkins, the man Donald Trump has nominated to bring the SEC into a new era of proper regulatory practices. The timing of this meeting, combined with the recent lawsuit dismissals , raises expectations that the Ripple lawsuit’s resolution could be confirmed soon.

The House of Representatives just released its version, following the Senate’s recent approval of a similar bill. New Bill to Align House and Senate Efforts This new legislation will set rules for how companies can create and use digital tokens backed by the U.S. dollar, marking a major step in bringing more oversight and clarity to the growing crypto industry. Steil explained that the new version of the bill will help align the House and Senate’s efforts, making the two versions more similar and easier to work with. The Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE Act) “is a strong continuation of our work on digital assets in the last Congress,” Hill said in a statement. Rep Emmer Reintroduces Securities Clarity Act Besides, on Wednesday, Rep. Emmer reintroduced his Securities Clarity Act , aiming to clarify how crypto assets fit into securities law. “Until we have a clear definition of what is a commodity and what is a security, American innovation will continue to suffer. Our legislation will help provide these answers and allow American investors to fully participate in digital asset technology without sacrificing consumer protections,” Congressman Tom Emmer noted. As the conference came to an end, the Senate held a second vote to overturn the IRS’ 2024 rule on DeFi brokers, after both the Senate and House passed the resolution before. The vote passed with 70 Senators in favor and 28 against. Amanda Tuminelli, Executive Director of the DeFi Education Fund, thanked the bipartisan lawmakers who supported the resolution, pointing out the negative effects of the IRS’ rule on the DeFi industry. French Hill to Release Revised FIT 21 Bill Shortly At the DC Blockchain Summit on Wednesday, House Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill also mentioned that a revised version of the market structure bill is almost ready, following work from his committee last year. The bill, called FIT 21 (Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act), passed the House last year with support from 71 Democrats, including former Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Hill plans to release a revised draft in the next few weeks, after receiving “technical assistance.” The market structure bill from last year aimed to give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission more control over crypto markets, especially bitcoin, and clarify the SEC’s role. Passing the market structure bill is more challenging than the stablecoin legislation due to its complexity. When FIT 21 passed the House, it was influenced by opposition to former SEC Chair Gary Gensler and former President Joe Biden, leading to some compromises. However, now, with a different political landscape, those compromises may no longer be needed. Stablecoin Regulation Picking Up The Senate Banking Committee recently advanced the bipartisan GENIUS Act, which aims to establish a framework for regulating stablecoins and determining when issuers fall under state or federal oversight. Some Democrats voiced concerns and sought changes, but they were unsuccessful. Meanwhile, in the House, Republicans, led by Rep. Bryan Steil, introduced the STABLE Act in February to regulate stablecoins.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-27 01:57:31

The global markets are on edge as former President Donald Trump is set to make a significant announcement regarding auto tariffs tonight at 8 p.m. UTC. While it might seem distant from the world of digital currencies, this move could send ripples through the entire financial ecosystem, potentially creating both challenges and opportunities for the crypto market. Let’s dive into what this Trump trade policy shift means and how it could affect your crypto portfolio. Why Auto Tariffs Matter to Crypto: Understanding the Economic Uncertainty At first glance, auto tariffs might seem like they only concern the automotive industry. However, in today’s interconnected global economy, such decisions have far-reaching consequences. Tariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods, designed to protect domestic industries. But they can also: Increase Consumer Prices: Tariffs can lead to higher prices for imported cars and potentially domestically produced cars as well, contributing to inflation. Spark Trade Wars: Imposing tariffs can provoke retaliatory measures from other countries, escalating into full-blown trade wars. This creates global trade tensions and economic instability. Impact Global Growth: Trade wars disrupt supply chains, reduce international trade, and can slow down global economic growth. Currency Fluctuations: Tariffs can influence currency exchange rates, impacting the value of the US dollar and other currencies, which in turn can affect crypto prices. For the crypto market, which often thrives on economic uncertainty crypto and volatility, these broader economic shifts are crucial to watch. When traditional markets face turbulence, investors sometimes look to alternative assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as hedges. Decoding Trump’s Auto Tariff Announcement: What to Expect? While the exact details of President Trump’s announcement are still under wraps, the anticipation itself is causing jitters in financial markets. Here’s what we can anticipate and consider: Scope of Tariffs: Will these tariffs be targeted at specific countries, or will they be broad-based? The scope will determine the extent of the impact. Tariff Rates: The percentage of tariffs imposed will directly influence the price increases and the level of trade disruption. Retaliation Risk: We need to assess the likelihood and potential scale of retaliatory tariffs from other nations. This could amplify global trade tensions . Market Reaction: How will stock markets, bond markets, and currency markets react immediately after the announcement? This initial reaction can give us clues about the potential impact on crypto. Navigating Market Volatility Crypto: Opportunities and Challenges The expected market volatility crypto markets might experience due to the tariff announcement presents a double-edged sword. Here’s a breakdown of potential scenarios: Scenario Potential Crypto Market Impact Opportunities Challenges Increased Economic Uncertainty Investors may seek safe-haven assets, potentially driving capital into Bitcoin and other established cryptocurrencies. Potential for price appreciation in major cryptocurrencies. Increased trading volume and market activity. Altcoins might experience higher volatility and increased risk. Regulatory uncertainty could be amplified during economic turmoil. Stock Market Downturn If auto tariffs trigger a significant stock market correction, some investors might diversify into crypto as an alternative investment. Opportunity to buy crypto at potentially lower prices if a market dip occurs. Increased awareness of crypto as a non-correlated asset. Broader market panic could temporarily drag down all asset classes, including crypto. Liquidity issues might arise in highly volatile conditions. Dollar Weakness Tariffs could weaken the US dollar if they negatively impact the US economy. A weaker dollar can historically be positive for Bitcoin. Bitcoin, often seen as an alternative to fiat currencies, could become more attractive. Dollar-pegged stablecoins might see increased scrutiny. Importing goods and services using crypto might become more expensive if the dollar weakens significantly against other currencies. Actionable Insights: Preparing Your Crypto Strategy Given the impending announcement and potential market volatility crypto could face, here are some actionable steps for crypto investors: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on news related to the tariff announcement and its immediate aftermath. Monitor market reactions across different asset classes. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different cryptocurrencies and potentially other asset classes can help mitigate risk. Manage Risk: Consider reducing leverage and setting stop-loss orders to protect your capital during periods of high volatility. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that short-term market fluctuations are common. Focus on the long-term fundamentals of your crypto investments. Explore Stablecoins: In times of uncertainty, stablecoins pegged to stronger currencies (other than USD if it weakens) could offer a temporary safe haven within the crypto ecosystem. The Bottom Line: Navigating the Trade Winds in Crypto President Trump’s auto tariff announcement is more than just trade policy; it’s a potential catalyst for economic shifts that can significantly impact the cryptocurrency market. By understanding the potential consequences of this Trump trade policy and preparing for increased market volatility crypto markets might experience, you can navigate these uncertain times strategically. Whether it presents opportunities for growth or challenges to overcome, staying informed and adaptable is key in the ever-evolving world of crypto.

Over the past week, the Pi Coin sentiment collapsed after a 90% price drop, triggering concerns about trust and engagement. In more positive news, Chainlink shows breakout potential, supported by bullish technical indicators and rising trading volumes. Yet all eyes are on BlockDAG (BDAG) , as explosive presale momentum drives the project closer to an ambitious $600 million presale goal. With over $206.5 million raised and growing BDAG demand, BlockDAG is doing more than keeping up—it’s surging ahead and solidifying its position as the best crypto to buy now. Pi Coin Sentiment Deteriorates as Market Confidence Wavers The spotlight is back on Pi Network but for all the wrong reasons. In just 24 hours, Pi coin sentiment worsened due to a staggering 90% drop in Pi’s value, sparking debate across the crypto space. The sharp drop appears linked to a wave of bot activity and spam, raising serious concerns about the project’s social credibility and underlying engagement metrics. The unexpected turn in Pi coin sentiment has raised concerns about the authenticity of Pi Network’s community support. With user trust under pressure and organic activity declining, the incident has cast a shadow over the project’s credibility. As speculation continues, it remains unclear how quickly Pi coin sentiment can recover from this reputational setback. Chainlink Technical Analysis Suggests Potential $24 Breakout Recent Chainlink technical analysis indicates growing bullish momentum as LINK trades near the $19 mark. Analysts point to strong support at $17.75 and resistance at $19.98. A successful breakout above this resistance could set the stage for a rally toward the $24 target, especially if market sentiment remains favorable. The analysis also highlights rising trading volume and improving RSI levels, which reinforce the bullish outlook. While short-term volatility remains, Chainlink’s technical analysis suggests the project is gearing up for a key move. Continued strength above support levels may confirm upward momentum in the coming weeks. BlockDAG’s Presale Surge Puts $600M Target in Striking Distance BlockDAG is racing toward its ambitious $600 million presale target, and it’s not just hype, it’s measurable momentum. With over $206.5 million raised and 18.9 billion BDAG coins sold, the numbers speak for themselves. The presale’s steady climb shows no signs of slowing, fueled by consistent batch sellouts and growing public interest. Not to mention, demand for BDAG coins is through the roof. Over 700,000 users are actively mining BDAG on its mobile mining tools, while more than 170,000 unique holders have bought BDAG coins. These figures show BlockDAG’s wide adoption and reflect the trust crypto enthusiasts have in the BlockDAG ecosystem and its growth. As the demand for BDAG grows and more people join the project, the presale keeps getting bigger. BDAG holders now anticipate its upcoming Mainnet launch and 10 centralized exchange listings, while BlockDAG’s momentum feels unstoppable. What sets BlockDAG apart is its balance between traction and forward visibility. Analysts are now projecting a $1 price in 2025, a jump that would reflect both its growing ecosystem and scalable architecture. With over 200 dApps to be developed under its Hackathon partnership and a clear roadmap in place to expand its ecosystem, BlockDAG’s price outlook is backed by substance. BlockDAG checks every box: real user adoption, consistent presale growth, and a realistic path to major market milestones. The $600 million goal isn’t just within reach—it’s becoming a matter of how soon. The Bottom Line The dramatic drop in Pi Coin sentiment has cast doubt on the project’s community strength, highlighting the risks of hype without sustained engagement. In contrast, the Chainlink technical analysis points to a potential breakout, signaling an opportunity if key resistance levels are broken. Both stories reflect the volatility that continues to define crypto. But one project is breaking through the noise. BlockDAG’s record-breaking presale, surging adoption, and steady progress toward its $600 million goal make it a standout crypto in 2025. BlockDAG has raised $206.5 million in presale and momentum is building across due to its fast-growing holder base. This isn’t hype, it’s execution at scale, and that’s what makes it the best crypto to buy now .

In an interview with Bloomberg Television, Elizabeth, who represents Massachusetts in the Senate, said, “Nobody is safe, not even the chairman of the Federal Reserve,” and warned that Trump’s interpretation of executive power means “all the power belongs to the king.” Elizabeth made the statement in Washington, D.C., just hours after Powell met with Treasury and Fed officials on the inflation trajectory. She accused Trump of overstepping legal limits to fire officials from independent agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which Elizabeth helped set up after the 2008 crash. “If he can just mow through every civil servant,” she said, “it’s a form of lawlessness.” She believes the president’s actions violate federal law. Warren hits Powell’s record and calls out Musk’s mass firings Elizabeth reminded Bloomberg that she had opposed Powell’s reappointment by former president Joe Biden, pointing to Powell’s support for loosening financial rules. She accused Powell of siding with Wall Street interests and warned that deregulating the banking sector would eventually hurt everyday people. Still, she said she supported the Fed’s independence and that of agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and Inspectors General, who have all been targeted under Trump’s return to power. During the same interview, Elizabeth called out Trump and Elon Musk for firing massive numbers of federal workers and terminating government contracts. She called it “lawlessness” and said it could destabilize the system designed to protect both markets and workers. She added that cutting rules that protect investors would wreck confidence in U.S. markets, saying, “The reason our stock market is so valuable is in part because it has level, transparent rules that are strictly enforced.” She also targeted Paul Atkins, who Trump wants to install as the new chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Elizabeth blamed Paul for voting in favor of weaker regulations before the financial crash of 2008 and said he hadn’t learned anything since then. “He had the chance to have 20-20 hindsight,” she said. “He has 20-zero hindsight.” Elizabeth, one of the Senate’s most outspoken progressives, also took aim at Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer for backing down on a procedural move that could have blocked a Republican spending bill earlier this month. That bill kept the government open, but many Democrats wanted to use the moment to push back against Musk’s federal firings. Elizabeth said: “I think there’s a moment when you stand and fight. We cannot avoid this fight, because Donald Trump and Elon Musk, truly they want to take this country over for just a handful of people and they want even more wealth and power to go to them while everybody else has to pay for it.” Bostic cuts forecast as tariffs drag inflation outlook While the political fights played out in Washington, Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, appeared on Monday in a Bloomberg interview and lowered his rate-cut forecast. Earlier this year, Raphael had expected two rate cuts in 2025. Now he’s predicting just one, citing Trump’s tariffs as the key reason. “I moved to one mainly because I think we’re going to see inflation be very bumpy and not move dramatically and in a clear way to the 2% target,” he said. Raphael now expects inflation to settle around the Fed’s 2% target sometime in early 2027, which is even later than the Fed’s own projection in September 2024, when officials thought 2026 was more realistic. This adjustment aligns with the Fed’s most recent forecast, issued last week. Despite Raphael’s cautious tone, the Fed still says it sees a half-point rate cut coming this year, which would mean two reductions of 25 basis points. But that number is just the median. A closer look shows that more officials now expect either one cut or none at all next year. Trump demands immediate rate cuts as Powell hesitates Trump, meanwhile, wants rate cuts now. During a Cabinet meeting at the White House this week, he said, “Generally, prices are coming down, and energy prices are coming down, and I hope the Fed lowers interest rates, and then you get to see interest rates coming down.” Last week, he also posted online that the Fed should start slashing now before his new tariffs kick in on April 2. Those tariffs are already affecting the Fed’s inflation models, according to Jerome Powell, who acknowledged that rising trade costs are being considered in their economic forecasts. But the Fed isn’t moving just yet. Officials are still waiting for more data, even though investors are growing restless. The Fed’s latest inflation report showed slower price increases for both consumer and producer goods in February, but deeper numbers suggest the central bank’s 2% inflation goal could be delayed. The biggest problem is Trump’s trade policy, which throws uncertainty into every model Powell’s team is working with. Rick Rieder, Chief Investment Officer for Global Fixed Income at BlackRock, said on Wednesday, “Uncertainty was a highlight of the statement.” He explained that both the market and the Fed are stuck in limbo and need time to figure out what to do next. Powell told reporters that the Fed has to stick with earlier projections for now, saying, “There is a level of inertia” until more clarity emerges. But time might be running out, especially if Trump’s tariff policies escalate through the summer. There’s also concern that the Fed might cut rates for the wrong reason — not because inflation is easing, but because growth is slowing and the job market is weakening. That would signal weakness, not strength, and investors may not like what comes next. Ken Mahoney, CEO of Mahoney Asset Management, told Yahoo Finance on Thursday: “Everybody wants two cuts, three cuts, four cuts. You don’t want any cuts. You want earnings growth. You want a strong economy. Be careful what you wish for.” Even though Powell has held a more hawkish line, markets still priced in three rate cuts by the end of this year, up from two. That shift was reported by Bloomberg, based on traders reacting to the latest projections. But Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird, warned that none of it might play out as expected. He said the Fed’s forecast models — especially the dot plot — haven’t exactly nailed it over the last five years. “The ‘dot plot’ and [the Fed’s] projections have not been super reliable over the last five years,” he said. He pointed to political chaos and economic confusion as reasons not to trust the numbers. “When the path forward is so unclear,” Ross said, “you just take it with a grain of salt, go back to basics, and focus on the drivers of either the individual equities or the sectors in the market that you own. In this case, thinking about things like earnings and long rates, rather than what the Fed is doing at the short end of the curve.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Recent data reveals a noteworthy shift in the digital asset landscape. As cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) gain popularity, global banks are seemingly adjusting their strategies, leading to a decrease in their direct cryptocurrency holdings. Let’s dive into this intriguing development and understand what it means for the future of finance and crypto. Why are Global Banks’ Crypto Holdings Declining? The ETF Effect The primary driver behind this shift appears to be the rise of crypto ETFs impact . These investment vehicles offer a regulated and perhaps more palatable way for institutional investors, including banks, to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly holding the underlying assets. Instead of managing the complexities and security risks associated with direct spot cryptocurrency holdings , banks can now invest in ETFs that track the performance of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Consider these points to understand the ETF effect: Ease of Access: ETFs are traded on traditional stock exchanges, making them easily accessible through existing brokerage accounts. This simplifies the investment process for banks accustomed to traditional financial instruments. Regulatory Comfort: Regulated ETFs provide a layer of compliance and oversight that might be more comfortable for risk-averse institutions like banks, especially compared to the often-murky waters of direct crypto custody. Diversification within Crypto: Crypto ETFs can offer diversified exposure to the crypto market, reducing the risk associated with holding individual cryptocurrencies. Liquidity: ETFs offer high liquidity, allowing banks to easily buy and sell their crypto exposure as needed, which might be less straightforward with direct cryptocurrency holdings. The Numbers Speak: A Snapshot of Banks’ Crypto Holdings Decline According to a CoinDesk report, citing data from the Basel Committee crypto on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the numbers clearly illustrate this downward trend. In the second quarter of 2024, an estimated 29 banks worldwide held $368.3 billion in cryptocurrencies. While this figure might seem substantial, it’s crucial to look at it in context. The proportion of spot cryptocurrency holdings within these banks’ overall assets is currently less than 3%. This figure represents a significant decline when compared to earlier periods, although specific historical data for direct comparison within the article is limited. To put this in perspective, let’s consider the BCBS’s recommendation: BCBS Recommendation: Back in December 2022, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision advised that banks’ spot cryptocurrency holdings should ideally not exceed 2% of their total assets. Current Status: While the current proportion is “less than 3%”, it’s important to note that it’s still slightly above the recommended threshold from 2022. However, the direction of travel is clearly downwards, indicating banks are actively managing their direct crypto exposure. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and Regulatory Influence The Basel Committee crypto on Banking Supervision plays a pivotal role in setting global standards for the regulation of banks. Their recommendations, although not legally binding in every jurisdiction, carry significant weight and influence how global banks crypto approach digital assets. Key aspects of BCBS’s influence include: Risk Management Framework: BCBS provides guidelines for banks to assess and manage the risks associated with crypto assets. This framework encourages a cautious approach, particularly towards volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Capital Requirements: The committee’s recommendations often include guidelines on capital requirements for banks holding crypto assets. Higher capital requirements can make holding certain crypto assets less attractive from a capital efficiency perspective. Promoting Stability: BCBS’s primary objective is to enhance financial stability globally. Their cautious stance on direct banks crypto holdings decline reflects a broader concern about the potential risks that cryptocurrencies could pose to the traditional banking system. Guidance Evolution: It’s important to note that the regulatory landscape is constantly evolving. As the crypto market matures and becomes more integrated with traditional finance, BCBS’s guidance and recommendations are likely to adapt as well. What Does This Trend Mean for the Future of Crypto and Banks? The observed banks crypto holdings decline , coupled with the rise of crypto ETFs, signals an evolving trend in how traditional financial institutions are engaging with the cryptocurrency space. It’s not necessarily a retreat from crypto, but rather a strategic shift towards potentially less risky and more regulatory-compliant avenues for exposure. Here’s a look at the potential implications: Mainstream Adoption via ETFs: Crypto ETFs could become a primary vehicle for mainstream and institutional crypto adoption, channeling investment through regulated and familiar structures. Shift in Bank Strategy: Banks might focus more on offering crypto-related services, such as custody solutions for ETFs or advisory services, rather than directly holding large amounts of volatile cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets. Regulatory Clarity and Growth: As regulations surrounding crypto ETFs and digital assets become clearer globally, we could see further growth in these regulated crypto investment products. Continued Bank Interest in Blockchain: While direct crypto holdings might decrease, banks’ interest in blockchain technology and its applications is likely to remain strong, as they explore use cases beyond just cryptocurrency investments. Conclusion: Navigating the Evolving Crypto-Banking Landscape The data indicating a decline in global banks crypto direct holdings is a significant development, highlighting the dynamic interplay between traditional finance and the burgeoning cryptocurrency market. The surge in popularity of crypto ETFs impact appears to be a key catalyst, offering banks a different, potentially more palatable route to participate in the crypto space. As the regulatory landscape continues to mature and crypto ETFs gain further traction, it will be fascinating to observe how banks crypto holdings decline trend evolves and shapes the future of institutional crypto adoption. This isn’t necessarily a bearish signal for crypto; instead, it may represent a strategic recalibration as banks navigate the complexities and opportunities presented by digital assets in a rapidly changing financial world.

While fluctuations are inevitable, some altcoins are breaking barriers with real-world applications and cutting-edge innovations. Qubetics (TICS), Arbitrum (ARB), and Gala (GALA) are at the forefront, making waves with major updates. Arbitrum DAO is debating whether to withdraw funding from its Gaming Catalyst Program due to concerns over transparency. Meanwhile, Gala Games has introduced staking for its native token, giving its 1.5 million users a new way to engage with the ecosystem. These moves could reshape their respective communities, but one project is standing out for its ability to solve long-standing issues in blockchain utility—Qubetics. Qubetics ($TICS) isn’t just another crypto token; it’s a powerful force in Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization. By transforming physical assets into digital tokens, Qubetics unlocks liquidity, broadens market accessibility, and simplifies asset ownership. Qubetics: Pioneering Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics is revolutionizing asset ownership by digitizing real-world assets on the blockchain. This means that traditionally illiquid assets, such as luxury real estate, can be fractionally owned, bought, or sold in a seamless, borderless manner. For decades, investing in high-value assets required substantial capital and extensive legal processes. Qubetics eliminates these barriers by allowing asset tokenization. For instance, instead of needing millions to own a stake in a prime real estate property, a user can buy fractional tokens that represent small portions of the property’s value. With a presale price of $0.1300 and a projected ROI of 669% at $1, Qubetics is rapidly gaining traction among enterprises, developers, and blockchain enthusiasts who recognize its long-term potential. With over $15.5 million raised, more than 503 million $TICS tokens sold, and 23,800+ token holders already on board, this is no ordinary presale. Currently in its 27th stage, the price is still accessible, but every phase sees an increase, meaning those who act now are locking in the lowest possible cost before the token hits the open market, one of the best altcoins to invest in now. What a $1,000 Investment Looks Like Right Now At the current crypto presale price of $0.1300, a $1,000 investment secures 7,692 $TICS tokens. If Qubetics hits $1, that $1,000 turns into $7,692. At $5 per $TICS, the same investment skyrockets to $38,460, and if Qubetics reaches $10, the value explodes to $76,920. With over 503 million tokens already sold, every passing stage sees an increase in price, reducing the potential returns for those who hesitate. Qubetics isn’t waiting for mainstream adoption—it’s building the infrastructure that will drive it. Blockchain interoperability isn’t a future dream; it’s happening now. Those securing $TICS at this stage are positioning themselves for what could be one of the most explosive blockchain transformations of the decade. Arbitrum (ARB): Governance & Security Challenges Arbitrum, a leading Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, is facing governance and security concerns. The Arbitrum DAO is debating whether to withdraw funding from its Gaming Catalyst Program, which allocated 225 million ARB tokens to support Web3 gaming. Transparency concerns have led to calls for reallocating the funds to one of the best altcoins to invest in now. On March 10, 2025, a vulnerability in Arbitrum’s signature verification system led to unauthorized transactions and a loss of $140,000. The issue has been addressed, but it highlights the importance of ongoing security enhancements. This incident serves as a stark reminder that even established blockchain networks must continuously evolve to stay ahead of potential threats. Gala (GALA): Staking & User Engagement Gala Games is taking a major step forward in its blockchain gaming ecosystem with the introduction of staking options for GALA tokens. With over 1.5 million active players and 21 developed games, this new feature is set to reshape how participants interact with the platform. By allowing token holders to lock up their assets in exchange for rewards, staking is expected to drive higher demand for GALA by reducing its circulating supply one of the best altcoins to invest in now. This move also strengthens user engagement by encouraging long-term holding, ultimately fostering a more sustainable and robust token economy. As more players and developers recognize the benefits of staking, Gala Games continues to solidify its position as a leader in blockchain gaming, ensuring a thriving ecosystem that benefits both gamers and token holders alike. Analyst projections for GALA vary. CoinCodex predicts a potential rise to $0.63998 by April 2025, while Changelly suggests a possible 1.1% decrease by March 26, 2025. Regardless of short-term fluctuations, Gala’s commitment to expansion remains strong. Conclusion Qubetics, Arbitrum, and Gala are shaping the crypto market in distinct ways. While Arbitrum navigates governance and security challenges, and Gala introduces new staking mechanisms, Qubetics is forging a future where real-world assets seamlessly integrate with blockchain technology. For those seeking the best altcoins to invest in now , staying informed on these evolving projects could unlock exciting opportunities. With Qubetics’ presale gaining momentum, Arbitrum refining its governance, and Gala enhancing its staking ecosystem, these three altcoins remain pivotal players in the crypto space.

42456336,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143644,1743042049,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Call: Crypto Firms Demand DOJ Clarity on Money Transmitter Rules,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-firms-doj-clarity-rules/,"Is the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) casting a shadow over the future of crypto innovation? Over 30 leading crypto firms are raising serious concerns about the DOJ’s interpretation of money transmitter rules, arguing it could stifle development and push innovation overseas. Let’s dive into why these companies are ringing alarm bells and what it means for the future of decentralized finance (DeFi). Why are Crypto Firms Calling for DOJ Clarity on Money Transmitter Rules? At the heart of the issue is Section 1960, a statute designed to combat illegal money transmitting. While its original intent is clear, crypto firms argue that the DOJ is applying an overly broad interpretation, particularly in cases like the recent Tornado Cash sanctions. This broad interpretation, spearheaded by the DOJ, is seen as a significant departure from established FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) guidelines, creating a murky legal landscape for developers, especially those working on non-custodial software. Here’s a breakdown of the key concerns: Threat to Non-Custodial Software: The DOJ’s stance is perceived as a direct threat to developers of non-custodial software. Non-custodial software is crucial for DeFi, empowering users to maintain control of their own digital assets. If developers are deemed money transmitters simply for creating and distributing this software, it could severely hamper innovation. Bypassing FinCEN Guidance: FinCEN is the primary regulatory body for money transmission in the U.S. The crypto industry feels the DOJ is bypassing FinCEN’s more nuanced approach, creating regulatory confusion and uncertainty. Legal Uncertainty and Innovation Chill: The lack of legal clarity is creating a chilling effect. Firms are hesitant to invest and innovate in the U.S. when the legal boundaries are unclear and potentially punitive. This could lead to an exodus of crypto talent and development to more welcoming jurisdictions. In a strongly worded letter to Congress, spearheaded by the DeFi Education Fund, these crypto firms are urging lawmakers to step in and provide much-needed clarification. They are seeking a clear legislative intent that explicitly protects U.S.-based crypto and DeFi development from overly aggressive interpretations of money transmitter laws. The Tornado Cash Case: A Lightning Rod for Concerns The Tornado Cash saga is a prime example of why the industry is so concerned. Tornado Cash, a decentralized privacy tool, was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department, with implications extending to developers who contributed to its code. The DOJ’s approach in this case has been interpreted by many as equating software code with money transmission itself. This is a dangerous precedent, according to industry experts, as it could criminalize the very act of writing and sharing open-source code. What are the Potential Ramifications of Vague DOJ Money Transmitter Rules? The consequences of the DOJ’s broad interpretation of DOJ money transmitter rules could be far-reaching and detrimental to the U.S. crypto industry. Let’s consider some potential outcomes: Ramification Description Innovation Stifled Fear of prosecution could discourage developers from building and deploying innovative DeFi applications and non-custodial tools within the U.S. Brain Drain Crypto talent and businesses may relocate to countries with clearer and more favorable regulatory frameworks, diminishing the U.S.’s position in the global crypto landscape. Reduced Competitiveness U.S.-based crypto firms could become less competitive compared to their international counterparts operating in more innovation-friendly environments. Hindered DeFi Growth The development and adoption of DeFi, a sector with immense potential for financial inclusion and innovation, could be significantly hampered. The Call for Action: Seeking Legislative Solutions for Legal Clarity The crypto industry’s plea is clear: they need Congress to step in and provide legal clarity . This isn’t just about protecting crypto firms ; it’s about fostering innovation, ensuring the U.S. remains a leader in technological advancement, and allowing the responsible growth of the digital asset ecosystem. The letter to Congress is a proactive step, urging lawmakers to: Clarify Legislative Intent: Explicitly define the scope of Section 1960 to ensure it doesn’t inadvertently target software developers and non-custodial technology providers. Reinforce FinCEN’s Role: Reaffirm FinCEN as the primary regulatory authority for money transmission within the crypto space, ensuring a consistent and expert-led approach. Promote Innovation-Friendly Regulation: Develop a regulatory framework that balances consumer protection and compliance with the need to encourage innovation and technological progress in the crypto sector. What’s Next? The Path to Regulatory Certainty for Crypto and DeFi The coming months will be crucial. Will Congress heed the call from crypto firms and take action to provide the necessary legal clarity ? The response will not only shape the future of the U.S. crypto industry but also send a powerful message about the nation’s commitment to innovation and technological leadership. The industry is watching closely, hoping for a positive resolution that fosters growth and ensures the U.S. remains at the forefront of the digital asset revolution. The demand for DOJ money transmitter rules clarification is not just about compliance; it’s about creating an environment where innovation can flourish, where developers feel safe to build, and where the U.S. can harness the transformative potential of crypto and DeFi.

Bitcoin Accumulation Rises Among Whales In an X post published today, seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted a notable increase in BTC whale activity. He shared the following chart showing that 48 new wallets now hold 100 or more BTC. A surge in whale accumulation often signals rising confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. The leading digital asset has climbed over 15% from its March 10 low of approximately $76,600. As of writing, BTC is trading in the high $80,000s. Related Reading: Bitcoin Surge Fueled by $32B in Open Interest—Here’s What Could Happen Next Renewed optimism around BTC’s price trajectory stems from several recent macroeconomic developments, including cooler than expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data for February and reports of US President Donald Trump adopting a softer stance on retaliatory tariffs scheduled to go into effect from April 2. On-chain intelligence firm Arkham reported long-dormant BTC whales becoming active again. In an X post, the firm highlighted how a wallet that held $3 million worth of BTC in 2017, recently became active after 8 years, with its holdings now valued at close to $250 million. Fellow crypto analyst Crypto Rover shared the following chart, illustrating a sharp rise in whale accumulation since late 2024. It is worth noting that the data excludes wallets tied to non-US exchanges and US Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Is BTC Eyeing A New Record High? Several crypto analysts believe BTC may have already bottomed out this cycle and entered a new bullish phase, potentially setting the stage for a fresh all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Bullish Pattern Returns – Is A Massive Uptrend Imminent? Noted crypto entrepreneur and former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes recently suggested that BTC ‘probably’ hit this cycle’s bottom during the March 10 dip to $76,600. Hayes added that while bottom may be in for BTC, stocks could still face further downside. Momentum indicators – such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) – also appear bullish. Bitcoin’s daily RSI recently broke out of a multi-month downtrend, fuelling hopes of sustained upward momentum. Additionally, Martinez projected that BTC could surge to $112,000 if it decisively breaks the $94,000 resistance level. However, a drop below $76,000 could open the door to a deeper decline, potentially falling to $58,000. Moreover, in their latest investor memo, digital asset management firm Bitwise hinted that on a risk-adjusted basis, now could be an opportune time to buy BTC. As of press time, BTC is trading at $88,069, up 1% in the last 24 hours.

42456727,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143655,1743042646,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Leak: Chinese AI Censorship Machine Exposed,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/chinese-ai-censorship-machine-exposed/,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency and digital freedom, the specter of censorship looms large. Imagine a world where even the subtlest dissent is flagged, where algorithms decide what you can and cannot see. This isn’t a dystopian fantasy; it’s the reality emerging from a massive data leak exposing China’s sophisticated AI Censorship Machine . Bitcoin World’s exclusive investigation reveals how China is supercharging its censorship capabilities using advanced AI, raising profound questions about digital rights and the future of online freedom globally. Are we on the brink of a new era of AI-powered authoritarianism? Let’s dive into the shocking details. Unveiling the Chinese AI Censorship Machine: A Data Leak Revelation A recently leaked database, uncovered by security researcher NetAskari and analyzed by Bitcoin World, paints a chilling picture of China’s escalating efforts to control online narratives. This isn’t just about blocking keywords like ‘Tiananmen Square’; it’s a leap into a new era of AI powered censorship . The data exposes a system trained on a staggering 133,000 examples of content deemed ‘sensitive’ by the Chinese government. What kind of content triggers these alarms? Social Unrest Indicators: Complaints about poverty, corruption, and labor disputes are flagged as ‘highest priority’. Political Satire: Even subtle jokes or historical analogies targeting current political figures are instantly flagged. Taiwan and Military Matters: Any mention of Taiwan politics, military movements, or weaponry is heavily scrutinized. Public Protests Triggers: Issues like pollution and food safety scandals, known to spark public demonstrations, are closely monitored. This isn’t just keyword filtering; this is a sophisticated LLM censorship China system designed to understand context and nuance, making it far more effective than traditional methods. Xiao Qiang, a UC Berkeley researcher specializing in Chinese censorship, confirms this, stating it’s “clear evidence” of the Chinese government using LLMs to enhance repression. He emphasizes the increased “efficiency and granularity of state-led information control” compared to human-labor-intensive methods. How Does This AI Censorship Machine Work? The leaked data reveals a system eerily similar to prompting ChatGPT. It tasks an unnamed Large Language Model (LLM) to assess content for sensitivity related to ‘politics, social life, and the military.’ Content deemed sensitive is flagged as ‘highest priority.’ The system’s creators are clearly leveraging the power of AI to automate and refine censorship at an unprecedented scale. Key Features of the AI Censorship System: Feature Description LLM Powered Utilizes a Large Language Model for content analysis, moving beyond simple keyword filtering. Extensive Training Data Trained on 133,000 examples of ‘sensitive’ content, ensuring comprehensive coverage. Prioritization Ranks flagged content by priority, focusing on ‘highest priority’ items for immediate action. Proactive Detection Aims to detect subtle dissent and nuanced criticism, not just blatant violations. The system’s goal, according to the data, is for ‘public opinion work’ – a term experts identify as Chinese government jargon for censorship and propaganda. Michael Caster from Article 19 explains this ‘public opinion work’ is managed by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), with the aim of enforcing government narratives online and eliminating dissenting voices. President Xi Jinping himself has called the internet the “frontline” of this ‘public opinion work.’ Examples of Censored Content: Glimpse into the Database Bitcoin World analyzed representative samples from the 133,000 data points, revealing the breadth of content targeted by this Chinese AI Censorship system. These examples provide a stark look at what the Chinese government deems unacceptable for public consumption: Rural Poverty: Posts lamenting the decline of rural Chinese towns and the struggles of remaining residents. Local Corruption: Complaints from business owners about police extortion and corruption. CCP Corruption: News reports about Communist Party officials expelled for corruption and ‘superstitions’. Taiwan Military Analysis: Commentary on Taiwan’s military capabilities and Chinese military developments. Subtle Political Criticism: Anecdotes using idioms to indirectly criticize power dynamics and political transitions. The sheer volume of mentions of ‘Taiwan’ (台湾) – over 15,000 times – highlights the extreme sensitivity surrounding this topic. Even subtle forms of dissent, like using idioms to comment on power transitions, are targeted, demonstrating the system’s sophistication and reach. The Broader Implications: AI Censorship Globally This leak isn’t just about China. It’s a warning sign for digital freedom worldwide. The adoption of AI Censorship Machine technology by authoritarian regimes is accelerating. OpenAI itself reported catching Chinese entities using LLMs to track and smear dissidents. This trend signifies a dangerous shift towards more efficient and pervasive digital repression. Key Takeaways: Escalating AI Repression: Authoritarian governments are rapidly adopting AI to enhance censorship and surveillance. Beyond Keyword Blocking: AI-powered censorship is far more sophisticated, capable of understanding context and nuance. Global Implications: This technology could be exported and adopted by other regimes, further shrinking digital freedom. Urgent Need for Scrutiny: We must critically examine the ethical and human rights implications of AI-driven censorship. The Future of Digital Freedom: Fighting Back Against AI Censorship As China AI Surveillance capabilities grow, so too must our vigilance and efforts to protect digital freedom. Understanding how these AI censorship systems operate is the first step. Supporting organizations that fight for online freedom and privacy is crucial. The fight for a free and open internet is becoming increasingly complex, but it’s a fight we cannot afford to lose. This data leak serves as a stark reminder: the battle for online freedom is ongoing, and the stakes are higher than ever. The rise of AI-powered censorship demands our attention, our action, and our unwavering commitment to a free and open digital world.

Aljarrah and Farina pointed to rising credit card defaults, tightening lending standards, and increasing living costs as indicators of a weakening financial system. Aljarrah highlighted a trend among the wealthy, moving capital into tangible assets such as gold, silver, and natural resources. He argued that fiat currencies are deliberately devalued, forcing individuals to liquidate assets. The Role of Blockchain in the New Financial System They examined the relationship between stablecoins and CBDCs, proposing a future where a two-tier banking system incorporates asset-backed digital currencies pegged to real-world commodities. They emphasized the importance of XRP and XLM in this two-tier monetary system , referencing documents from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding trust bridges , which could play a role in this transition. According to them, the existing system collapses while a new digital framework is being constructed. Digital assets like XRP and XLM, including gold and silver, will play critical roles in this transition. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This comes just a day after the company revealed its Bitcoin (BTC) treasury strategy. Gamestop To Raise $1.3B Through Convertible Notes The company plans to issue $1.3 billion in convertible senior notes, targeting qualified institutional buyers, with a five-year maturity. It also granted the initial purchasers a 13-day option to buy up to an additional $200 million in notes, bringing the potential total raise to $1.5 billion. The notes will carry a 0% coupon and will mature on April 1, 2030, unless converted, redeemed, or repurchased earlier. GameStop plans to use the funds raised from the offering for general corporate purposes, including buying bitcoin in line with its Investment Policy. GME Follows MSTR’s Strategy With this move, GameStop joins companies like Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy (MSTR), Semler Scientific (SMLR), Marathon Digital (MARA), and Riot Platforms (RIOT), which have also issued convertible debt to fund bitcoin purchases. Michael Saylor initiated a poll on X, asking how much bitcoin GameStop needs to buy to gain respect from Bitcoiners. 1B at least pic.twitter.com/SBsT1b8fxZ — Alex (@AlexesNakamoto) March 26, 2025 GME Stock Dips 8% However, GameStop (GME) stock dropped over 8% in after-hours trading Wednesday after the company revealed plans to raise funds for Bitcoin. This follows a 12% surge in GameStop shares just a day earlier when the company announced that its board had unanimously approved adding Bitcoin to its treasury reserve assets. Concerns about potential share dilution could have led to the drop. However, like MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy boosted MSTR, GameStop’s move could drive long-term growth for its stock. Bitcoin has bounced back from its earlier lows, rising to $87,000 after briefly dipping to $86,000. GameStop’s planned Bitcoin investment follows reports from CNBC a month earlier that the company was exploring cryptocurrency. The interest in crypto was further fueled by CEO Ryan Cohen’s post with MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor, who holds over 447,000 Bitcoins. Wall Street Skeptical Over The Move While MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin bet has boosted its stock by 84% over the past year, Wall Street remains skeptical about GameStop’s move.

The SEC’s decision not to challenge the 2023 ruling by U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres brings much-needed clarity to the question of whether XRP should be classified as a security. Judge’s Ruling on XRP Sales Judge Torres had previously ruled that Ripple’s “programmatic sales” of XRP on secondary exchanges did not violate securities laws. However, the direct sale of XRP to institutional investors was found to be in violation of securities regulations. With the SEC choosing not to appeal, this ruling stands as a key precedent in the cryptocurrency space. Settlement Details: SEC Returns $75 Million As part of the settlement, the SEC has agreed to return $75 million of the $125 million fine originally imposed on Ripple by a New York judge in 2022, leaving $50 million to settle the case. Ripple’s Future Sales to Institutional Investors Amid the excitement, one user on X (formerly Twitter) commented that the lifting of the SEC’s injunction would now allow Ripple to sell directly to institutional investors. The user said that while Ripple would still need to adhere to securities laws, it would no longer be required to go through over-the-counter (OTC) desks and could sell directly to entities like hedge funds or private equity firms. Clarification from Former SEC Attorney However, former SEC attorney Marc Fagel clarified that while the injunction is lifted, the original ruling that Ripple’s sales to institutional investors violated the law still stands. I haven't gone back to revisit the order. But to the extent any future sales are sold in similar fashion as the institutional sales described in the order, they would continue to pose problems under Section 5 (at least if the SEC were still invested in the case). — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) March 25, 2025 Fagel explained that while the SEC will no longer pursue enforcement of the case, Ripple’s sales to institutional investors may still face legal challenges under Section 5 of the Securities Act if they are conducted in a similar manner as before. Impact on Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity Product When asked about the impact on Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product, Fagel responded that the ruling would likely alleviate some of the restrictions Ripple faced, particularly regarding how it could sell XRP. However, he warned that if Ripple were to resume sales in the same manner as those deemed illegal, it could still face legal issues, though the SEC would no longer actively pursue enforcement.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|XRP|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-27 02:55:14

Blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence said in a March 26 post to X that the trader attempted to manipulate the system to profit from price movements, withdrawing collateral before Hyperliquid’s liquidation system could catch up. The trader opened three accounts within five minutes of each other, two with $2.15 million and $1.9 million long positions, and the third a $4.1 million short, to cancel out the long positions , according to Arkham in a post-mortem report. “This allowed him to build up leverage in an attempt to drain funds from Hyperliquid,” Arkham said. Source: Arkham When the price of Jelly pumped by over 400%, the $4 million short position entered liquidation, but the open short didn’t liquidate immediately because it was too large and instead passed to the Hyperliquidity Provider Vault (HLP), which is supposed to liquidate the position. At the same time, the trader withdrew collateral from the other two accounts while having a “7-figure positive PnL to withdraw from,” Arkham said. However, the “exploiter” quickly hit a wall when the accounts, which still had millions in unrealized profit and loss, were restricted to reduce-only orders, forcing them to sell the tokens in the first account on the market to recoup some of the funds. Source: Arkham Hyperliquid eventually closed the Jelly token market at a price of 0.0095, the same price as the trader’s short trade, which “zeroed out all floating PnL on the first two exploiter accounts.” In total, Arkham says the trader withdrew $6.26 million, but at least $1 million is still in the accounts. “Assuming he can withdraw this at some point in the future, his actions on Hyperliquid have cost him a total of $4,000. If he is unable to, he faces a loss of almost $1 million,” the blockchain analytics firm said. Hyperliquid has since delisted perpetual futures tied to the JELLY token , citing evidence of suspicious market activity. Other traders have been using similar tactics This isn’t the first time Hyperliquid has had issues like this. On March 14, Hyperliquid increased margin requirements for traders after its liquidity pool lost millions of dollars during a massive Ether ( ETH ) liquidation.

F. Sharapov Russian Economic Society and a Doctor of Economics. Russian Economist: Strategic Bitcoin Reserves Talk ‘Like Laying Landmines’ Katasonov said he was concerned about the need for Russia “to take a cautious approach” to the idea of “creating a crypto reserve.” Valentin Katasonov, the Chairman of the S. F. Sharapov Russian Economic Society. (Source: Ministerstvo Idey/YouTube/Screenshot) The economist used an allegory to explain his point of view, equating creating a national crypto reserve to “laying landmines” in Russia. Katasonov claimed that cryptoassets were “not fully fledged” forms of “money,” but “rather speculative tools that can pose threats to the economy.” “[Talk about creating strategic crypto reserves] is way of inflating bubbles. If the bubble bursts, everything will be fine as long as the economy holds up. But, regardless, there will still be many victims.” Katasonov Stores selling Russian products have spread across China, and now Moscow is seizing on the interest with a plan for a major expansion of its own https://t.co/QYYmkpu6rv — Bloomberg (@business) March 26, 2025 Economist: ‘Russian Crypto Advocates Are Fifth Columnists’ Katasonov hit out at crypto advocates who call for the “introduction of tokens” into “the official economic system.” He called them “fifth columnists,” and suggested they intended to “undermine the country’s economic security.” A Central Bank office building in Moscow, Russia. (Source: Dzasohovich [CC BY-SA 4.0]) The economist also cast doubt on other countries’ plans to launch strategic Bitcoin reserves. He noted that “while some countries, such as the United States, are considering creating Bitcoin (BTC) reserves,” the process was “still far from practical implementation.” Katasonov concluded that “no country” in the world has yet “had a successful experience launching official crypto reserves.” Some critics may point to the example of El Salvador, whose government embarked on a bullish program of Bitcoin buying in 2021. However, in recent months, the question of El Salvador’s BTC-purchasing has come under the spotlight of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which disaproves of the nation’s Bitcoin pivot.

Think again! Recent data has revealed a surprising reality: the vast majority of Bitcoin trading and Ethereum trading actually happens outside of U.S. borders. Let’s dive into this eye-opening data and explore why the global stage is stealing the spotlight when it comes to crypto. The Shocking Numbers: US Exchanges Play a Smaller Role Than You Think According to a recent report from Unfolded, powered by data from Kaiko, the numbers are quite stark. Only a small fraction of global Ethereum trading and Bitcoin trading volume originates from exchanges based in the United States. Specifically: Ethereum (ETH) Trading: A mere 8.6% of global ETH trading volume occurs on U.S. exchanges. Bitcoin (BTC) Trading: Slightly higher, but still surprisingly low, at 11.5% of global BTC trading volume on U.S. platforms. These figures paint a clear picture: the crypto market is truly global, and the lion’s share of activity is happening elsewhere. But where exactly, and why is this the case? Where is the Real Crypto Action Happening? Exploring Global Markets If the U.S. isn’t the primary hub for crypto exchanges , then where is all the trading volume concentrated? The data suggests a much more distributed landscape, with significant activity in regions like: Asia: Exchanges in Asia, particularly in countries like South Korea, Singapore, and Hong Kong, have historically been major players in the crypto space. Their early adoption and large tech-savvy populations contribute to substantial trading volumes. Europe: European exchanges are also gaining prominence, with regions like Eastern Europe and countries with favorable crypto regulations attracting significant trading activity. Emerging Markets: Countries in Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia are increasingly embracing cryptocurrencies as alternative financial tools, leading to growing trading volumes in these regions. This global distribution highlights the decentralized nature of the cryptocurrency market itself. Unlike traditional finance, which is often centered around major financial hubs like New York or London, crypto operates on a worldwide stage. Why Are US Exchanges Losing Ground in Crypto Trading? Several factors contribute to the relatively smaller share of Bitcoin trading and Ethereum trading volume on US exchanges . Let’s break down some key reasons: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the United States remains somewhat unclear and fragmented. This uncertainty can create hurdles for crypto exchanges operating in the US, potentially driving some trading activity to more favorably regulated jurisdictions. Stringent Compliance Requirements: U.S. regulations are known to be rigorous, requiring significant compliance efforts and costs for crypto exchanges . These stringent requirements can make it more challenging and expensive to operate in the U.S. compared to some other regions. Global Crypto Adoption: Cryptocurrency adoption is a global phenomenon. Many regions outside the U.S. have seen rapid crypto adoption, driven by factors like limited access to traditional banking, high inflation, and a desire for alternative financial systems. This organic growth in global adoption naturally leads to higher trading volumes outside of the US. Competition from International Exchanges: International crypto exchanges have become increasingly sophisticated and competitive, offering a wide range of services and often lower fees. This intense global competition can draw trading volume away from US-based platforms. Benefits of a Globally Distributed Crypto Market While the smaller share of US exchange volume might seem surprising, a globally distributed crypto exchanges market actually offers several benefits: Increased Resilience: Decentralization is a core tenet of crypto. A globally distributed trading market reduces reliance on any single jurisdiction, making the overall crypto ecosystem more resilient to regional regulatory changes or economic shocks. Wider Access to Crypto: With trading activity spread across various regions, individuals around the world have greater access to cryptocurrencies. This broader accessibility promotes financial inclusion and empowers individuals globally. Innovation and Competition: Global competition among crypto exchanges fosters innovation and drives improvements in services, security, and user experience. This competitive environment ultimately benefits crypto users worldwide. Reduced Regulatory Risk: Diversification across multiple jurisdictions can help mitigate regulatory risks. If one region imposes restrictive regulations, the global market can continue to function, albeit with potential shifts in trading volume. Challenges of a Globally Distributed Crypto Market Of course, a decentralized global market also presents certain challenges: Regulatory Fragmentation: The lack of harmonized global regulations can create complexities for crypto exchanges operating across multiple jurisdictions. Navigating diverse regulatory frameworks can be challenging and costly. Enforcement Issues: Cross-border enforcement of regulations and combating illicit activities in a globally distributed market can be more complex than in a centralized system. Market Fragmentation: While global distribution is beneficial, excessive fragmentation could potentially lead to liquidity issues or price discrepancies across different exchanges. However, arbitrage opportunities often help to mitigate these discrepancies. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? So, what are the key takeaways from this data, and how can you use this information? Diversify Your Exchange Usage: Don’t limit yourself to only US-based crypto exchanges . Explore reputable international platforms to potentially access a wider range of assets, features, and potentially lower fees. Stay Informed About Global Crypto Trends: Keep an eye on developments in global crypto markets , not just the US. Understanding global adoption patterns and regulatory trends can provide valuable insights into the future of crypto. Consider Regulatory Differences: Be aware of the regulatory landscape in different jurisdictions if you are trading on international crypto exchanges . Understand the compliance requirements and potential risks associated with each platform. Conclusion: The Global Crypto Revolution is Here The data is clear: the cryptocurrency market is a truly global phenomenon, with the majority of Bitcoin trading and Ethereum trading volume happening outside of the United States. This stunning revelation underscores the decentralized and international nature of crypto. While US exchanges remain important players, the future of crypto trading is undoubtedly global, offering both exciting opportunities and unique challenges. Embracing this global perspective is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies.

A flurry of factors appears to be affecting the investors’ sentiment, with recent trends and analysis indicating towards further slip ahead to about $0.6. However, despite that, experts remained bullish on the long-term trajectory of Pi Coin. Pi Network Price Slips 3%: What Lies Ahead? Pi price today was down around 3% and exchanged hands at $0.79, while its volume for the last 24 hours increased by 33% to $327 million. Notably, the crypto has touched a 24-hour low of $0.77 from yesterday, indicating the gloomy sentiment hovering in the market. Notably, an article highlighted the key reasons behind the latest Pi price dip . Amid this, market watchers anticipate a further fall ahead, with some experts predicting a slump to even $0.6. However, despite that, the market watchers remained bullish, hinting at a potential breakout ahead. Will Pi Coin Slip To $0.6? A flurry of market experts anticipates a further dip in Pi Network price due to massive token unlocks ahead. According to PiScan data, a total of 105.96 million Pi will be unlocked over the next 30 days, worth around $85 million at the current price. The daily average unlock is around 3.5 million coins. This heavy influx could significantly dampen the investors’ sentiment. Besides, a lack of clarity from the Pi Core Team has further fueled concerns. On the other hand, the lack of major listings on leading crypto exchanges like Binance, which many were anticipating, has weighed on the sentiment. Besides, looking ahead to the next 12 months, 1.6 billion Pi Coins are set to be unlocked, with an average of 129 million per month. This trend is expected to continue until May 2028, with minimal changes. To mitigate this potential price drop, Pi enthusiasts are urging the Pi Core Team to implement measures to reduce circulation, such as burning mechanisms or smart contract features. Expert Predicts Dip To $0.6: What’s Next For Pi Network? Analyst bullstraders7 on TradingView noted that Pi Network price risks falling to $0.61 or even $0.6 in the coming days. This has further dampened the market sentiment, especially with soaring anticipation over a robust rally in Pi price. However, another expert Coinvo sees this latest dip as a buying opportunity. He said that “Pi RSI divergence” is signaling towards a “massive buy signal.” Besides, he also noted that the current “Fibonacci zone” could push the crypto to a new high ahead. Source: Coinvo, X Considering this analysis, Pi Network price could hit a new high in the coming days. However, a recent Pi Coin price prediction hints at a potential drop to $0.54 by next month. Having said that, investors should exercise due diligence before putting their bets into the market.

He made it clear that cars built within the country will not be affected, saying there’s “absolutely no tariff” for them. He signed the new trade order inside the Oval Office. According to a report from CNBC, Trump formalized the tariffs through a presidential proclamation. His longtime aide, Will Scharf, told reporters at the White House that the new rule includes foreign-made light trucks too, and stacks on top of all existing duties. “Over $100 billion of new annual revenue” is what Scharf claimed this move will generate for the U.S. Trump adds pressure on auto supply chains with parts enforcement Trump didn’t offer many specifics about how it’ll work, especially considering most vehicles today are built from thousands of individual parts sourced from several different countries. Still, he told reporters the government would launch “very strong policing” to monitor which components trigger the tariffs. That means federal agents will have to track exactly which parts are foreign and where they come from—no easy task in a system where even a single sedan might carry pieces from 20 different countries. The move instantly drew backlash from Europe. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen responded within hours, saying the European Union would continue pursuing negotiations but wouldn’t roll over. “Tariffs are taxes — bad for businesses, worse for consumers equally in the US and the European Union,” she said in a formal statement Wednesday. As expected, the stock market didn’t sit still. After-hours trading saw shares of General Motors, Ford Motor, and Stellantis all drop about 5%. All three companies have some manufacturing capacity outside the U.S., even though they assemble a lot of cars within it too. Trump didn’t throw them under the bus completely. He offered GM, Ford, and Stellantis a one-month exemption from the new 25% tariff—for imports from Mexico and Canada only—if their cars qualify under the rules in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA. That deal replaces the old NAFTA structure and has stricter guidelines around regional production. The waiver is set to expire at the end of April. The announcement didn’t come out of nowhere. Trump already warned on Monday during a Cabinet meeting that auto tariffs were on the way. “We’ll be announcing that fairly soon over the next few days, probably, and then April 2 comes, that’ll be reciprocal tariffs,” he said earlier this week. The plan is part of what Trump calls his “reciprocal tariff” policy. It targets countries that impose high duties on U.S. goods but expect low barriers coming into the American market. Business executives say these surprise rollouts have made it impossible to plan ahead. Trump’s trade decisions change fast, and sometimes without notice. Even companies that support American manufacturing say they don’t know how to prepare anymore. Musk left out of decision, Tesla parts still vulnerable One person not involved in the decision was Elon Musk. Trump confirmed that himself Wednesday, telling reporters Musk “may have a conflict” and had “never asked me for a favor in business whatsoever.” Musk is Trump’s top advisor for federal operations, but this time he had no input. Musk’s involvement with the administration goes deeper than just advice. He donated $290 million to Trump’s 2024 campaign and currently leads the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which is supposed to reduce federal spending and downsize bloated agencies. Even with that power, Musk didn’t weigh in on the car tariffs, according to Trump. That didn’t stop Tesla from getting a spotlight moment this month. Trump turned the White House’s South Lawn into a temporary Tesla display, ordering five of the company’s electric vehicles to be delivered so he could walk around and inspect them. Afterward, he posted on Truth Social that he was planning to buy one himself to “support Elon” and his companies. During the walkthrough, Trump called the designs “beautiful” and pointed at the sharp, stainless-steel Cybertruck. When asked whether Tesla would benefit from the new import penalties, Trump said the effect would likely be “net neutral or they may be good.” He pointed out that Tesla has major factories in Fremont, California and Austin, Texas, and repeated that “anybody that has plants in the United States — it’s going to be good for them.” But Tesla doesn’t build everything at home. The company recently wrote to the U.S. Trade Representative warning that “even with aggressive localization” of production, certain vehicle components are “difficult or impossible to source within the United States.” The list of imported parts includes suspension systems, brake assemblies, glass, panels, printed circuit boards, and other electrical gear. A lot of these still come from Canada, Mexico, and China. Tesla isn’t the only one with that problem, but their international parts footprint puts them in a tough spot. And while the tariffs don’t directly mention Tesla, any imported part can trigger a tax. The policing that Trump promised would mean border checks could flag individual parts even if the final car is assembled in Texas. There’s also a bigger fight happening in the electric vehicle market. More automakers are building EVs now than ever before, squeezing Tesla’s dominance. But not everyone gets to play in the American sandbox. BYD, the top electric vehicle manufacturer in China, still hasn’t been allowed to sell its cars in the U.S. With Trump in office and tariffs being thrown around like darts, that’s unlikely to change anytime soon.

He drew attention to Tokentus Investment AG, a German venture capital firm actively educating its audience about XRP through detailed videos. His post contrasted the firm’s efforts with U.S. media platforms that “pretend it doesn’t exist,” fueling ongoing debates about how XRP is presented to investors globally. German financial news educating their audience on XRP while @cnbc tries to pretend it doesn't exist. We see you @SquawkCNBC @andrewrsorkin @BeckyQuick @JoeSquawk pic.twitter.com/4IsGidFT0W — Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) March 24, 2025 Tokentus Investment AG’s Educational Efforts Tokentus Investment AG has consistently shared insights on XRP through its YouTube channel, covering topics ranging from regulatory status to price movements. In one of its latest videos, the firm reiterated that XRP does not classify as a security, addressing a long-standing debate that has shaped perceptions of the asset. The discussion also explored the differences between cryptocurrencies and tokenized assets, explaining that while a tokenized stock would inherently be considered a security, XRP does not fall into the same category. By clarifying these distinctions, Tokentus aims to equip investors with a clearer understanding of XRP’s role in the financial landscape. Tokentus’s Support for XRP Beyond regulatory topics, Tokentus has continually provided detailed market insights into XRP’s price trends. CEO Oliver Michel previously examined historical data to assess the asset’s growth potential. He pointed to the asset’s 4,300% surge from 2014 to 2017, suggesting that while such extreme growth is less likely this time, a significant rally remains possible. Based on historical patterns and broader market trends, he projected that the asset could rise by 2,000% , potentially reaching $8-$10. The CEO also previously discussed XRP’s role as the world reserve bridge currency , and he has big expectations for the digital asset. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Media Coverage Disparities in the U.S. and Germany The community has long debated how the asset is portrayed in media, and Tokentus’s videos have reignited this conversation. Digital Asset Investor’s remarks suggested that German firms are actively educating investors about the asset, whereas major U.S. financial media outlets appear to downplay its significance. This view is shared by other community members, with some calling out Bitcoin maximalists. While this perspective continues to gain traction, it is worth noting that U.S. financial networks such as CNBC, Bloomberg, and FOX have covered the asset and related events, particularly legal battles involving Ripple and the SEC. High-profile interviews, including those with Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, have been featured in mainstream media platforms like 60 Minutes , though not to the level that some supporters would like.

Yeah, the meme coin market never sleeps. Every week, something goes viral, communities get louder, and gains get crazier. But while most of the action feels like it’s already passed, there’s one rare moment when you’re early—really early. That moment is now. Right in the middle of this meme coin madness, BTFD Coin is throwing down an offer that’s tough to ignore—especially for anyone still chasing that 1000x dream. Its 90% APY staking, wild play-to-earn ecosystem, and an active Bulls Squad community are already turning heads. But the real kicker? A limited-time 2x token bonus through the LAUNCH100 code that ends March 30. It’s no wonder BTFD is turning heads as one of the best meme coin presales to buy this week . Let’s break down why this presale stands out, and take a look at three other trending picks—CAT, APU, and NPC—bringing their own flavor to the meme coin scene. BTFD Coin: 2x Tokens, 90% APY, and Just One Stage Left Here’s the deal— BTFD Coin is in Stage 15, and things are heating up fast. The current price is just $0.0002, and over $6.41 million has already been raised from more than 11,600 holders. More than 72 billion tokens have been snapped up, and only one stage remains before BTFD hits exchanges at $0.0006. If you’re hunting for one of the best meme coin presales to buy this week, this is your window—because it’s closing fast. But what’s grabbing attention more than anything? Staking. At 90% APY. That’s not a typo. This isn’t your typical “stake and hope” situation either—investors are already mapping out their passive income. Let’s say you toss in $5,000 worth of BTFD at the current price of $0.0002. That nets you 25 million tokens. If you stake those tokens at 90% APY, you’re earning 22.5 million extra tokens annually. That’s real, tangible growth—especially if BTFD hits its $0.0006 listing price or the projected moon price of $0.006. At the moon price, that $5,000 could balloon into $150,000. That’s the kind of ROI that puts BTFD squarely on the map as one of the best meme coin presales to buy this week. And don’t forget the limited-time LAUNCH100 bonus. Until March 30, every token you buy will be doubled—no catch. Just enter the code LAUNCH100 at checkout. So your 25 million tokens? Now they become 50 million. That’s double the stake, double the rewards, and way more room to run when BTFD gets listed. How to buy BTFD Coins? Start by setting up a wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet and load it with ETH, BNB, or USDT. Then, head to the BTFD presale page , connect your wallet, enter the LAUNCH100 code, and complete your purchase. After the presale ends, you’ll claim your BTFD tokens—and that’s when the staking, earning, and moon-chasing really begins. This is one of the best meme coin presales to buy this week, and the window is closing fast. One more stage, one more shot. The question is—are you in? Why did this coin make it to this list? Because BTFD Coin offers a rare mix of meme culture, real utility, massive staking returns, and an epic bonus that doubles your tokens. Combine that with a moon price prediction of $0.006 and a vibrant Bulls Squad backing the movement—this isn’t just another meme coin. It’s a full-blown opportunity. Simon’s Cat (CAT): From Animated Fame to Meme Chain Fame You’ve probably seen the iconic white cat batting at everything in sight on YouTube. Simon’s Cat, the British animated sensation, has clawed its way into the crypto world with a fully licensed meme token. This isn’t just another knockoff—CAT has full IP rights and the backing of a global fanbase that’s already watched the brand rack up over 1.6 billion views online. CAT combines nostalgia, cuteness, and meme culture in one smooth purr. And because it’s based on an internationally beloved character, the community is vast and highly engaged. This coin has the kind of brand recognition that most meme tokens could only dream of—and that gives it staying power in a space filled with short-lived hype. Why did this coin make it to this list? CAT stands out because it’s not just a meme, it’s a brand with global appeal. Backed by the real creators of Simon’s Cat, this token has the meme market’s attention, plus built-in credibility. That combo makes it a solid choice in this week’s roundup. Apu Apustaja (APU): The Purest Meme on the Chain Let’s take a break from the usual chaotic meme coins and talk about something… wholesome. Apu Apustaja is the softer, more innocent cousin of Pepe—a meme that rose from imageboard origins to become a symbol of hope and sweetness in a rough digital world. And now it’s a token. APU is all about community and positive vibes. This little frog is designed to push back against toxic crypto culture and deliver something that feels human again. Instead of aggression or hype, APU thrives on humor, kindness, and inclusivity. It’s meme coin energy without the toxicity. Why did this coin make it to this list? APU makes the cut because it brings heart to the meme coin world. The community is loyal, the message is strong, and the brand is genuinely different. If you’re tired of edgelord memes and soulless pumps, APU is a refreshing shift in tone. Non-Playable Coin (NPC): Where Memes Meet NFTs If there’s one meme that defines the chaotic energy of 2020s internet culture, it’s “I support the current thing.” That’s exactly where Non-Playable Coin (NPC) draws its fuel. But it goes a step further by merging ERC20 and ERC1155 standards to create something new: Meme Fungible Tokens (MFTs). Yup, that means NPCs can be traded as both tokens and NFTs. This coin is pioneering the crossover between meme investing and NFT flexibility. And because it leans so hard into social commentary, the project naturally grabs attention from creators and traders alike. It’s satirical, it’s flexible, and it’s hella tradable. Why did this coin make it to this list? NPC brings a tech-forward angle to the meme game. By blending NFT utility with viral meme aesthetics, it carves out a unique spot in the market. It’s more than a joke—it’s a hybrid of culture and code, and that deserves a spotlight. Conclusion: The Clock Is Ticking—Don’t Miss This Wave There are a lot of meme coins out there, but only one is offering 2x tokens, 90% APY staking, and a community that’s locked in for the long haul. BTFD Coin is the standout among the best meme coin presales to buy this week, and it’s racing toward launch. Just one stage remains. The presale price is still low at $0.0002—but it won’t be for long. When the listing hits at $0.0006—or the forecasted moon price of $0.006—the ROI speaks for itself. There’s only a few days left to use the LAUNCH100 code and double your token stack. Whether you’re new to crypto or hunting your next 100x, BTFD is the moment. The other meme coins—CAT, APU, and NPC—each bring their own brand of magic, but BTFD Coin is the only one giving you a chance to stack tokens and earn big before the bull run begins. Join the BTFD Coin presale now . Stake big. Earn bigger. Ride the bull. FAQs How do I use the LAUNCH100 bonus code for BTFD Coin? Go to the presale page, connect your wallet, enter LAUNCH100 in all caps, input your amount, and complete the transaction to get 2x tokens. What makes BTFD Coin one of the best meme coin presales to buy this week? It’s the only coin offering 90% APY staking, a live play-to-earn game, a growing Bulls Squad community, and a limited 2x token bonus that ends March 30. Is staking with BTFD really 90% APY? Yes. BTFD offers a real 90% APY staking model. The earlier you stake, the more you earn. When will BTFD Coin be listed on exchanges? After the final presale stage ends. The projected listing price is $0.0006, and the moon price prediction is $0.006.

While most people are still sleeping on the wild potential of presale tokens, Cheems just exploded by 23%—sending waves across the meme market—and Sudeng (HIPPO) rolled out a jaw-dropping $1 million airdrop to energize its Telegram-based trading bot and token launchpad. The meme coin market is heating up—but not all opportunities are created equal. Enter BTFD Coin (BTFD) . Unlike high-volatility assets like CHEEMS or tokens ruled by dev drama like HIPPO, BTFD offers something rare: stability at entry, community-driven momentum, and a clear path to massive ROI. BTFD’s presale is currently in Stage 15, priced at just $0.0002, with a 100% bonus (yes, 2x tokens) available using code LAUNCH100—until March 30. With the presale heading into its final stage before launch at $0.0006, BTFD is looking like a generational chance for wealth creation through timing, conviction, and FOMO-worthy perks. Keep reading to break down how BTFD Coin could be the best new meme coin for significant returns, plus a look at CHEEMS and Sudeng’s big moves this week. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – Can This Referral Program Turn You Into a Crypto Magnet? Why are savvy traders ditching short-term pumps and throwing $2,000 or more into a meme coin presale? Because BTFD Coin isn’t just a project—it’s a movement. This Ethereum-based token launched its P2E game on January 1, 2025, and has been gaining unstoppable traction ever since. Right now, we’re in Stage 15 of the presale, and here’s what’s wild: BTFD started at just $0.000004, and today it’s $0.0002. At launch, it’ll list for $0.0006. That’s a 200% return baked in. But if the price hits the projected moon target of $0.006, we’re talking a massive 2900% ROI. Now imagine this: You invest $2,000 today in Stage 15 using the LAUNCH100 bonus code. You’d snag 10 million $BTFD tokens at $0.0002—and get another 10 million FREE. That’s 20 million tokens total. If BTFD hits just $0.0006, you walk away with $12,000. If it hits $0.006? That’s a life-changing $120,000 from just $2K. That’s not hopium. That’s math. But that’s not the only juicy piece. BTFD’s referral program is making waves. Share your unique referral code after connecting your wallet on the official BTFD site , and when someone buys $50 or more, they get 10% extra tokens, and you could bank 10% of their purchase amount—if you make it to the top 20 leaderboard. That’s passive earning with every bullish friend you onboard. Let’s talk staking. The platform offers 90% APY to token holders, meaning your holdings don’t just sit—they grow. Want to multiply your 20M tokens even more? Stake and double down. And don’t forget the live P2E game. This isn’t just fluff—it’s a fully immersive play-to-earn experience tied directly to the $BTFD ecosystem, giving you even more ways to earn while you play. Oh, and here’s a reminder: Last Chance for 2X Tokens with LAUNCH100 – Ends March 30! Snag double the $BTFD during Stage 15 when you use code LAUNCH100—but don’t sleep on it. The 100% bonus deal vanishes on March 30. Grab it now or regret it later!

Twice the tokens. And the shot at 29x returns if $BTFD hits $0.006. That’s what being early looks like in this game. With over 72 billion coins sold, $6.41 million raised, and 11,600+ holders, the BTFD community (aka the “Bulls Squad”) is showing up and showing out. If you’re sleeping on this meme coin presale , you’re missing the kind of alpha that only comes once every few market cycles. Cheems (CHEEMS) – 23% Rally Has Traders Barking Again Cheems just clawed its way back onto the leaderboard with a 23% gain in 24 hours, jumping to a market cap of $393K. The coin, inspired by the iconic Shiba Inu meme, saw a volume surge as traders responded to its comeback and nostalgic appeal. Although it’s still far from its $345 million rally high, the contract renouncement, zero taxes, and BNB Chain migration show it’s got strong community roots. While volatile, CHEEMS proves meme power never really dies—it just needs the right spark. Sudeng (HIPPO) – Airdrops, Bots, and Big Ambitions Sudeng (HIPPO) is doing something few others dare: launching a $1 million HIPPO token airdrop in partnership with MemeFi. Built on the Sui network, the HIPPO coin gained fresh momentum after the community took over when the dev stepped down. Now with the HIPPObot Telegram trading assistant and HipHop fun meme coin launcher, Sudeng is rebranding itself as a Sui-native meme hub. The token is trading at around $0.004278, and volume is heating up fast at $21.5 million. HIPPO’s community-first energy is refreshing, but like all meme coins, it’s a bumpy ride. Conclusion: Missed SHIB or DOGE? This Is Your Shot at 2900% ROI Based on current presale data, community activity, and tokenomics, BTFD Coin is hands-down one of the best new meme coins for significant returns. While CHEEMS barks back and HIPPO throws a hefty airdrop, BTFD is playing the long game—with staking, P2E gaming, and a referral program built to grow your bags before the token even hits exchanges. The clock is ticking. Stage 15 won’t last long, and March 30 is your last day to claim the 100% LAUNCH100 bonus . If you believe in smart entries, wild exits, and building wealth before the next bull cycle, BTFD or get left behind. Join the BTFD Coin presale today before this door slams shut.

According to data from blockchain analytics firm Parsec, the latest outflows happened within hours of the JELLY liquidation event, echoing a similar $300 million outflows seen during a previous Bitcoin ( BTC ) whale liquidation event. As a result, Hyperliquid’s ( HYPE ) USDC reserves have fallen from a high of $2.58 billion to $2.02 billion over the past 30 days. Hyperliquid USDC outflows/inflows. Credit: Parsec The JELLY controversy began when Hyperliquid’s treasury assumed a $5 million short position in JELLY. As the token’s price unexpectedly spiked, the unrealized loss grew to $10.63 million. If JELLY had reached $0.17, Hyperliquid’s treasury faced a potential $240 million loss. The price spike appears to have been manipulated. An address identified as 0xde95 opened a massive 430 million JELLY short position on HyperliquidX, only to remove its margin shortly after. This action led to a series of liquidations, with the losses being absorbed by Hyperliquid’s treasury. Another wallet, 0x20e8, opened a long position in JELLY at the same time, which caused the price to rise even more.

Four roles on BlackRock’s digital asset team were added to its website on Wednesday, including Director of Digital Assets, Director of Regulatory Affairs, Vice President for Digital Asset and ETF Legal Counsel and Associate for Digital Asset. According to the job description, three of the roles are based in New York and another one in Atlanta. The descriptions have otherwise been kept fairly broad and don’t give away any clues regarding what BlackRock might be looking to work on in the future. For the role of the legal counsel, the company is seeking somebody who can help with future crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) launches. BlackRock has so far issued two spot ETF products, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHE). Other issuers have applied to launch funds for several other crypto assets, including Solana (SOL), XRP, and Litecoin (LTC). BlackRock has not announced any plans to do the same. The asset manager is also strongly focused on tokenization, a sector in which it has quickly become a leading force. The firm’s tokenized money market fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), has drawn in $1.7 billion since its introduction in 2023, making it by far the largest tokenized fund on the market currently.",Finance|Wall Street|BlackRock,EN,0,0,REGULATION|LTC|MARKET|SOL|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-27 03:19:34

According to the official announcement on Mar. 26, The Wyoming Stable Token Commission, which will oversee the launch, has partnered with LayerZero ( ZRO ) to develop and distribute the token. At the DC Blockchain Summit, Wyoming’s governer Mark Gordon and commission executive director Anthony Apollo revealed that WYST has entered its testing phase. The state-issued stablecoin has been deployed on testnets for Avalanche ( AVAX ), Solana ( SOL ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and more blockchains. These test tokens have no real value yet, but they help ensure the system works properly before the official launch. WYST will be fully backed by cash and U.S. Treasury securities to ensure stability. Interest from these reserves will be transferred to Wyoming’s school foundation fund to ensure that the stablecoin benefits the state. To ensure it maintains its value, WYST will have more reserves than the total number of tokens issued since it will be overcollateralized.

This lowers security risks by enabling users to move WYST between networks without depending on centralized bridges. A recent test transaction showed WYST moving between Ethereum and Avalanche using Stargate, a LayerZero-powered bridge. However, any compatible interface will be able to support WYST’s transfers. Wyoming lawmakers have been working on the stablecoin since passing the Wyoming Stable Token Act in March 2023. The commission will continue refining WYST’s smart contracts and risk management framework. If testing goes as planned, the stablecoin could launch as early as July 2025.

Bitwise Breaks Down the Possibilities,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-2030-29-32-or-0-13-bitwise-breaks-down-the-possibilities/,"The post XRP Price News: $29.32 or $0.13? Bitwise Breaks Down the Possibilities appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Despite the recent victory in the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit, XRP’s price hasn’t seen much movement. The 3-day chart still shows a clear bearish trend, with the token stuck in a pattern that suggests no major bullish momentum is expected in the near future. On the resistance side, XRP is facing short-term resistance at around $2.50 and $2.56. If the price manages to break above these levels, there is further resistance between $2.65 and $2.80. Sideways Movement Continues for XRP For the time being, XRP’s price action remains largely neutral, bouncing between support and resistance levels. There is a lack of strong directional momentum, with both short-term bullish and bearish price movements occurring intermittently. This sideways price range is expected to continue unless a significant breakout or breakdown occurs. Short-Term Pullback and Potential Support Levels Looking at the shorter 8-hour time frame, XRP is currently experiencing a pullback. This could potentially lead to a test of support levels between $2.24 and $2.30. If the price breaks below this area with confirmation, the next significant support zone would be between $1.95 and $2.05. Bitwise’s Price Prediction for XRP by 2030 Bitwise, a cryptocurrency fund manager, believes XRP could reach $29.32 by 2030 if it captures a large share of the payments and tokenization markets, greatly increasing its value. XRP’s market cap could grow to $2.9 trillion, more than Microsoft’s. In a “bull” scenario, XRP could reach $12.70 by 2030 if it grows steadily, although it may face challenges in payments and tokenization. On the other hand, if XRP struggles to gain traction and institutional support fades, its price could drop to just $0.13 in the worst-case “bear” scenario.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-27 03:23:30

ETH is now rising and might aim for a move above the $2,050 resistance. Ethereum corrected lower and tested the $1,980 support level. The price is trading below $2,040 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,050 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $2,050 and $2,100 resistance levels to start a decent increase. Ethereum Price Faces Resistance Ethereum price failed to continue higher above $2,100 and corrected some gains, like Bitcoin . ETH declined below the $2,020 and $2,000 support levels. It tested the $1,980 zone. A low was formed at $1,982 and the price is again rising . There was a move above the $2,000 level. The price surpassed the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,097 swing high to the $1,982 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,040 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,050 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,040 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,097 swing high to the $1,982 low. The next key resistance is near the $2,050 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,100 level. A clear move above the $2,100 resistance might send the price toward the $2,150 resistance. An upside break above the $2,150 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,250 resistance zone or even $2,320 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,050 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,000 level. The first major support sits near the $1,980 zone. A clear move below the $1,980 support might push the price toward the $1,920 support and the trend line. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,880 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,810.

The XRP Price Surge has sparked new excitement, raising hopes for a break above $3. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs are gathering momentum, with staking emerging as a key force behind ETH’s potential rebound. As these two established assets ride waves of optimism, BlockDAG (BDAG) is quietly stealing the spotlight. Nearing the final days of its historic presale, BlockDAG has already raised $206.5 million, selling 18.8 billion BDAG coins. With its Mainnet launch and 10 CEX listings coming in 2025, BDAG’s projected $1 price target positions it as one of the best long term crypto options available today. XRP Price Surge Reaches 7%: Is a Break Above $3 Within Reach? The latest XRP Price Surge has caught traders’ attention. After climbing 7%, XRP is now valued at $2.25, triggering speculation about whether it can challenge the $3 mark. After bouncing off a solid support level at $2.10, XRP is gaining strength. Analysts are watching resistance zones at $2.40 and $2.60—critical thresholds that could open the door for further gains. If XRP breaks through these resistance points, this XRP Price Surge could be a key moment in the coin’s trajectory. Some traders believe this move could lead to a longer-term uptrend, but others remain cautious as technical hurdles remain. Ethereum ETFs Gain Attention as Staking Becomes a Major Price Catalyst Ethereum ETFs are drawing more interest, but it’s the growing importance of staking that’s really standing out. Recent analysis suggests staking rewards could have a bigger impact on Ethereum’s price than the highly anticipated Pectra upgrade. As more participants lock up ETH for staking, the reduced circulating supply may strengthen the token’s price fundamentals. Currently, Ethereum trades at around $1,860. With staking participation rising steadily, Ethereum ETFs are poised to attract increased institutional involvement. The combination of staking and ETF demand is boosting confidence in ETH’s potential recovery. As these factors gain traction, Ethereum ETFs and staking are both becoming pivotal drivers of ETH’s price direction. BlockDAG Presale Surpasses $206.5M as Mainnet & CEX Listings Draw Near Crypto presales often set the tone for a project’s long-term success. BlockDAG’s presale is proving to be no exception. So far, it has pulled in more than $206.5 million and sold 18.8 billion BDAG coins, ranking among the largest presales in recent history. Starting at just $0.001 in Batch 1, BDAG’s price has climbed to $0.0248 in Batch 27—closing in on its $600 million goal. But what’s coming next for BlockDAG? The focus is shifting toward utility and adoption. BlockDAG’s Mainnet launch in 2025 will mark a major step, transitioning the project from presale momentum to live blockchain operations. Alongside the Mainnet release, BlockDAG has announced 10 major centralized exchange (CEX) listings, which are expected to bring a wave of new liquidity and wider access for traders worldwide. In addition, BlockDAG is expanding its developer community through its partnership with HackerEarth. Already, over 200 dApps are being built on the platform, ranging from DeFi and NFTs to Web3 solutions. This growth is fueling BlockDAG’s evolving ecosystem, which is adding real value to BDAG tokens as demand increases. With each batch of the presale, BDAG’s price continues to rise, reinforcing predictions of a $1 valuation in 2025. As the remaining supply of BDAG runs low, early adopters are securing their positions before the window closes. Those who entered earlier have already seen a 2,380% ROI, and projections show Batch 27 buyers could earn a 3,932% return if the $1 target is reached. Quick Recap The 7% XRP Price Surge has sparked hope for a move past $3, with resistance points at $2.40 and $2.60 under close watch. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs are gaining momentum, with staking now viewed as a key driver of ETH’s future price. Both assets face important crossroads as investors monitor their next moves. At the same time, BlockDAG’s presale continues to build speed. With $206.5M raised and 18.8 billion BDAG sold, the project is racing toward its next phase. The Mainnet launch and 10 CEX listings in 2025 could propel BDAG to its forecasted $1 valuation. Those joining before Batch 27 closes could see returns of up to 3,932%, cementing BlockDAG as the best long term crypto opportunity on the market right now.

While virality remains part of the appeal, investors are beginning to prioritize fundamentals. The focus is shifting from short-lived hype to tokens with lasting value, stronger mechanics, and community-driven ecosystems. Projects that balance cultural relevance with real utility are gaining traction. In this changing landscape, four tokens have started making a case for themselves: MIND of Pepe, Meme Index (MEMEX), Cheems, and Dragoin. Each one brings something distinct—but Dragoin is emerging as a standout by integrating entertainment, scarcity, and decentralization into a scalable ecosystem. 1. MIND of Pepe: Combining AI Tools with Meme Power MIND of Pepe sets itself apart by merging meme culture with artificial intelligence. Backed by over $7.5 million raised, the project uses an AI engine that analyzes market trends, helps with trading decisions, and offers predictive insights. Token holders gain exclusive access to these tools, along with early opportunities that non-holders can’t tap into. Rather than leaning on memes alone, MIND of Pepe builds on practical value. This combination of humor and functionality gives it an edge. As a result, it’s positioned as more than just a fun token—it’s one of the Best Meme Coins to Buy in 2025 for those who want both entertainment and intelligent investing. 2. MEMEX: Making Meme Investing Easier Through Indexing Meme Index (MEMEX) addresses a growing issue—too many choices. With new meme coins launching every week, keeping up is tough. MEMEX simplifies the process by offering a token that tracks a curated basket of top meme coins. It automatically adjusts based on market performance, giving investors diversified exposure without constant monitoring. MEMEX introduces a data-driven approach to a space often dominated by unpredictability. By focusing on structure and risk management, it transforms how meme coin investing is approached. For investors seeking efficient entry into this niche, MEMEX brings a fresh, organized strategy to the mix. 3. Cheems: Classic Meme, Clear Mission Cheems brings a familiar face and a unique purpose. Inspired by the original “Cheems” meme, the token supports charities by donating a portion of its transaction fees. This built-in charitable element adds a new dimension to its appeal. Community transparency and consistent activity have helped Cheems remain visible across several market cycles. Its long-term relevance lies in its values. By tying meme culture to social good, Cheems delivers more than humor—it delivers impact. In a time when investors are more selective, this dual-purpose model could give it a lasting place among the Best Meme Coins to Buy in 2025. 4. Dragoin: A Meme Coin Designed for Sustainability Dragoin ($DDGN) is challenging the meme coin model by building a full-featured ecosystem from the ground up. Built on Ethereum, the project revolves around a play-to-earn game hosted on Telegram, where users train digital dragons and earn $DDGN tokens by competing. It connects activity with earnings, making token ownership engaging and rewarding. Beyond gameplay, Dragoin’s economic model shows strong planning. Out of its 200 billion total supply, 50% is allocated to a 25-stage presale. Each stage increases the token’s price, encouraging early investment. Unsold tokens will be permanently burned, reducing supply and boosting scarcity. The team’s decision to fully renounce ownership of the smart contract post-presale adds a decentralization layer rarely seen in meme coins. This structure builds long-term trust in the project. Dragoin’s roadmap is equally forward-focused. Q2 2025 includes the full game launch, staking tools, and partnerships with key influencers. Q3 will bring listings on major exchanges and additional in-game enhancements. With referral rewards, airdrops, and active social engagement already in place, the project is gaining momentum. What Dragoin represents is a shift. It’s not just about short-term gains—it’s about creating a self-sustaining, community-owned platform. That’s why for many investors watching the market evolve, Dragoin isn’t just an option—it’s leading the list of Best Meme Coins to Buy in 2025 .

After weeks of volatility and uncertainty, the market appears to be stabilizing — but conviction remains low. Analysts are divided on the next move. Some warn that if BTC fails to break above $90K, a continuation of the downtrend is likely. Others believe the current consolidation could set the stage for a bullish surge into higher price levels. Adding to the complexity, on-chain data offers key insights into market behavior. According to CryptoQuant, since January 1st, 2025, Short-Term Holders (STH) have increased their supply by 201,743 BTC. This cohort now holds 5,750,076 BTC, a significant accumulation that reflects cautious re-entry by market participants. The rise in STH supply suggests growing interest at current levels, but it also raises questions about potential selling pressure if momentum fails to return. As Bitcoin hovers below the $90K mark , both bulls and bears are preparing for the next decisive move. The coming days will be critical in determining whether Bitcoin can regain strength — or continue its slide in a fragile market. Bitcoin Faces Critical Test As Bulls Eye Break Above $88K Bitcoin is once again at a pivotal point, with bulls attempting to push the price above the $88,000 level in hopes of triggering a broader rally. After a period of consolidation and mild recovery, this level has emerged as a short-term resistance. Reclaiming it could give bulls the momentum they need to challenge the psychological $90,000 barrier and flip the market structure bullish once again. However, broader financial conditions continue to weigh heavily on sentiment. Macroeconomic uncertainty and growing fears of a trade war have kept financial markets on edge. These factors have created a cautious environment where even strong technical setups are treated with skepticism. Within this backdrop, top analyst Axel Adler offered insights on X that shed light on Bitcoin’s current on-chain dynamics. According to Adler, since January 1st, 2025, Short-Term Holders (STH) have added 201,743 BTC to their supply, which now totals 5,750,076 BTC. While this is a sizable increase, it’s still below levels seen at previous cycle peaks — 8.4 million and 7 million BTC respectively. Importantly, around 200,000 BTC are currently held at an unrealized loss, amounting to roughly $17 billion based on current prices. Despite this, Adler notes there are no on-chain signals pointing to panic or imminent selling from these holders. The data suggests that STHs are holding through volatility, signaling growing resilience or at least a wait-and-see approach. If bulls can capitalize on this stability and push above $88K with conviction, it could mark the beginning of a stronger recovery phase. Until then, Bitcoin remains locked in a cautious tug-of-war between optimism and macro-driven fear. Bitcoin Holds $88K As Bulls Target $89K Breakout Bitcoin is currently trading at $88,200 after successfully reclaiming the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) and 200 exponential moving average (EMA) near the $87,000 mark. This recovery above key short-term technical indicators is an encouraging sign for bulls, suggesting that momentum is slowly building after recent consolidation. However, the next major challenge lies just ahead. To maintain upward momentum and confirm a short-term bullish breakout, BTC must push above the $89,000 level. This breakout would likely trigger a move toward the next key resistance zone around $92,000, a level that has previously acted as a strong barrier. Reaching that area could bring renewed bullish sentiment and open the door for higher targets in the coming sessions. However, if Bitcoin fails to break above $89,000, the current rally could quickly lose steam. A rejection at this level would likely increase selling pressure, with the potential for BTC to fall back toward the $81,500 support zone. This would erase recent gains and confirm that bears remain in control of the broader trend. As price hovers near critical levels, bulls must act decisively to keep the recovery alive and avoid another downturn.

Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) and Henry (@LordOfAlts), are pointing to what they believe is a major technical setup on the Dogecoin (DOGE) price chart—potentially heralding a sizable breakout. This Price Level Is Crucial For Dogecoin Early today, Rekt Capital shared a weekly DOGE/USDT chart highlighting key price levels at $0.159, $0.204, and most critically $0.22. According to the analyst, Dogecoin’s trajectory now hinges on whether it can “reclaim and/or Weekly Close above $0.22”—a level he refers to as a green zone of Pre-Halving highs on his chart. Rekt Capital suggests that the recent dip below $0.22 could represent a mere “downside deviation,” meaning any breach under that threshold might have been temporary if price action stabilizes above $0.22 in the near future. The candlesticks near $0.20 and $0.22 exhibit notable wicks, indicative of high volatility. Rekt Capital interprets these as part of a “very volatile retest” of the price region around March highs. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is ‘All Going To Plan,’ Says Crypto Analyst From a technical standpoint, the $0.22 area seems to act as a pivot. Should Dogecoin close a weekly candle above that boundary, it would increase the likelihood that buyers are regaining control, potentially setting the stage for a move toward higher resistance levels—such as the $0.28 and $0.338 region, identified by two horizontal green lines on Rekt Capital’s chart. DOGE Breakout Already Confirmed? Meanwhile, analyst Henry (@LordOfAlts) points to a multi-month falling wedge formation stretching from late 2024 through the first quarter of 2025. Henry notes that this pattern bears resemblance to Dogecoin’s descending wedge in 2024, which eventually led to a breakout and a significant price surge. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Mirroring This 2017 Pattern Suggests That A Rise To $4 Could Happen On Henry’s chart, DOGE had been consolidating between two downward-sloping trendlines for several months. The upper trendline connects lower highs since the coin’s peak above $0.48, while the lower boundary captures a sequence of descending lows. Henry’s analysis draws a parallel between the current wedge and a similar structure that resolved in a 365% surge which started in October 2024. Over the past few days, Dogecoin broke out of the falling wedge pattern again, possibly setting the stage for another steep rise. Although Henry does not guarantee specific targets, he remarks that last time “Last time it did a similar thing was in Sep 24. 50¢ next, then $1.00,” concluding with a succinct instruction to “Trust the cycle.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.19583.

42460153,https://coingape.com/?p=246162,1743048221,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,US Congress Accelerates Crypto Oversight with New Stablecoin Bill,https://coingape.com/us-congress-accelerates-crypto-oversight-with-new-stablecoin-bill/,"The U.S. Congress is moving forward with efforts to regulate the cryptocurrency industry, with a particular focus on stablecoins. A new stablecoin bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives, building on previous legislative efforts. This bill aims to provide clearer guidelines on how companies can issue dollar-denominated digital tokens and set the stage for broader crypto oversight. House Version of Stablecoin Bill Released The U.S. House of Representatives has moved forward in digital asset regulation efforts after it published its stablecoin bill text to the public. The two congressmen, Bryan Steil and French Hill introduced stablecoin legislation, that dictates rules for digital tokens which bind their value to the U.S. dollar. Steil who leads the Financial Services Committee crypto panel stated the bill functions to unite stablecoin legislative frameworks between the House and Senate. The legislation known as the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE Act) follows Congress’ ongoing development of digital asset regulations. According to Hill the bill constitutes part of an extensive program to establish regulatory clarity for cryptocurrency operations. He stated that the bill aims to establish financial regulations which require stablecoin companies to maintain transparency while protecting consumers and the system. Senate Stablecoin Bill Moves Forward There has been some progress made on the regulation of stablecoins by the Senate as the bill was moved to the Banking Committee where it enjoyed bipartisan support. This bill has made its way to the Senate floor, awaiting the senate action. Rep. Representative Tom Emmer, a crypto supporter in Congress, noted that even though the two bills are somewhat similar but have distinct features, such differences are not significant and can be sorted out as the bills progressed through the legislative procedure. Lawmakers are looking forward to passing the stablecoin laws in the next few weeks especially following US President Donald Trump directive on stablecoin regulation. Emmer remained optimistic that the bill will be finished by August. This momentum is part of a wider effort in Congress to provide more stability in the regulation of cryptocurrencies so that companies and users have better frameworks to follow. Efforts to Clarify Crypto Asset Regulations Additionally, Emmer also reintroduced the Securities Clarity Act as another bill targeting how cryptocurrencies fit into the domain of securities. This bill, sponsored with republican partner Darren Soto, is to clarify legal uncertainty existing in the United States concerning the qualification of digital assets under the securities law. Emmer thus urged for better formalism saying that business requires legal predictability to the effect that they are able to conduct their operations within the legal framework. Emmer’s actions are in line with other pieces of legislation that have been made to determine how digital assets should be regulated within the U.S. financial system. These steps are regarded as crucial in offering that legal certainty that many cryptocurrencies and blockchain start-ups have claimed to need to enhance business growth and development. Wyoming and Other States Enter the Stablecoin Market As federal lawmakers push forward with stablecoin regulations, states are also taking steps to position themselves as leaders in the crypto space. Wyoming, in particular, is moving toward launching its own state-backed stablecoin . Governor Mark Gordon has announced plans to issue a stablecoin fully backed by U.S. dollar reserves, aiming to provide a fast, low-cost alternative for digital payments. The state’s move is part of a broader trend, with other companies and states working on their own stablecoin projects. Custodia and Vantage Bank, for example, recently launched the Avit stablecoin , backed by U.S. dollar reserves and based on the Ethereum blockchain. These efforts reflect the growing interest in stablecoins as a way to bridge the gap between traditional financial systems and the emerging digital economy.

A March 26 letter signed by 34 crypto companies and advocate groups sent to the Senate Banking Committee, House Financial Services Committee and the House and Senate judiciary committees said the DOJ’s take on unlicensed money-transmitting business means “essentially every blockchain developer could be prosecuted as a criminal.” The letter — led by the DeFi Education Fund and signed by the likes of Kraken and Coinbase — added that the Justice Department’s interpretation “creates confusion and ambiguity” and “threatens the viability of U.S.-based software development in the digital asset industry.” The group said the DOJ debuted its position “in August 2023 via criminal indictment” — the same time it charged Tornado Cash developers Roman Storm and Roman Semenov with money laundering. Storm has been released on bail, has pleaded not guilty and wants the charges dropped . Semenov, a Russian national, is at large. Source: DeFi Education Fund The DOJ has filed similar charges against Samourai Wallet co-founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill, who have both pleaded not guilty. The crypto group’s letter argued that two sections of the US Code define a “money transmitting business” — Title 31 section 5330, defining who must be licensed and Title 18 section 1960, which criminalizes operating unlicensed. It added that 2019 guidance from the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) gave examples of what money-transmitting activities and said that “if a software developer never obtains possession or control over customer funds, that developer is not operating a ‘money transmitting business.’” The letter argued that the DOJ had taken a position that the definition of a money transmitting business under section 5330 “is not relevant to determining whether someone is operating an unlicensed ‘money transmitting business’ under Section 1960” despite the “intentional similarity” in both sections and FinCEN’s guidance. Related: Hester Peirce calls for SEC rulemaking to ‘bake in’ crypto regulation The group accused the DOJ of ignoring both FinCEN’s guidance and parts of the law to pursue its own interpretation of a money-transmitting business when it charged Storm and Semenov. They said the result had seen “two separate US government agencies with conflicting interpretations of ‘money transmission’ — an unclear, unfair position for law-abiding industry participants and innovators.” The letter said that if not addressed, the Justice Department’s interpretation would expose non-custodial software developers “within the reach of the U.S. to criminal liability.” “The resulting, and very rational, fear among developers would effectively end the development of these technologies in the United States.” In January, Michael Lewellen, a fellow of the crypto advocacy group Coin Center, sued Attorney General Merrick Garland to have his planned release of non-custodial software declared legal and to block the DOJ from using money transmitting laws to prosecute him. Lewellen said the DOJ “has begun criminally prosecuting people for publishing similar cryptocurrency software,” which he claims extended the interpretation of money-transmitting laws “beyond what the Constitution allows.” Magazine: Meet lawyer Max Burwick — ‘The ambulance chaser of crypto’",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|EXCHANGE|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-27 04:06:27

This integration unlocks powerful new strategies for EVAA users — including fixed yields, leveraged farming, and impermanent loss-protected liquidity provision — while reaffirming EVAA’s position as the leading lending platform on TON. Think of it as Pendle meets TON — and it’s live. With this move, EVAA users can now tokenize their deposits into two distinct assets, opening up access to stable returns, amplified point farming, and composable yield strategies. This also marks the launch of FIVA’s phased mainnet rollout, with EVAA’s USDT market as its next strategic integration. One Deposit, Two Tokens — You Choose Through FIVA, EVAA depositors can split a single yield-bearing position into: PT (Principal Token): A fixed-rate instrument offering predictable income (e.g., 7–15% APY over 3–6 months) YT (Yield Token): A leveraged position offering up to 100x exposure to EVAA’s variable yields and point system — with no liquidation risk This dual-token design gives users greater control over their capital, letting them hedge risk or maximize upside depending on their strategy. Three Ways to Make Your Yield Work Smarter EVAA’s mission is to deliver transparent, sustainable, and innovative lending experiences. With FIVA now integrated, users can enhance their yield performance using three core instruments: Fixed Yields with Principal Tokens (PT) Users can lock in stable returns, ideal during times of market volatility. For example: Deposit 10,000 USDT at a fixed 7% APY over 6 months Earn 350 USDT in guaranteed returns, fully insulated from rate volatility With EVAA’s historical rates swinging between 3% and 14% — and dropping by as much as 75% in a year — PTs offer valuable protection for long-term and passive investors. This mechanism is ideal for investors who prioritize stability and need predictable income, especially in the often-volatile world of DeFi. Leveraged Farming with Yield Tokens (YT) For those seeking higher returns, YT tokens provide leveraged exposure to EVAA yields and points, with capital efficiency and capped downside. For instance, a 1,000 USDT YT position can give the yield of a 55,000 USDT deposit (representing 55x leverage – a possible scenario that varies based on market conditions) — perfect for aggressive farmers ahead of EVAA’s TGE. Multi-Stream Rewards as Liquidity Provider (LP) Users can also deploy EVAA positions to FIVA liquidity pools, earning: EVAA base yield (currently 3%) Trading fees (~0.5%) Both EVAA and FIVA points with multipliers Protection from impermanent loss at maturity Each token type — PT, YT, and LP — serves a different strategic purpose, allowing users to customize their approach based on personal risk profiles and yield targets. Phased Access, Proven Security – Rolling Out the Future of Yield The integration of FIVA into EVAA marks the start of a phased mainnet rollout designed with security, performance, and community feedback at its core. The rollout is structured across three stages: Phase 1: Early access for FIVA Genesis Pass NFT holders (completed) Phase 2: Partner access for EVAA users via exclusive links (now live) Phase 3: Full-scale expansion with additional protocol integrations (upcoming) During the current phase, EVAA users can access FIVA’s yield tokenization features through invite-only links distributed via the EVAA app, Telegram channel, quests, and partner campaigns. This controlled onboarding process allows the FIVA team to closely monitor performance, collect real-world usage data, and refine the user experience — all while ensuring protocol stability and protecting early participants. The decision to launch EVAA’s USDT market was strategic: as one of the most established protocols on TON, EVAA offers a secure and well-audited foundation to test and scale FIVA’s novel mechanics. Security remains a priority throughout. Both EVAA and FIVA implement smart contract audits, rely on Pyth oracles for reliable price feeds, and maintain contingency protections. Should any issues arise within the EVAA protocol, FIVA’s contracts are designed to honor fixed-rate positions , even if the underlying token values are affected. By combining phased access with robust security measures, the integration sets a new standard for responsible scaling in the TON DeFi space — a space that’s evolving fast and demanding smarter, safer infrastructure. And this is just the beginning. FIVA is already connected with a growing network of TON-native protocols, including Tonstakers , Storm , Ethena , and Bemo , with more integrations planned. Together with EVAA, they’re laying the groundwork for a modular DeFi ecosystem, where yield is not just earned — it’s tokenized, tradable, and optimized.

Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels However, during this period, ADA has recorded several fakeouts, which now appear confusing to traders and investors trying to determine its upcoming move. According to expert technical analysis, the asset remains neutral and is currently at the upper boundary of the consolidation. Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if ADA breaches the upper boundary and closes a daily candle above the $0.76 level, there is a strong possibility that it could soar by 13% to reach $0.85 in the coming days. Source: Trading View However, this rally is currently halted by the upper boundary of $0.75 and the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, which has been providing constant resistance. Despite this neutral price action, a technical indicator called the Bollinger Bands on the 12-hour timeframe appears to be squeezing, signaling a potential upside or downside rally. Current Price Momentum At press time, ADA is trading near $0.742, having recorded a modest price surge of over 0.25% in the past 24 hours.

The ChatGPT creators also expect its revenue target for 2025 to more than double to $29.4 billion by 2026, Bloomberg reported on March 26, citing a person familiar with the matter. The 2025 estimate is a little higher than the $11.6 billion revenue target that OpenAI was reportedly eyeing for 2025, The New York Times reported last September. Bloomberg noted that the bulk of ChatGPT’s revenue has come from its paid AI software subscription offerings for consumers and businesses. OpenAI reportedly hit 1 million paid users for the corporate versions of ChatGPT last September, while the company more recently added a $200 monthly ChatGPT Pro option. The Sam Altman-led firm does not expect to be cash-flow positive until 2029, when it expects its revenue to top $125 billion, the person told Bloomberg. OpenAI is reportedly close to finalizing a $40 billion funding round led by SoftBank Group at a valuation of up to $300 billion, Bloomberg reported on March 26. The firm is also looking to convert its nonprofit business model into a for-profit venture. Competition heats up between US and Chinese AI players While the release of DeepSeek’s ChatGPT-competitor “R-1” model sent shockwaves through the AI industry in late January, it sparked a wave of several other high-quality, low-cost AI solutions from other Chinese tech firms, Bloomberg reported on March 26. Baidu Inc. launched its “Ernie X1” model to compete with DeepSeek’s R-1 model in China, while Alibaba Group launched its new open-source AI model for cost-effective AI agents on March 26. Source: David Sacks Tencent Holdings also unveiled an AI chatbot of its own under subsidiary firm Ant Group Co, while DeepSeek released its latest model — DeepSeek-V3-0324 — on March 24. Related: Cathie Wood to kick off El Salvador’s AI public education program While it remains to be seen how these Chinese models truly stack up against OpenAI’s products, the newer and often cheaper options are putting more pressure on the business models of leading US companies, Balaji Srinivasan, a tech investor and former general partner at tech-focused venture capital firm Andreessen “a16z” Horowitz said in a March 22 X post. “China is trying to do to AI what they always do: study, copy, optimize, and then bankrupt everyone with low prices and enormous scale.” Lee Kai-fu, CEO of Chinese startup 01.AI told Reuters on March 25 that DeepSeek’s efforts have positioned Chinese AI firms only three months behind their US counterparts after previously being around six to nine months behind.

Plus and Pro subscribers will be able to run GPT-5 at a “higher level of intelligence” which will incorporate voice, canvas, search, deep research features and more, he said in OpenAI’s technical roadmap update. Among OpenAI’s competitors in the US market are Anthropic, DeepMind, xAI and Google’s Gemini. Magazine: What are native rollups?

According to a press release shared with CryptoPotato, this oracle services provider is named Lumina and is built on the open-source financial data platform DIA (Decentralized Information Asset). Unveiling DIA’s Oracle Services Provider DIA Lumina is scheduled to go live on March 26. It will provide verifiable, trustless oracles for decentralized finance (DeFi), real-world assets (RWAs), and Web3 applications in the crypto ecosystem. DIA claims the platform will redefine the standard for oracle security, transparency, and efficiency. The financial data platform says Lumina will end “black-box data processing,” which has caused DeFi protocols and blockchain networks to rely on opaque, centralized, trust-based, and unverifiable data feeds for years. According to DIA, Lumina puts an end to an era where crypto networks are forced to depend on oracles that operate behind closed doors. Lumina offers a fully on-chain and transparent architecture that makes sure every step of the data journey is verifiable. Developers, networks, and institutions will be able to audit oracle operations directly in Lumina’s open and permissionless environment. This is why Ripple and the peer-to-peer (P2P) decentralized network Stellar have chosen DIA to provide oracle services for their blockchains. Transparency and Trustlessness Unlike other popular oracles like Chainlink and Pyth , Lumina has a fully transparent design that meets institutional and regulatory standards. Ripple believes access to fully auditable, trustless off-chain data is non-negotiable for the growth of the RWAs sector, and Lumina enables that. “For years, oracles have been considered a necessary evil by many—an infrastructure layer blockchain builders had no choice but to trust. That stops now. DIA Lumina isn’t just another oracle stack. It’s the first one that doesn’t ask you to trust it at all,” said DIA’s head of business development, Dillon Hanson. Meanwhile, Lumina’s core technology is Lasernet, a modular layer-2 rollup built for trustless and verifiable oracles. DIA says this network leverages Arbitrum’s optimistic rollup technology and Ethereum’s security to ensure oracle transactions are processed publicly and verifiably, eliminating the reliance on off-chain, multi-sig-controlled nodes. “By putting every transaction, price feed, and computation on-chain, we’re not just competing with existing oracles—we’re making them obsolete,” Hanson added.

An official release from the state governor’s office noted that the state is considering nine blockchains to host the stablecoin. Speaking at the DC Blockchain Summit on Wednesday, Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon confirmed the token’s launch after a testing period. Wyoming has partnered with LayerZero to launch WYST, pegged to USD and backed by cash, US Treasuries and repurchase agreements. Further, the stable token maintains a statutory requirement of no less than 102% capitalization, per Bloomberg . “There’s no clearer signal of where finance is heading than a U.S. state putting the dollar onchain,” wrote LayerZero on X.

The U.S. Senate is back in session this evening, and crypto enthusiasts are holding their breath. After a snag in the initial vote on April 4th, senators are set to revisit the contentious DeFi broker rule. This regulation, aimed at bringing decentralized finance (DeFi) under traditional financial reporting frameworks, has sparked significant opposition from the crypto community. Will this second vote finally overturn the rule? Let’s dive into what’s happening and what it means for the future of crypto. What is the DeFi Broker Rule and Why the Fuss? At the heart of this legislative battle is the DeFi broker rule . This rule, proposed by regulatory bodies, mandates that entities operating as brokers in the decentralized finance space must report the total proceeds from digital asset sales. Sounds simple enough, right? Not quite. The crypto industry argues this rule is deeply flawed and impractical for several key reasons: Defining a ‘Broker’ in DeFi is Murky: DeFi is built on decentralization. There aren’t always clear intermediaries in the way traditional finance operates. Identifying who qualifies as a ‘broker’ in a decentralized, often anonymous environment is incredibly complex and potentially overbroad. Privacy Concerns: The reporting requirements could compromise the privacy of DeFi users, a core tenet of many cryptocurrency principles. Forcing platforms to collect and report user data goes against the ethos of decentralization and could stifle innovation. Technical Challenges: Implementing such reporting requirements in the decentralized world presents immense technical hurdles. DeFi protocols are often designed to be permissionless and operate without central control, making data collection and reporting a significant challenge. Innovation Stifling: Many in the crypto space fear that overly burdensome regulations like the DeFi broker rule could stifle innovation and drive developers and businesses away from the U.S., pushing the burgeoning DeFi sector offshore. Essentially, the crypto industry views the DeFi broker rule as a square peg being forced into a round hole – traditional financial regulations being clumsily applied to a fundamentally different technological paradigm. The industry argues for a more nuanced and tailored approach to regulation that acknowledges the unique characteristics of DeFi. The Senate Vote: A Second Chance for Crypto? The fact that the Senate is holding a second vote on overturning the DeFi broker rule is significant. It indicates that the initial attempt, while facing a technical hurdle, has garnered enough support to warrant another try. According to reports from Eleanor Terrett, a procedural vote is scheduled for 5 p.m. this evening, followed by a final passage vote expected around 8 p.m. Eastern Time. This timeline suggests a focused and determined effort to push this resolution through. Why is this Senate vote so crucial? Industry-Wide Impact: The outcome of this vote will have a ripple effect across the entire crypto industry. Overturning the rule would be seen as a major victory, signaling a more accommodating regulatory environment in the U.S., encouraging further investment and development in the crypto space. Setting a Precedent: This vote could set a precedent for future crypto regulations. If the Senate successfully repeals the DeFi broker rule, it might embolden lawmakers to take a more cautious and considered approach to regulating digital assets, engaging with the industry and understanding its nuances. Global Signal: The U.S.’s stance on crypto regulation is closely watched globally. A move to overturn the DeFi broker rule could send a positive signal to the international crypto community, positioning the U.S. as a more crypto-friendly nation. What Happens Next? Potential Scenarios Let’s consider the potential outcomes of this pivotal Senate vote and what they could mean: Scenario Likelihood Impact on Crypto Industry Senate Repeals DeFi Broker Rule (Again) High (Given second vote attempt) Positive: Crypto industry celebrates a significant regulatory victory. Increased investment, innovation, and potentially clearer regulatory pathways in the U.S. Senate Fails to Repeal DeFi Broker Rule Medium (Possible resistance remains) Negative: Disappointment in the crypto industry. Concerns about overregulation and potential stifling of DeFi innovation in the U.S. May lead to increased focus on offshore DeFi development. Resolution Moves to President Trump Dependent on Senate outcome Uncertain: Trump’s stance on crypto regulation is evolving. His administration’s final decision would be crucial. Industry hopes for a favorable outcome given Trump’s generally pro-business stance. Crypto Regulation: A Constant Balancing Act The debate surrounding the DeFi broker rule highlights the ongoing tension between regulation and innovation in the cryptocurrency space. Governments worldwide are grappling with how to regulate this nascent industry effectively. The challenge lies in finding a balance that protects consumers and prevents illicit activities without suffocating the potential for growth and technological advancement that crypto offers. Key Challenges in Crypto Regulation: Rapid Technological Evolution: The crypto space is constantly evolving. Regulations need to be adaptable and forward-thinking to keep pace with technological advancements. Decentralization and Anonymity: The decentralized and pseudonymous nature of many cryptocurrencies poses unique challenges for traditional regulatory frameworks designed for centralized and transparent systems. Global Nature of Crypto: Crypto operates globally, transcending national borders. Effective regulation requires international cooperation and coordination to prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure consistent standards. Education and Understanding: Policymakers and regulators need to develop a deeper understanding of the technology and its nuances to create informed and effective regulations. Digital Asset Sales: What’s at Stake? The core of the DeFi broker rule controversy revolves around the reporting of digital asset sales . For the crypto industry, this isn’t just about compliance; it’s about the fundamental principles of how digital assets are treated and regulated. Requiring DeFi brokers to report total proceeds from digital asset sales raises questions about: Definition of ‘Sale’: In DeFi, transactions can be complex and involve various forms of exchange, staking, lending, and borrowing. Defining what constitutes a ‘sale’ for reporting purposes can be ambiguous and problematic. Data Collection and Reporting Burden: The sheer volume and velocity of transactions in DeFi networks could make the reporting burden overwhelming and technically infeasible for many platforms. Impact on Market Liquidity: Overly stringent reporting requirements could reduce liquidity in DeFi markets if platforms and users become hesitant to engage in transactions due to compliance concerns. Ultimately, the debate over reporting digital asset sales in DeFi is about striking a balance between regulatory oversight and fostering a thriving, innovative digital economy. The Crypto Industry Impact: Watching with Bated Breath The entire crypto industry impact is keenly observing the Senate’s second vote. This isn’t just about one rule; it’s about the broader regulatory climate in the United States and its implications for the future of crypto innovation. A successful repeal would be a shot in the arm for the industry, signaling that policymakers are listening to concerns and are willing to take a more balanced approach to regulation. Potential Positive Impacts of Rule Repeal: Boost to Investor Confidence: A more favorable regulatory environment could attract more institutional and retail investors to the crypto market. Increased DeFi Adoption: Reduced regulatory uncertainty could encourage wider adoption of DeFi protocols and applications. Job Creation and Economic Growth: A thriving crypto industry can create new jobs and contribute significantly to economic growth in the U.S. Innovation Hub: A supportive regulatory framework can position the U.S. as a global hub for crypto innovation and development. Final Thoughts: A Pivotal Moment for Crypto The Senate’s second vote on the DeFi broker rule is more than just a procedural step; it’s a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. The outcome will send a strong message about the U.S.’s approach to crypto regulation and its willingness to foster innovation in this transformative space. As the crypto world waits with anticipation, the decisions made in the Senate this evening could significantly shape the future trajectory of decentralized finance and the broader digital asset ecosystem.

42461880,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143708,1743051021,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Hopeful Clarity: SEC Nominee Atkins Promises Clear Crypto Guidelines,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/atkins-promises-clear-crypto/,"The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation as Paul Atkins, President Trump’s pick for SEC Chair, has publicly committed to establishing clear and principled digital asset regulations. This news comes as a beacon of hope for many in the crypto space who have long yearned for regulatory certainty. But what exactly does this mean for the future of crypto, and why is Atkins’ nomination such a significant development? Let’s dive into the details of his pledge and explore what it could entail for the evolving world of digital currencies. Why Clear Crypto Guidelines Matter? For years, the cryptocurrency industry has navigated a complex and often ambiguous regulatory landscape. This lack of clarity has been a major pain point, hindering innovation and creating uncertainty for businesses and investors alike. Imagine trying to build a house without knowing the building codes – that’s been the reality for many crypto ventures. Clear crypto guidelines are not just about ticking boxes; they are about fostering a healthy and thriving ecosystem. Here’s why they are so crucial: Reduced Market Uncertainty: Ambiguity breeds volatility. When regulations are unclear, market participants are unsure of the rules of the game, leading to hesitant investment and potential market instability. Clear guidelines provide a stable foundation, encouraging confidence and long-term growth. Fostering Innovation: Innovation thrives in environments where the boundaries are defined, not absent. Knowing the regulatory parameters allows crypto companies to innovate within a framework, rather than constantly fearing unforeseen legal hurdles. This clarity can unlock a wave of new products and services in the digital asset space. Attracting Institutional Investment: Large institutional investors, who could inject significant capital into the crypto market, often shy away due to regulatory uncertainty. Clear rules can pave the way for greater institutional participation, bringing much-needed liquidity and maturity to the market. Investor Protection (Yes, it’s crucial!): While some fear regulation stifles growth, thoughtful regulation is paramount for investor protection . Clear guidelines can help prevent scams, fraud, and market manipulation, ensuring a safer environment for everyone involved. Who is Paul Atkins, the SEC Chair Nominee? Paul Atkins isn’t a newcomer to the world of securities regulation. He brings a wealth of experience to the table, having served as an SEC Commissioner from 2002 to 2008. This prior experience within the agency provides him with a deep understanding of the SEC’s workings and its mandate. Currently, he leads Patomak Global Partners, a regulatory consulting firm. His background suggests a pragmatic and informed approach to regulation. As SEC Chair nominee , his words carry significant weight, signaling a potential shift in the regulatory approach towards digital assets. Atkins’ Pledge: Principled and Clear Crypto Regulations During his appearance before the Senate Banking Committee , Atkins didn’t just vaguely mention crypto regulation. He specifically vowed to establish “clear and principled digital asset regulations” if confirmed. This is a strong statement of intent. He emphasized the need for “coherent rules” to reduce market uncertainty and, crucially, to foster innovation. This balanced approach – promoting both clarity and innovation – is being welcomed by many in the crypto community. Atkins further outlined his priorities, which include: Investor Protection First: He stressed that protecting investors would be a top priority. This aligns with the SEC’s core mission and is a reassuring message for those concerned about the risks in the crypto market. Depoliticizing Securities Oversight: Atkins aims to remove political bias from the SEC’s oversight, suggesting a focus on objective, rule-based decision-making. This could lead to more predictable and consistent regulatory actions. Smart, Tailored Regulation: He advocated for regulation that is “smart” and “tailored” to the specific nuances of the digital asset space, operating within the SEC’s existing authority. This implies a move away from a one-size-fits-all approach and towards regulations that are fit for purpose. The Crypto Investments Controversy: A Hurdle to Overcome? Atkins’ nomination hasn’t been entirely smooth sailing. It has faced delays due to scrutiny over his financial disclosures, particularly concerning his crypto investments . Reports indicate these investments could be as high as $6 million. This has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest. However, Atkins has taken a proactive step, agreeing to divest these holdings if he is confirmed as SEC Chair. This commitment to divestiture attempts to address these concerns and clear the path for his confirmation. The Senate Banking Committee’s approval is the next hurdle, followed by a full Senate vote. The timeline remains uncertain, but the crypto industry is watching closely, hoping for a swift and positive outcome. The potential for clear crypto guidelines under Atkins’ leadership is seen as a significant positive development. What to Expect if Atkins is Confirmed? If Paul Atkins is confirmed as SEC Chair, the cryptocurrency industry can likely anticipate a more defined and structured regulatory environment. While the specifics of these regulations remain to be seen, his statements suggest a focus on: Area Potential Impact Digital Asset Classifications Clearer definitions of what constitutes a security versus other types of digital assets, reducing ambiguity and legal uncertainty. ICO/Token Sales More defined rules for Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and token sales, potentially making it easier for legitimate projects to raise capital compliantly. Crypto Exchanges and Custodians Potentially clearer guidelines for the operation and regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges and custodial services, enhancing investor protection and market integrity. Enforcement Actions While aiming for clarity, the SEC under Atkins may also be expected to take enforcement actions against bad actors in the crypto space to maintain market integrity and protect investors. It’s important to remember that regulatory frameworks take time to develop and implement. Even with Atkins at the helm, the process will likely be gradual and involve consultation with industry stakeholders. However, his commitment to clarity is a significant first step and signals a potentially more constructive and innovation-friendly approach from the SEC. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope for Crypto Regulation? Paul Atkins’ nomination and his pledge for clear crypto guidelines represent a potentially pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. His experience, coupled with his stated commitment to principled and smart regulation, offers a glimmer of hope for a more stable and predictable future for digital assets. While challenges remain, and the Senate confirmation process is still underway, the prospect of clearer rules is undoubtedly a positive signal for the crypto market. The industry waits with bated breath to see if this promise of clarity will translate into a regulatory framework that fosters both innovation and investor protection, paving the way for the next phase of crypto’s evolution.

42462172,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143709,1743051618,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Frustrating Delay: ChatGPT’s Exciting AI Image Feature Held Back for Free Users,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/chatgpt-ai-image-delay-free/,"The buzz around ChatGPT’s groundbreaking AI image generation capabilities has been palpable, and for good reason! The promise of creating stunning visuals directly within your chat interface was incredibly exciting. However, if you’re a free ChatGPT user eagerly awaiting this feature, there’s some disappointing news. OpenAI has announced a delay in rolling out this fantastic tool to free users. Let’s dive into why this delay has occurred and what it means for you. Why the Delay in ChatGPT’s AI Image Generation for Free Users? OpenAI CEO Sam Altman himself broke the news, citing unexpectedly high demand as the primary reason for the delay . In a post on X, Altman stated that the “Images in ChatGPT are wayyyy more popular than we expected (and we had pretty high expectations).” This surge in popularity has seemingly overwhelmed OpenAI’s current infrastructure, leading to the decision to postpone the rollout for free users. Think of it like a viral product launch – everyone wants it at once, and the servers are struggling to keep up! Here’s a breakdown of the situation: Overwhelming Demand: The AI image feature has become an instant hit, exceeding even OpenAI’s optimistic projections. Capacity Constraints: OpenAI is facing limitations in its current computing capacity to handle the massive influx of users wanting to generate images. Prioritizing Paid Users: Currently, the feature has only been launched for ChatGPT Pro, Plus, and Teams subscribers. This suggests a prioritization of paying customers to ensure a smooth experience for them, while free users will have to wait. What Does This Delay Mean for Free ChatGPT Users and AI Image Generation Access? For millions of free ChatGPT users who were looking forward to experimenting with AI image generation , this delay is undoubtedly a setback. It means you’ll have to wait longer to access this innovative feature directly within ChatGPT. While it’s disappointing, it’s important to understand the context and potential reasons behind this decision. Here’s what you should consider: Limited Access for Now: The AI image feature is currently exclusive to paid subscribers. If you’re keen to use it immediately, upgrading to ChatGPT Plus or Pro might be an option. Patience is Key: OpenAI hasn’t provided a specific timeline for when the feature will be available to free users. However, Altman’s statement suggests they are working on addressing the capacity issues. Alternative Options: In the meantime, there are other AI image generation tools available online, such as DALL-E 2 (also from OpenAI, but accessible separately), Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion. You can explore these alternatives while waiting for the ChatGPT feature to become available. Is OpenAI’s Infrastructure Prepared for the Future of AI? This isn’t the first time OpenAI has faced capacity-related challenges. Remember the Sora launch in December? Sign-ups were quickly disabled due to similar issues. These recurring hiccups raise questions about whether OpenAI’s infrastructure is adequately prepared for the rapid growth and adoption of its AI technologies. However, there’s a glimmer of hope on the horizon. OpenAI’s ambitious $500 billion “Stargate” data center project could be the long-term solution to these capacity constraints. This massive investment signals OpenAI’s commitment to scaling its infrastructure to meet the ever-increasing demands of its AI models and user base. Stargate, if successful, promises to provide the robust computing power needed to support features like ChatGPT ‘s image generation and future AI innovations. Navigating the Wait for Free AI Image Generation in ChatGPT While the delay of AI image generation for free users is frustrating, it also highlights the immense popularity and potential of these technologies. OpenAI is clearly grappling with the challenges of scaling its services to meet this unprecedented demand. For now, free users will need to exercise patience. Keep an eye on official OpenAI announcements and tech news outlets for updates on when this exciting feature will finally become accessible to everyone. In the meantime, explore alternative AI image generators, or consider if upgrading to a paid ChatGPT plan aligns with your needs. The future of AI is undoubtedly visual, and while there’s a temporary hurdle, the path forward promises incredible creative possibilities.

On 27th March, the Korean government’s Public Officials Ethics Committee released the regular updates on public officials’ assets for 2025. According to the Korean Cultural Daily, 411 out of 2,047 public officials (about 20.1%) hold cryptocurrency, with a total value of 14.4 billion won (around $9.8 million). Notably, two out of 10 high-ranking public officials held virtual assets and the average holding per person was found to be 35.07 million won. Seoul City Councilor Kim Hye-young Tops The List Among them, Seoul City Councilor Kim Hye-young tops the list, with an impressive 1.7 billion won, which is about $1.27 million in Digital assets. Council Member Kim owns 16 types of cryptocurrencies, including 0.00144591 Bitcoin. Additionally, her spouse and eldest son also hold ETH, DOGE, and XRP. She reported holding 0.01226935 Ethereum, around 472 Dogecoins, and approximately 519,004 Ripples, along with about 3,336 Ripples owned by her eldest son. Seoul City Councilor Choi Min-gyu stood second with a reported 1.62 billion KRW in virtual assets, including nearly 410,000 Ripples and thousands of Artidiums and Ads. Close behind is, Kim Ki-hwan, CEO of Busan-Ulsan Expressway, with 1.43 billion KRW in crypto, holding over 150,000 Luna Classics and a range of other altcoins. Growing Trend of Government Officials Investing In Crypto Besides, several high-ranking public officials including Kim Dae-hwan, Oh Moon-kyo, and Park Byeong-chun, have significant cryptocurrency holdings. These officials are part of the top 10, with assets ranging from KRW 270 million to over KRW 1.3 billion. The disclosure of their crypto assets follows new regulations requiring public officials to report their holdings. This marks a growing trend of government figures investing in virtual currencies, highlighting a shift in how traditional officials are engaging with the evolving financial landscape. The involvement of public officials in cryptocurrency has sparked both interest and debate. In South Korea, the government’s move to mandate the disclosure of public officials’ cryptocurrency holdings aims to enhance transparency and accountability. Conflict of Interest In the U.S., some officials, including President Trump, have shown interest in cryptocurrencies, with Trump proposing a Bitcoin reserve to boost financial innovation. However, this involvement has raised some concerns ove conflicts of interest. Trump’s involvement in the crypto space has also drawn criticism, with his family’s ties to World Liberty Financial and the launch of a memecoin in January raising concerns about close connections between the administration and the crypto industry.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Ethereum|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ETH|BTC|LUNC|ALTCOIN|ASIA|DOGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-27 05:04:43

The price is rising and might aim for a fresh move toward the $640 resistance. BNB price is moving higher above the $620 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $630 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $627 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $615 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Eyes Upside Break After forming a base above the $600 level, BNB price started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $618 and $610 resistance levels. It even recovered above the $625 level, like Ethereum and Bitcoin . There was a break above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $645 swing high to the $615 low. The price is now trading below $630 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $628 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $627 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The next resistance sits near the $630 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $645 swing high to the $615 low. A clear move above the $630 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $638. A close above the $638 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $650 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $665 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $630 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $622 level. The next major support is near the $615 level. The main support sits at $600. If there is a downside break below the $600 support, the price could drop toward the $585 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $565 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BNB/USD is currently above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $622 and $615.

His remarks, released in prepared testimony ahead of Thursday’s Senate confirmation hearing, position Atkins as a crypto-friendly regulator seeking to rein in what he described as burdensome and overly politicized oversight. Atkins, who previously served as an SEC commissioner under President George W. Bush, criticized the agency’s approach to crypto regulation under the Biden admin, calling it “ambiguous and non-existent” and a barrier to innovation. “Since 2017, as I have led industry efforts to develop best practices for the digital asset industry, I have seen how ambiguous and non-existent regulations for digital assets create uncertainty in the market and inhibit innovation,” he said. SEC Poised for Policy Overhaul as Atkins Pledges Pro-Growth Crypto Framework In his testimony, Atkins pledged to work alongside fellow commissioners and lawmakers to establish clear rules that foster innovation while protecting investors. U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION CHAIR NOMINEE PAUL ATKINS PLEDGES TO PROVIDE 'RATIONAL, COHERENT AND PRINCIPLED' APPROACH TO CRYPTO REGULATION -TESTIMONY — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) March 26, 2025 “It is time to reset priorities and return common sense to the SEC,” he added, arguing that excessive regulation has stifled capital formation and confused retail investors with overly complex disclosures. The confirmation hearing comes as the SEC begins reassessing its stance on digital assets under a new administration. Since January, the Trump White House has issued several pro-crypto executive orders and is actively working to roll back regulations adopted under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Paul Atkins Holds Up to $6M in Crypto-Related Assets, Faces Questions Over FTX Ties Atkins enters the confirmation process with notable financial ties to the crypto sector. In an ethics filing released Tuesday, he disclosed up to $6m in crypto-related investments , including equity stakes in Anchorage Digital and tokenization platform Securitize. He also reported between $1m and $5m in the crypto investment fund Off the Chain Capital, where he is a limited partner. While none of the holdings include Bitcoin, the disclosure highlights Atkins’ deep exposure to the industry he may soon be charged with regulating. Together with his wife, Sarah Humphreys, Atkins reported total assets of up to $327m, mostly derived from his consulting firm Patomak Global Partners and her family’s business, Tamko Building Products. The couple’s combined holdings could exceed $588m based on upper-range estimates. But Atkins’ nomination has already drawn fire from Senate Democrats. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a longtime crypto skeptic, has demanded clarity on his ties to collapsed exchange FTX , which is listed as a creditor of Patomak in bankruptcy filings. In a letter this week, Warren urged Atkins to explain his advisory work and how he would avoid conflicts of interest in overseeing digital asset markets.

As Bonk (BONK) rallies 35% and Dogs (DOGS) makes waves on Telegram, BTFD Coin (BTFD) is handing out a one-time-only LAUNCH100 code that doubles your tokens instantly. But blink and you’ll miss the best meme coin to buy today—this bonus is gone by March 30. With a live P2E game, 90% staking rewards , and 2900% ROI potential, BTFD is more than just a meme coin. It’s a movement. The presale is now in Stage 15 at just $0.0002 with over $6.41M raised and 72B+ coins sold to 11,600+ holders. Investors are piling in—because no one wants to miss this dip. So how does BONK’s trend-break and DOGS’ Telegram-powered push stack up against BTFD’s insane staking returns and game rewards? Let’s break it all down—because this presale window is closing fast. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Best Meme Coin to Buy Today for 100% Bonus and 90% APY Can you imagine doubling your coins before they hit the market? That’s exactly what’s happening with BTFD Coin. Right now, investors can use the LAUNCH100 bonus code during Stage 15 and instantly get 100% more tokens—2X the value on the same dollar. For example, if you invest $6,000 in Stage 15 at $0.0002, you’ll bag 30 million BTFD Coins. Use the bonus code LAUNCH100, and suddenly you’re sitting on 60 million tokens. Once the listing hits $0.0006, that investment could balloon into $36,000—without even factoring in staking. And let’s talk about staking: BTFD Coin offers a jaw-dropping 90% APY to those who lock their tokens. The staking feature went live back on December 2, 2024, and has quickly become one of the most lucrative passive income plays in the meme coin space. Imagine watching your stack grow every month while others pray for green candles. This isn’t some vague promise. The BTFD presale started at just $0.000004 and is now nearing its final stage. Over $6.41M has been raised, 72 billion coins sold, and 11,600+ holders have joined the Bulls Squad. And let’s not forget the Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that went full throttle on January 1, 2025—real-time rewards for real-time fun. Want to Know How to Snag that LAUNCH100 Bonus Before it Disappears? Step 1: Visit the BTFD Presale site and connect your wallet. Step 2: Enter LAUNCH100 in all caps and hit apply. Step 3: Buy your tokens and double your bag on the spot. This meme coin presale isn’t just about hype—it’s about building long-term value through real utility, insane rewards, and a community-driven roadmap. On top of all that, BTFD launched a killer referral program. Share your code, and if you make the top 20 leaderboard by the end of the month, you earn 10% of all your referrals’ purchases in BTFD tokens. Meanwhile, your referrals get 10% extra BTFD when they invest $50 or more. It’s a win-win hustle. The clock’s ticking, and this 100% bonus window slams shut on March 30. Once it’s gone, so is your chance to enter with double the value. BTFD isn’t just the best meme coin to buy today—it’s the best shot at meme coin dominance in 2025. Bonk (BONK) – Breaking Out and Gaining Traction Bonk just pulled a classic reversal, breaking above its descending trendline with a juicy 35% weekly gain. With daily trading volume now topping $100 million and its market cap sitting around $1.1 billion, BONK is back on the radar. The resistance zone between $0.0000158 and $0.0000225 could be the next major battleground. Still, BONK is about 75% down from its all-time high in November 2024, and meme coin volatility is no joke. But if momentum keeps pushing, BONK may have more room to bark. Dogs (DOGS) – Telegram’s Favorite Pup Is Barking Louder Dogs (DOGS) is making moves on the TON Blockchain, climbing 16.5% in just a week. The Telegram-powered meme coin is sitting at $0.00016741 with a market cap of $86.31 million. DOGS is drawing serious hype, especially from users embracing its dog mascot created by Telegram’s founder. Still, it’s a risky play—DOGS is down nearly 90% from its all-time high. That said, its community-first design and strong brand connection are keeping it alive in the dog-eat-dog meme coin arena. Final Verdict: Is BTFD the Best Meme Coin to Buy Today? You tell us—would you rather chase pumps or position yourself before liftoff? BONK and DOGS are both delivering newsworthy gains, but neither comes close to what the BTFD presale is offering right now. With a 100% token bonus, a 90% APY staking system, and an ROI that could hit 2900%, BTFD isn’t just another meme coin—it’s the one investors are watching like hawks. Based on what we’re seeing in the market and across social platforms, this presale is shaping up to be a watershed moment. That’s why BTFD is hands down the best meme coin to buy today—for the rewards, for the tech, and for the future. Don’t wait till the presale ends. March 30 is the deadline to claim your double tokens . Buy the dip. BTFD or get left behind.

Meanwhile, the majority of altcoins are trying to recover from recent losses . Experts are noticing an interesting shift, as altcoins begin to break trends and take the lead. For months, Bitcoin was the dominant force, but as it slowed down, altcoins started to drive the market’s correction. However, Matt Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors, recently discussed risks facing the markets, especially in light of the current economic climate. Here are three key reasons why markets may be turning bearish: Weakened Consumer Confidence : Consumer confidence dropped to its lowest point since 2021, hitting 92.9 in March. This suggests that Americans are feeling uneasy about the economy, and if spending slows down, it could hurt the market, especially in the consumer sector. Consumer discretionary stocks in the S&P 500 are down 9% this year, compared to a 2% decline in the overall market. Bearish Positioning in Consumer Discretionary : There are signs of a bearish outlook in the consumer discretionary sector, with $800 million in outflows in March alone. Options data also shows a higher number of puts compared to calls, and short interest is rising. A lot of this bearish sentiment comes from poor performance in stocks like Tesla and broader economic factors. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Four Reasons Why XRP Price May Hit $20 Soon , Uncertainty in Economic Data : Worries over inflation and weak economic data, like GDP forecasts from the Atlanta Fed, are also affecting market sentiment.

It looked like someone was manipulating the market, putting the exchange at risk of losing $12 million. But before things got worse, Hyperliquid’s team stepped in, fixed the issue, and turned the loss into a $700K profit. To stop any more trouble, they shut down trading for JELLYJELLY. How One Whale Nearly Broke the System The chaos started when a trader holding 124.6 million JELLYJELLY tokens, worth $4.5 million, placed an $8 million short bet on Hyperliquid. This forced the platform’s liquidity vault to take on the risk. But then, another wallet likely controlled by the same trader opened a massive long position at the same time. This caused JELLYJELLY’s price to skyrocket, leading to mass liquidations and huge profits for the trader. Arkham later revealed that this was a deliberate strategy to exploit leverage and drain funds from Hyperliquid. Hyperliquid just got exploited. What happened? A trader deposited $7.167M on 3 separate Hyperliquid accounts within 5 minutes of each other. He then made leveraged trades on an illiquid coin, JELLYJELLY. However, he ended up losing money, and is down almost $1M unless… pic.twitter.com/uNyMwLS5Sc — Arkham (@arkham) March 26, 2025 But the plan backfired when the trader’s accounts were restricted to reduce-only orders. This meant they could no longer open new trades and had to start selling off tokens from the first account to recover some of their funds, despite still having millions in unrealized gains. The attacker’s last withdrawal was at 12:43 UTC. However, he continued to attempt withdrawals – but was unable to, since his account was restricted to reduce-only orders at 12:50 UTC. However, his accounts still had millions of dollars in unrealized PnL. Instead of withdrawing,… pic.twitter.com/T9XcL35rCr — Arkham (@arkham) March 26, 2025 As JELLYJELLY’s price kept climbing, Hyperliquid’s liquidity vault faced the risk of a massive wipeout. If the token’s market cap kept rising, the vault could have lost everything. Seeing the surge in trading, major exchanges like Binance and OKX stepped in, listing perpetual futures for JELLYJELLY to capitalize on the hype. Hyperliquid Pulls the Plug With the situation escalating, Hyperliquid validators stepped in and reset JELLYJELLY’s price to $0.0095—the level where the whale had originally placed their short position. This allowed the platform to liquidate 392 million JELLYJELLY tokens, converting a multi-million-dollar disaster into a manageable $703K profit. However, to prevent further manipulation, Hyperliquid immediately closed all open JELLYJELLY positions and removed the token from its platform. The team also promised to reimburse affected users, with compensation set to be distributed automatically, except for flagged addresses suspected of being involved in the scheme. A Blow to Hyperliquid’s Reputation? Hyperliquid’s response to the crisis drew mixed reactions. Some praised its quick action, while critics like Bitget CEO Gracy Chen argued it acted more like a centralized exchange. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes also questioned the handling of the situation. This marks Hyperliquid’s second major liquidity scare in just two weeks. Earlier, a whale’s $200 million Ethereum long liquidation caused a $4 million loss for its liquidity vault. The repeated turmoil has shaken confidence, sending Hyperliquid’s native token, HYPE, down over 12% in a day and over 30% for the month. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

42463025,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143711,1743052817,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking! Trump’s 25% Car Tariff Unleashes Chaos in Global Auto Industry,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-car-tariff-auto-industry/,"Buckle up, folks! The global auto industry is bracing for a seismic shift as former President Donald Trump has reportedly slapped a hefty 25% tariff on all vehicles manufactured outside the United States. According to a Wu Blockchain post on X, citing Bloomberg, this dramatic move is set to take effect on April 2nd, with enforcement beginning April 3rd. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a colossal increase on top of the existing 2.5% import duty, potentially reshaping the landscape of car imports and the automotive market as we know it. Let’s dive into what this shocking development means for consumers, manufacturers, and the broader economy. What Exactly is This New Trump Car Tariff? In essence, the Trump car tariff is a significant tax levied on vehicles imported into the United States that are not manufactured within the country. Imagine it like this: for every foreign-made car shipped to the U.S., an additional 25% of its value will be added as a tariff, right at the border. This is separate from, and in addition to, the already existing 2.5% import duty. The announcement, as reported by Bloomberg and highlighted by Wu Blockchain, indicates that this policy is aimed squarely at vehicles fully assembled outside of the U.S. Interestingly, parts manufactured in the U.S. and used in vehicles assembled abroad will be exempt, hinting at a strategy to incentivize domestic parts production even for foreign automakers. Why the Sudden Auto Import Tariff Hike? While the exact motivations behind this sudden and substantial auto import tariff increase aren’t explicitly stated in the announcement, we can infer potential reasons based on past trade policies and Trump’s economic philosophies. Likely drivers could include: Boosting Domestic Manufacturing: A core tenet of Trump’s economic agenda has been to revitalize American manufacturing. By making imported cars significantly more expensive, the administration aims to make domestically produced vehicles more competitive, encouraging consumers to buy American-made cars and prompting automakers to shift or expand production within the U.S. National Security Concerns: While not explicitly mentioned in this announcement, previous tariffs under the Trump administration have been justified using national security arguments. The rationale could be extended to the auto industry, deeming a strong domestic auto manufacturing base as vital for national economic security. Trade Deficit Reduction: Another key focus of past trade policies has been to reduce the U.S. trade deficit. Imposing tariffs is a tool to discourage imports, theoretically narrowing the trade gap. Political Signaling: Announcing such a significant tariff could also be a strategic political move, signaling a tough stance on trade and potentially exerting pressure on trading partners in ongoing or future trade negotiations. Who Will Bear the Brunt of These US Auto Tariffs ? The impact of these US auto tariffs will ripple across various sectors. Here’s a breakdown of who is likely to be most affected: Stakeholder Potential Impact Consumers Likely to face higher prices for imported cars. Reduced choice and potentially increased prices even for domestic cars due to reduced competition and potential price adjustments across the board. Foreign Automakers Significant decrease in competitiveness in the U.S. market. Potential reduction in sales and market share. May need to reconsider production strategies, possibly shifting production to the U.S. or absorbing tariff costs, impacting profitability. U.S. Automakers Potentially benefit from increased domestic demand and reduced competition from imports. However, they may also face increased costs if they import parts, although U.S.-made parts are exempt in foreign-assembled vehicles, this might still affect global supply chains. Auto Parts Suppliers (Global) Complex impact. U.S. parts suppliers might benefit. Foreign suppliers, especially those not integrated into U.S. supply chains, could face challenges. Exemption for U.S. parts in foreign cars adds complexity. Economy (Overall) Potential for inflation due to higher car prices. Uncertainty in trade relations. Possible retaliatory tariffs from other countries. Potential benefits to specific U.S. manufacturing sectors, but broader economic consequences need careful evaluation. The Impact on Your Wallet: Understanding the Foreign Car Tax Let’s get down to brass tacks: how will this foreign car tax impact your pocket? Imagine you’re eyeing a popular imported sedan priced at $30,000. Under the new 25% tariff, the price could effectively increase by $7,500 (25% of $30,000), plus the original 2.5% duty. This means the same car could now cost you closer to $38,250 (including original duty, assuming duty is calculated on the original price before tariff). This price hike could make purchasing a new car significantly more expensive for American consumers, especially those who prefer or rely on imported brands known for their fuel efficiency, specific features, or price points. Furthermore, the ripple effect could extend beyond just imported vehicles. Reduced competition from imports might allow domestic manufacturers to potentially raise prices as well, impacting the entire car market. The extent of this price increase will depend on various factors, including how automakers decide to absorb or pass on these tariff costs and how consumer demand reacts to these changes. Navigating the Auto Industry Impact : What Happens Next? The auto industry impact of this tariff is poised to be substantial and multifaceted. Here are some potential near-term and long-term consequences: Immediate Price Hikes: Expect to see price increases on imported vehicles relatively quickly as automakers adjust to the new tariff structure. Shifting Production Strategies: Foreign automakers might accelerate plans to establish or expand production facilities within the U.S. to circumvent the tariffs. This could lead to new jobs in the U.S. but also significant capital investment shifts. Trade Negotiations and Retaliation: This move could escalate trade tensions with countries that export cars to the U.S. Retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports are a distinct possibility, impacting other sectors beyond the auto industry. Consumer Behavior Changes: Consumers might delay car purchases, opt for used cars, or shift preferences towards domestic brands or smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles if import prices become prohibitive. Legal Challenges: The legality and implementation of these tariffs could face legal challenges, potentially leading to delays or modifications in the policy. Conclusion: A Road of Uncertainty for the Auto World President Trump’s imposition of a 25% tariff on foreign-made cars is a dramatic intervention that injects significant uncertainty into the global automotive industry. While proponents might argue it will bolster domestic manufacturing and jobs, the potential downsides – including higher prices for consumers, strained international trade relations, and broader economic disruptions – are equally significant. The coming months will be crucial in observing how automakers, consumers, and governments react to this seismic policy shift, and whether it achieves its intended goals or sets the stage for unintended consequences.

Gillibrand Pushes for Stablecoin Limits to Shield Local Banks,https://coinpaper.com/8220/us-sen-gillibrand-pushes-for-stablecoin-limits-to-shield-local-banks,"Gillibrand also warned that yield-bearing tokens could undermine community banking. Meanwhile, Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon also spoke at the DC Blockchain Summit, and announced a July launch for the state’s USD-backed stablecoin. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce echoed calls for clearer, lasting crypto rules, as the SEC pivots under the Trump administration. With Congress ramping up legislation and Paul Atkins poised for confirmation as the SEC Chair, the US is on the brink of reshaping its digital asset regulatory landscape. Gillibrand Defends Local Banks Against Stablecoin Disruption At the 2025 DC Blockchain Summit that is held in Washington, DC, US Senator Kirsten Gillibrand voiced her strong support for stricter regulations on stablecoin issuers to protect the traditional banking sector. The New York Democrat argued that allowing stablecoin providers to offer yield-bearing products could significantly undercut local banks, which rely on customer deposits to issue home mortgages and small business loans. According to Gillibrand, if consumers shift their funds away from local banks in favor of interest-bearing stablecoins, it could lead to the collapse of key financial services that communities depend on. Sen. Gillibrand at the DC Blockchain Summit She also praised New York's financial regulatory framework as one of the most robust globally, and advocated for the adoption of similar standards across both state and federal levels to ensure consumer protection and legal compliance in the digital finance space. Her remarks were tied to the broader legislative effort behind the GENIUS Act, which is a stablecoin regulation bill that is co-sponsored by Gillibrand and introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty in February. The main goal of the GENIUS Act is to create a comprehensive framework for the issuance and oversight of fiat-backed digital tokens. It was updated on March 10 to include enhanced anti-money laundering (AML) provisions, stricter know your customer (KYC) rules, financial transparency standards, and safeguards for consumers. The Senate Banking Committee approved the bill with an 18-6 vote on March 13, moving it closer to a full vote in both chambers of Congress before potentially being signed into law by President Donald Trump. However, the bill has faced some criticism from members of the crypto industry who see it as a covert move toward establishing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) through private actors. Jean Rausis , co-founder of the decentralized trading platform Smardex, warned that centralized stablecoins could become tools for financial surveillance and censorship. He warned that such systems might eventually give governments the power to freeze assets or block people from accessing financial services entirely. Wyoming Stablecoin Set for July Launch Despite Gilibrand’s concerns, Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon announced that the state’s highly anticipated stablecoin could be ready for launch by July. This is a huge milestone in the state’s years-long effort to embrace digital asset innovation. At the DC Blockchain Summit on March 26, Gordon talked about the efficiency of the Wyoming state government in adopting blockchain technology. In fact, the Wyoming Stable Token Commission revealed that it formally partnered with LayerZero, an interoperability protocol, to handle token development and distribution. Executive Director Anthony Apollo confirmed that Wyoming stable tokens are already live on several test networks. The project traces its roots back to February of 2022, when Wyoming lawmakers introduced the Wyoming Stable Token Act . The legislation proposed a state-issued stablecoin that is pegged to the US dollar and fully redeemable for fiat currency. It was signed into law in March of 2023, and allowed the state treasury to assemble a team of financial and technical professionals to oversee the stablecoin’s issuance and supply management. Since then, the state steadily built the infrastructure required to bring the stablecoin to market. In August 2024, Governor Gordon told attendees at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium that the launch was being targeted for Q1 2025. Taking a very different approach from Gilibrand, he also criticized the dominance of “too big to fail” institutions in US finance and described the Federal Reserve Bank as a barrier to innovation. The Wyoming stablecoin will be backed by short-term US Treasury Bills and repurchase agreements, providing a secure and liquid foundation for its value. Apollo also advocated for putting the state's public budget on-chain , and argued that blockchain technology can improve transparency, accountability, and government efficiency. Wyoming is represented in the Senate by crypto-friendly lawmaker Cynthia Lummis, and continues to position itself as a leader in digital asset regulation and innovation. Hester Peirce Calls for Lasting Crypto Rules SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has called for more permanent and transparent regulatory structures for the crypto industry that can endure changes in political leadership. Peirce also spoke at the DC Blockchain Summit on March 26, and she placed a lot of emphasis on the importance of rulemaking and congressional legislation over temporary agency guidance, which can shift with each administration. She specifically argued that the current lack of clarity leaves developers too focused on legal ambiguity, particularly around the Howey test, rather than innovation. Peirce also pointed out that she wants clearer boundaries for what falls under the SEC’s jurisdiction and straightforward guidance on how projects can proceed if they fall within that scope. Hester Peirce speaking at the DC Blockchain Summit Her comments were made at a time when the SEC recently dropped several high-profile enforcement actions against crypto firms, including Coinbase, Ripple, Kraken, and Immutable. This shift in posture is being interpreted by some people in the industry as a political move that is aligned with President Donald Trump’s administration, which has been viewed as more industry-friendly. Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda led the commission during this transitional period, but his leadership may soon change. Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner and Trump’s recent nominee, is scheduled to testify before the Senate Banking Committee on March 27. His confirmation could pave the way for an even more favorable regulatory environment for digital assets. Atkins holds investments in Securitize, which is a real-world asset tokenization platform, and is connected to a consulting firm linked to the collapsed exchange FTX. His ties to the industry and prior experience made him a very popular figure among crypto advocates, though it remains to be seen whether the full Senate will confirm him for a term that will run through 2031. Meanwhile, the 119th Congress has shown increasing interest in establishing a clear regulatory framework for digital assets. A recently proposed market structure bill aims to better define the responsibilities of the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in overseeing crypto markets. On his third day back in office, Trump signed an executive order launching a working group to explore comprehensive stablecoin regulations, which means that the administration is working hard already to create a much more structured approach to crypto policy.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-27 05:26:07

Member states should now look at other options listed in the recently unveiled “Rearm Europe/ Readiness 2030” plan as the Union is yet to figure out how to repay loans used for post-pandemic recovery funding, the European official suggested. Brussels not prepared to fund defense readiness with EU debt For now, EU nations are expected to utilize instruments already set out in the “Readiness 2030” plan rather than rely on joint debt for military spending, the Union’s defense chief has indicated. Andrius Kubilius told Euronews that the bloc is not ready to issue Eurobonds for that purpose. Ahead of discussions on the next Multiannual Financial Framework ( MMF ), the commissioner emphasized that the European Union will have to spend a significant portion of its long-term budget to pay back pandemic-related debt, unless another solution is found. The EU has to decide first how to cover debt resulting from recovery grants issued in the wake of Covid-19. Annual repayments are expected in the range of €25 billion to €30 billion (over $32 billion), amounting to 20% of the approximately €1.2 trillion MMF which represents 1% of the EU’s economic output. “Eurobonds means that the European Union will have a bigger debt, which will need to be serviced again by all the member states, and now we have in some ways a challenge on how to repay the existing debt,” explained Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania and ex-leader of the country’s conservative Homeland Union party. PIC – https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/photo-details/P-066064~2F00-29 Andrius Kubilius, EU commissioner for defense and space, Brussels, March 19, 2025 (Source: EC Audiovisual Service) The European Commission (EC) unveiled its “Rearm Europe” plan earlier this month and later rebranded it to “Readiness 2030” after objections from Italy and Spain. Their prime ministers called for widening the scope of the term to encompass spheres beyond simply buying armaments such as cybersecurity, anti-terrorism, artificial intelligence, and telecommunications. The initiative seeks to ramp up the defense capabilities of EU member states and expand military production across the Old Continent. Its key goal is to mobilize up to €800 billion for defense and security over the next four years. EU aims for 3.5% of GDP defense spending target in member states The bulk of that total, around €650 billion, is supposed to come from member states increasing their defense spending to up to 3.5% of gross domestic product (GDP). To achieve that, the Commission has come up with a set of proposals, including to relax fiscal rules and attract private capital. “For the next four years, in some kind of idealistic scenario, member states will start to spend 3.5% of GDP, so it will be €2.4 trillion spent on defense. The question is: will it cover all the needs,” commented Andrius Kubilius who expects to have more clarity on the matter in the next couple of months. The remaining €150 billion should be provided by a newly established financial loan instrument called Security Action for Europe ( SAFE ). The latter will allow the executive body in Brussels to issue bonds and borrow on the capital markets to lend funds to the EU countries. Within the scope of SAFE, the EC requires at least 65% of the value of some items, such as missiles, small drones and ammunition, to be purchased from within the EU, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), the European Economic Area (EEA), or from war-torn Ukraine. “We want to incentivize member states to spend more money on European production,” Kubilius pointed out. The Commission has estimated that the European Union will need hundreds of billions of euros in fresh investments by the end of the decade in order to remain competitive on the global stage, fight climate change and address rising defense needs. Last week, the EC presented a plan to steer some of the €10 trillion in citizens’ savings toward capital markets. Meanwhile, Europe’s economic powerhouse, Germany, removed its constitutional “debt brake” to be able to borrow funds for infrastructure, climate and defense projects.

While Coinbase Ventures remains focused on infrastructure, stablecoins, and real-world applications, Bitso is expanding its regional reach with the launch of a Mexican peso-pegged stablecoin aimed at improving cross-border payments. Bitso Launches Peso-Pegged Stablecoin on Arbitrum to Drive Financial Efficiency in Latin America Bitso Business, the enterprise division of leading Mexican crypto exchange Bitso, has unveiled a new peso-pegged stablecoin , MXNB, to be issued on the Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution Arbitrum. According to a March 26 announcement, MXNB will be fully backed by Mexican pesos on a 1:1 basis and will be managed by Juno, a newly created subsidiary of Bitso. The firm promises regular independent audits of the reserves, with transparent attestation reports to be published publicly on the token’s dedicated website. “Global companies face significant monetary challenges when it comes to serving customers in new markets and conducting cross-border payments, including high intermediary costs and inefficient transaction times,” said Ben Reid, Head of Stablecoins at Bitso Business. He emphasized that MXNB could offer a more efficient, faster, and lower-cost alternative to the traditional financial rails for businesses and investors seeking exposure to Latin America. The launch of MXNB comes at a time when Mexico’s remittance market is booming, and cryptocurrency is playing an increasingly vital role in enabling cross-border transfers. According to the World Bank , Mexico received a staggering $61 billion in remittances in 2023, largely from the United States, making it the second-largest recipient of remittances globally. Crypto research firm Chainalysis noted in October that Mexico is one of the most critical markets for crypto-based remittances, citing high usage rates and growing infrastructure. From July 2023 to June 2024, Latin America received $415 billion in crypto transactions, a 42.5% increase year-over-year — the second-fastest growing region after sub-Saharan Africa. In this context, MXNB could act as a liquidity bridge between the fiat peso and the global crypto economy, particularly in regions where financial services are expensive or limited. The use of Arbitrum, a high-throughput Ethereum Layer-2 network, is expected to reduce costs and latency compared to mainnet Ethereum or traditional remittance corridors. While Bitso’s move is strategic, MXNB enters a growing but competitive space. Tether’s MXNT, launched in 2022 across Ethereum, Polygon, and Tron, already has a presence in the region. At the time, Tether’s CTO and now-CEO Paolo Ardoino called it a tool to protect Mexican users from inflation and facilitate a smoother fiat-to-crypto transition. Other players include MMXN, backed by Monetary Digital, and MXNe, a stablecoin launched in 2024 by US-based Brale on the Solana and Stellar networks. Each stablecoin issuer has targeted niche use cases such as fintech applications, remittances, or DeFi integrations, indicating a maturing and diversifying Mexican crypto economy. Despite the competition, Bitso’s advantage lies in its local dominance, boasting over 7 million users across Latin America, and its robust regional infrastructure that supports both retail and institutional users. The company’s recent Latin America Crypto Landscape report found that stablecoin purchases on Bitso surged by 9% in recent months, as users seek refuge from local fiat volatility by turning to USDC and USDT. Building Trust Through Transparency Juno, the entity managing MXNB, will operate independently of Bitso to ensure transparency and regulatory clarity. This governance structure aligns with best practices for stablecoin issuance globally, especially as scrutiny from financial watchdogs continues to intensify. By offering public audits, Juno seeks to instill trust among both institutional and retail users wary of opaque backing practices, a concern that has plagued some stablecoin issuers in the past. The launch of MXNB marks a pivotal moment for Mexico’s crypto ecosystem. As businesses in Latin America look for faster, cheaper, and more secure financial rails, Bitso’s stablecoin could serve as a linchpin connecting the digital economy with real-world fiat value. The combination of fiat-backing, Arbitrum’s scalability, and Bitso’s market reach may position MXNB to become a cornerstone asset for cross-border commerce, remittances, and decentralized finance in Mexico and beyond. With crypto-based remittances on the rise, and stablecoins emerging as reliable financial tools for inflation-hit economies, MXNB could prove to be more than just a new token — it could be the digital peso for the next generation of Latin American finance. Coinbase Ventures Doubles Down on Crypto’s Future, Eyes 2025 as Banner Year for Blockchain VC As crypto markets continue to experience cycles of volatility, venture capital appears unfazed, seeing turbulence not as a threat but as a filter that exposes true innovation. At the forefront of this resilient outlook is Coinbase Ventures, the investment arm of the US-based crypto giant Coinbase, which remains steadfast in its commitment to backing the next wave of blockchain and Web3 builders. In an interview, Hoolie Tejwani, head of Coinbase Ventures, outlined a long-term thesis that positions crypto not as a fleeting trend but as a foundational transformation — a technological evolution just entering its adolescence. We’re “one decade into a 30-year paradigm shift,” Tejwani said. “What we’re seeing as investors is an exponential technology change curve that is transforming the way people interact, how value flows, and how economies are run. And it’s being shaped by the people who are building on crypto infrastructure.” While some investment firms have pulled back due to market uncertainty, Coinbase Ventures is taking the opposite approach — investing steadily through all market conditions, with its eyes on the “big picture. Its portfolio is already stacked with some of the most influential names in crypto, including Arbitrum, Dune, EigenLayer, Etherscan, OpenSea, Optimism, and Uniswap. These are not just token projects or trading platforms — they are infrastructure builders, data aggregators, and decentralized systems that are shaping the backbone of Web3. A significant area of focus for Coinbase Ventures in 2025 is the rapid growth and normalization of stablecoins — particularly US dollar-pegged assets like USDC and USDT. Tejwani pointed to a shifting regulatory landscape in the US that could supercharge adoption. The recent advancement of the GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins), which cleared the Senate Banking Committee in an 18-6 vote, has been hailed as a milestone. If passed, the bill would bring much-needed clarity to stablecoin issuers and provide a regulatory framework that supports both innovation and compliance. California Representative Ro Khanna recently revealed that at least 70 Democrats now support stablecoin legislation , a remarkable shift in sentiment that underscores the technology’s geopolitical significance. With the stablecoin market now exceeding $220 billion — or about 1.1% of the US M2 money supply — the stakes have never been higher. Beyond stablecoins, Coinbase Ventures is honing in on next-generation decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, on-chain consumer applications (especially in social, gaming, and creator economies), and crypto-AI convergence as key areas of investment heading into 2025. This thematic focus is shared by other major players in the space. Jeffrey Hu, head of research at HashKey Capital, also noted an increasing VC appetite for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) and decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs) — both of which aim to bridge blockchain with the physical world. What unites these efforts is a common belief that real-world utility and institutional involvement will drive the next bull market, not hype. VC Capital Already on the Rise Tejwani’s bullish outlook is echoed by recent funding data, which shows a surge of capital flowing back into the crypto space. Blockchain startups raised $1.1 billion in February alone, a sign that investor confidence is rebounding despite market headwinds. Key sectors attracting VC capital include DeFi, business services, security infrastructure, and payment systems, according to analytics firm The TIE. These areas align closely with Coinbase Ventures’ investment thesis, which prioritizes infrastructure and utility over speculation. Whether through enabling borderless payments, offering financial inclusion, or building decentralized digital economies, blockchain technology is being positioned as a generational shift — and Coinbase Ventures wants to be at the center of it.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|BUSINESS|ETH|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-27 05:30:00

Market Index Reveals Crucial Clues,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-ongoing-recovery-a-bull-trap-or-breakout-market-index-reveals-crucial-clues/,"Bitcoin has maintained its upward trajectory so far this week, with the asset reclaiming and holding above the $85,000 mark. This performance reflects a weekly gain of approximately 4.7%, indicating a possible shift in momentum after weeks of sideways and bearish activity. While short-term gains have been recorded, signs that might determine Bitcoin’s next major move appear to have emerged. Particularly, a renewed analysis of market health and investor behavior has accompanied the current price action of BTC. On-chain metrics and sentiment indicators are being used to assess whether the current recovery signals a continuation of the bull cycle or if the market may be transitioning into a new phase. One such framework recently shared by CryptoQuant contributor Woominkyu offers a broader view of Bitcoin’s positioning using the Bitcoin Combined Market Index (BCMI). Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally To $95K? Market Greed Suggests It’s Possible Assessing Market Health Through BCMI Metrics According to Woominkyu, the BCMI provides a comprehensive overview of Bitcoin’s market condition by aggregating four core metrics: MVRV (30%), NUPL (25%), SOPR (25%), and the Fear & Greed Index (20%). Each component reflects key aspects of network valuation, investor sentiment, realized gains/losses, and emotional market trends. The index assigns weightings to each metric and calculates a combined score, which can indicate whether the market is overheated or undervalued. Historically, a BCMI score below 0.15 is associated with extreme fear and potential buying opportunities, while scores above 0.75 often precede market tops or sharp corrections. At present, the BCMI remains below the 0.5 level, suggesting that Bitcoin has not yet entered the overheated zone. Woominkyu suggests two possible scenarios: the market is either undergoing a normal correction within an ongoing bull cycle, or it is showing early signs of an atypical transition into a bearish phase. The moment of decision for Bitcoin “During this current market cycle, BCMI hasn’t yet reached the typical ‘overheated’ zone (above 0.75). It’s currently hovering below 0.5, suggesting we’re at a crucial market juncture.” – By @Woo_Minkyu Read more ⤵️https://t.co/sfyunRuWbh pic.twitter.com/he77VS98t7 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) March 26, 2025 Key Thresholds to Watch in Bitcoin The analyst points to the importance of monitoring the 7-day and 90-day moving averages of the BCMI for clearer direction.

Conversely, a sustained decline could confirm a broader trend reversal. Meanwhile, IntoTheBlock has recently shared resistance zones of BTC identified onchain. The market intelligence platform particularly emphasizes the $97.400 level noting that this is “where roughly 1.44 million BTC are currently holding at a loss,” therefore should BTC price hit that point we could see a pullback.

Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President is expected to sign a resolution repealing it. The rule, introduced during the Biden administration, required DeFi platforms to report crypto transactions to the IRS, much like traditional financial institutions. 3/ Next up? The CRA heads to @realDonaldTrump for signature – a milestone that would officially roll back the IRS’ misguided “DeFi Broker” rulemaking, and formally protect DeFi innovators in the United States. — DeFi Education Fund (@fund_defi) March 27, 2025 Senate Votes to Overturn Crypto Reporting Requirements The Senate voted 70-28 in favor of repealing the rule, following a similar decision by the House earlier this month. The legislation had been widely criticized by the crypto community for being impractical and harmful to innovation. Supporters of the repeal argue that DeFi platforms operate differently from centralized financial entities and should not be subjected to the same reporting rules. Critics Say the Rule Was Unworkable Crypto advocacy groups, including the Blockchain Association, praised the Senate’s decision, calling it a victory for DeFi innovation. Thank you, @SenTedCruz , @RepMikeCarey and all of the members who voted to strike down this rule. Your leadership will ensure American innovation in crypto and DeFi thrives. We look forward to President @realDonaldTrump ’s final signature to take this rule off the books for good. https://t.co/e0de4b5Sfd — Kristin Smith (@KMSmithDC) March 27, 2025 Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, expressed gratitude to Senator Ted Cruz, Representative Mike Carey, and other lawmakers for voting to overturn a rule that could have restricted crypto and DeFi innovation. She emphasized that their leadership helps secure the future of digital assets in the U.S. and is now looking forward to Donald Trump’s final approval to scrap it permanently. However, some experts argued that the rule was unrealistic and would have placed excessive burdens on decentralized platforms , making compliance nearly impossible. However, opponents of the repeal, such as Democratic Representative Lloyd Doggett, warned that removing the rule could open doors for tax evasion and illicit financial activities. He claimed that keeping the regulation in place would have helped prevent wealthy investors from exploiting tax loopholes. What’s Next? With Trump expected to approve the repeal, the rule will soon be off the books. The decision highlights the shifting political landscape around crypto regulation as the industry gains stronger support in Washington. For now, DeFi platforms can breathe a sigh of relief, knowing they won’t have to comply with the IRS reporting requirements that many saw as an existential threat to the sector. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The state has officially begun testing its own government-backed stablecoin, the Wyoming Stable Token (WYST), across several major blockchain networks. The tests are being conducted on Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and others, marking a critical step toward a planned launch in July 2025. WYST will be issued under the authority of the Wyoming Stable Token Commission and built using LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard to enable seamless movement between blockchains without relying on centralised bridges. WYST launch backed by US Treasuries The WYST token will be fully backed by a combination of cash and US Treasury securities, with reserves exceeding the total number of tokens issued. This overcollateralisation model is designed to maintain price stability and instil public trust. Unlike algorithmic stablecoins that have failed in the past, WYST will hold assets that match or exceed the token supply at all times. Interest earned on these reserves will go directly to Wyoming’s school foundation fund, creating a mechanism through which stablecoin adoption could directly benefit public services in the state. The initiative is being managed by the Wyoming Stable Token Commission, formed after the passage of the Wyoming Stable Token Act in March 2023. This marks a rare example of a US state pursuing its own stablecoin project under direct legislative authority. LayerZero enables cross-chain transfers The commission has partnered with LayerZero to build WYST on the OFT standard. This framework allows tokens to move securely across blockchains without the need for third-party bridges, which are often targets for exploits. LayerZero’s protocol is designed to enable cross-chain communication using decentralised oracles and relayers, reducing the risk of hacks that have plagued the industry. WYST has already been successfully transferred between Ethereum and Avalanche during testnet demonstrations using Stargate, a LayerZero-enabled bridge. While Stargate was used for initial testing, WYST will be compatible with any interface that supports LayerZero’s OFT standard. These developments were shared during the DC Blockchain Summit on 26 March, where Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon and Stable Token Commission Executive Director Anthony Apollo confirmed that the token had entered its testing phase. The state aims to use these trials to ensure smart contracts function properly, identify vulnerabilities, and confirm that cross-chain mechanics are stable ahead of the launch window. Testnets include Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche WYST is being deployed on multiple blockchain testnets to prepare for a wide-scale launch. The inclusion of Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and others allows Wyoming to ensure compatibility with the most widely used decentralised finance platforms. The testnet version of the token does not carry any real-world value but replicates the behaviour of the live version. Each blockchain brings different capabilities to the table. Ethereum provides robust security and institutional adoption. Solana offers faster transaction speeds and lower fees, while Avalanche provides high scalability and eco-friendliness. By deploying WYST across these networks, the state is aiming to build a flexible, future-ready digital asset. This approach positions WYST as a uniquely interoperable state-issued stablecoin, capable of serving multiple decentralised ecosystems. It also reflects Wyoming’s broader strategy of developing comprehensive blockchain legislation and infrastructure, attracting both startups and institutional players to the state. Wyoming aims for stablecoin leadership With initial testing underway, the next few months will be focused on refining WYST’s smart contracts, finalising risk management protocols, and expanding test coverage. If these elements are completed on schedule, the token could see a full-scale launch by July 2025. Wyoming’s move into stablecoins follows years of progressive blockchain legislation.

Will BTC set a new all-time high?,https://crypto.news/bitcoin-supply-on-exchanges-drops-to-8-year-low-will-btc-set-a-new-all-time-high/,"Bitcoin exchanges supply has dropped to its lowest in 8 years, sparking hopes of a price recovery towards a new BTC all-time high. According to a Mar. 27 post on X by blockchain analytics firm Santiment, Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) supply on exchanges has dropped to 7.53%, its lowest level since 2018. This implies that more investors are moving their Bitcoin into self-custody, which lowers the amount available for immediate selling. Because it signifies less short-term sell pressure and rising confidence among holders, a declining exchange supply is frequently interpreted as a bullish sign. 💸 Bitcoin's ratio of supply on exchanges has officially dropped to as low as 7.53%, the lowest since February 20, 2018. The 7-year milestone reflects a continued trend of investors of crypto's top asset feeling comfortable 'hodling' for the long-term, regardless of short-term… pic.twitter.com/m7d6Yon5HR — Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 26, 2025 One of the main factors driving Bitcoin’s price movement has been institutional demand. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have seen steady inflows since Mar. 14, which has caused BTC to rise more than 10%. In contrast, between Feb. 10 and Mar. 13, ETF inflows were negative to nearly stagnant, and Bitcoin dropped 17%. This pattern shows the strong link between institutional buying and Bitcoin price trends, with large investors having a greater market impact than retail speculators. You might also like: Economist warns of a recession: Will Bitcoin and altcoins crash or rise? Alongside the growing institutional demand, a Mar. 25 article published on OKX’s research page indicates that the market behavior of Bitcoin is also changing. Historically, a 50% drop was regarded as a bear market. In previous cycles, drops of up to 80% have been recorded. But as Bitcoin has matured, extreme crashes brought about by panic selling have become less common. Now, a 30% decline is often enough to trigger bear market concerns. According to insights from the article, on-chain data suggests that instead of the prolonged declines of past cycles, Bitcoin might be going through a brief “mini” bear market . An early indicator of this change was the Short-Term Holder Market Value to Realized Value ratio, which compares the current price of Bitcoin with the average price at which short-term holders purchased their coins. The metric displayed a bearish sentiment even before there were notable price drops on Feb. 25. Now, it has fallen below the 365-day moving average, which is a critical level that usually signals more selling pressure. However, analysts anticipate that the metric will improve and lead to a relief rally as the amount of Bitcoin on exchanges declines. As of press time, Bitcoin is trading at $87,653, roughly 19% down from its peak of $108,786.

42464820,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143715,1743054009,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Crypto Opportunity: Why Smart Investors Are Piling Into Crypto Hedge Funds Now,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-hedge-funds-investment-opportunity/,"Are you looking for a fresh, potentially lucrative avenue in the world of cryptocurrency? Forget the noise and focus on where the smart money is moving. According to a top executive at Amitis Capital, the answer might surprise you: it’s crypto hedge funds . Chris Solarz, Chief Investment Officer at Amitis Capital, recently shared his expert insights, suggesting that right now presents a golden opportunity to dive into this burgeoning sector. Let’s unpack why this seasoned investor believes now is the prime time to consider cryptocurrency investment through hedge funds. Why Crypto Hedge Funds Are Ripe for Investment Now? Solarz argues that the cryptocurrency market, despite its maturity in some aspects, still retains the characteristics of its early days. This ‘early stage’ environment allows for the successful deployment of investment strategies that were highly effective in the initial phases of the traditional hedge fund industry. Strategies that have become too commonplace and less profitable in traditional finance are finding new life and effectiveness within the volatile yet potentially rewarding digital assets landscape. Early Stage Advantage: The crypto market mirrors the early hedge fund days, offering unique profit opportunities. Revived Strategies: Commoditized traditional finance strategies are effective again in crypto. Untapped Potential: The relative immaturity of the crypto space allows for alpha generation through less saturated strategies. Think of it like this: imagine being able to use well-tested, proven strategies in a market that hasn’t been completely saturated by them yet. That’s the opportunity Solarz is highlighting. It’s about applying financial wisdom to a relatively new frontier where those time-honored principles can yield exceptional results. But it’s not all smooth sailing; navigating this space requires discernment and expertise. The Challenge: Separating the Wheat from the Chaff in Crypto Asset Management While the opportunity is significant, Solarz also issued a stark warning about the current state of crypto asset management . In a candid assessment, he revealed that out of 20 cryptocurrency asset management firms he recently evaluated, he found only one worthy of entrusting with funds. This sobering statistic underscores a critical challenge: the crypto space is still young, and many firms lack the experience and expertise needed to navigate its complexities effectively. The Expertise Gap: Solarz observed that the majority of firms he encountered were: Young and Inexperienced: Many firms are newly established and lack a long track record in asset management. Lacking Traditional Finance Acumen: Some firms may not possess the deep understanding of financial principles and risk management crucial for hedge fund success. Potentially Overwhelmed: The rapid pace and volatility of the crypto market can be challenging for inexperienced teams. This highlights the importance of due diligence. Investors need to be exceptionally careful when selecting a crypto hedge fund . It’s not enough to be enthusiastic about crypto; you need seasoned professionals at the helm, individuals who understand both traditional finance and the nuances of the digital asset world. Bitcoin’s Ascent: Could Bitcoin Outshine Gold? Beyond the immediate opportunity in crypto hedge funds, Solarz also shared a bold prediction about Bitcoin . He anticipates that Bitcoin could potentially surpass gold in market capitalization within the next decade. This is a significant statement, considering gold’s long-standing position as a safe-haven asset and store of value. Bitcoin vs. Gold: A Potential Market Cap Showdown Here’s a simplified look at the potential shift Solarz envisions: Asset Current Role Future Potential (Solarz’s Prediction) Gold Traditional safe-haven asset, store of value Potentially surpassed by Bitcoin in market cap Bitcoin Digital asset, store of value, emerging investment Could become the dominant store of value, exceeding gold’s market cap This prediction speaks to the growing acceptance and adoption of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. If Bitcoin continues on its current trajectory, driven by institutional interest and increasing mainstream awareness, surpassing gold in market capitalization is not just a far-fetched dream but a tangible possibility. Actionable Insights for Potential Crypto Hedge Fund Investors So, what are the key takeaways and actionable steps for anyone considering investing in cryptocurrency investment through hedge funds based on Solarz’s insights? Due Diligence is Paramount: Thoroughly research and vet any crypto hedge fund before investing. Don’t be swayed by hype; look for experienced teams with proven track records in asset management. Focus on Experience: Prioritize firms with professionals who have a strong understanding of both traditional finance and the cryptocurrency market. Understand the Strategies: Inquire about the specific investment strategies employed by the hedge fund. Ensure they are sound, well-reasoned, and appropriate for the current market conditions. Long-Term Perspective: Consider crypto hedge funds as part of a long-term investment strategy. The market is volatile, and patience is key. Diversification: As with any investment, diversification is crucial. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, even within the crypto space. Conclusion: Seize the Moment in Crypto Hedge Funds – But Invest Wisely Chris Solarz’s perspective offers a compelling narrative: the time for crypto hedge funds is now. The market dynamics are ripe for strategies that have proven successful in the past, and the potential for significant returns is undeniable. However, his cautionary note about the varying quality of asset management firms in the crypto space cannot be ignored. The message is clear: the opportunity is real, but smart, informed investment is essential. Approach alternative investments in crypto hedge funds with enthusiasm, but tempered with rigorous due diligence and a focus on experienced, reputable managers. The future of finance is unfolding, and crypto hedge funds could be a pivotal part of that evolution – for those who invest wisely.

PepeX aims to tackle issues of market manipulation and insider advantages that have affected meme launchpads. Set to launch in Q3, the platform aims to “make fair launches fair again” at a time when confidence in existing models is shifting, even as the sector has generated billions of dollars in token launches. PepeX introduces features like anti-bundling transparency, developer wallet tracking, sniping protections, and AI-powered tools for democratized token creation. These innovations seek to enhance fairness and accessibility in one of crypto’s most active segments. PepeX presale gains momentum The presale follows a 30-stage, 90-day model, starting at $0.02 with a 5% price increase per stage, culminating at $0.0823 on June 22—a 311% rise from its opening price. PepeX, now in the first stage of its presale, gives early investors access to 45% of the total supply, amounting to 2.25 billion PEPX tokens. The presale has already gained strong traction, raising $771,430 in just a few days since launch. Early-stage investors could benefit from PepeX’s structured price increases throughout the presale. After the presale, PepeX is expected to list on major exchanges ahead of the launch of its AI-powered platform. Positioned as a next-generation meme coin launchpad, PepeX aims to surpass existing competitors by leveraging AI-driven features. Why is the market excited about PepeX PepeX has been generating strong interest. Positioned as the “world’s first AI-powered meme coin launchpad,” PepeX aims to offer a fairer alternative to existing platforms like Pump.fun. To promote fairness, PepeX caps project creators’ token holdings at 5% of the total supply. Additionally, deployers must put down $500 upfront when launching a token, reinforcing accountability and long-term commitment. By requiring founders to do this, PepeX sets a higher entry barrier than Pump.fun. This helps filter out low-effort projects, attracting more serious and committed developers. The AI-powered Moonshot Engine streamlines meme coin creation by allowing users to upload an image—whether it’s Doge, a frog, or their own face—and generate a custom token with built-in anti-snipe protection and liquidity pools. In addition to simplifying token creation, PepeX leverages AI-driven bots to promote projects across social media, automating community engagement and increasing visibility. By tackling the major pain points of existing launchpads, PepeX aims to enhance platform integrity and rebuild user confidence. This comes at a time when interest in the sector remains strong, with market participants looking for more transparent and equitable solutions. PepeX’s momentum The launchpad sector has already generated several million dollars in revenue, underscoring the scale of interest and the opportunity PepeX is entering. While the market has recently cooled, discussions around a potential resurgence are growing, particularly if issues of fairness and transparency can be resolved. PepeX positions itself as part of the next evolution in meme coin infrastructure, launching at a time when macroeconomic conditions appear increasingly favorable for high-risk digital assets. Analysts have suggested that expected rate cuts, prompted by shifts in global trade policy, could drive a renewed appetite for speculative assets, including meme coins.

OpenAI’s latest AI image generator, baked into ChatGPT, dropped just yesterday, and already, social media is exploding with AI-crafted memes channeling the iconic style of Studio Ghibli. Think ‘My Neighbor Totoro’ meets Elon Musk – you get the picture? This sudden surge of Generative AI art, while visually captivating, has reignited a critical debate: AI Copyright . Is this playful mimicry just harmless fun, or does it tread into legally murky waters? Let’s dive into the captivating and complex world of AI-generated art and the copyright concerns it raises. Why is OpenAI’s Studio Ghibli Moment Going Viral? It’s hard to miss. Your social media feeds are likely flooded with images that look straight out of a beloved Studio Ghibli film. In just 24 hours since OpenAI launched its new image generation feature within ChatGPT (powered by GPT-4o), users have been enthusiastically experimenting. We’re seeing: Ghibli-fied Celebrities: Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman himself have been reimagined in the warm, whimsical style of Ghibli animation. Altman even changed his profile picture to a Ghibli-esque avatar, showcasing the tool’s immediate impact. Pop Culture Reboots: ‘The Lord of the Rings’ and other iconic franchises are getting the Studio Ghibli treatment, creating fascinating and often humorous crossovers. Personal Transformations: Users are uploading their own photos and asking ChatGPT to reimagine them in the signature Ghibli style, leading to personalized AI art experiences. Users seem to be uploading existing images and pictures into ChatGPT and asking the chatbot to recreate it in new styles. pic.twitter.com/M8B7eqfNzR — Moon Parameter (@ParamMoon) March 26, 2025 This viral trend highlights the accessibility and power of Generative AI tools, following closely on the heels of Google Gemini’s similar image feature, which also went viral for its watermark removal capabilities. Both platforms have made it incredibly simple to mimic copyrighted artistic styles with just a text prompt. But this ease of creation brings us to a crucial question… Does Recreating Studio Ghibli Style Infringe on Copyright? The rapid adoption of these AI image generators has reignited the debate surrounding AI Copyright and fair use. Are these tools, trained on vast datasets that may include copyrighted material, potentially violating copyright law? Let’s break down the legal complexities: Style vs. Substance: According to IP lawyer Evan Brown, current copyright law primarily protects specific works, not artistic styles themselves. This means that simply generating images that *look like* Studio Ghibli films might not, on the surface, be illegal. The Training Data Question: The legal grey area emerges when considering how these AI models learn styles. It’s plausible that OpenAI ’s model was trained on millions of frames from Studio Ghibli movies to achieve such accurate stylistic replication. Fair Use in Question: Courts are actively grappling with whether training AI on copyrighted material constitutes “fair use.” If it doesn’t, companies like OpenAI could face significant legal challenges. Ongoing Lawsuits: The New York Times and numerous publishers have already filed lawsuits against OpenAI , alleging unauthorized use of copyrighted works in AI model training. Similar lawsuits are targeting Meta and Midjourney. Brown aptly summarizes the core issue: “What are the copyright infringement implications of going out, crawling the web, and copying into these databases?” This question remains at the heart of the legal battles surrounding Generative AI . OpenAI’s Stance: Broader Styles vs. Individual Artists In response to the growing copyright concerns , an OpenAI spokesperson clarified their position to Bitcoin World. While ChatGPT is designed to avoid replicating the style of *individual living artists*, it *does* permit the replication of “broader studio styles.” This distinction, however, raises further questions: The Pioneers of Style: Studio Ghibli’s distinctive style is deeply intertwined with the vision of its co-founder, Hayao Miyazaki, a living artist. Can a “studio style” truly be separated from the individual artists who pioneered it? Beyond Ghibli: Users are already pushing the boundaries, successfully recreating styles from other studios like Pixar and even individual artists like Dr. Seuss. This suggests the current limitations might be easily circumvented. studio ghibli is out, dr seuss is in pic.twitter.com/4ECxwLLkoj — Jordi Hays (@jordihays) March 26, 2025 How Does OpenAI’s AI Image Generator Stack Up? To understand the capabilities of these new AI tools, we put several popular image generators to the test, comparing their ability to mimic the Studio Ghibli style. Our findings: AI Image Generator Studio Ghibli Style Replication Accuracy OpenAI (ChatGPT) Highest Accuracy – Remarkably captures the essence of Ghibli’s animation style, including character design, backgrounds, and color palettes. Google Gemini Good – Demonstrates stylistic similarity but sometimes lacks the nuanced charm and detail of OpenAI ‘s output. xAI Grok Moderate – Attempts Ghibli style but results are less consistent and often miss key stylistic elements. Playground.ai Moderate – Can generate Ghibli-inspired images, but requires more prompting and fine-tuning to achieve accurate results. (Left) A real dog vs. (Right) AI-generated Ghibli-style dog by ChatGPT (Credit: Maxwell Zeff/OpenAI) OpenAI ’s new image generator clearly leads the pack in replicating the Studio Ghibli aesthetic, showcasing a significant leap in Generative AI capabilities. The Future of AI Art and Copyright: Waiting for the Courts The overwhelming popularity of OpenAI and Google’s new image features signals a major step forward for Generative AI . The sheer demand has even led OpenAI to delay the rollout of its image tool to free-tier users. While user adoption and technological advancement are rapidly accelerating, the legal landscape is still catching up. The courts will ultimately play a crucial role in defining the boundaries of AI Copyright and determining the legality of training AI models on copyrighted works. For now, we’re in a fascinating, and somewhat legally precarious, era of AI-generated art.

Analyst Predicts Amid Massive Burn Surge A recent X post by crypto market trader and analyst ‘World Of Charts’ revealed that Shiba Inu price is eyeing 2x gains ahead. This bullish prediction is attributed to the meme coin showcasing the potential for a price rally with recent formations. As per the analyst, the coin’s price is currently trading in a descending channel range. A sustained breakout above the upper trendline in this formation cements the chances of a bull run. Source: ‘World Of Charts,’ X For context, a descending channel pattern is a bearish formation characterized by two parallel trendlines sloping downward. Nevertheless, the analyst believes that 2x gains are possible, given that a sustained breakout above the upper trendline holds.

Burn Rate Shoots Up 60,000% As Over 1B Coins Destroyed According to Shibburn’s data on March 27, the SHIB burn rate surged by a whopping 57,291.91% intraday.

Is this a recipe for disaster or a calculated risk? Let’s delve into the unfolding saga of Unicoin and its high-stakes gamble amidst regulatory headwinds. If you’re invested in the crypto world, especially in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency regulation , this story demands your attention. Why is Unicoin Still Under SEC Scrutiny? Despite requesting an end to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force investigation, Unicoin has reportedly received no response, according to CoinDesk. This silence from the regulatory body speaks volumes, especially considering the initial notification Unicoin received at the end of last year. The SEC had then signaled its intention to charge Unicoin with serious allegations, including: Fraud : Accusations of misleading investors or engaging in fraudulent schemes. Deceptive Practices : Allegations of employing deceptive tactics in their crypto operations. Dealing in Unregistered Securities : Potentially offering or selling securities without proper SEC registration. These are not light accusations. They strike at the heart of investor protection and regulatory compliance within the cryptocurrency space. The ongoing SEC probe casts a long shadow over Unicoin’s ambitious plans. Unicoin’s Audacious IPO Plans Amid Regulatory Cloud What makes this situation even more intriguing is Unicoin’s unwavering commitment to an Initial Public Offering (IPO). While many companies might retreat and address regulatory concerns before considering such a significant step, Unicoin is seemingly pressing forward. CEO Alex Konanykhin’s return to New York from Europe, driven by Trump’s vision of the U.S. as a crypto hub, underscores this determination. But is this ambition misplaced in the face of an active SEC probe ? Navigating the Complexities of Cryptocurrency Regulation Unicoin’s predicament highlights the broader challenges faced by blockchain companies operating in the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency regulation . The SEC’s role is to ensure investor protection and market integrity, and their scrutiny of Unicoin is part of this larger effort. Here’s a look at the complexities: Challenge Description Regulatory Uncertainty The rules governing cryptocurrencies are still being developed and interpreted, leading to ambiguity for businesses. Global Reach vs. Local Laws Crypto operates globally, but regulations are often jurisdiction-specific, creating compliance hurdles. Defining Securities Determining whether a crypto asset is a security or not is complex and often subject to SEC interpretation, as seen in the Unicoin IPO case. Enforcement Actions The SEC has been actively enforcing regulations, as evidenced by the SEC probe into Unicoin and other crypto firms. Has the Regulatory Climate Shifted? The content mentions that “other crypto firms have been released from enforcement actions by the agency’s new leadership since U.S. President Donald Trump took office.” This suggests a potential shift in the regulatory climate. Is the SEC becoming more lenient? Or are these releases specific cases unrelated to Unicoin’s situation? It’s crucial to understand that while there might be individual instances of eased enforcement, the overall commitment to cryptocurrency regulation remains strong. It’s possible that the releases refer to cases where firms demonstrated proactive compliance or addressed the SEC’s concerns effectively.

Furthermore, Elon Musk has once again teased DOGE, sharing a Ghibli Anime character of his from a famour scene from “The Lion King”. Dogecoin Price Eyes A 10x Breakout Ahead In the last 24 hours, the Dogecoin price has surged another 4%, moving to $0.205 with its market cap just touching $30 billion. Additionally, the daily trading volumes have surged more than 32%, crossing $2 billion showing a strong bullish sentiment aong traders. Additionally, the Coinglass data shows that the DOGE futures open interest is also up 4%, moving above $2 billion, while the 24-hour liquidations have soared to $13.82 million. Popular crypto analyst CryptoELITES has cited the formation of a cup-and-handle chart pattern, wherein the DOGE price is on the move to complete the cup pattern. As a result, he expects the meme coin to register 10x gains from here onwards. Source: CryptoELITES Some traders also expect the DOGE price rally to continue to $8 as the meme coin breaks past the three-month trendline. DOGE SuperTrend Indicator Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted a potential bullish phase for Dogecoin (DOGE) based on the SuperTrend indicator. According to Martinez, the popular meme coin could enter a significant upward trend if it manages to break through the critical resistance level of $0.21. The SuperTrend indicator usually helps to identify trend reversals and potential breakout points. Thus, surpassing this key threshold of $0.21 Dogecoin price could signal renewed investor momentum for the meme coin.

Blockchain stats from etherscan show Vitalik Buterin transferred 250 ETH, worth approximately $500K, to privacy platform Railgun. Wu Blockchain @WuBlockchain · Follow Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin (vitalik.eth) transferred 250 ETH (~$500k) to the privacy protocol Railgun 7 hours ago. Vitalik Buterin has previously stated that privacy is normal, and Railgun utilizes a privacy pool protocol that effectively prevents malicious actors from 6:49 am · 27 Mar 2025 124 Reply Copy link Read 15 replies The transaction has sparked debate regarding its motive and possible implications. Privacy crypto protocols have been on investors’ radar lately, especially after the US OFAC removed Tornado Cash from its sanctioned entities . Understanding Railgun Railgun is a privacy-focused network that allows individuals to hide their transaction footprints on Ethereum and EVM-compatible protocols such as Avalanche and Polygon. Railgun uses zero-knowledge proofs to ensure financial privacy in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. The protocol allows individuals to hold private balances without compromising smart contract compatibility. That’s unlike old-fashioned mixers, which use pooling to shield transaction histories. While the transaction’s motive remains unclear, multiple factors could have influenced Buterin’s move to Railgun. Ethereum’s co-founder is a recognized blockchain expert. His transfers could indicate an experiment to examine Railgun’s security and competence. Moreover, Buterin has previously navigated privacy-focused mechanisms. Some technologies he has explored include zk-Succinct no-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARKs) and zk- Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge (zk-STARKs). He also referenced Tornado Cash as a sufficient privacy mixer. Further, Buterin advocates for privacy on the Ethereum blockchain. What does it mean for Ether and the crypto market Vitalik’s moves often impact the Ethereum ecosystem and the cryptocurrency market. For instance, PolitiFi tokens suffered user exodus after his criticism . His latest transaction with Railgun could reflect his dedication to financial privacy. Ethereum uses a public ledger, making all transactions visible. Some experts argue that the approach undermines monetary confidentiality. Buterin’s active exploration of privacy-focused solutions could suggest potential integrations to bolster Etehreum’s privacy. Notably, the move emerges amid regulatory developments linked to privacy protocols. Recently, the US OFAC removed sanctions on crypto mixer Tornado Cash. In 2022, OFAC sanctioned Tornado Cash for not implementing adequate controls to prevent malicious actors from laundering funds through the crypto mixer. Community response The cryptocurrency community remained divided on Buterin’s potential motive and market implications. Some see the transfer as a simple test, while others believe it is a step toward improving Ethereum’s ecosystem with privacy solutions. Source – X Whether an experiment or a strategic decision, Buterin’s transaction with Railgun confirms increased interest in privacy crypto solutions. Enthusiasts will watch whether these protocols will be crucial for the next wave of blockchain evolution. Ethereum trades at $2,026 after losing 2% in the past 24 hours.

This recovery marks a shift in short-term sentiment after several weeks of price turbulence. While the asset remains down approximately 20.2% from its all-time high set in January, the current rebound suggests a pause in downward pressure and a potential reassessment among market participants. Despite the recent uptick, traders and analysts remain cautious. Market behavior has been mixed, with on-chain metrics and trading activity offering differing signals. CryptoQuant contributor Nino recently provided a breakdown of the Coinbase Premium Index and its implications for Bitcoin’s short-term direction, pointing to changing sentiment in the US market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pushes Past $88K Amid Rising Volatility and On-Chain Resistance Zones Coinbase Premium Turns Positive Amid Stabilizing Price In a recent QuickTake post titled “Is the Coinbase Premium Signaling a Bullish Shift for Bitcoin?”, Nino observed that the index—which measures the price gap between Bitcoin on Coinbase and other exchanges—had hovered near zero for weeks. However, it now appears to be entering positive territory. This trend, if sustained, may reflect a growing appetite from US-based traders and institutions. Historically, a positive Coinbase Premium has coincided with increased spot demand and broader upward price momentum. Nino added that while this shift can be a bullish signal, it should be evaluated alongside other market indicators such as trading volume and on-chain metrics. These combined factors help clarify whether the move represents real buying conviction or short-term speculation. In parallel, renowned market analyst Ali noted that following Bitcoin’s surge above $70,000 in late 2024, stablecoin reserves grew from $26 billion to $46 billion—often an indication of profit-taking by investors. Now that reserves have plateaued, the market may be entering a period of reduced selling pressure, as participants appear to be waiting for new catalysts before re-entering. After #Bitcoin $BTC broke $70,000 in late 2024, stablecoin reserves jumped from $26 billion to $46 billion, signaling heavy profit-taking. Now that reserves have plateaued, it looks like investors are sitting on the sidelines. pic.twitter.com/PRtOQnNq5x — Ali (@ali_charts) March 26, 2025 Bitcoin Whale Accumulation and Long-Term Signals Further reinforcing this narrative, Ali also pointed to new whale accumulation trends. Specifically, 48 new Bitcoin wallets have surpassed the 100 BTC threshold, indicating growing holdings among large-scale investors. This increase in whale addresses is generally interpreted as a sign of confidence in long-term price appreciation. When whales accumulate during consolidation phases, it can reflect expectations for upward movement once market uncertainty subsides. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Daily RSI Downtrend, But Analyst Warns Of Strong Resistance Ahead Whale behavior has historically played a significant role in shaping Bitcoin’s market structure. Accumulation at higher levels can act as price support while selling activity from these holders can introduce major volatility.

Seoul City Councilor Kim Hye-young held the largest amount with 1.7 billion KRW. According to a recent report by local media Munhwa, on March 27 the Government Public Ethics Committee publicly disclosed the detailed report of personal assets held by the country’s public officials as of 2025. Based on information from the ethics watchdog, 411 out of 2,047 public officials directly hold or have invested in cryptocurrency . This means that 20% of South Korean officials hold cryptocurrency, including the Secretary General of the Labor-Management Development Foundation, President of the Korean National Police University, and Vice President of the Korea Water Resources Corporation among others. The total worth of crypto assets held by the 411 public officials amounted to 14.41 billion Korean won or equal to $9.8 million. The report concluded that each South Korean official who owned crypto held an average of 35.07 million Korean won ($23,927). The public official who holds the most funds in cryptocurrency is Seoul City Councilor Kim Hye-young. According to her asset disclosure, Kim reported to holding $1.76 billion Korean won ($1.2 million) distributed into 16 different types of crypto assets, including Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Ripple ( XRP ) and many more.

In third place is CEO of Busan-Ulsan Expressway Co., Kim Ki-hwan with crypto holdings worth a total of 1.4 billion Korean won ($955,031). This is the second year South Korean public officials were obligated to include virtual assets as part of their financial disclosures to the Government Public Ethics Committee. In May 2023, South Korean regulators passed a bill that mandated public officials and political candidates to disclose their cryptocurrency holdings. Since it came into effect on Jan. 1, 2024, high-ranking public officials in South Korea, including National Assembly members have to abide by the bill and report their crypto holdings to the ethics committee. Public officials categorized under Grade 4 must disclose the quantity and the type of cryptocurrency they hold. While high-ranking public officials categorized under Grade 1 must disclose not only their crypto holdings, but also explain in detail how they acquired the crypto assets along with their transaction history throughout the past year.

This price action demonstrates healthy accumulation with decreasing volatility while maintaining higher lows since the local bottom. The rise is led by the Walrus Protocol mainnet launch , which is a popular decentralized storage network powered by the SUI blockchain. Therefore, the price is expected to trigger another 25% upswing and rise above $3 ahead of the quarterly close. The SUI price has surged by over 6% to 7% since the early trading hours and has surpassed giants like Shiba Inu and Hedera. With this, the token has become one of the top layer-1 cryptos with a potential of displaying a 100x rally for the upcoming bull cycle. The token underwent a tremendous retest and is displaying huge buying opportunities at these levels. Therefore, this suggests that the SUI price rally has just started, and hence, a new ATH can be expected in April 2025. After plunging from the highs, the price remained consolidated within a falling wedge that was broken during the previous trading day. The bullish start for the day, mainly above the resistance of the wedge, is expected to keep up the rally until the end. Besides, the RSI is incremental, and the DMI underwent a bullish crossover. However, the ADX continues to plunge, indicating a drop in the strength of the rally. Therefore, the SUI price may remain consolidated around the local resistance zone of around $2.8 and $2.85 until the platform does not receive a huge buying volume. The SUI price has retraced much deeper and smashed a major support zone, and hence, the rebound is expected to attract a huge liquidity onto the platform. Moreover, the Walrus Protocol mainnet launch is also seen as a major catalyst that may keep up the momentum of the rally for a long time. Therefore, the SUI price has begun to breakout and is believed to rise above $3 before the end of the month. With this, the price is expected to maintain a strong ascending trend and reach a new ATH in the coming days.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|SUI|BLOCKCHAIN|SHIB|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-27 07:36:45

The price could hit a high of $3.99 in 2025. XRP Price Today: XRP value has dropped 3.63% in 24 hours to $2.36. In the latest update on the Ripple vs SEC case, Attorney Fred Rispoli has provided an updated timeline for the SEC v. Ripple case. He stated that the necessary documentation had already been produced following Alderoty’s declaration, and they are now awaiting a vote by the SEC Commission, which is expected in 30 days. Following this, the SEC will file a motion to lift the injunction, which Ripple will not contest. Once the judge signs off, the case will be finalized, most likely within 60 days. Coming to the expenses, which Ripple will be bearing, the case will be settled with a $50 Million payout to the SEC. Talking about the XRP price, it is presently down 3.63% to $2.36. If the bullish momentum continues, XRP could aim at its resistance level of $2.462. On the flip side, if it loses out on steam, the XRP price could take a plunge to $2.3192. Our XRP price prediction will explore the potential answers to questions such as “Will XRP reach $10 in 2025?” by providing short-term and long-term Ripple (XRP) price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 2.36562580 -4.03% Market cap $ 137,692,899,431.23 Circulating Supply 58,205,697,378.00 Trading Volume $ 3,347,207,297.2116 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Price Prediction 2025 The SEC believes that XRP can help release funds stuck in the U.S. Nostro accounts, which can then be used to buy more Bitcoins. There is more positive news for Ripple, as Franklin Templeton has announced filing for an XRP ETF. Once launched, it is expected to be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Moreover, Ripple has received approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) to offer regulated crypto payments in the Dubai International Finance Centre (DIFC). The exchange inflow vs outflow graph from March 1st to March 27th shows 646k outflows in comparison to 290k inflows. This signals a spike in strong investor interest, which is a big thumbs-up for XRP. XRP Exchange Inflow vs Outflow If things go in favor of Ripple, the XRP price could surge to a maximum of $5.81 by the end of 2025. In contrast, if the lawsuit continues, XRP could remain under a narrow range with a potential low of $2.3. That being said, we can expect an average price of $4.89. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.6 6.25 8.64 2027 7.15 8.89 12.25 2028 11.3 14.11 16.53 2029 13.98 16.48 21.12 2030 16.92 19.87 26.97 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP price will likely witness strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.64 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum XRP price will be around $5.6, with an average trading price of $6.25. This could be a result of Ripple’s role in CBDC development and XRP’s rising institutional demand. XRP Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP’s price will range between $7.15 to $12.25. XRP price might record an average level of $8.89. The reason behind this surge could be due to Ripple’s increasing domination in the payment sector, accelerating XRP’s buying demand and utility. XRP Price Prediction 2028 In 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases, including new dApps and announcements regarding XRP. This might boost the dominance of XRP as the second-largest altcoin by market cap. We expect the XRP price to range between $11.3 to $16.53. The average trading price could be around $14.11. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The altcoin might record a trading range between $13.98 to $21.12, with an average price of $16.48. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The long-term XRP price prediction depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the XRP price could scale between $16.92 to $26.97. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.87. Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Based on historic price sentiments and XRP’s rising popularity, here are the long-term XRP price projections for 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, and 2050.

These projects are a part of the rapidly growing sectors of decentralized finance, data monetization, and on-chain intellectual property management, according to the latest Grayscale Research Insight report published on Mar. 26. With a $5.1 billion valuation, Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) focuses on on-chain perpetual trading to meet the growing demand for decentralized derivatives. Strong speculative interest is indicated by its 90-day price volatility of 121.7%. Story Protocol, with a $1.5 billion market cap, focuses on blockchain-based IP rights and AI applications. Due to its quick adoption and price fluctuations, it has had the highest volatility among the top 20 featured assets at 417.3%. Another AI-powered project, Grass ( GRASS ), lets users earn money off of the data they browse. Grass is becoming more and more popular in the growing data economy, with a market capitalization of $300 million and a volatility rate of 156%. Broader market trends are also reflected in the report. Uniswap ( UNI ), Aave ( AAVE ), Ethena ( ENA ), and Lido DAO ( LDO ) have secured positions on the list, making DeFi one of the most dominant sectors.

Bitcoin network activity, however, remained consistent, with a record 48 million wallets holding at least $1. Monthly active on-chain remained stable at 11 million, suggesting Bitcoin is being used more as a store of value than for transactions. Meanwhile, there was a decline in activity on smart contract platforms, mostly as a result of less trading of memecoins on Solana. Solana still made $390 million in fees in Q1, which accounted for almost half of all smart contract platform revenues, despite this slowdown.

Arctic Pablo Leads The Best New Meme Coins For Exponential Returns Amid Gigachad And Brett’s Rapid Rise,https://thecoinrise.com/grab-12-million-tokens-for-1k-arctic-pablo-leads-the-best-new-meme-coins-for-exponential-returns-amid-gigachad-and-bretts-rapid-rise/,"The meme coin market in 2025 is off its rocker—and that’s putting it mildly. Gen Z and Millennial crypto traders are diving headfirst into the wildest new tokens in search of sky-high returns, viral community vibes, and narratives that actually get the blood pumping. So, if you’re chasing the best meme coins for exponential returns, you’re in the right place. In this guide, lets strapping in and going full throttle into Arctic Pablo Coin , Gigachad, and Brett—three meme coin monsters lighting up the crypto radar. Whether you’re keen on deep lore, Solana-powered surges, or BASE-backed bangers, this list packs serious punch. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC): Best New Meme Coin for Exponential Returns — Ride the Ice-Cracking Presale Into 9552%+ Gains Right out the gate, Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just a meme coin presale —it’s a mythical movement. As the Best New Meme Coin for Exponential Returns, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale isn’t based on boring stages or arbitrary price jumps. Instead, Pablo—the cartoon arctic explorer—is journeying through legendary locations, and each location represents a new presale phase. Currently, he’s diving deep into Crystal Cove, the 16th location, and the $APC token price is just $0.000083. But here’s the kicker: if $APC lists at $0.008, a humble $1000 investment today could explode into $96,385.52.That’s 12,048,190.00 tokens for a thousand bucks. Absolute madness. The tokenomics are even juicier. As the Best New Meme Coin for Exponential Returns, Arctic Pablo Coin is built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), with a total supply of 221.2 billion tokens and a deflationary burn model. Each week, unsold tokens are torched, permanently reducing supply. And the presale? It doesn’t just tick along—it automatically increases the price every week, no matter what. No pauses. No gimmicks. Just raw, deflationary fire. Even better? The staking rewards slap hard—lets talking 66% APY. Stake your Arctic Pablo Coin tokens and watch your wallet swell while Pablo pushes through frozen realms in search of ancient riches. Just know your staked $APC will be locked for two months from launch day. But hey, the gains? Worth the wait. And let’s not ignore the vibes. Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just a presale. It’s a full-blown cartoon adventure, with each location unveiling secret myths, glowing coins, and snow-slicked mysteries. Pablo’s currently surfing ancient Atlantean currents in Crystal Cove, uncovering treasure maps, whispering mermaids, and coins that practically beg to be hoarded. With over $2 million already raised, Arctic Pablo Coin is gaining serious traction. It’s meme meets myth, wrapped in slick tokenomics, and delivered on a blazing-fast BSC contract. If you’re chasing the Best New Meme Coin for Exponential Returns , Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t a maybe—it’s your icy golden ticket. Gigachad (GIGA): Solana’s Alpha Beast Charging Back from the Shadows Gigachad ain’t here to play nice. This Solana-powered meme coin is flexing harder than a bodybuilder on pre-workout. Currently trading at $0.02338, GIGA is making waves with a 36.67% gain in the past 24 hours. It’s backed by a $217.52 million market cap and a whopping $25.62 million daily volume, meaning liquidity’s flowing like protein shakes at a gym convention. The token’s supply sits at 9.3 billion, just shy of its 10 billion cap. There’s still room for growth, but the scarcity angle is kicking in too, making this a powder keg waiting for the right spark. And let’s not forget—it once hit an ATH of $0.09511 back in January 2025. That’s over 75% off from the top, which screams opportunity for any savvy degens hunting value. But here’s where GIGA gets wild. The coin’s already up a jaw-dropping 1,274,610% from its all-time low. Let that sink in. This isn’t just another flash-in-the-pan token. This is a proven monster that’s shown it can rocket like a SpaceX launch, even from the ashes. Brett (BRETT): The Base Chain’s Meme Market Royalty With Major Room to Run Let’s be real: Brett is based AF. And that’s not just a meme—it’s the mission. BRETT is currently riding a nice 11.60% daily pump, sitting at $0.04059. With a $402.27 million market cap and $21.75 million in daily trading volume, this Base Chain baddie is gaining serious traction in the meme coin ecosystem. The circulating supply’s nearly maxed at 9.91 billion tokens out of 10 billion, making Brett an absolute scarcity play. Sure, it’s still 82% off its ATH of $0.235, but don’t let that throw you off. Since its all-time low, it’s ripped +37,580.68%. That’s the kind of performance that makes crypto whales raise eyebrows and weekend warriors FOMO in (okay, we almost used the word). What gives BRETT this edge? It’s got cultural meme status, tight tokenomics, and it’s riding shotgun on the rising Base ecosystem, which is getting more devs and users than ever. Plus, Brett doesn’t take itself too seriously—it’s got that chaotic Gen Z humor, drip-fed into meme culture, and polished with network utility. Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin stands tall as the most unique and promising meme coin of 2025. It’s not just another token—it’s a full-blown mythical journey through crypto lore. The presale model, weekly burns, narrative world-building, and 66% APY staking make it a no-brainer for anyone chasing the best new meme coins for exponential returns. Gigachad brings the Solana heat with undeniable strength and comeback potential. Meanwhile, Brett continues to stack meme power on Base Chain, proving its resilience and explosive ROI capacity. But let’s be honest, if you’re holding onto $1,000 and you miss Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale at Crystal Cove, you might be kicking yourself later when those listing prices explode. Join the Arctic Pablo Coin presale now and lock in your seat on Pablo’s snowmobile before it vanishes into the next location.

42468434,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=700852,1743061527,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42468434.jpeg,Robinhood to launch bank accounts with cash delivery to your door,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/robinhood-to-launch-bank-accounts/,"Robinhood just confirmed it’s building full-scale banking services into its app—and those services will include a feature for cash delivery straight to your house. The announcement came on Wednesday during its event Robinhood Presents: The Lost City of Gold, where the company laid out its newest products: Robinhood Banking, Robinhood Strategies, and Robinhood Cortex. All three are designed to expand its reach beyond trading into areas traditionally reserved for the wealthy. According to the company’s announcement, Robinhood Banking will launch in the fall of 2025, and it’s only available to Robinhood Gold members. Once live, users can open both checking and savings accounts inside the Robinhood Credit Card app, which will officially become the central banking app for all Robinhood financial tools. Gold members will get access to private banking services, traditional features like wire transfers, and luxury options like on-demand cash delivery, eliminating the need to visit an ATM. Robinhood promises private banking and luxury perks inside its app The upcoming banking platform includes 4.00% APY on savings accounts, which Robinhood says is nine times the national average. Users will be able to open individual, joint, and even children’s accounts with spending controls and built-in allowances. Every user will receive a debit Mastercard, and the platform supports money movement across 100+ currencies, international transfers, and real-time transfers between Robinhood accounts. Deepak Rao, Robinhood’s GM and VP of Money, said , “With Robinhood Banking, we’re trying to solve many of the challenges presented by legacy banks.” He added that the service was “designed to be as easy to use as possible” while offering benefits usually kept for the ultra-wealthy. Source: Robinhood Accounts will come with up to $2.5 million in FDIC insurance, around-the-clock support, and estate planning services. Professional tax advice will also be available through the platform. Users can monitor their net worth, see totals across linked accounts, and track assets held outside Robinhood. The cash delivery feature is part of a list of luxury perks, which also includes access to private jets, chauffeurs, helicopters, and tickets to invite-only events like the Met Gala, the Oscars, the F1 Monaco Grand Prix, and The Masters. Robinhood Banking is the follow-up to the Robinhood Gold Card, which launched last year. Over 100,000 users already have it, and the waitlist stands at nearly 3 million people. This week, Robinhood said it’s moving another 100,000 users off the waitlist. Robinhood Strategies introduces managed portfolios with capped fees Also announced at the event was Robinhood Strategies, which gives users tailored portfolios, financial guidance, and market insights inside the app. It’s available now for Gold members, with access for all users starting in April 2025. The platform offers portfolio management with a flat 0.25% annual fee, capped at $250 for Gold users. Anything over $100,000 is managed for free. So if your portfolio hits $250,000, that’s effectively 0.1% in fees, and at $500,000, it drops to 0.05%. Steph Guild, President of Robinhood Asset Management, said, “We realized the existing digital advisory model was broken, with limited features and fees that grow as you do better. We designed Robinhood Strategies to give everyone incredible service and low fees with a cap.” According to Robinhood, the team running this service has more than 50 years of combined experience on Wall Street, including managing accounts for high-net-worth individuals and institutional clients. Source: Robinhood The product builds portfolios using a foundation of diversified ETFs, with hand-picked single stocks chosen to take advantage of market behavior. Users get transparency through regular portfolio updates and market analysis right in the app. The platform gives users a dashboard that displays portfolio performance, asset allocation, and return drivers. It also allows recurring deposits and simulated return projections using Monte Carlo simulations. Robinhood said users can block specific stocks they don’t want in their portfolio and adjust preferences to match their risk level and time horizon. Tax features are included as well. Robinhood Strategies will attempt to minimize capital gains by selecting specific tax lots for selling. It will also allow users to manage external assets and enforce turnover limits to control taxes in brokerage accounts. Toward the end of the year, users will receive a breakdown of their gains and losses to help with tax-loss harvesting. Right now, the platform supports individual and retirement accounts, and Robinhood said joint accounts are on the way. Gold members who fund accounts by June 30 get the first $1,000 managed for free through the end of 2025. Non-Gold users get $500 managed free under the same timeline. Through May 30, Gold users also receive a 1% transfer boost up to $500, and non-Gold users get a 1% deposit boost up to $250. Robinhood Cortex adds AI-powered market analysis for retail traders The third product announced was Robinhood Cortex, a new AI tool that helps users break down market news and generate trade ideas. It’s not automated trading. It’s real-time research, and it’s built into the same app as Robinhood’s other tools. Abhishek Fatehpuria, VP of Brokerage Product, said, “High quality, premium investment and market analysis has historically been reserved for institutional investors and the rich. Over time, Robinhood Cortex will completely transform the Robinhood experience as we strive to bridge that gap and put a premium research assistant right in your pocket.” The first feature inside Cortex is Stock Digests, which shows a summary of what’s affecting any given stock. Users can tap a ticker and immediately get an update on news events, technical factors, or analyst reports that might be moving the price. The goal is to cut through the noise and get a short answer to the question: “Why is this stock up or down today?” The other feature is called Trade Builder. This lets users input their outlook for a stock, and Cortex responds by recommending a potential options trade based on that belief. It uses signals like price patterns, market data, and technical analysis to suggest strategies. Cortex will not place trades for users—it just helps gather and organize the information. Fatehpuria said the company expects Cortex to keep growing over time. In the future, it will be integrated into other areas of the app, improving how users research trades, manage risk, and interact with their portfolios. The tool will launch later this year, with early access going to Robinhood Gold members. All three products—Banking, Strategies, and Cortex—are set to roll out across 2025. All of them are tied to Robinhood’s push to give regular retail users tools that have traditionally belonged to elite firms and private banks. Every single part of the new lineup was presented as being available through a phone, with no in-person visits or paperwork needed. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

In 6 years, the company has grown from a local project to a leader in the European market. Today, the WhiteBIT Group ecosystem has over 35 million clients and includes various blockchain and crypto solutions, including a decentralized exchange, crypto processing, its own blockchain, and more. In a new interview, Volodymyr Nosov shares how the company transformed tough challenges into new opportunities and success through determination and innovation. The founder and president of WhiteBIT Group talks about the exchange’s start, rapid global expansion, and corporate culture, and shares his expert opinion on introducing regulation in the crypto market and the future of meme coins. How our launch in the bear market made us stronger Volodymyr, you founded the WhiteBIT cryptocurrency exchange six years ago, which soon became the largest in Europe. Please share a bit about your background and what led you to crypto. Everyone has a unique journey—what’s yours? WhiteBIT Group has come a long way from a startup to a global business. Today, our ecosystem serves over 35 million users and includes many blockchain and crypto products and services. However, it all started as a local project, with the creation of the WhiteBIT exchange. I’ve always been passionate about innovation—building something impactful, shaping the future, and improving everyday processes has been my driving force. 2016 was a turning point for me. That’s when I started exploring blockchain and Bitcoin, eager to invest and understand how to store crypto securely. I quickly realized that existing exchanges were far from user-friendly—they lacked essential features and provided a poor experience. This led me to conceptualize a crypto exchange that would meet user needs. In just over six years, what started as an exchange has grown into a full-fledged ecosystem, offering various blockchain and crypto solutions. Today, WhiteBIT continues to expand, shaping the industry and setting new standards in the market. WhiteBIT was founded in 2018 and has endured time and volatile markets. It now serves over 8 million users and has a $2.7 trillion annual trading volume. Can you take us back to its early days as a startup? We launched WhiteBIT in 2018 during a bear market—arguably one of the most challenging times to enter the industry. However, these harsh conditions shaped us. They forced us to stay focused, optimize resources, and build a solid foundation. When we were just starting, during peak loads or high registration periods, every specialist—regardless of their role—jumped in to help process client applications. We worked day and night as one well-coordinated team. No one stood aside; everyone was invested in the company’s success. Today, we are a team of 1,200, a full-fledged group of companies with a strong corporate culture and well-established processes. Over the years, we’ve grown, scaled, and improved key business metrics—and even accumulated some bureaucracy along the way (laughs). WhiteBIT Group is a vast blockchain ecosystem with various products that meet the needs of crypto and blockchain users worldwide. Apart from its flagship project, the WhiteBIT crypto exchange, WhiteBIT Group encompasses the Whitechain blockchain with its native coin, WhiteBIT Coin (WBT), the crypto acquiring solution Whitepay, the WhitePool mining pool, the decentralized exchange WhiteSwap, the WB Soul ecosystem, the CS marketplace White.market, and crypto education initiatives like ByHi and The Coinomist. We continue to expand and innovate, proving that a company born in a bear market can survive and thrive. How did the full-scale Russian invasion affect your company in terms of operations, market strategy, and international partnerships? It was a matter of principle for us to stop working with the Russian market after the full-scale invasion. We took all necessary measures to block transactions by Russian citizens. First, we disabled all payment gateways that allowed deposits or withdrawals in Russian rubles. Second, we removed all trading pairs involving the ruble. Third, we completely restricted Russian users from registering on our platform—both through KYC verification and by blocking access based on IP addresses. At the time, Russian users comprised nearly 30% of our client base, meaning we faced an immediate and substantial loss. However, instead of looking back, we chose to diversify and innovate, pushing forward with new business strategies to ensure sustainable growth. As a result, 2022 became a pivotal year for WhiteBIT, marked by the launch of numerous new products, projects, and partnerships. For example, in 2022, we expanded into the Turkish market, establishing a strong presence in a promising new region. Since then, we have entered the markets of Spain, Portugal, Georgia, Australia, Kazakhstan, Croatia, and Italy. Beyond product development, strategic partnerships played a key role in our expansion. In the fall of 2022, we became the official crypto partner of Trabzonspor, one of Turkey’s leading football clubs. Just a month later, we achieved another significant milestone—becoming the official cryptocurrency partner of FC Barcelona, further solidifying our presence in the global sports and crypto ecosystem. Our support for Ukraine during the war exceeds $11 million WhiteBIT has been a strong supporter of Ukraine during the war. Can you share some key initiatives the exchange has undertaken to aid the country? Many of our team members are Ukrainian, and for many of them, the war is deeply personal—friends, family members, and colleagues have joined the front lines as soldiers, medics, or volunteers. From the very beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion, WhiteBIT has been committed to actively supporting Ukraine. One of our key initiatives was signing a memorandum of cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine. Through this partnership, we launched a 24-hour call center and a chatbot to assist Ukrainians worldwide. Beyond humanitarian support, WhiteBIT has provided direct financial aid to support Ukraine. Over three years of full-scale war, starting February 24, 2022, we have donated more than $11 million of our funds. Our dedication remains steadfast, and we continue to explore new ways to contribute to the country’s resilience and recovery. You started in Ukraine but expanded the market into Europe. If Ukraine had remained geopolitically stable, do you think WhiteBIT would have achieved the same level of success, or did the situation in the country act as a catalyst for global expansion? We have always aimed high, building WhiteBIT with a strong focus on technological innovation and top-tier security. From the start, our goal was to create a platform that could compete with the biggest global players. Our team has worked tirelessly to refine and enhance our product, ensuring it meets the highest industry standards. Global expansion has always been part of our vision, and every step we’ve taken has been focused on steady growth and long-term success. What key factors would you say have contributed to your success in the crypto industry? Our success is built on three key pillars: security, user experience, and strategic growth. First and foremost, we prioritize reliability and security, which are the cornerstones of any leading crypto exchange. WhiteBIT became the first crypto exchange in the world to achieve the highest level of certification under the Cryptocurrency Security Standard (CCSS). Secondly, we’ve always been user-focused, continuously improving our product to meet the evolving demands of modern traders. Today’s users expect more than just basic functionality—they want an intuitive interface, diverse trading pairs, and innovative tools. We’ve tailored our platform to serve individual traders and institutional clients while developing strong marketing strategies, including top-tier referral programs. Recently, in partnership with Visa, we introduced the WhiteBIT Nova card, a debit card for daily cryptocurrency payments, adding even more value for our users. Another key factor is our global expansion strategy and collaborations with industry leaders. For example, we established official partnerships with VISA and ESL Faceit. Finally, our greatest strength is our team. With over 1,200 dedicated professionals, we are constantly enhancing the platform, launching new products, and engaging with our growing community of 35+ million users. Our team shares a deep belief in the future of crypto, working tirelessly to ensure WhiteBIT remains at the forefront of the industry. The WhiteBIT Nova card surpassed 1 million transactions in 3 months You mentioned the WhiteBIT Nova card. Given the considerable competition in the crypto card market, how successful do you view this project to be? We didn’t just launch another crypto payment card—we created something truly valuable. WhiteBIT Nova is the first-ever debit card for payments using digital assets with cashback, introduced in late 2024 in partnership with Visa. Unlike many competitors, we offer zero fees for opening or closing, which our customers appreciate. In just three months, we’ve recorded over a million transactions. Users frequently pay using USDC, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and WhiteBIT Token, often for subscriptions and services like Spotify, YouTube, Booking, KFC, and Ryanair. Cashback is most commonly earned on everyday purchases—groceries, dining, taxis, entertainment, and gaming. As expected, 89% of users prefer the digital version of the WhiteBIT Nova card, while only 11% opt for a physical card. The industry is flooded with new tokens—600,000 were launched in January alone. Are we in another ICO-style bubble, or is this just a sign of increasing crypto adoption? How do exchanges like WhiteBIT filter out real projects from the noise? We have a rigorous process for listing new coins. We carefully evaluate each project, its goals, and its unique features. Our listing procedure involves several stages. Initially, we discuss their technology, tokenomics, and legal compliance with the project’s team. We conduct a preliminary check to weed out fraudulent or low-quality projects that don’t meet our basic listing criteria. If the project passes this initial filter, we proceed with a more detailed analysis. This includes assessing legal compliance, project viability, and security measures, and evaluating the asset’s liquidity. Any project we list must offer enough liquidity to maintain a healthy trading environment and avoid excessive volatility. That being said, we also listen to our users. Many of them request certain high-risk assets in which they can allocate part of their portfolio, even if the success of these projects is uncertain. However, when we decide to filter out certain meme tokens or high-risk projects, it’s often done in response to user feedback. We aim to strike a balance between offering innovative projects and protecting the interests of our traders. What are your thoughts on the meme cycle? What do you think will be the community’s breaking point, especially after that high-profile back-to-back rug pulls? Are memes gonna die this year like NFTs did in 2022? Meme coins are not a recent phenomenon—they’ve been around since the first global hype in 2017. Take Dogecoin, for example, one of the oldest meme coins. It gained significant attention, even earning support from figures like Elon Musk. While Dogecoin continues to have a decent market cap, the reality is that any project without real utility or tangible benefits will eventually fizzle out. As industry regulation deepens, meme coins will face even greater challenges. Over the next few years, the market will likely cleanse itself of these short-lived hype projects. For instance, investors and companies backing Bitcoin have little interest in these types of projects. They dilute the audience and financial flows. With 600,000 tokens being launched each month, the target audience gets fragmented. Instead of focusing on core assets like Bitcoin and Ether, users are spread thin across countless tokens. For larger market players, it’s more beneficial to build a market audience around key coins like Bitcoin and Ether, increasing their demand and value. This shift will gradually lead to meme coins fading from the market as the focus moves back to assets with real, long-term value. Being a global player, how do you see the crypto regulatory landscape evolving across major regions? Mass legalization and regulation of cryptocurrencies will be among the most significant factors shaping the market’s development in 2025. More countries are set to adopt clear legislative frameworks, which will provide a much-needed boost for the global expansion of the crypto ecosystem. For example, implementing MiCA in the European Union opens many new opportunities. With a well-defined regulatory environment, the market will gain new tools—crypto projects will have access to banking and fintech services. At the same time, traditional financial institutions can tap into blockchain technologies. This will lead to greater availability of virtual assets for users. I think the adoption rate will soar when crypto is integrated into familiar platforms, such as German banks or mainstream apps. Virtual assets will increasingly find their way into banking products, telecommunication services, and marketplaces, making them more accessible and practical for everyday use. Regulatory clarity, combined with this wider integration, will make virtual assets more understandable and user-friendly for the mass market, much like the experience in Asian countries, where people have a deeper understanding of the industry compared to Europe. The team’s role and the upcoming trading competition Finally, let’s discuss your team. How has your team and corporate culture changed during the rapid growth of the company and its international expansion? Over the past three years, our team has grown 5x, bringing together 1,200 top professionals worldwide. We’ve built a truly global presence with official offices in Europe (UK, Lithuania, Ukraine, Georgia, Portugal), Asia (Turkey), and Australia. At WhiteBIT, our team is the foundation of everything we do. We are proud to work with the best of the best—passionate, driven experts who push the boundaries of innovation every day. At the same time, we are deeply committed to nurturing young talent and fostering a culture of continuous learning. We prioritize vertical growth—helping our employees advance their careers—and horizontal development, encouraging cross-functional expertise and collaboration. To support this, we have developed a range of internal programs. Knowledge-sharing is at the heart of our culture: we host regular internal sessions where team members exchange expertise and insights. We have also introduced exclusive crypto education courses to equip our employees with top-tier industry knowledge. Beyond theory, we emphasize real-world learning experiences—our recent WhiteBIT Crypto Trading tournament is just one example of how we create hands-on opportunities for professional growth. Our expansion continues rapidly—just last year, we welcomed 200+ new professionals. As we grow, we remain committed to building a strong and future-focused team that drives the evolution of the crypto industry. Do you intend to host similar competitions for a larger audience? This spring, we are launching the first-ever International Crypto Trading Cup (ICTC), a groundbreaking event that will bring cryptocurrency trading to the big stage with a live broadcast. The tournament will feature eight elite traders competing in live futures trading using a dedicated game capital provided by WhiteBIT. This ensures a secure environment where participants can fully showcase their skills. Hence, ICTC is an educational experience in its essence. Millions of viewers worldwide will have the chance to watch top professionals make real-time decisions, track their trades, and analyze their strategies, gaining invaluable insights along the way. Secondly, it’s set to be an exciting, large-scale trading show where anyone can participate. Viewers will be able to compete against star traders online—individually or as part of squads led by experienced leaders. On top of that, we have valuable prizes and surprises in store. One of the eight star traders will be chosen from our global trading community. From March 27 to April 7, we host a Qualifying trading tournament to select a standout trader who will join the top seven professionals on stage for the main event in May.

Table of Contents XRP battles resistance as it struggles to hold above two dollars Payment altcoin Remittix becomes the top pick over XRP Remittix presale explodes as XRP fatigue sets in XRP is facing heavy resistance at the $2.50 mark, with momentum slowing despite bullish market conditions. As signs of buyer fatigue set in, investors are beginning to look elsewhere, specifically toward Remittix (RTX), a rising payment-focused altcoin offering real-world utility and rapid adoption. While XRP remains weighed down by past regulatory scars and sluggish breakout attempts, Remittix’s explosive presale and instant crypto-to-fiat features are drawing serious attention. The shift suggests a growing appetite for practical blockchain solutions in 2025. XRP battles resistance as it struggles to hold above two dollars The XRP price is testing investor patience as it hovers just below a key psychological level. After a long legal standoff with the SEC, Ripple finally cleared its regulatory hurdles, sparking waves of optimism. But that momentum is beginning to fade. XRP has struggled to decisively break past $2.50, despite being added to the U.S. Digital Asset Reserve, a milestone many expected would ignite a sustained rally. Instead, the token is showing signs of buyer fatigue. At $2.47, the XRP price has posted only modest gains, and technical indicators suggest it’s hitting liquidity resistance near the $2.60 mark. Even with Bitcoin’s rally lifting the broader market, XRP has failed to keep up with the surging energy. Some traders point to thinning volume and slowing upward pressure as red flags. The initial buzz around ETF speculation and Ripple’s stablecoin plans has cooled, leaving investors looking elsewhere for faster gains. While XRP continues to position itself as a global payment solution, others argue that the market has already priced in much of its near-term potential. That sentiment is reflected in capital rotation happening in real time, funds are now flowing toward newer payment-based altcoins that promise not just legacy use cases, but innovation. One such rising token is already pulling ahead in terms of both momentum and user demand, and for many investors, it’s becoming the more attractive play.

Payment altcoin Remittix becomes the top pick over XRP As XRP faces stiff resistance at $2.50, a new altcoin quietly reshaping the payment conversation is gaining serious traction. Remittix (RTX), a next-gen Ethereum -based token, is rapidly becoming the investor favorite among those frustrated by XRP’s sluggish breakout attempts. Traders who once doubled down on XRP are now turning to Remittix, drawn by its practical crypto-to-fiat remittance system and explosive upside potential. Unlike speculative memecoins or stalled Layer-1s, Remittix offers an immediate real-world utility, instant crypto conversions to fiat, which are then deposited straight into bank accounts worldwide. The platform removes delays, minimizes fees, and enables international payments with a level of ease XRP originally promised but has yet to fully deliver. This shift in focus toward utility has not gone unnoticed. The project has already raised more than $14 million and sold over 522 million tokens, despite still being in presale at just $0.0734. Early backers are already celebrating returns of over 1,000%, while projections of a 50x to 100x surge after launch continue to attract investors watching XRP stagnate near resistance. With XRP struggling to build momentum and Remittix consistently outperforming expectations, the narrative is changing. Remittix presale explodes as XRP fatigue sets in Analysts are pointing to the increasing shift in retail and institutional sentiment, away from established names and toward functional, high-upside platforms like Remittix. As momentum builds, it’s no longer a question of whether Remittix can match XRP’s rise; it’s whether it can outperform it entirely. With adoption accelerating and attention shifting, this payment altcoin isn’t just another alternative. It’s the one investors believe could redefine the payment sector of crypto.

With President Trump expected to sign the bill , it could officially become law by the end of the week. The bill’s supporters say this will ease pressure on DeFi developers and help grow blockchain innovation. The vote took place on March 26, when senators passed H.J. Res. 25 with a strong 70-28 majority. This resolution, led by Senator Ted Cruz and Representative Mike Carey, had already been passed earlier in March but needed a second vote due to budget rules. The House had previously approved it with a 292-132 vote. Crypto advocate Dan Gambardello called the move “bullish,” pointing out that fewer regulations will likely lead to more innovation. Journalist Eleanor Terrett said, based on a Republican source in the Senate, that the bill could become law by Friday. If President Trump signs it under the Congressional Review Act, it would be the first crypto-related bill to become U.S. law . Earlier this month, David Sacks, the White House advisor for AI and crypto, voiced his support for the resolution, saying Trump’s senior advisors would suggest signing it. This development comes at a time when the crypto industry is pushing for more clear and fair rules. A coalition of organizations—such as Coinbase, Kraken, Paradigm, A16z Crypto, and Polygon Labs—sent a letter to Congress on March 26. The letter was addressed to key committees in the Senate and House, including Banking, Judiciary, and Financial Services. In the letter, the DeFi Education Fund and its partners criticized the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) interpretation of money transmission laws , especially the law on “unlicensed money transmitting businesses.” They argue that the DOJ is stretching the law too far and that it could criminalize software developers who build blockchain tools but don’t hold or control user funds . According to the coalition, these developers use non-custodial technologies, meaning they have no access to customer assets. Treating them as money transmitters, they say, goes against legal tradition and could harm U.S. tech innovation. The letter also says the DOJ’s view doesn’t match earlier guidance from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) or past legal rulings. The signers are asking Congress to urge the DOJ to rethink its position. They want to make sure software developers are protected and that U.S. law matches both legal history and what Congress originally meant. The goal is to prevent confusion and keep the U.S. as a leader in digital innovation. In short, this Senate vote signals a turning point. If President Trump signs the bill as expected, it will be a major victory for the crypto industry, reduce oversight on DeFi, and protect developers building open, decentralized systems.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|TECHNOLOGY|MATIC,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-27 07:53:58

As selling activity rises and buyers show hesitance, is a Ripple price crash to $1 brewing? Let’s explore. XRP Price Prediction as Top Trader Sounds Bearish Alarm XRP price today trades at $2.36 after a 4% drop in 24 hours. At press time, Ripple had the biggest 24-hour loss among the top ten largest cryptos by market cap. Top crypto analyst and trader Peter Brandt has noted that Ripple’s downtrend was only just beginning. In his analysis, he pointed out a head and shoulders pattern on the XRP price chart. This pattern usually predicts a trend reversal from bullish to bearish. Brandt observed that XRP price has successfully defended support at the neckline of this pattern at $1.90. However, if the current downtrend progresses and Ripple breaches this support level, it could spark a decline towards $1.07. Conversely, if buyers step in now, and XRP price manages to break out above $3, it will invalidate this bearish setup. XRP Price Chart A recent Coingape article also highlighted the top reasons why the XRP bull run may be over as the price remains stuck in consolidation for three months. Moreover, speculation that the market may have already priced in Ripple’s win in the SEC case is causing reduced trader interest. Is an XRP Crash to $1 Brewing? A full bearish reversal for XRP price that will confirm a crash to $1 will only happen if it breaches the neckline of $1.90 as highlighted on Brandt’s chart. However, several catalysts could push Ripple past $2.90 and invalidate this bearish pattern. Nate Geraci, the President of ETF Store, opined that the end of the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit has increased the odds of an XRP ETF approval . “Spot XRP ETF approval is simply a matter of time. And yes, I expect Blackrock, Fidelity, etc to all be involved.” If BlackRock files for a spot XRP ETF before the XRP price drops to $1.90, the price is bound to rally and possibly break out of the bearish head and shoulders pattern and avoid a crash to $1. The other catalyst that could prevent an XRP price crash to $1 is a surge in leveraged trading activity. Popular analyst Ali Charts noted that XRP futures contracts have surged by 36% in just two weeks. This increase likely comes from a buildup of long positions. Data from Coinglass further shows that on Binance, 72% of traders have opened long positions on XRP, while only 27% of traders have opened short positions. This data depicts positive trader sentiment that the XRP price will rebound . Binance XRP Long/Short Ratio These factors suggest that an XRP crash to $1 is not brewing, and such a drop might not happen in the near term. Ripple Technical Analysis Ripple’s 4-hour price chart shows that the altcoin has entered a key demand zone. The volume profile bars show at the current price zone, bullish pressure is stronger than bearish pressure, which could prevent a drop to the crucial level of $1.90. This price chart further shows that the immediate support level lies at $2.23. Falling below this level has previously caused a spike in selling volumes. If XRP continues to trade above this level, a drop to $1 may not happen. However, a full reversal from bullish to bearish trends will occur if XRP makes a decisive close above the $2.59 resistance. The RSI, which stands at 39 at press time, also needs to rise past 50 to show strong buying activity and bullish momentum. XRP/USDT: 4-hour Chart This price chart shows mixed sentiment towards the XRP price. Despite Ripple being in a demand zone, buying activity as depicted by the RSI is still low. Nevertheless, as long as Ripple defends crucial support levels at $2.23 and $1.90, it can prevent a crash to $1.

Long-term holders are seeing a significant portion of their invested capital sitting underwater. Using data from Glassnode’s Net Unrealized Profit/Loss indicator, we can see that sentiment has entered a state of fear. This is a signal that, in previous instances, has indicated either a sharp increase in accumulation or some other form of price reaction in the near future. Solana is at present not able to achieve those previous high marks. Many people are watching closely to try and see what it is indicating, if anything, about market direction. All this is occurring alongside growing trader optimism that a spot Solana Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) could be imminent, with Polymarket traders saying there’s an 85% chance for such a creature to exist by 2025. If that happens, it could really pump the price. But is that what we’re seeing now? Or are we just seeing the market pump in anticipation of approval? Polymarket traders are betting big on a spot Solana ETF—pricing in an 85% chance of approval in 2025. Is the market ahead of the curve, or is this just wishful thinking? https://t.co/0b0WAsKL24 pic.twitter.com/DseQid9R7d — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) March 25, 2025 A Critical Moment for Solana: Fear and Unrealized Losses Once hailed as a high-speed, low-cost alternative to Ethereum, Solana has had a rough stretch in the market. The NUPL indicator, which tracks the balance between unrealized profits and losses of a network’s holders, now shows that a pretty large portion of $SOL holders are underwater. That’s a pretty big deal for Solana, considering that the last time it held a rally prior to this apparent downturn, quite a few net new investors had come on board and had started buying. Now, those are the people who seem to be the most net long on Solana, and they’re the ones really holding onto what are pretty apparent losses. Previously, times characterized by high amounts of unrecognized losses tended to lead to one of two results. They sometimes produced accumulation phases, which are periods in which market participants recognize that a discounted asset presents an extraordinary buying opportunity. They sometimes produced price rallies, which are what happen when assets start looking good to enough participants that they start buying those assets again. Solana being at a potentially pivotal price point could be related to either of those two possibilities. Solana Market Update Glassnode’s NUPL indicator is flashing ‘fear’—long-term $SOL holders are deep in unrealized losses. Historically, moments like this have led to one of two things: Big accumulation before a rally More pain if buyers don’t step in Will SOL find… pic.twitter.com/6JM3AK0uqZ — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) March 25, 2025 On the other hand, if buying pressure does not show up, the market may suffer more. Selling from underwater investors could still push prices lower, especially if there is no new buying interest in $SOL. Continued price declines could push the Solana ecosystem deeper into a bear market. As with any asset, sentiment is a critical driver of price, and Solana’s future trajectory seems destined to zigzag up and down based on how fear-filled or exuberant the community around it feels. Solana ETF Speculation: A Potential Catalyst? In a market that is largely filled with uncertainty, there is one source of optimism: the possible approval of a spot Solana ETF. Traders on the Polymarket betting platform now give an 85% chance that such an ETF gets approved before 2025, and this is certainly a growing sentiment among members of the Solana community in light of the recent overall market being more bullish. The idea of a Solana ETF has built quite a bit of traction behind it. An ETF would let institutional folks buy into the $SOL without having to buy the cryptocurrency itself—nebulously “owning” the thing through the fund structure. This, in turn, could signal a (possibly increased) wave of institutional capital surging into Solana’s ecosystem, and, as lore has it, might boost the token’s “legitimacy” and liquidity. The question, however, remains whether this optimism is premature. While an ETF could be a major catalyst for the token’s price, we must remember that the approval process for such products is never certain. Regulatory hurdles and market conditions might delay or stop altogether the approval of a Solana ETF. Furthermore, while the market has shown considerable interest in Ethereum ETFs, the approval of a Solana ETF would be a first for the Solana ecosystem, and the success of such a product is still an open question. Despite all this, traders appear to be pricing in at least a decent chance the ETF will be approved. And if it is actually OK’d in the next couple of years, that very well might lead to an immediate bump in Solana’s token price, given how associated with the Ethereum alternative that network is right now. What’s Next for Solana? “The next few months remain cloudy for Solana, with key factors likely to influence its price action.”Why? There could be two reasons. One is the sobering possibility that if the current sentiment does not turn around, and if the selling pressure does not abate, then Solana and perhaps the whole crypto market could face significant downside. Not just in the short term, but also in what some might call a crypto winter. The alternative is the market could have reached a point of maximum fear. And in that case, it could be setting up for a period of accumulation. Hope is in sight for Solana long-term investors as we could see a Solana ETF getting approved by 2025. The result of this approval would mean that Solana could experience some sort of boost in its price and market perception, mainly because ETFs are more readily accessible and consequently more impactful than direct investments by institutions. At present, Solana holders and potential investors need to keep a close watch on the market sentiment and be ready to react to whatever direction the market may take. Whether the fear represents a market bottom that is signaling a time to accumulate or whether it foretells further downside is still an open question. In either case, Solana’s long-term potential will ultimately depend on whether the project can come through this period of adversity and emerge on the other side.

Despite the Layer 2 (L2) solutions of Ethereum booming and seeing a lot of development, Arbitrum, the second-largest L2 platform by total value locked, is in a market downturn that’s very sharp, very clear, and not very good. Most recently, @intotheblock reported that a staggering 98% of Arbitrum holders are currently under water, with only 1% able to claim that their investments are in the green. This is a massive wipeout for a platform that most of us (including me) thought was going to be a big winner. Is the market on the verge of capitulating, or is it gearing up for a reversal? According to @intotheblock , 98% of #Arbitrum ($ARB) holders are out of the money, with only 1% in profit. With ARB at $0.39, are we near capitulation or setting up for a reversal? What's your take ? Bullish or bearish on $ARB ? #Crypto pic.twitter.com/R0qYsfIr67 — champagne mami (@EkponoAkwaowo) March 26, 2025 Arbitrum Faces a Critical Moment Amid Price Decline $ARB’s price has dropped sharply, leading to widespread concern among holders. The majority of the token’s investors are now underwater. This state of affairs points to a period of difficulty for Arbitrum, punctuated by the price dropping to such a low level. Meanwhile, the market seems on the verge of capitulation—when most holders sell off their positions—that could, in the view of some hopeful investors, set up the potential for a reversal. Market sentiment often reaches extremes of pessimism before a market cedes to capitulators. Investors abandon their holdings, and prices spiral downwards; yet in the case of Arbitrum, the fundamentals and adoption level of the project not only allow but practically ensure a recovery. Even as arbitration pricing against the ERC-20 standard has fallen significantly—reduced by half just last week—Arbitrum remains a vital part of the Ethereum ecosystem. At $2.58 billion, Arbitrum’s total value locked (TVL) puts it firmly at the front of the line in Ethereum’s scaling efforts. But the price of ARB has been in freefall for the most part, which has in turn catalyzed some grandstanding on the part of a few analysts who want to use Arbitrum’s predicament to badmouth Ethereum as a whole. We wanted to avoid that. So today, we’re taking a look at some of the oomph Arbitrum has as an Ethereum Layer 2. The focus will be on technology and ecosystem — not so much on price. And we’ll be looking at our old friend T-shirt graph, depicted in some now-familiar colors. Ethereum’s L2 Ecosystem: Growth and Competition Although the current problems with Arbitrum may be grabbing the headlines, the entire Layer 2 ecosystem of Ethereum is flourishing. Base, another Layer 2 chain, has recently taken the lead in terms of total value locked (TVL), with an impressive $3.19 billion. Base has emerged as a big player in the Layer 2 space, attracting all sorts of investors to its platform thanks to its scalability and the rapidly growing ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) that it enjoys. Base’s TVL has grown at an absolutely stunning clip over the past week, up 12.6% in just seven days. By contrast, Arbitrum has not made quite the same sort of TVL explosion lately, but it retains a solid edge over several other Layer 2 competitors in terms of total value locked. Top Layer 2 Chains by Total Value Locked! #Ethereum ’s L2 ecosystem is booming, with Base leading at $3.19B TVL, followed by Arbitrum at $2.58B! Biggest 7D Growth: @soneium (+23.3%), Mantle (+12.3%), @base (+12.6%) Biggest TVL: @base , @arbitrum , @0xPolygon … pic.twitter.com/qVybSNwi6r — TokenHunter (@_TokenHunter) March 26, 2025 The contest among Ethereum’s Layer 2 ecosystems is getting fiercer, with other projects like Mantle (up 12.3%) and Soneium (up 23.3%) also enjoying handsome gains. These platforms, along with the previously mentioned ones, are adding to what seems like the inexorable expansion of Ethereum’s scaling solutions. And Layer 2 is where the action is. Compared with the demure Layer 1 Ethereum, which is known for its slow speeds and high fees, Layer 2 offers a low-cost, low-latency alternative that still gets the Ethereum security blanket. Even though Arbitrum is having a hard time with its price, it is still bringing in some strong numbers with its TVL. The platform is one of the top Layer 2 chains when it comes to 24-hour volume, and it even had $613 million traded over the last day. This suggests, despite how much Arbitrum is struggling in terms of its price, that the network is still very active. The Path Ahead for Arbitrum and Layer 2 The future looks murky for Arbitrum, but one thing is certain: it’s at a crossroads. Most holders are nursing losses, and with so many investors underwater, the sell pressure could intensify if prices keep dropping. But how likely is that? And could a downturn somehow work in Arbitrum’s favor? Currently, Arbitrum holds a solid position as one of the lead Layer 2 solutions, boasting a sizeable total value locked (TVL) along with a significant level of activity in terms of transactions. Most recently, the projected long-term viability of Ethereum—and, by extension, its ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps)—has given Layer 2 solutions renewed attention as a potentially thriving segment of the Ethereum network. If Ethereum retains its place in the blockchain pantheon, and if the dApp revolution takes off as some envision, then Layer 2s like Arbitrum should enjoy significant long-term growth prospects. To sum up, although Arbitrum is confronted with major problems at the present time, the overall Ethereum Layer 2 ecosystem is expanding quickly, with Base, Arbitrum, and Polygon in the lead. Whether Arbitrum can manage to turn things around is an open question, but its ongoing development, coupled with its pivotal role in Ethereum’s scaling efforts, suggest that it might just manage to ride out the present storm. Meanwhile, the steadily evolving L2 landscape is not going to hold still for anyone, so closely watching both the price action and the ongoing technological advancements associated with Arbitrum and its chief rivals is going to be a necessary task for investors.

Lawmakers across the country are proposing and passing bills that support crypto mining, Bitcoin reserves , and digital asset investments. These moves highlight a growing view of crypto not just as a speculative tool, but as a strategic financial asset . In Kentucky, major progress came on March 24 when the governor signed the “Blockchain Digital Asset Act” (HB701) into law. This law gives residents the right to hold their own Bitcoin and offers benefits to crypto mining companies. The Senate passed it with full support, 37-0. With access to energy from coal and hydropower, Kentucky is positioning itself as a major mining hub. In fact, it currently holds 11% of the total U.S. Bitcoin hashrate. North Carolina is also taking bold steps. Lawmakers there introduced three bills to invest public money in digital assets. Bill H506 and S709 both allow up to 5% of state funds to go into digital assets, while H92 pushes that number up to 10% for strategic reserves. These proposals would allow the state to protect public funds from inflation and build long-term value through crypto investments. Lawmakers are working quickly, aiming to pass the bills in the coming weeks. Arizona is following a similar path. Two bills—SB1373 and SB1025—were approved by the House Rules Committee. SB1373 allows the state treasurer to create a digital asset reserve using funds from seized criminal assets. The treasurer can invest up to 10% of the reserve and lend assets to earn more money, as long as the risks are controlled. SB1025 would let Arizona invest up to 10% of treasury and pension funds into Bitcoin. If the federal government builds a Bitcoin reserve fund, Arizona could store its holdings there for added safety. Oklahoma is getting involved too. The state’s House recently passed HB1203, the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill. This bill allows public funds from several state accounts to be invested in Bitcoin, stablecoins, and top-tier digital assets with a market cap over $500 billion. Across the country, more than 20 states are now considering similar plans. According to Bitcoin Law, 23 of 50 U.S. states have introduced Bitcoin reserve bills. Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck, said these bills could bring up to $23 billion in Bitcoin purchases , or 247,000 BTC . This estimate doesn’t even include what might come from pension fund investments, which could increase if lawmakers go forward. These state efforts are gaining momentum after the Trump administration showed strong support for Bitcoin. On March 7, the White House approved the creation of a Federal Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This has opened the door for states to align their financial strategies with national crypto policy. With this growing wave of state-level legislation, the U.S. is moving closer to integrating cryptocurrency into public finance. Whether it’s through mining, reserves, or direct investment, states are laying the foundation for a new kind of financial future—one where digital assets play a central role.",,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|FIAT|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-27 07:56:39

Priced at $0.62, Nillion is not just catching attention; it is easily the most longed token since the past 24 hours, and with good reason too: several groundbreaking innovations introduced by Nillion just this week have many thinking that it may very well be the most undervalued project in the space. $NIL @nillionnetwork (now at $0.62) is the most longed token by CEX smart money wallets during the last 24 hours Few facts about Nillion and why they probably invest in it: Privacy Innovation: Nillion introduces ""Blind Compute"" technology, enabling secure data computation and… pic.twitter.com/akfutaEp5M — CoinSense.app (@CoinSense_App) March 26, 2025 A Groundbreaking Approach to Privacy with Blind Compute Technology Nillion’s recent attention stems in large part from its edgy take on privacy. At the heart of Nillion’s tech is something called “Blind Compute,” which, as the name suggests, offers a way to compute (make calculations with) data without seeing the data (or without exposing it). In this case, “seeing” involves artificial intelligence that has been trained to make sense of data. In an era when privacy is in increasing demand—particularly as AI becomes more pervasive—Nillion’s remedy for the problem of projecting private data into the public domain seems, on the surface anyway, to be a solid solution. Blind Compute technology fills a critical gap in the current AI landscape. Concerns are growing over the amount of sensitive data AI and machine learning handle. Nillion’s innovation allows data to be processed in a blind manner. That means no third party sees the data being processed. This level of privacy and security appeals to both users who are conscious of their privacy and to institutional investors. Increasingly, these investors are looking to put money into projects that are focused on privacy. A Leap Forward in AI Research Nillion is tooting its own horn in artificial intelligence and getting some serious buzz from the sectors it straddles—tech and cryptocurrency. Recent developments have now very much become a part of Nillion’s narrative. Tech and crypto reconnaissance have been captivated and intrigued. The network’s prototype stands compared to a pretty big milestone for privacy-oriented AIs—Microsoft’s Sigma paper. Combining Blind Computation with AI offers an attractive, infrequent-solution way of doing secure, efficient data processing. Nillion’s prototype produces impressive, superior results that showcase its technological advantage and highlight the way its very existence has the potential to revolutionize compute-intensive tasks like deep learning and AI model training and to do so while protecting the user data involved. For investors who are keen on AI and its potential, Nillion’s model offers something extremely unique: a project that merges two of the most critical sectors—AI and data privacy—at a scale no other project has yet achieved. The Nucleus Program: Building a Robust Developer Ecosystem Investor interest in Nillion is also growing because of another factor: the Nillion developer ecosystem. The developer ecosystem of Nillion is still in its infancy, but the Nillion team has already taken steps to push it toward vibrancy. What does this mean? Well, it means that Nillion is creating a state in which developers want to work on the platform (for high-value data) and to push forth with their creations, in and of itself a good thing for any network. Further, this could enhance a couple of the good reasons to think the price of Nillion’s token (NIL) could increase. The Nucleus program incentivizes app development, and it’s a two-for-one: Not only does it boost the Nillion network’s functionality and allow us to demonstrate what we can do, but it also increases the long-term investment potential, which is our focus currently. We want people to put money into Nillion, and as soon as possible, frankly. We have two major verticals for app dev right now. The first is building applications that work with us in delivering data to the kind of parity that you want in order to achieve a private cloud or in order to achieve some kind of functionality where you can deliver data loans to private institutions in a way that’s qualitatively different from anything they’ve had before. In addition, as the Nillion network develops additional applications, the corresponding need for $NIL tokens is likely to increase. This could act as an added upward force on the price of the token, providing even greater returns for early investors. And as those use cases expand, they too will align the Nillion network with the trend of blockchains and cryptocurrencies developing real-world applications, for which the value proposition in these projects has certainly been enhanced. Why Smart Money Investors Are Bullish on Nillion The increasing allure of Nillion among astute investors, especially on global centralized exchanges, is a direct outcome of these recent developments. Nillion’s innovation and its privacy-first, with the potential for AI-derived breakthroughs, make it a cryptocurrency space that stands out incalculably. And of course, there are reasons, big ones, that explain why smart money is seeking out the Nillion project. Chief among those reasons is investors’ clear, unmistakable attraction to the project’s tech edge and what that could mean for solving some of the urgent problems, privacy and data security, that lie at the heart of today’s digital economy. The Nucleus program provides a strong roadmap for growth, which makes Nillion an appealing long-term investment. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market keeps evolving; and in the space where our next-generation Nillion Network operates, the captured attention of retail and institutional investors seems to be increasingly focused on solutions to five high-demand issues: 1. The lack of real-world applicability for most cryptocurrencies. 2. Insufficient scalability of current blockchain solutions. 3. A need for increased and sustained innovation in the web3 space. 4. Privacy and the security of digital identities. 5. Artificial intelligence and its rapid development. To sum up, Nillion ($NIL), with its emphasis on private innovation, breakthrough AI research, and a thriving developer community, is carving out a space for itself as a leader in the twin worlds of privacy and AI. Its token price has surged recently (along with price charts for just about everything else in crypto), and interest in it from CEX smart money wallets has picked up considerably, both of which make it a token to watch.

According to local media , the five suspects, including one woman, were taken into custody following an investigation by the cybercrime wing of Odisha’s Crime Branch. The accused reportedly ran a scam using a bogus trading app called ZAIF, where they promised massive returns of up to 200% on digital currency investments. The trading platform was promoted as being based in Japan. It’s worth noting that ZAIF is the name of a legitimate Japanese cryptocurrency exchange, which suffered a $60 million hack in 2022. However, the platform used in this scam is likely unaffiliated and merely borrowed the name to appear credible. The fraud kicked off when the victim, an Indian businessman, was contacted on Facebook by a woman claiming to be a Hong Kong-based IBM software developer. You might also like: Indian police bust $2m RSN crypto scam with alleged ties to China She gained his trust and convinced him to invest in crypto via ZAIF. Over a month, he transferred more than INR 6 crore (approximately $$699,352) across various accounts controlled by the scammers. As is common in such crypto trading scams, the victim was initially shown fake profits on the platform to build trust. However, when the victim attempted to withdraw gains, the platform demanded an additional INR 89 lakh to unlock the funds — a tactic commonly referred to as an advance fee fraud . Once the victim refused, the scammers vanished, cutting off contact. Police tracked down the suspects through digital trails and banking records. Authorities seized phones, SIM cards, ID documents, and other incriminating materials during a raid. With cryptocurrencies still operating in a grey area , India remains a hotspot for scams and fraud targeting unsuspecting users. Earlier this month, police cracked down on a similar scam that promoted a fake token called RSN and promised 2% daily returns . Losses were estimated to be between $1.14 and $2.29 million.

The state has teamed up with LayerZero, a well-known interoperability protocol, to issue the token. WYST will be pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed by a mix of cash, U.S. Treasury bonds, and repurchase agreements. The plan includes a strict 102% reserve requirement to ensure full support for each token issued. This will be the first stablecoin fully issued by a government entity in the United States. Wyoming is currently considering nine different blockchains to host the stablecoin, including Ethereum , Solana, and Polygon . The aim is to carry out a small-scale test of stablecoin technology with the hope that it may grow over time. Governor Mark Gordon announced the partnership at the DC Blockchain Summit. However, Senator Cynthia Lummis, a vocal crypto advocate from Wyoming, appears not to be directly involved in this project. In the past, Lummis pushed for a state-level Bitcoin Reserve bill, but it failed in committee due to opposition from fiscal conservatives, who were against spending taxpayer funds on Bitcoin. The WYST project, however, is separate from the Bitcoin reserve debate. Its financial structure is built to avoid the need for new tax funding. Instead, the state plans to use the interest generated from WYST’s reserve assets to fund key public services such as education and infrastructure. Some lawmakers are still concerned. Fiscal conservatives in Wyoming may object to using existing state investments for the stablecoin. Still, the state already controls about $31 billion in assets , including cash and U.S. bonds. That means Wyoming could use a portion of these holdings for WYST without needing new funds. LayerZero stated that being chosen for this project is a sign of the future of finance . “There’s no clearer message about where money is going than a U.S. state putting the dollar onchain,” the company posted online. WYST will be a fully reserved, fiat-backed stablecoin, issued by the state and monitored under strict rules to protect its value. Wyoming’s move comes as stablecoins become a bigger part of national conversations. President Trump has recently said that stablecoins could play a big role in maintaining the U.S. dollar’s global power . This adds more weight to Wyoming’s experiment, as it could act as a model for other states. If the WYST stablecoin proves successful, it could inspire similar initiatives elsewhere. The goal is not only to test the technology but also to show how public finance can benefit from digital tools. A well-run state-backed stablecoin could provide a stable, trusted alternative to private crypto tokens while offering new ways to manage public money. Wyoming is trying something bold.

42468949,https://nulltx.com/?p=147478,1743062445,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"GameStop Embraces Bitcoin in Strategic Move, Stock Jumps 6.30% After Hours",https://nulltx.com/gamestop-embraces-bitcoin-in-strategic-move-stock-jumps-6-30-after-hours/,"In a daring sign-of-the-times move, GameStop has updated its investment policy to include Bitcoin as part of its treasury reserves. This is a significant change for the video game retailer, which is known almost exclusively for its physical stores and for being a meme stock. But therein, of course, lies part of the story: GameStop also used to be a company that was largely tied to the physical world. And it still is, even more than it is tied to the virtual world of cryptocurrency. So what should we make of the bold move that GameStop has just made? In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), GameStop disclosed that it has diversified its financial approach to cover not just traditional asset classes but also digital ones—as indicated by Bitcoin and USD stablecoins—that are rapidly becoming mainstream. This is one small step, one filing at a time, toward ensuring that GameStop is not just a retail meme but a sustainable business that prospects in an age of alternatives. Bitcoin and Stablecoins Now Part of GameStop’s Investment Strategy GameStop’s official filing indicates that the company may now hold Bitcoin alongside USD stablecoins in its treasury reserve assets. The company positioning itself to benefit from digital currencies while also perhaps diversifying fiat currency for the sake of enhancing its financial flexibility is a new development and, as such, calls for attention. The inclusion of Bitcoin in this move is especially significant since the cryptocurrency has achieved acclaim—despite its volatility—for possibly serving as a modern-day equivalent to gold. The filing, however, also confesses to the dangers of holding cryptocurrencies. GameStop stated unequivocally that it is on the same page as everyone else who fancies Bitcoin and other forms of digital assets. “You should understand that we’re probably just as uncertain about this investment as you are,” is the impression I get from this part of the filing. I suppose this is a necessary admission in order for GameStop to proceed with its shareholder-friendly crypto gambit. GameStop Adds Bitcoin to Treasury, Stock Surges 6.30% After Hours On Mar 25, @gamestop updated its investment policy, officially adding Bitcoin to its treasury reserve assets. The filing states: The company may invest in Bitcoin and USD stablecoins. Acknowledges… pic.twitter.com/8qWcVDjrQR — Followin (@followin_io) March 26, 2025 GameStop’s investment policy not only allows for the purchase of Bitcoin but also includes stable USD stablecoins. These stablecoins are designed to hold a steady value and are pegged to reserve assets like the US dollar, providing a simple, straightforward hedge against the wild price swings that can occur in other cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin. This decision comes when many firms in a range of sectors are diversifying their investment profiles to include digital assets. In particular, institutional investors have turned to Bitcoin as a vehicle for gaining exposure to the still-nascent cryptocurrency market. GameStop’s addition of both Bitcoin and stablecoins to its reserves suggests that the company is striving to be a financially progressive player in an increasingly digital ecosystem. Stock Price Reacts Favorably to the News After the announcement, GameStop stock surged, climbing 6.30% in after-hours trading. That took the price of GameStop shares to $25.40, and investors seemed to be quite pleased with the news as a potential step toward modernizing and diversifying the company’s strategy. The announcement likely drew in investors, many of whom have already been involved in the com any’s previous movements in the stock market and seem primed to enjoy all the ups and downs that any year-ender is likely to present. Before the past couple of years, GameStop was perhaps one of the most obvious targets for a short-seller. And that is because, for the most part, the company has not been growing, and its basic problem—the fact that people are not buying games in its stores—does not seem to have a solution. The company’s stock has been volatile, but its new inclusion of digital assets such as Bitcoin into its financial strategy could very well attract a whole new class of investors. These investors might be lured not just by the enormous potential returns, but also by the idea that the assets in question are actually business-ready. They’re meant to serve as a potential bridge between the old, stable, and somewhat dull world of traditional finance and the fast-moving, anarchic world of decentralized finance, which so far has no plan to save Crypto Industry failures. Future Outlook GameStop’s addition of Bitcoin to its treasury is a part of a larger trend in the corporate world, where companies are moving to adopt cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class. This decision could herald a more profound transformation within the company, including possible partnerships with startups in the area of blockchain technology and digital finance. GameStop is obviously trying to stay in step with the times. The company is now offering crypto wallets, and they also plan to integrate digital assets into their finances. The willingness to push towards these innovative—and somewhat risky—crypto ventures signals that GameStop is trying to move beyond its current death spiral (and potential bankruptcy) and position itself as a relevant entity in a rapidly changing financial landscape. At this point, GameStop’s share price surge clearly reflects an optimism among investors that the company is transforming itself in a positive way—diversifying its revenue streams, for example—and that it is embracing what so many other companies are also busy doing: making the shift to the digital world, investing in all kinds of virtual assets (like this company’s new blockchain division), and pouring resources into something that a great many smart people believe is the future of money: digital currencies.

Rather than a passing trend, this reflects a clear shift in how younger investors are approaching risk, trust and financial planning. The report, which surveyed over 13,000 individuals across 13 countries, reveals that 62% of Millennial investors have crypto holdings making up at least a third of their portfolios. Among Gen Z investors, 35% allocate more than half of their portfolio to crypto, while 20% invest around one-third of their portfolio in digital assets. The @wef 2024 Global Retail Investor Survey, produced in collaboration with @RobinhoodApp and @BCG , identifies four structural shifts shaping individual #financial behaviours, preferences and market activity in #retail #investing . Explore them here: https://t.co/bcou9nSMUW pic.twitter.com/BKqYuC23Xy — World Economic Forum (@wef) March 26, 2025 These allocations often exceed their investments in stocks, mutual funds, or bonds—asset classes long considered cornerstones of a balanced portfolio. How Gen Z and Millennials Are Rewriting Investment Rules Young investors’ confidence in crypto appears to stem from a broader trend: many perceive it as easier to understand than traditional investments such as ETFs or bonds. This perception contrasts with the conventional view of crypto as a complex and high-risk asset. For digital-native generations, guidance now comes from crypto platforms, influencer content, and peer networks rather than traditional sources like licensed advisers or institutional analysts. This generational shift is also about values. The report notes that 70% of Millennials and 66% of Gen Z choose financial institutions based on personal values alignment. Crypto, often associated with decentralization and transparency, appears to resonate with those priorities. Image Source: WEF / Global Retail Investor Outlook 2024 At the same time, these younger investors are more likely to explore alternative assets and engage in shareholder activism, suggesting a broader appetite for influence and innovation. Crypto’s Rise in Emerging Markets Highlights Shifting Financial Access Emerging markets echo this enthusiasm. Investors from countries like India, Brazil, and South Africa show higher crypto adoption rates than their developed-market counterparts. In fact, 36% of emerging market investors hold crypto, compared to 27% globally. For some, crypto offers an accessible gateway to capital markets in environments where banking infrastructure remains underdeveloped. Technology plays a powerful role in shaping this trend. The report finds that 41% of investors globally—and nearly half of Gen Z and Millennial respondents—are willing to delegate financial decisions to AI-based advisers. These same cohorts are also the most active users of budgeting apps, robo-advisers, and fintech platforms, further embedding crypto into their daily financial lives. Still, the risks are real. The high concentration of portfolios in volatile assets raises concerns about long-term financial stability. Financial educators and regulators face a new challenge: how to guide a generation that prefers learning-by-doing and places more trust in YouTube than in brokerage whitepapers.

The bill now goes to President Donald Trump, who’s expected to sign it into law by Friday, making it the first crypto-related legislation to officially pass under his administration. The original rule—pushed during the Biden era—tried to force decentralized protocols to report to the IRS like traditional brokers. That meant developers and platforms would have to track user data and submit transaction reports, even though most DeFi tools don’t hold customer funds. That plan just got nuked. The final Senate vote came after the House of Representatives passed its own version of the bill on March 11. The Senate had already passed a similar version earlier this month, but budget bills have to start in the House, so it bounced back for final approval. Lawmakers, Trump team, and crypto firms reject the IRS rule The CRA was introduced in the Senate by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. He called the repeal “a victory for American innovation” after the earlier Senate vote. Trump’s AI and crypto adviser, David Sacks, confirmed the president supports overturning the rule, meaning Trump’s signature is now just a formality. This isn’t just a win for politicians. More than 30 crypto companies banded together the morning of the Senate vote to send a letter to lawmakers. They sent it to the Senate Banking and Judiciary Committees and the House Financial Services and Judiciary Committees, demanding answers on how the Department of Justice (DOJ) is interpreting money transmitter laws. The companies behind the letter include Coinbase, Kraken, A16z, Multicoin Capital, Paradigm, Exodus, and Ledger. The letter was led by the DeFi Education Fund, a policy group focused on defending decentralized systems. The group’s executive director, Amanda Tuminelli, said in the letter that the DOJ’s legal strategy could “expose software developers to criminal liability simply for writing code.” The companies pushed back against the DOJ’s view that DeFi tools fall under Section 1960 of the criminal code, which is meant to regulate centralized entities that move money without a license. The DOJ claims DeFi protocols can be considered “money transmitting businesses” under that law—even if the developer doesn’t touch customer funds. That interpretation, according to the crypto firms, goes against FinCEN’s 2019 guidance, which said developers aren’t considered money transmitters. The fight over this issue isn’t just theory. In August 2023, the DOJ filed criminal charges against Roman Storm, one of the co-founders of Tornado Cash, a crypto mixer. The DOJ accused him of running an unlicensed money-transmitting business and enabling money laundering. It was the first time criminal charges had been filed against a DeFi developer. That case spooked the entire crypto industry. Amanda Tuminelli called the DOJ’s move “regulation by criminal indictment.” She said the DeFi Education Fund’s top priority right now is to force Congress to clearly define Section 1960 to protect software developers. She also thanked the crypto companies that joined the effort to push back. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

According to social media posts from Armstrong himself, the emails led to a warrant being issued. He is currently being held without bond, meaning he cannot be released before trial , with no option to post bail. The arrest has caught the attention of the crypto community, many of whom initially speculated that the reason was a public disturbance or his past involvement with questionable crypto projects. However, these claims lack evidence. The real reason appears tied to his direct communication with the judge in an ongoing legal dispute. Five days before the arrest, Armstrong admitted online that a warrant had been issued because he had emailed Judge Childs while acting as his own legal representative. The judge has since deleted her Twitter account, which adds more focus to the incident. BitBoy referred to her as “dishonorable,” and if his messages were considered threatening or inappropriate, they may fall under criminal harassment. Armstrong is known for taking part in legal fights without proper legal counsel. In this case, representing himself and directly contacting a judge may have worsened the situation. This isn’t his first run-in with legal trouble—back in 2023, he was accused of harassing a lawyer involved in another case, although he wasn't arrested that time. His behavior has been widely criticized, both legally and online. Recent posts show him engaging in strange online rants, including targeting a young actor who shares his name. This pattern of erratic public behavior has raised concerns even among his supporters. For now, the emails that led to his arrest have not been made public . Until court proceedings begin, it’s unclear exactly what was said or how serious the accusations are. There’s no official timeline for when his next hearing will take place. The arrest could affect Armstrong’s reputation and career in crypto.

The token has been on quite the upward trajectory, rising over 50% in price today alone, which has propelled its market capitalization to a solid $13.5 million. This spike in value has drawn the attention of retail traders and memecoin aficionados, but what is the market trying to tell us with this sudden surge, and why is $PWEASE so dang popular all of a sudden? $pwease Surges Over 50%, Market Cap Hits $13.5M, Why? The Solana-based memecoin $pwease is gaining traction due to its parody culture linked to U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance and strong grassroots support. Key Highlights: +50% price surge today Market cap: $13.5M … pic.twitter.com/8FHSm8P1RZ — Followin (@followin_io) March 26, 2025 The emergence of $PWEASE can only be understood by looking at the market forces driving its creation and the peculiar cultural corner it has managed to occupy. $PWEASE’s Memecoin Roots and Parody Culture $PWEASE, like many successful memecoins, is more than just a cryptocurrency—it encompasses a larger cultural and social movement within the cryptocurrency space. Memecoins are typically associated with humor and internet culture, often generating significant interest by appealing to grassroots communities and using elements of humor, inside jokes, or parody that resonate with the broader public. $PWEASE has carved out a cozy niche by parodying the current political and cultural scene. This particular form of meme culture that $PWEASE has sunk its teeth into is one that holds a mirror up to society and uses humor as a weapon. It is what $PWEASE does next, however, that really defines its place in the altcoin space: political parody and a direct association with U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance. The meteoric rise of the memecoin can also be credited to its robust grassroots backing—a major trait of any successful memecoin, for that matter. Like many (if not most) memecoins, $PWEASE has effectively grown through community-driven efforts. Its followers consistently push the memecoin across social media platforms and crypto forums, where—and I’m not sure if this is a coincidence or not—virality and meme culture seem to rule the day when it comes to the perceived success of a project. This push has led to the kind of perceived success that sees a project maintain its buzz even when other projects are corrections or just plain dead. Key Milestones and Market Performance The recent uptick in $PWEASE’s valuation is not an isolated instance but part of a broader movement. The token’s market capitalization now rests at $13.5 million, which is a significant climb from its earlier 2025 form when it reached a high of $35 million in early March. This sharp descent, however, is par for the course in the memecoin market, where speculative trading and capricious market forces generate price swings that can make one dizzy. Predicting such phenomena lurches between the laughable and the ludicrous. The $PWEASE token has remained followed and favored under a community of loyal supporters. It has not weathered a crypto storm recently, but it has a semblance of calm in the midst of this particular crypto volatility. Today’s upward motion in $PWEASE is, in my estimation, a signal of ongoing interest in the token and a sign that this quiet token may just be quietly finding its wings. What’s Driving the $PWEASE Hype? $PWEASE’s recent price spike appears to have a single driving force behind it, and that’s the announcement by Vice President J.D. Vance of an upcoming diplomatic trip to Greenland on March 28. This is a trip that has stirred up no small amount of controversy, especially in Denmark, where Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has publicly expressed her strong opposition to Vance’s visit. The media has taken an interest in this political dust-up, and that interest, in turn, has given $PWEASE a bit more attention in the press, further solidifying its status as a memecoin. Connecting with the Vance story—and the memecoin’s ongoing efforts to use its political and cultural influence—has given new energy to its boosters. The token has shown an incredible ability to ride the wave of current events, making it not just relevant but increasing its visibility and trading volume to a point where it is starting to feel like a real asset. The political row over Vance’s trip to Greenland has roused a strong emotional response from backers and detractors alike, and $PWEASE has successfully aligned itself with that conversation. While this could easily be dismissed as a moment of memetic irrelevance, the very ability to adapt and align with trending topics is what makes the most successful memecoins in the current moment. The Future of $PWEASE and Memecoin Markets Like many memecoins, the future of $PWEASE is uncertain. And, by their very nature, memecoins are highly speculative and volatile. The price fluctuations provide excitement for traders but can also feel unpredictable. However, another defining characteristic of $PWEASE is a strong community that supports it, which adds to a level of resilience that many other memecoins lack. In the future, $PWEASE will almost certainly continue to be shaped by not only its parody culture but also by its connection to contemporary political matters. The token’s staying power will be determined by the number of ways it can remain relevant and hook into the larger cultural conversation. For as long as it keeps doing both of those things, $PWEASE could also see more upward movement in its price in the future. Nonetheless, it is vital to keep in mind that, as with other memecoins, $PWEASE is a dangerously speculative asset. Gains of recent times are beautiful; potential investors should, however, proceed with caution. Understand that you are dealing with an asset (a memecoin, in this case) that is highly volatile. You are dealing with the kind of asset that can give with one hand and take back with the other. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

After an elongated stretch of extreme fear and nearly record-setting lows that saw Bitcoin trading for as little as $78,000 at the beginning of March, the tide has turned; we find ourselves in a renewed era of at least mild optimism and what some traders are even calling a bull market. Bitcoin recently pushed back to $88,500, and the altcoins have followed suit by either holding their ground or churning back toward more favorable trading levels. Those were the good old days for hodlers and altcoin traders. What happened? Why the sudden shift? And can we believe it? Traditionally, the actions of retail investors have served as a good indicator for the direction in which the markets are heading. And right now, with the recent uptick in prices, everyone seems to have an opinion on what they think is going to happen next. Even more so than usual, the calls (and the confidence level of those making the calls) seem to be all over the place. Here’s a smattering of what some folks have been saying, from the clearly reasonable to the absurdly ludicrous. The Crowd’s Predictions and Market Psychology One of the most common occurrences in the world of cryptocurrencies is that the crowd tends to get its predictions wrong. This is especially true at moments of heightened optimism or extreme pessimism. The surge of recent price predictions, which have moved to a new range of $100,000 to $159,000, should serve as a cautionary signal for seasoned traders. The appearance of a consistent narrative among the masses that prices are going to increase quickly often foreshadows a market correction. And when the appearance of bullish sentiment is accompanied by isolated upward price spikes, the likelihood of an imminent market dip tends to increase. Market participants gripped by fear and negativity, and when the prevailing sentiment is “crypto is dead” or “Bitcoin is a scam,” it often indicates we’re at the bottom of a price cycle. These sentiments, which may seem counterintuitive, have been consistently observed over time, particularly during periods of market distress when panic sets in and prices plummet. As crypto has bounced nicely in the second half of March, traders have swung the pendulum back toward mild greed. After showing major fear in late February and early March following two stints of Bitcoin dipping as low as $78K, it appears that this rebound to $88.5K has… pic.twitter.com/WGvmvKSv2X — Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 25, 2025 Individuals who have spent any significant amount of time trading in the crypto market know full well that it tends to act in the opposite manner to what traders expect. When the cry of “to the moon” goes up, or when traders are talking about how it’s nearly time to cash in big with “lambo time,” it’s almost a guarantee that a price correction is about to happen. When the market turns against us and has a collective meltdown, that’s usually when we should start loading up on more coins in preparation for the upside. The Role of Social Media and Retail Traders Market sentiment, especially in the world of cryptocurrency, is shaped in large part by social media. Price forecasts, whether rooted in thoughtful analysis or unbridled conjecture, often originate on platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Telegram. And while these platforms allow for almost direct conversation between traders about the conversation-starter price movements most traders live and die by, they also serve as amplifiers for the high and low emotions driving traders to make good decisions and bad decisions. This influence weighs heavily on a group that has little else to go on: retail traders, who make up a large portion of the cryptocurrency market and tend not to have the kind of resources employed by market makers or hedge funds. Price movements—significant ones, in either direction—tend to draw in retail traders, and over the last few years, we have seen how even the slightest bit of hype can drive them to unprecedented levels of euphoria or despair. From what we have seen thus far, a retail trader’s main weapon is an altcoin portfolio. As Bitcoin approaches its latest zenith, social media has once more been inundated by retail traders with gleeful projections of where the price might go next. Flooding in right beside this surge in bullish sentiment has been the almost obligatory call for an impending market correction, with some traders and pundits ready to see any signs at all of a market that might be overheating. For traders with several market cycles under their belt, this situation invites a critical reassessment of what might really be going on. A Word of Caution for Crypto Traders Recent changes in the market atmosphere should remind traders of the cyclical nature of the cryptocurrency markets. The trading public—retail and institutional—reacts with the same emotions as every time in human history when the price of an asset rises: greed, envy, and lust. The Moon Boys of trading and the working masses react to the price of Bitcoin increasing with euphoria and elevate that feeling to collective sentiment. It is convenient to make fun of this in hindsight because the Bitcoin price is not at a new all-time high, but also just remember that the Bitcoin price was not at a new all-time high in June 2022 or in November 2022 either. Price movements in the cryptocurrency market often occur in a manner that goes against popular expectation. When retail traders grow overly bullish, the market tends to take a turn for the worse. When sentiment turns overwhelmingly negative, it is usually a sign that the market is bottoming out and poised to reverse. If you understand this pattern, you can make more informed decisions when trading and are less likely to become a victim of the emotional swings that characterize the cryptocurrency markets. In the end, the cryptocurrency trading that works best is the kind where the trader maintains a level head and follows a sound, well-thought-out strategy. Getting caught up in price rallies and the kind of bold predictions that are in no short supply when it comes to discussing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is quite easy. Even so, it remains of the utmost importance to keep in mind just how incredibly volatile these markets are and how the crowd’s expectations can serve as a pretty reliable indicator of what not to do if one is interested in doing something that will work.

The controversy involves a market titled “Ukraine agrees to Trump mineral deal before April?” which resolved as “Yes,” despite there being no official confirmation from U.S. or Ukrainian sources . Users are calling it the biggest manipulation case in the platform’s history, accusing insiders of using their power to influence the vote outcome. The rules for the market clearly said the result would be based only on official government sources. However, the resolution ignored this condition, and the outcome favored the “Yes” side. Many users lost money, and the crypto community is reacting with anger and suspicion. According to one user on X, two previous markets with nearly identical rules ended with a “No” result—yet they involved far less money, under $400,000 combined. In contrast, this manipulated market involved more than $7 million. The user claimed that a powerful participant used multiple accounts and cast votes with 5 million UMA tokens, representing 25% of the total voting power , to tilt the decision in their favor. Polymarket’s team responded in their Discord channel but refused to offer refunds. They explained the issue was not a platform failure but a unique situation they aim to prevent in the future. They promised improved systems and monitoring, but the explanation did little to calm users who lost significant funds. This is not the first time Polymarket has been accused of insider control. A detailed thread by crypto user Folke Hermansen outlined past cases of similar manipulation. He alleged that Polymarket insiders often write vague rules, place bets themselves, and work with verifiers to rig outcomes. One example involved a market about gold being missing from Fort Knox, which resolved to “No,” resulting in a $3.5 million loss for those who bet otherwise. In another case, Hermansen said the dispute option was quietly disabled during a critical window, preventing users from challenging a “No” resolution in a tariff-related market. A third example was a market about whether Trump would say “China” during a crypto event. Even though he said it, Polymarket clarified the rule after the fact and ruled “No,” which appeared retroactive and unfair. Hermansen points out that the UMA system used to verify market outcomes is flawed. Just two whales allegedly control over half the voting power. One person alone reportedly holds 7.5 million of the 20 million staked tokens. These whales are not neutral—they also place large bets, giving them both the power to vote and financial reasons to sway results. He explained that UMA is supposed to reward truth-seeking, but it really encourages users to vote with the majority to avoid losing staked tokens . This creates a system where large holders lead the vote, and others follow to avoid losses. That means truth doesn’t matter as much as following the crowd. Adding to the problem, challenging a market outcome requires a bond, usually $750 USDC. Large holders can afford to challenge or propose outcomes easily, while smaller users can’t risk the money. This keeps control in the hands of the few, with most disputes ending in near-total agreement—sometimes over 95%. Finally, Hermansen noted that all voting and dispute actions are anonymous, making it impossible to trace who manipulated a market. That lack of transparency allows insiders to operate freely and avoid accountability. With users now questioning the fairness of its markets, Polymarket’s credibility is on the line. Unless changes are made, confidence in the platform—and its core system—could collapse.",,EN,0,0,MARKET|UMA|ASIA|FIAT|MINING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-27 08:06:14

A wallet, 0x5a8, which is thought to belong to Michael Egorov, the founder of Curve Finance, seems to have sold quite a lot of CRV tokens. This particular wallet sold 1 million CRV for 515048 USDC at an average price of $0.515. This might be the latest in a series of transactions aimed at liquidating Egorov’s assets, but it has raised quite a few eyebrows in the DeFi community. Significantly, 18 hours before the sale, Wallet 0x5a8 received 1.997 million CRV, valued at about $1.03 million, from Wallet 0x7a1, which most believe is linked to Egorov. After the sale of 1 million CRV, Wallet 0x5a8 now holds just under 1 million CRV, worth approximately $512,000. This recent transaction, combined with previous sales, suggests that Michael Egorov might be liquidating a large chunk of his holdings in the token. A Flurry of Sales in the Past 48 Hours This recent sale of 1 million CRV tokens is not an isolated event. In the past two days, Wallet 0x5a8 has likely sold a total of 1.469 million CRV for 753,229 USDC at an average price of $0.513. The combined value of these sales paints a picture of a significant liquidation of holdings, possibly signaling a change in strategy or a response to broader market conditions. Michael Egorov ( @newmichwill ), founder of #Curve Finance, appears to be selling $CRV again! 18 hours ago, he transferred 1.997M $CRV (worth $1.03M) to the wallet “0x5a8.” Just now, this wallet sold 1M $CRV for 515,058 $USDC at an average price of $0.515, leaving 997K $CRV … https://t.co/GXUzvBOhpe pic.twitter.com/5DalDRgHfv — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) March 26, 2025 The context is that the price of CRV has varied widely in recent months. For the last several days, the price of CRV has been hanging just over the $0.50 line, with a significant drop that possibly nudged Egorov to offload some of his stake. With CRV’s price in such a state of flux, watchers of these deals are trying to get a read on where the token might be headed next. What’s Behind the Recent CRV Sales? DeFi enthusiasts have been left wondering why Michael Egorov has sold off so much CRV, considering that he is the founder of Curve Finance, the decentralized exchange that is one of the top three in the ecosystem. The most straightforward explanation is that he needs money, that he has some personal financial situation that has not yet come to light. Another possibility is that he is doing some sort of financial engineering with his own CRV and that of other liquidity providers to boost the price of CRV at a time when zooming past $1.00 is indispensable for some sort of up-or-down scenario to play out. One potential rationale for the sale might be connected to the cryptocurrency and DeFi sectors’ larger market dynamics. For the past several months, the market has been in a state of turbulence, with many tokens’ values swinging up and down—notably, the price of CRV. Global financial markets’ current uncertainty, when mixed with the DeFi space’s volatile sentiment, could yield a pretty good covering fire for Egorov if he were selling as a way to secure some profits and/or reallocate his assets for improved risk management. Another possible explanation for the sale could be tied to personal finances. As a major player in DeFi, Egorov’s fiscal health and his role at Curve Finance are probably central to most people’s minds when they think about the market’s perception of CRV. If he’s in need of cash for some reason—be it personal or business—that could certainly account for these large-scale sales we’ve seen recently. Impact on Curve Finance and CRV Selling 1.469 million CRV tokens in just two days is a big deal for the person who did it and for the whole Curve Finance ecosystem. Curve is one of the biggest decentralized exchanges, and it counts a lot on the success and even more on the adoption of its native token, CRV. When key people in the project—especially the founder—do large-scale sell-offs, that can affect how investors feel about the project. And we all know that when investor sentiment shifts, increased volatility often follows. So this seems like a bad scene for CRV. So was this an urgent sale of CRV done mostly to keep from getting liquidated? Was Egorov acting out of caution? Or has he and Curve Finance cooked up a clever strategy here that’s going to pay off and send the CRV price skyward, while also helping keep the order book on this DEX from going belly up? Again, these developments might give some people a reason to rethink the future trajectory of Curve Finance. What’s Next for CRV? The future of Curve Finance and its token’s trajectory are, understandably, being called into question as Egorov sells off a portion of his holdings in CRV. What is happening with DeFi, and what will happen with it in the future, is anyone’s guess. But DeFi has not been a space of quietude, and it has not been a space of steadfast prices. When a project or its token has shown as much instability as Curve and CRV have lately, it is ever more understandable that questions might arise about how this situation could possibly improve. At present, CRV is experiencing a lot of downside pressure as a consequence of the recent sales. However, it is imperative to remember that the success of both Curve DAO and Curve’s corresponding DEX are inextricably linked to the future of Curve Finance and CRV. Despite its current straits, Curve Finance remains one of the most significant DeFi platforms in the crypto sphere, with an impressive liquidity pool north of a billion dollars and a customer base that stretches from all corners of the DeFi universe. The market will probably keep watching for more signals from Egorov and other important people in the project to figure out if this sale is an isolated event or part of a larger trend where they’re divesting from the CRV token. Is this move a sign of caution? Or is it, as some have speculated, a strategic reallocation of assets? Only time will tell, but it’s certainly a development not just investors but also enthusiasts of Curve Finance will be keeping a close eye on in the next few weeks. And we won’t have to wait long; the next couple of weeks could hold some important developments for both Curve Finance and the CRV token. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

(NYSE: GME) has announced plans to raise $1.3 billion through a private offering of convertible senior notes, with a portion of the proceeds earmarked for acquiring Bitcoin (BTC). Investment Policy Update and Funding Plans On Tuesday, GameStop’s board of directors unanimously approved the update to its investment policy, enabling the gaming retailer to allocate capital into Bitcoin. The company disclosed its funding plan in a Wednesday press release, stating: “GameStop expects to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin in a manner consistent with GameStop’s Investment Policy.” The move aligns with strategies employed by other corporations, most notably Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which has accumulated billions in Bitcoin over the past year. GameStop’s decision marks another instance of a major publicly traded company integrating cryptocurrency into its financial strategy. Details of the Convertible Senior Notes Offering The company plans to issue $1.3 billion in aggregate principal amount of 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2030. Additionally, GameStop intends to grant initial purchasers an option to buy up to $200 million more in notes within a 13-day period from the first issuance date. GameStop confirmed that the notes will be general unsecured obligations, bearing no regular interest and with no accretion in principal amount. They are set to mature on April 1, 2030, unless converted, redeemed, or repurchased earlier. Upon conversion, the company has the option to settle in cash, shares of its Class A common stock, or a combination of both. The initial conversion rate and other terms will be determined at the time of pricing, with the U.S. composite volume-weighted average price of GameStop stock from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on the pricing date serving as the reference for the initial conversion price. Regulatory Considerations and Offering Uncertainty GameStop emphasized that neither the notes nor any shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion have been or will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or any state securities laws. As a result, they cannot be offered or sold in the United States without registration or an applicable exemption. The company further noted that there is no guarantee the offering will be completed as planned. However, if successful, GameStop will join a growing list of corporations diversifying their balance sheets with Bitcoin, signaling a continued shift toward cryptocurrency adoption in traditional financial markets.

Whale 0xce0 sold $7.81 million worth of Solana ($SOL) into the Kraken exchange. The latest transaction consists of 54,113 EIGEN tokens and is part of a larger move in which Whale 0xce0 has been managing and expanding its crypto portfolio. Reports from OnchainLens say that what we’ve seen so far this week is not just a single transaction but part of a larger episode in which Whale 0xce0 has been putting together a portfolio of all sorts of crypto assets. The deposit into Kraken that the whale made is just one of many moves that have solidified its position in the market. To date, the whale has transferred a massive 1,573,313 $SOL, worth around $293.26 million, in 2025 alone. The whale now holds 3,232,101 tokens of $SOL, giving it an impressive valuation of $469.1 million. A whale has been selling $EIGEN at a loss of $2M (-69%) over the past 2 days! From Oct 8 to 18, 2024, whale “0xce0” spent 1,198 $ETH (~$2.9M) to buy 772,450 $EIGEN at an avg. price of $3.76. After a 68% drop in price over the last 5.5 months, the whale unstaked and sold 780,132… pic.twitter.com/a5gxdtg5Df — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) March 26, 2025 A Dive into Whale 0xce0’s EIGEN Journey EIGEN began its journey with Whale on October 8, 2024, when Whale invested heavily in the token. Between October 8 and 18, Whale 0xce0 spent 1,198 ETH, worth around $2.9 million at the time, to purchase a substantial amount of 772,450 EIGEN tokens. The tokens were acquired at an average price of $3.76 each, and Whale 0xce0 immediately staked these tokens, presumably to earn rewards via EIGEN’s staking mechanism. This was a long-term investment play, seen as a move that would pay off if and when the EIGEN token grew in value. The staking rewards, if any, would simply sweeten the deal. When Whale 0xce0 purchased EIGEN, its price appeared to hold great promise in what seemed at the time to be an emerging bullish market. Subsequent events demonstrated, however, that the conditions were anything but bullish. EIGEN’s price plunged over the next few months—as did the prices of many, many other cryptocurrencies—while Whale 0xce0’s purchase couldn’t have been looking much worse. The Price Crash and Unstaking Present day, and the value of EIGEN has taken a massive hit. Over the last 5.5 months, the price of EIGEN plummeted by 69%, which undoubtedly shook the confidence of investors, particularly those with large holdings like Whale 0xce0. As the token’s value continued to slide, Whale decided to unstake and sell a significant portion of their EIGEN holdings. In the past day, Whale 0xce0 divested 780,132 EIGEN tokens, valued at roughly $919,000, at an average price of $1.178 per token. The transaction was split between 9.196 WBTC and 53.423 ETH. Whale 0xce0 purchased EIGEN back in May 2023. Their purchase price was $3.76 per token. Their recent sale, therefore, combined with the acquisition of WBTC, highlights a significant loss in value since their purchase. Although they tried to save some worth by turning their EIGEN assets into more stable currencies like WBTC and ETH, it is nevertheless a massive loss. It shows how much the crypto market can fluctuate and how inherently unstable it can be—this is not news to anyone. But the numbers are still jarring even for a market known for its ups and downs. Whale 0xce0’s decision to buy EIGEN at the peak on July 21, 2022, for a price of $6.75, along with the decision to hold it until now, has resulted in a massive unrealized loss of $4,572,954. The Implications of Whale 0xce0’s Actions Whale 0xce0 had a substantial amount of EIGEN tokens in their possession. They decided to sell and did so at a heavy loss, worth about half of what they had paid for the tokens. When a large holder like Whale 0xce0 sells and signals that they’re not confident in a token’s future, it raises eyebrows. A lot of people watch what the big players do and then take it as a sign to do (or not do) something with the token themselves. It’s important to note, though, that Whale 0xce0’s decision to unstake and sell may also reflect larger market conditions. The crypto market is notoriously volatile, and tokens in the Einsteins Universe, like EIGEN, aren’t exempt from that treatment. They’ve also faced significant price corrections as part of a broader market trend. The loss of $2.01 million is absolutely a bummer, but if nothing else, it’s a reminder of the risks involved in trading cryptos, where market sentiment can shift on a dime and prices can move around a lot. EIGEN’s price drop might not only result from market conditions but could also derive from other sources, like these: – low liquidity in the EIGEN market, – movements in investor sentiment towards EIGEN, – broader trends in the DeFi space that might affect EIGEN’s price. Whale 0xce0’s experience shows that these factors can work in tandem or in parallel to produce price moves that can easily go against you in this volatile crypto world. Conclusion Whale 0xce0’s recent transaction, selling 389,523 EIGEN tokens for $457,000, highlights the cryptocurrency investment landscape’s risks and rewards. This whale’s initial decision to make a heavy investment in EIGEN at an average price of $3.76 now stands in stark contrast to their recent liquidation of the same asset at a much lower price of $1.173. And that, friends and family, is a not-so-cryptic way of saying that the unpredictable price action of the cryptocurrency market just bit this whale hard on the backside. As the market forms, the conduct of whales like 0xce0 will probably continue to occupy an important place in molding the feeling of EIGEN and other tokens like it. Can EIGEN come back from the recent downturn? The question remains open. But the significant losses suffered by Whale 0xce0 make for a cautionary tale that most of us can interpret in at least two ways. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

This latest transaction, consisting of 54,113 $SOL tokens, is part of a larger trend in which Solana has been actively managing and expanding its crypto portfolio. According to reports from OnchainLens, this deposit brings Solana’s total holdings to a staggering $469.1 million. Kraken has been deposited into. This is but one among many moves that have strengthened PumpFun’s position in the marketplace. This year alone, 2025, the company has sent forth an amount of $SOL that is nothing less than staggering—1,573,313 $SOL, worth about $293.26 million, has been transferred to the marketplace via Kraken. The total amount of $SOL held by PumpFun stands now at 3,232,101 tokens, a number with which we can directly associate the company’s valuation, which is in excess of 3/4 of a billion dollars. 2 hours ago, PumpFun ( @pumpdotfun ) deposited 54,113 $SOL valued at $7.81M, into #Kraken . In 2025, they sent a total of 1,573,313 $SOL worth $293.26M.

The company is now bringing its own kind of innovation to the industry. Recently, Alon, one of PumpFun’s co-founders, shared some very future-forward plans for the platform with the folks at Bankless. Alon told the crypto media outlet that PumpFun is preparing to launch a feature called “Creator Revenue Sharing.” This initiative, Alon explained, is set to redefine what it means to be a creator on the PumpFun platform. In an interesting statement, Alon cleared up the misconception that he and his fellow YouTube stars are raking in the dough and living lavish lives. “We reinvest in product development almost all the revenue we generate (which is a decent amount but not what you might think). So, by the way, when this company is valued at $1 billion, it’s not because we’ve printed money and have a lot in our bank account. It’s because we’ve reinvested almost everything into development and we’ve got this amazing product that works super well for the people who use it. Alon’s comments highlight an important facet of PumpFun’s work: the company is not just in the business of making money from token trading or speculation. Rather, it is deeply committed to growing its platform, and its storyline in the crypto space is one of direct and obvious linkage between the development of its products and the kind of success that would make it a company of substance and not just a revenue-focused project. Alon, co-founder of PumpFun, said in Bankless that the Creator Revenue Sharing function will be launched. He claimed that all the $600 million in revenue was reinvested in product development and not distributed to investors. The team now has 45 to 50 people, mainly engineers.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 26, 2025 Currently, the PumpFun team comprises approximately 45 to 50 individuals, a large portion of whom are focused on engineering. This indicates that the company has a strong emphasis on technical development—a most favorable posture to take in the highly competitive cryptocurrency and blockchain universe. With the emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) and creator-driven ecosystems, PumpFun’s investment in its engineering team seems a shrewd way to ensure that it remains competitive. PumpFun’s Role in the Crypto Ecosystem What makes PumpFun different from many other players in the crypto world is its vision. The company is not just gathering up tokens for some future financial windfall; it’s building a platform that aims to give real power to creators and change the way they work with and earn from digital assets. One of the first steps on this path, which could take it in a number of different directions, is a new feature called Creator Revenue Sharing. Furthermore, the choice made by PumpFun to reinvest all of its earnings back into the platform instead of sharing it with profit investors like the usual in the crypto space reflects a long-term development strategy that seems to be working for the new decentralized online gaming platform. The usual in the crypto space is projects that share dividends with investors and promise imminent returns. PumpFun is not that type of project. Instead, it is clearly using its funds to grow and develop itself further. The firm holds a substantial amount of $SOL, one of the highest market cap cryptocurrencies, which indicates its belief in Solana’s long-term potential as a reliable platform. Solana is a rising star in the blockchain sector, largely due to its throughput, which is much greater than that of Ethereum; low fees; and reliable speed, which makes it compliant with the demands of “decentralized applications” and other blockchain-based services. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for PumpFun? As PumpFun keeps extending its portfolio and honing its platform, the next several months may well be pivotal for it in the fiercely competitive world of cryptocurrency. The successful launch of the Creator Revenue Sharing feature could give a handsome boost to the platform’s user base, bringing not just more users but also more creators into its ecosystem. And with an expanding team of engineers and an evident laser-like focus on product development, PumpFun is starting to look like a force to be reckoned with in the blockchain world. With total holdings of $469.1 million, PumpFun is positioned for the long haul. It’s not about to go quietly into that good night. The company told me its enhanced focus on reinvestment and innovation is enabling it to build out a “long-term” business model. Thus, while PumpFun hasn’t turned product development revenue into a near-term profit engine, the trajectory of the model might at some point turn this startup into a significant player in the still-emerging space of blockchain-based “creator economies.” Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Analysts warn that if BTC stumbles, CRV’s run could fizzle before it hits new highs. CrediBULL Crypto has highlighted a critical resistance zone for CRV. A clean break above this level could send the token soaring beyond $2. However, BTC’s stability remains a linchpin, with any sharp drop below $80,000 possibly derailing the rally. The Make-or-Break Levels for CRV In a recent post on X, CrediBULL shared a 4-hour chart showing CRV encountering significant resistance between $0.67 and $0.83. He described this area as the “LTF bull/bear line in the sand,” signifying the zone that needs to be crossed for a sustained upward trend. In the analyst’s opinion, clearing that line would suggest a confirmed bottom for CRV, opening the path for future gains. Conversely, a rejection at that level could trigger a temporary pullback, offering traders a fresh buying opportunity. Looking at the latest price data for CRV, the token has gained 30% over the past month, rebounding from lows around $0.40 to its current level above $0.52. This uptick seems to have largely been supported by Bitcoin’s recent climb past $88,000, which injected confidence into altcoin markets. However, even with the jump, CRV remains nearly 90% below its all-time high of $6.40. Bitcoin’s Crossroads Meanwhile, BTC has experienced some attrition in the last 30 days, losing slightly under 5% of its value. According to data from CoinGecko, its worst performance in the past month was on March 11, when prices hovered just above $77,000. However, since then, the asset has been on a steady upward trend, serving as a cornerstone for broader market sentiment. Its foray above $88,000 a couple of days ago placed it at a pivotal stage. According to CryptoQuant, Bitcoin’s Combined Market Index (BCMI) remains below 0.5 , indicating the market isn’t yet overheated. This level leaves room for both a bullish continuation as well as a potential market correction. Observers like Santiment have warned of growing greed , with a spike in social media predictions placing BTC as high as $159,000 fueling speculative enthusiasm. In parallel, the integration of the number one cryptocurrency into corporate treasuries is making waves, especially after video game retailer GameStop put aside $1.3 billion to buy Bitcoin. So, as CRV navigates its resistance zone, traders will need to keep a close eye on BTC’s performance. A dip towards $80,000 could derail CRV’s momentum, while sustained stability may further push its ascent.

SHIB token dropped to a low of $0.00001443, down by about 55% from its highest point this year. It has plunged by over 65% from last year’s high. So, what next for the SHIB coin as its burn rate accelerates? Shiba Inu burn rate accelerates A potential catalyst for the SHIB price is the ongoing incineration. Data by Shiburn shows that the burn rate has jumped by over 57,0000% in the last 24 hours. This increase happened after one user moved 1 billion tokens to a dead address. At the current price, these tokens are worth over $14,500. This burn happened after another user incinerated 1 billion Shiba Inu coins. Another user burned over 2.1 million Shiba Inu coins on Thursday. Therefore, these token burns mean that the coin’s inflation will continue going down in the coming months. Data shows that there have been over 410 trillion Shiba Inu coin burns over the years. These burns have lowered the number of tokens in circulation to about 584 million coins, a number that will continue falling in the next few years. However, the reality is that the overall deflation is not all that big when you compare the size of Shiba Inu, which has a market cap of over $7 billion. Potential catalysts for SHIB coin There are several potential catalysts for the Shiba Inu coin. First, Donald Trump’s tariffs will likely lead to a recession in the United States. While a recession is a bad thing, history shows that risky assets bounce back after the initial drop. The main driver for these assets when there is a recession is that the Federal Reserve tends to intervene when markets crash. The bank does that by cutting interest rates and implementing quantitative easing policies that flood the market with money. At the same time, the federal government often intervenes by providing money to support key sectors. For example, in the 2008/9 crisis, the government spent over $700 billion in saving the banking sector. It spent trillions of dollars during the COVID-19 pandemic. The fiscal and monetary interventions draw investors into risky assets like cryptocurrencies and stocks. Such a move will benefit cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Shiba Inu coin. Second, Shibarium, its layer-2 network may boost Shiba Inu price. Data shows that the network is nearing 1 billion completed transactions now that it has handled over 975 million coins. The number of accounts has grown to over 245k, while blocks have risen to 10.15 million coins. Shibarium is an important part of Shiba Inu’s ecosystem in that the fees generated in the ecosystem are converted into Shiba Inu and then incinerated. While Shibarium has not been all that successful, there is a likelihood that it will be in the future. Shiba Inu price technical analysis SHIB price chart by TradingView The weekly chart shows that the SHIBZ coin has been in a downward trend in the past few weeks. It has crashed from a high of $0.000035 to low of $0.00001525. Shiba Inu price has moved slightly below the 50-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which is a bearish view. However, on the positive side, it has formed a megaphone chart pattern, which is characterized by two ascending and broadening wedge pattern. It is one of the most popular bullish patterns in technical analysis. Therefore, the SHIB coin price will likely have a strong bullish breakout in the coming weeks, with the next key point to watch being at $0.00003395, which is about 130% above the current level.

It all started when Sam Altman changed his profile picture, sparking the Ghibli trend across social media. These unique images, often featuring real people, have been flooding the internet. What’s the Hype About? OpenAI’s new update with ChatGPT includes an AI tool that can transform regular images into a whimsical Studio Ghibli animation style. Whether it’s for fun, self-expression, or a meme, the Studio Ghibli style has captured the hearts of many, offering a glimpse into the potential future of AI in creative fields. Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, joined the Ghibli-style portrait trend, creating images featuring himself, Stuart Alderoty, and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse.

The firm has been aggressively accumulating Bitcoin , and according to a new report from Bernstein, its holdings could skyrocket to over 1 million BTC by 2033 if market conditions remain favorable. JUST IN: BERNSTEIN ANALYST PREDICTS STRATEGY’S BITCOIN HOLDINGS COULD DOUBLE TO 1M $BTC IN A BULL CASE SCENARIO, AND EXPECTS BITCOIN TO HIT $200,000 BY THE END OF 2025, $500,000 BY 2029, AND $1 MILLION BY 2033. Source: @Cointelegraph https://t.co/4wLVOvSbTs pic.twitter.com/7WmgXzIWzM — Mario Nawfal’s Roundtable (@RoundtableSpace) March 27, 2025 A Massive Bitcoin Accumulation Plan Currently, Strategy holds 506,137 BTC, already making it the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. But Bernstein’s bullish forecast suggests the company could more than double that, reaching 1,013,000 BTC—equivalent to 5.8% of Bitcoin’s current circulating supply. This projection assumes Bitcoin will hit $200,000 by 2025 , $500,000 by 2029, and eventually $1 million by 2033. To fund this aggressive expansion, Strategy would likely rely on the capital markets, potentially increasing its debt from $11 billion to a staggering $100 billion while raising $84 billion in equity. The analysts believe that lower interest rates and strong investor demand would be key to making this plan feasible. Where BTC Stands! While Bitcoin is still below $90K, the best recovery level as of now is seen as the $90,000 level where the market will get interested again, with options market makers expected to influence price swings. Data from Deribit shows that market makers are “short gamma” at this strike, meaning they’ll need to buy when BTC rises and sell when it drops, adding to market turbulence. Despite this, BloFin’s Griffin Ardern suggests that there is a possibility of a bullish move ahead. With Friday’s options settlement, BTC could stay quite volatile around this key level. What Happens if Bitcoin Slows Down? Not everyone believes Bitcoin will keep going up without setbacks. If Bitcoin reaches a peak in 2025 and then starts a long decline, Strategy might stop buying more BTC and hold around 514,800 BTC, which is just 2.6% of the total supply . In this case, the company might even have to sell some of its Bitcoin to handle its growing debt, which would still climb but to a smaller amount—around $51 billion. Investors Still See Growth Potential Despite the risks, Bernstein remains confident in Strategy’s long-term position, maintaining an “outperform” rating and setting a $600 price target—representing a 75% upside from current levels. The firm’s valuation model applies a 2x EV/sales multiple to Strategy’s software segment and a 55% premium on its Bitcoin holdings, in line with its average market valuation since pivoting to Bitcoin in 2020. Meanwhile, Strategy continues its Bitcoin buying spree. Between March 17 and March 23, the company added another 6,911 BTC for $584.1 million, further solidifying its commitment to Bitcoin as its primary treasury asset. Whether Bitcoin soars or faces challenges, Strategy is going all in on its bet that digital gold is here to stay. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The firm also noted that there was currently a shift towards long-term holder accumulation, with wealth now transferring back towards price incentive investors. Coin Metrics analytics platform also reported that the share of supply held by long-term holders continued to rise, recently reaching around 63%. The firm argued that the trend highlighted how the virtual currency was “evolving into that of a store of value and reserve asset.” Bitcoin short-term holders face losses Challenging market conditions continue for digital assets, with #Bitcoin Short-Term Holders finding themselves under increasing financial pressure. Under the surface, a shift towards Long-Term Holder accumulation appears ongoing, with wealth now transferring back towards price… pic.twitter.com/S36DJfHjao — glassnode (@glassnode) March 26, 2025 Glassnode reported that short-term Bitcoin holders were currently facing increased financial pressure in the wake of challenging crypto market conditions. The firm revealed that BTC’s short-term holders have incurred realized losses of $7 billion over the past 30 days. The on-chain platform argued that the run of losses marked the most prolonged loss event of the current market cycle. Short-term holders’ unrealized losses also intensified, nearing the +2 standard deviation threshold, which is a level that has historically pointed to an increased risk of capitulation. Glassnode also argued that history showed short-term BTC holders were not in the worst position they could be in despite the mounting capitulation risk. Data revealed that current figures remained well below the $19.8 billion and $20.7 billion loss spikes witnessed during the 2021 to 2022 crash. The analytics firm also argued that losses were still aligned with patterns seen in the middle of previous corrections during bull markets. The firm’s outlook correlated with that of crypto analyst PlanB that Bitcoin is still in the middle of its bullish run. On-chain data from CryptoQuant indicated that BTC’s Bull Score Index had plummeted to 20, its lowest point in two years. The digital asset is currently exchanging hands at $86K at the time of publication, a 23% drop from its recent all-time high in January. The digital asset’s corrective phase also initiated a four-month low at $76,000 on March 11. Price rebounds have only occurred when the index climbs above 60. The analytics firm stated that the current low reading signaled that the crypto market is still trapped in uncertainty, where sellers are currently outpacing buyers in momentum. CryptoQuant also noted that sustained capital outflow from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds was a major contributing factor. The firm reported that more than $4.4 billion had flowed out of spot BTC ETFs since February. Data from SosoValue also indicated that spot ETF behavior shifted last week despite the heavy outflows, with consecutive days of net inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. Long-term Bitcoin holders show signs of bullishness Glassnode reported that long-term Bitcoin holders have continued to hold large amounts of the digital currency. The firm suggested that there were signs of a “unique market dynamic moving forward.” In a March 18 markets report, the analytics platform stated that long-term holder (LTH) activity remained largely subdued, with a notable decline in their sell-side pressure. Source: Glassnode Insights. Total supply held by Bitcoin long-term holders. The Binary Spending Indicator, which determines when LTHs are spending a significant proportion of their holding in a sustained manner, showed a slowdown in long-term holders activity. The indicator also showed that LTH supply was beginning to rebound after several months of decline. “This perhaps represents a shift in sentiment, with Long-Term Holder behavior moving away from sell-side distribution.” – Glassnode Insights Bull market tops are often followed by intense sell-side pressure and strong profit-taking among LTHs, which signals a shift to bearish momentum. Glassnode acknowledged that despite BTC’s drawdown in recent weeks, LTHs continued to hold a large portion of their profits, especially during the current later stage of the cycle. The firm also suggested that Bitcoin long-term holders might still be expecting more price upside later in the year. On-chain data from CryptoQuant revealed that new BTC whales, addresses holding at least 1,000 Bitcoin, were aggressively accumulating amid market downturn. The firm argued that it signaled strong conviction in the digital asset’s long-term outlook among the new large investors. CryptoQuant’s independent analyst stated on March 7 that the cohort collectively acquired over 1 million BTC since 2024, “positioning themselves as one of the most influential market participants.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

In a new video update, Green says that Bitcoin may see a boost from US President Donald Trump’s support of crypto, helping to pump it to $150,000 this year. He also says that Trump’s tariff policies may create macroeconomic turmoil, driving investors to move their wealth into the safe haven asset golf. However, Green says some investors may also invest in Bitcoin, treating it like digital gold. “Bitcoin has the opportunity to do incredibly well. And of course, with the Trump administration and all the things that they’re doing, on one hand the positive of supporting crypto and backing it, and of course, looking for a digital future for America, and at the same time causing a little, perhaps, chaos if there are tariffs. Of course, that again makes many people concerned about what’s going to happen with emerging markets and what’s going to happen with other countries. Well, of course, when there is uncertainty, more and more people invest in gold. Yes, of course. But they also want an alternative, and Bitcoin gives that alternative. For me, $150,000 by the end of the year.” Bitcoin is trading for $87,163 at time of writing, flat on the day.

This move also follows a 200+% surge in the company's stock since it began buying Bitcoin in late 2024. GameStop saw a nearly 12% stock jump as well after announcing plans to invest in Bitcoin by using proceeds from a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering. Meanwhile, Bitcoin mining stocks fell after Microsoft reportedly scaled back its AI data center expansion plans, which caused doubt on miners’ diversification into AI infrastructure to offset post-halving revenue declines. The Blockchain Group Makes Biggest BTC Purchase France-based The Blockchain Group recently expanded its Bitcoin holdings by adding 580 BTC to its treasury in its largest purchase to date. The acquisition is valued at approximately $50.64 million at current market prices, and was disclosed after market hours on March 26. Blockchain Group’s stock price over the past 6 months (Source: Google Finance ) This move was made after an impressive 225% surge in the company’s stock price since it began investing in Bitcoin in November of 2024. The Blockchain Group describes itself as a global umbrella for companies focused on data intelligence, artificial intelligence, and decentralized technologies. Details about The Blockchain Group’s BTC acquisitions (Source: Euronext ) The firm’s Bitcoin buying strategy seems to align with certain key moments in the broader crypto market. Its first purchase of 15 BTC happened on Nov. 5, which coincided with Donald Trump’s US election win. The second was a 25 BTC acquisition that took place on Dec. 4 as Bitcoin hovered around $96,000, just before it hit six figures. While March 26 wasn’t a specific milestone for Bitcoin, it arrived just before the end of Q1 2025, which is a quarter in which Bitcoin underperformed compared to historical averages, and a few weeks ahead of the April 20 Bitcoin halving anniversary. The company says its Bitcoin strategy is intended to make use of excess cash and favorable financing options. The most recent purchase also happened as interest in corporate Bitcoin holdings seems to be gaining renewed momentum. This growing trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption is drawing a lot of commentary from industry players. N7 Capital founder Anton Chashchin believes that it will be worth watching whether other companies follow suit. US angel investor Jason Calacanis agreed with this, and suggested that Bitcoin can serve as a viable asset strategy for public firms lacking robust business models. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor's firm Strategy recently surpassed the 500,000 BTC mark after buying 506,137 Bitcoin. This was part of the company’s 12-week buying spree from November through January. Bitcoin Bet Boosts GameStop Shares GameStop shares also jumped by close to 12% on March 26 after the company’s announcement that it plans to purchase Bitcoin. The move will be financed through debt, with GameStop unveiling a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering after the market closed that day. These convertible senior notes, which can later be turned into equity, will fund general corporate initiatives, including Bitcoin acquisition, which is in line with the company’s updated investment policy. On March 25, GameStop revealed that it will use part of its corporate cash or future financing to buy digital assets like Bitcoin and US-dollar-pegged stablecoins. The company’s cash reserves saw a massive increase, and stands at about $4.77 billion. This is up from $921.7 million the previous year. GameStop’s stock closed at $28.36 on the NYSE, posting an 11.65% gain for the day. GameStop stock price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) The firm also reported a Q4 2024 net income of $131.3 million, which was more than double the $63.1 million posted during the same period the previous year. Despite a $511 million year-over-year drop in net sales, GameStop aggressively reduced its operating costs, including shutting down 590 stores across the US in 2024. The company was once the face of the 2021 meme stock phenomenon that saw retail investors drive its price sky-high in a dramatic short squeeze, and is now pivoting toward digital asset investment. GameStop’s move mirrors a broader trend of companies incorporating Bitcoin into their corporate treasuries. Japanese firm Metaplanet plans to acquire 21,000 BTC by 2026, and it experienced a 4800% increase in its stock and a 6300% jump in market capitalization after embracing its Bitcoin strategy. Semler Scientific also reported a rise in its share price after disclosing its intent to buy Bitcoin. Metaplanet stock price rise over the past year According to data from CoinGecko , 34 publicly traded companies currently hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Bitcoin Mining Stocks Slide On the other hand, Bitcoin mining stocks took a hit after reports that Microsoft is scaling back its plans to invest in new artificial intelligence data centers in the United States and Europe. The news was first reported by Bloomberg and reflected in Google Finance data. In fact, it triggered share price drops of between 4% and 12% for major crypto mining firms including Bitfarms, CleanSpark, Core Scientific, Hut 8, Marathon Digital, and Riot. The decline shed some light on the growing reliance of Bitcoin miners on AI-related revenue streams, particularly after the April 2024 Bitcoin halving event that reduced mining rewards and tightened margins across the industry. Core Scientific stock price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google ) Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer thinks that while Microsoft’s decision was expected by some investors, the broader market reaction may be more closely tied to Bitcoin’s stagnant price and growing investor fatigue in the sector. Mining difficulty is also at historically high levels, compounding the challenges for miners already grappling with weaker crypto prices. To adapt, many mining companies started repurposing their infrastructure to support high-performance computing for AI workloads. A March report from Coin Metrics shared some details about this shift, and pointed out that miners are increasingly diversifying into AI data center hosting to boost revenue. In June of 2024, Core Scientific committed 200 megawatts of capacity to power AI models developed by CoreWeave. In August, asset manager VanEck projected that mining stocks could see up to $37 billion in added market capitalization if they invest in AI infrastructure. (Source: VanEck ) However, these plans may now face additional headwinds. Microsoft’s decision to cancel or delay data center projects adds a new layer of uncertainty. Analysts at TD Cowen attributed the move to a perceived oversupply of computing capacity for AI applications and a scaling back of some planned collaborations with OpenAI. Over the past six months, Microsoft reportedly abandoned multiple data center leases and may continue to decelerate investments into late 2025, once it completes $80 billion in previously planned developments. For now, this shift is the start of a more cautious phase for AI infrastructure spending and raises concerns for Bitcoin miners hoping to capitalize on the sector.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-27 09:18:15

No longer is it a pass-off game between various government bodies: Digital assets now have dedicated overseers in a lot of regions. One of the pioneers in the space is Dubai's crypto regulator, the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). What sets VARA apart is its ability to effectively communicate guidelines and regulation to crypto firms, according to its senior official. ""Set and forget does not work for crypto, it's all about feedback and open channels,"" said Sean McHugh, senior director of market assurance at VARA. ""Since we are exclusively focused on crypto, it allows us to get a little deeper into the tech and our rules are written for the modern-era."" Dubai has become a crypto darling, emerging as one of the preferred choice for non-native crypto firms to set up shop and gain access to the region and beyond. ""Dubai is seen as a great jumping off point. We've seen a lot of [crypto] firms from Europe and beyond coming here and the reverse is also true, we see a lot of companies from other side of Asia come here. It's a strategic move and the regulatory clarity helps them,"" McHugh added. Tokenization and beyond Real world tokenization, or RWA, is gaining lot of traction in Dubai and for good reason. The region's real estate agency, the Dubai Land Department (DLD), recently started a pilot to register and transfer property deeds on the blockchain. The tokenization initiative is being fostered by VARA and the Dubai Future Foundation (DFF). The integration of real-estate into blockchain could bolster the city's massive property market. DLD expects tokenized real-estate to jump to 60 billion dirhams ($16 billion) by 2033, accounting for 7% of Dubai's total property transactions. McHugh, speaking to CoinDesk at VARA's office, believes that real estate is just the beginning. ""It's very popular, not just in Dubai, but beyond. Dubai has the ability to get things done quicker,"" he said, adding that they are also seeing a lot of precious metal tokenization projects. VARA, with its nimble approach to regulation, is closely watching the space, he said. ""Whether it's real estate, precious metal, or some other asset, a big part of my focus on this is customer protection. So, especially when you get to fractionalization it brings in a lot of new capital and retail investors, that need to be protected,"" he said. ""We ask a lot of questions when it comes to RWA projects, what is the token? what exactly do I own? What does it trade and who is the liquidity provider? Cause for investors (institutional or otherwise) they need a liquidity event to get out. And these are the type of things we drill down with each project,"" McHugh emphasized. Interagency collaboration The Donald Trump administration has openly advocated for crypto in the U.S. and in the opinion of industry leaders pushed other regions to follow suit. That's not necessarily the case in the UAE, especially with VARA, which was created three years ago, long before the U.S. President became an open proponent of digital assets. McHugh believes that interagency cooperation will be key for global crypto regulation, but does not see any particular agency leading the charge. ""I don't think we'd see some super regulator, regional or otherwise. I think each agency is focused on its own customers,"" he said, adding that memoranda of understanding (MoU) and open communication between governing bodies is the way to successfully watch over crypto. Whether it's exchanges, Web3 or RWA, the future of crypto in Dubai looks bright and McHugh, who was the former chief compliance officer at Citadel, said he feels that one of the main reason for that is the pro-business and start-up nature of the city.",Policy|Vara|Dubai|Tokenization|Real Estate,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|ASIA,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-27 09:19:34

Bitcoin has retracted from its $109K high, while altcoins have faced even steeper declines. According to Coinglass data, investor sentiment has shifted from a phase of “greed” to one of “fear,” sparking debate over whether this is merely a dip or the onset of a bear market. As trading risks increase, more investors are seeking stable and reliable passive income solutions. Centralized exchanges are competing to expand their wealth management offerings, and HTX Earn is leading the charge — delivering top-tier yields, an expansive range of supported assets, and constant product upgrades. Together, these features create a seamless and automated earning experience for crypto holders. Earn While You Trade: The Power of HTX Auto-Earn HTX Earn has recently launched a major upgrade to its Auto-Earn feature, enabling smoother, more flexible capital deployment with one-click subscription and redemption. This enhanced system redefines passive income through smarter automation. With Auto-Earn enabled, users’ spot balances are automatically subscribed into the corresponding Flexible Earn products every hour, activating hourly automatic compounding to optimize returns. When users place spot trades, their Earn balances are automatically redeemed in real time to fulfill orders, eliminating the need for manual withdrawals and minimizing delays. Whether users are catching a market pump or executing daily trades, the entire process remains frictionless. Even during market downturns, idle assets can keep working. Auto-Earn ensures that every satoshi is earning—whether you’re stacking BTC and ETH or exploring the next high-potential token listed on HTX. HTX Earn has continuously pushed the boundaries of integrating trading and earning. Following the success of SmartEarn, which enabled passive income generation on USDT balances in perpetual futures accounts, Auto-Earn closes the gap between spot trading and passive yield. Funds compound automatically, while liquidity remains readily accessible, giving HTX Earn a major edge over competing exchange-based yield products. High Yields, More Choices: Find Your Perfect Fit In passive income, APY matters, and HTX Earn consistently offers some of the most competitive rates in the industry, especially for stablecoins and PoS assets. For instance, USDD Flexible Earn offers an 8% APY — 9.4x higher than typical stablecoin products. Plus , users can subscribe using USDT at a 1:1 ratio with zero slippage, making it one of the most convenient options for optimizing yield. For holders of ETH, TRX, and SOL holders, HTX Earn’s Flexible products deliver returns comparable to on-chain staking, minus the technical complexity and security concerns. A standout innovation is the $HTX Earn product. By subscribing to $HTX Flexible Earn, users automatically join Launchpool events, earning a 4% APY while receiving airdrops of trending project tokens. Currently, Launchpool #3 is in full swing, with 370,000+ USDT worth of airdrops from AB and OBT prize pools. Beyond high yields, HTX Earn supports over 200 cryptocurrencies, with rapid listings of high-quality new assets. New users joining fixed term products for newly listed tokens can access APYs of up to 100%. At present, top-performing Flexible Earn products include USDT, USDD, BTC, ETH, and $HTX, with DOGE and SHIB also gaining traction. With the TRON Meme Season 2.0 on the horizon, expect more SunPump meme coins to land on HTX and expand the Earn ecosystem further. HTX Earn also runs a monthly “Earning Day” promotion, featuring APY Booster Coupons and exclusive perks. This month, HTX introduced 7-day fixed-term products for BTC, ETH, and USDT, offering up to 10% APY and attracting significant user demand.

Cryptocurrency trading group HashKey has unveiled a new initiative to rate cryptocurrencies and crypto exchanges in Hong Kong to help the local crypto businesses align with regulatory framework for virtual assets, issued by the Securities and Futures Commission. In an X post on Thursday, March 27, HashKey said it partnered with the Hong Kong Virtual Asset Rating Company, which will provide three key services: virtual asset ratings, exchange ratings, and virtual asset indices. According to HashKey, the initiative aims to build an “industry evaluation ecosystem” offering “objective quantitative standards” for both exchanges and investors. The goal is to strengthen market transparency and create compliance benchmarks, which, in turn, could help solidify Hong Kong’s role as a global virtual asset hub. Per HashKey, the ratings would provide risk indicators to help investors make more informed decisions.

HashKey secured a $30 million investment from Beijing-based Gaorong Ventures, which valued the company at $1.5 billion. The investment came shortly after HashKey Capital, the group’s investment arm, received approval from the SFC to manage crypto investment products for high-net-worth clients.

Its daily trading volume has jumped by 27.5% to $3.37 billion, reinforcing the intensity of the sell-side activity. XRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView Key catalysts driving the XRP prices lower today include: Failure to rally despite Ripple dropping its cross-appeal case against the SEC. Lack of enthusiasm among derivatives traders. A textbook bearish technical setup. Ripple’s dropped cross-appeal fails to boost XRP One of the most significant factors is the lack of a strong market response following Ripple’s decision to drop its cross-appeal in the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit. Key takeaways: On March 25, Ripple announced it would withdraw its appeal against the SEC, bringing its case with the agency to a conclusion. Ripple had appealed against a prior ruling, which included a $125 million fine for violating securities laws through institutional XRP sales. According to Ripple’s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, the resolution reduced the fine to $50 million, with $75 million returned to Ripple, signaling the end of a four-year legal saga. Alderoty also highlighted that the agency will ask the judge to lift the injunction placed on Ripple in August 2024.

Under the new leadership led by acting Chair Mark Uyed, the agency has reversed most of its legal actions against crypto companies, including Coinbase , Kraken , Uniswap , and Immutable . However, XRP’s price has remained flat in the past few days. The absence of a rally indicates waning momentum and possible profit-taking by traders who expected more upside. Low Open Interest and negative funding rates XRP’s price action is also reflecting a lack of enthusiasm in its derivatives market, evidenced by low open interest and funding rates. Key points: Open interest (OI), the total number of outstanding futures and options contracts, remains subdued, indicating reduced trading activity. Currently, at $3.82 billion, the OI is 52% below its peak of $7.8 billion witnessed on Jan. 18, dropping 5% over the last 24 hours. Declining OI means less capital is entering the market, which can exacerbate the price decline as buying pressure dries up. XRP open interest across all exchanges. Source: CoinGlass Compounding this issue are negative funding rates in XRP perpetual futures markets. Funding rates represent the periodic payments exchanged between long and short-position holders. This metric flipped negative on March 27, dropping from 0.0088% to -0.0049% over the last 24 hours. When rates turn negative, shorts (bets against the price) pay longs to keep their positions open, suggesting bearish sentiment. XRP funding rates across all exchanges. Source: CoinGlass If buyers do not step in, these conditions can create a self-reinforcing cycle of selling pressure, further dragging the price down. XRP price validates bear flag pattern XRP has confirmed a bear flag pattern on the daily chart after closing below the lower boundary of the flag at $2.45. Key levels to watch: XRP is currently testing the support level at $2.30 after flipping the flag’s lower trendline into resistance. The $2.22 range low (from March 18) and the flag’s base at $2 are key levels. A high volume move below these support levels could drag XRP prices lower. The maximum loss target from the pole’s length indicates that XRP could revisit the $1.60 level over the next few days. This would represent another 31% descent from current levels.

As Cointelegraph reported , veteran trader Peter Brandt said that XRP is forming a textbook head-and-shoulders pattern on the daily chart, projecting a possible 50% drop toward $1.07. Brandt explained that a rally above $3 would invalidate this pattern to avoid a potential 55% correction. “Below $1.9, I would not want to own it. H&S projects to $1.07.

DOGE, currently priced at $0.17, has been climbing past key resistance levels, fueling speculation of a breakout that could push it beyond $0.80 or even higher if market momentum holds. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance is gaining momentum after launching its presale. The third phase of Mutuum Finance presale has sold over 80% and continues while this high-growth altcoin sells for $0.02 and has collected $5 million. The next stage of the presale will boost MUTM’s price to $0.025 while attracting more than 7000 investors. The initial investors during this phase will receive a 200% payback when the launch price reaches $0.06 while future forecast estimates predict a value surge past $1 in the near future. A DeFi Giant on the Rise Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 7000 investors joined the presale funding to support the project which received $5 million in total. Mutuum Finance’s price currently reaches $0.02 in Phase 3 even though investors anticipate a 25% price increase in Phase 4 which will generate considerable profit potential. The analysts forecast MUTM to surge beyond $1 in upcoming months when it launches at $0.06 because its distinctive lending approach meets rising market requirements thus making it an underappreciated yet promising DeFi resource. Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts. The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi. A Reliable and Secure Financial Network Mutuum Finance creates a launch plan for its new collateralized USD-backed stablecoin developed for Ethereum blockchain usage. Insolvency risks that threaten algorithmic stablecoins will not affect this over-collateralized asset because it will maintain long-term reliability. A complete audit system of smart contracts together with transparent financial mechanisms establishes trust with investors as it fixes numerous security problems observed with past decentralized finance projects. Driving Community Growth with Investor Rewards To attract more community members Mutuum Finance implements profitable incentive programs at an aggressive pace. The program will use $1 million to give ten investors $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and the referral system gives rewards to users who bring in new investors to the platform. The platform gives early supporters exclusive benefits including staking pools and governance rights and VIP-exclusive updates to enhance their connection with the platform. Friendly Tokenomics for Lasting Expansion Tokenomics in the project follows a strategy designed for both limited token circulation management and continuous appreciation of value. The presale limitation combined with anti-inflationary procedures enables Mutuum Finance to establish scarcity which creates possible upward token value potential. Staking rewards users for token involvement by delivering valuable incentives that strengthen the ecosystem sustainability of its native token. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continue to capture investor attention with their strong growth potential heading into 2025. While DOGE eyes a breakout past $0.80, Mutuum Finance is rapidly selling out its presale, with over 80% of Phase 3 already gone. This is the final chance to get in at $0.02 before the next surge, with the price set to rise by 25% in the next stage. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to secure early gains.

Right now, the spotlight is firmly fixed on Bitcoin. The latest reading from the CoinMarketCap (CMC) Altcoin Season Index is flashing a clear signal: it’s Bitcoin Season . What is the Altcoin Season Index and Why Does it Matter? The Altcoin Season Index , a crucial tool for crypto traders and enthusiasts, isn’t just another arbitrary number. It’s a meticulously calculated metric designed to gauge the prevailing sentiment and momentum within the crypto market. Think of it as a compass, pointing towards whether altcoins or Bitcoin are leading the charge. This index helps you understand the current market dynamics and potentially strategize your investment decisions. Here’s a breakdown of what you need to know about the Altcoin Season Index : Data Source: It’s tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), a reputable source for cryptocurrency data. Scope: The index analyzes the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CMC, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide a pure reflection of market sentiment. Timeframe: It assesses coin performance over the past 90 days, giving a medium-term perspective on market trends. Scoring: The index ranges from 1 to 100. Altcoin Season Definition: An Altcoin Season is declared when at least 75% of the top 100 coins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. Bitcoin Season Definition: Conversely, a Bitcoin Season emerges when 25% or fewer of these coins have outperformed Bitcoin during the same period. Currently, the Altcoin Season Index sits at a mere 19, as of 00:30 UTC on March 27. This low score emphatically confirms that we are indeed in a Bitcoin Season . The index even nudged up two points from the previous day, further solidifying Bitcoin’s current dominance. Decoding Bitcoin Season: What Does an Index of 19 Really Mean for the Crypto Market? An Altcoin Season Index reading of 19 is a strong indicator of Bitcoin dominance . It signifies that Bitcoin is not just holding its ground, but actively outperforming the vast majority of altcoins in the market. But what are the underlying implications of this? Let’s break down the significance of Bitcoin Season : Capital Flow to Bitcoin: During Bitcoin Season , investors often rotate their capital back into Bitcoin, perceived as a safer and more established cryptocurrency, especially during times of market uncertainty or consolidation. Altcoin Underperformance: While Bitcoin thrives, many altcoins may experience slower growth or even price corrections as investor attention and capital shift towards Bitcoin. Market Sentiment: A Bitcoin Season can reflect a cautious or risk-off sentiment in the broader crypto market. Investors may be prioritizing security and established assets like Bitcoin over the higher volatility and potentially higher risk associated with altcoins. Potential for Future Altcoin Surge: Interestingly, Bitcoin Seasons don’t last forever. They can often pave the way for future Altcoin Seasons . As Bitcoin consolidates or corrects after a period of dominance, profits can then flow back into altcoins, potentially triggering a new altcoin rally. Is Bitcoin Dominance a Threat or an Opportunity? Whether Bitcoin dominance , as indicated by the Altcoin Season Index , is a threat or an opportunity largely depends on your perspective and investment strategy. For Bitcoin maximalists and long-term Bitcoin holders: This is often seen as a positive sign, reinforcing Bitcoin’s position as the king of crypto and validating its store of value narrative. For altcoin enthusiasts and traders: A prolonged Bitcoin Season might seem less exciting. However, it presents unique opportunities: Accumulate Altcoins at Lower Prices: During Bitcoin Season , many fundamentally strong altcoins may become undervalued. This could be an opportune time to strategically accumulate them for the next potential altcoin rally. Focus on Bitcoin Trading: Traders can capitalize on Bitcoin’s price movements and volatility during its dominant phase. Identify Strong Altcoins: Even in Bitcoin Season , some altcoins may still outperform. Identifying these resilient projects can lead to significant gains. Research is key to finding these gems. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Crypto Market in Bitcoin Season So, how can you navigate the crypto waters during a Bitcoin Season ? Here are some actionable insights: Reassess Your Portfolio: Evaluate your crypto portfolio in light of the current Bitcoin Season . Are you overweight in altcoins? Consider rebalancing to align with the prevailing market trend. Monitor the Altcoin Season Index: Keep a close eye on the Altcoin Season Index . A rising index could signal a shift towards altcoin momentum. Research and Due Diligence: Whether you’re focusing on Bitcoin or exploring undervalued altcoins, thorough research is paramount. Understand the fundamentals, technology, and adoption of any cryptocurrency before investing. Manage Risk: The crypto market is inherently volatile. Implement robust risk management strategies, including diversification and setting stop-loss orders. Stay Informed: The crypto landscape evolves rapidly. Stay updated on market news, regulatory developments, and technological advancements to make informed decisions. Conclusion: Embracing the Dynamic Nature of the Crypto Market The Altcoin Season Index serves as a valuable reminder of the cyclical nature of the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin Seasons and Altcoin Seasons are part of this fascinating ebb and flow. Understanding these dynamics, utilizing tools like the Altcoin Season Index , and adapting your strategies accordingly are crucial for navigating the crypto market successfully. While Bitcoin dominance may be the current theme, the crypto narrative is constantly unfolding, promising exciting shifts and opportunities in the future.

Analysts suggest that for Dogecoin to solidify this upward momentum, it must surpass a crucial resistance level. Dogecoin Eyes New Bullish Trend Amid Market Recovery The recent price movements of Dogecoin have been influenced by broader market trends and macroeconomic factors, particularly the fallout from President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. After reaching a yearly high of $0.4350 on January 18, Dogecoin experienced a dramatic decline, plummeting 67% to a low of $0.1430 on March 11. However, the recent positive performance indicates that a new bullish wave may be emerging. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Prediction: Analyst says There Is 100% Chance Of A Bullish Rally, Here’s Why Market analyst Ali Martinez has pointed in a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter) to the SuperTrend indicator, a technical analysis tool that helps identify price trends, suggesting that Dogecoin could enter a bullish phase if it successfully breaks through the resistance level at $0.21. The analyst further identified the key support floor for the Dogecoin price at $0.177, which will be crucial in determining whether the token can sustain its recovery or if it will face another downtrend. Should Dogecoin fail to hold this support level, it could revisit once again the $0.14 price point, where significant buying pressure previously helped support the price. This scenario could erase the gains made over the last two weeks. Eyeing $0.50 And Potential All-Time High Of $1.60 Adding weight to Martinez’s analysis, data from Glassnode reveals that 7% of Dogecoin’s total supply is concentrated at the $0.20 mark, which is the third-largest concentration after $0.17 and $0.07. According to Glassnode, this concentration suggests that the $0.20 level may act as a formidable resistance point in the near term, as many wallets likely acquired their holdings at lower prices. In a more positive note for the token and despite the current uncertainties surrounding Dogecoin’s price, analysts remain optimistic about the memecoin’s long-term prospects. Related Reading: Bitcoin Marks 114 Weeks In Active Buy Signal On The SuperTrend Weekly, But Things Could Turn Bad If This Happens According to experts like AMCrypto, Dogecoin has recently tested a multi-year support trendline, indicating a potential for sustained upward movement. “Memes are slowly moving up now, and I expect DOGE to lead the rally,” one analyst stated, setting a target of $0.50 in the second quarter of the year.

42472808,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=700906,1743067849,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42472808.jpeg,"Italy goes after Meta, X and LinkedIn in landmark tax payment case",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/italy-goes-after-meta-x-linkedin-tax-payment/,"Italian tax authorities have demanded Meta, X, and LinkedIn pay value-added tax (VAT) claims, according to a Wednesday Reuters report, citing four sources familiar with the matter. The case will become the first attempt in the European Union (EU) jurisdiction to apply VAT laws to social media platforms offering free services in exchange for user data. Italy is seeking €887.6 million ($961 million) in taxes from Meta, €12.5 million from X, and around €140 million from LinkedIn. Per Reuters, the figures represent the entire period under investigation , which varies by company but spans from 2015-2016 to 2021-2022. Still, the current tax assessment only covers 2015 and 2016, as claims for those years are set to expire. Why Italian tax authorities want social platforms to pay levies The case hangs on a legal argument that when users sign up for platforms like Facebook, X, or LinkedIn, they are effectively engaging in a barter transaction. Under EU VAT law, taxable transactions require a supply of goods or services for consideration. Italian authorities are convinced that users are offering non-monetary consideration by providing personal data in exchange for access to social media platforms, making the transaction subject to VAT. Investigations into Meta and X for alleged tax fraud had been previously reported, but the inclusion of Microsoft’s LinkedIn unit in the case was not publicly known until now. Mark Zuckerberg and his team have yet to comment on case specifics, but they insisted they will cooperate fully with authorities in accordance with EU and local laws. The company also opposed the idea that providing access to online platforms should be subject to VAT. LinkedIn told Reuters that it had “nothing to share at this time.” Elon Musk and X have not made any statement on the matter either. Legal proceedings with big repercussions Legal and tax experts suggest that if Italy’s approach is upheld, it could impact several businesses that keep user data across the EU, including airlines, supermarkets, and publishers. Any company linking free services to data collection could face similar tax liabilities. The three social media companies have 60 days to appeal before a judicial process can formally begin. If they request a settlement proposal from tax authorities, they will be granted an additional month, during which time three outcomes could follow. One option is for the companies to challenge the claims in court, a process that could take up to a decade given Italy’s three-tiered judicial system. Another possibility is for the Italian Revenue Agency to drop its claim, either for technical reasons or due to political considerations. Alternatively, a partial settlement could be reached and payments made while Italy seeks a ruling from the European Commission on a more defined legal framework. Italy freezes Starlink negotiations Italy and Starlink Service LLC CEO Elon Musk have a good relationship, although it may turn sour soon because of the trade tariff wars between the EU and the US. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto confirmed in an interview with La Repubblica on March 22 that Italy has halted negotiations with SpaceX over a potential Starlink agreement. According to a Ukrainian local news outlet, European officials fear the US could use control over Starlink to twist the hand of Kyiv into decisions favoring Russia and a reported minerals deal with Washington. On March 9, Musk denied that Starlink would be cut off from Ukraine, clashing with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski over the legitimacy of these fears. “ To be extremely clear, no matter how much I disagree with the Ukraine policy, Starlink will never turn off its terminals ,” Musk stated. Earlier this year, the Italian government was supportive of working with Starlink, but political opposition derailed discussions. “ It seems to me that everything has stopped … the topic has moved from Starlink to the statements of and about the person ,” Crosetto said. Negotiations are purportedly now on hold, and the Italian government wants security considerations in its defence contracts heard before making any deal. “ When the controversy and the times have calmed down, there will be a technical approach ,” the Italian Defence minister reckoned.

Now it looks as though XRP , the payments-focused cryptocurrency, can also be used as an indicator for bull-market peaks in bitcoin ( BTC ). Unlike meme tokens like DOGE and shiba inu ( SHIB ), XRP has utility. It is used by Ripple to facilitate cross-border transactions, which places it in a bucket different from the memecoins. Even so, since 2017, XRP has been a contrary indicator for bitcoin bulls, tending to rally— often soaring several hundred percent in a short time — in the final stages of BTC bull runs, marking the point at which bitcoin ultimately peaked. XRP experienced a remarkable 10-fold rally from December 2017 to early 2018, coinciding with bitcoin's peak at around $20,000, before entering a bear market that lasted almost a year. A similar near-vertical spike in XRP occurred in early 2021, marking the peak of another bull market in bitcoin. And XRP's surge of approximately 240% in late 2024 foreshadowed bitcoin's bull market peak above $109,000, followed by a decline below $80,000. As the saying goes: ""Once is happenstance, twice is a coincidence, and three times is a trend.""

He made the threat on Truth Social, saying both countries would face “far larger” penalties if they attempt to damage the American economy. “If the European Union works with Canada in order to do economic harm to the USA, large scale Tariffs, far larger than currently planned, will be placed on them both in order to protect the best friend that each of those two countries has ever had!” Trump wrote . As Cryptopolitan reported , the warning came just one day after Trump announced a new 25% tariff on all vehicles not manufactured inside the U.S., which he said would go into effect on April 2. The White House confirmed the plan on Wednesday. The new tariffs will target foreign-made cars and light trucks and will pile onto the existing trade duties already enforced under Trump’s administration. Trump expands tariffs to include foreign car parts Will Scharf, a White House aide, said the new rules don’t just stop at cars. Starting in May, the administration will apply additional tariffs on engines, transmissions, and electrical parts brought in from outside the country. These components are often used in American car production. Scharf said the plan is expected to generate “over $100 billion of new annual revenue” for the United States. After the announcement, stock markets in the U.S. and Asia dropped sharply, especially shares tied to the auto industry. European automakers were expected to follow the same trend as their markets opened Thursday morning. The decision added another layer to the global trade war that has already affected several industries and regions. Trump, who has already put duties on goods from China, Canada, and Mexico, as well as across the board on steel and aluminum, continues to argue that the U.S. is being taken advantage of by its biggest trading partners. The new auto tariffs are the latest move in what he sees as a long-overdue correction of global trade imbalances. The White House defended the policy shift by saying it would “protect and strengthen” the American car industry. But many analysts said this could actually hit U.S. automakers as hard as it does foreign ones. That’s because most American carmakers depend heavily on imported parts to build their vehicles domestically. EU and Canada signal retaliation plans, automakers panic Neither the EU nor Canada has confirmed that they plan to work together against the U.S., but both have made it clear that they are considering responses to Trump’s new tariffs. On Thursday, Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, said the EU will continue looking for ways to negotiate while also defending its economy. “We will continue to seek negotiated solutions, while safeguarding its economic interests,” she said . “Tariffs are taxes — bad for businesses, worse for consumers equally in the U.S. and the European Union.” In Canada, newly elected Prime Minister Mark Carney called the new auto tariff “a direct attack.” Speaking to reporters in Kitchener, Ontario, Carney said he planned to hold an emergency cabinet meeting that same day to decide how to respond. “We will defend our workers, we will defend our companies, we will defend our country, and we will defend it together,” he said. In Europe, carmakers are already feeling the heat. The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association released a statement on Thursday saying it is “deeply concerned” about the move. The group said the timing couldn’t be worse, calling it “a watershed moment for our industry’s transformation and as fierce international competition mounts.” Ludovic Subran, Chief Economist at Allianz, said on CNBC Thursday that no one should be surprised that Trump is going after the car industry. “Cars are so political,” Subran said during the “Squawk Box Europe” show. He also said the industry is already under pressure, with registrations down since January. “You’ve seen the reaction of the stock markets, the car manufacturers. It comes at a time when there is a lot of uncertainty about car consumption, the registration of cars has slumped since the beginning of the year, so it is really another one of these major seismic waves of the Trump administration.” While Trump pushes ahead, economists are warning that the policy will cause more harm than good. Many said the tariffs are likely to make cars more expensive in the U.S. and drive up inflation at a time when consumer confidence is already shaky. Auto analysts from Wedbush Securities said the new rules could make some cars cost $5,000 to $10,000 more depending on the model and features. “In our view these initial tariffs (if they hold in their current form) would be a hurricane-like headwind to foreign (and many U.S.) automakers and ultimately push the average price of cars up $5k to $10k depending on the make/model/price point,” the firm said in an emailed note Wednesday. They added that this may still be a negotiation tactic by Trump rather than a final decision. “We continue to believe this is some form of negotiation, and these tariffs could change by the week, although this initial 25% tariff on autos from outside the U.S. is almost an untenable head-scratching number for the U.S. consumer,” they said.

42473131,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143841,1743069017,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Hopeful Surge: Asia FX Climbs as US Dollar Weakens Post-Trump Tariffs,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/asia-fx-dollar-trump-tariffs/,"The Forex market is a dynamic beast, constantly reacting to global events. Recently, we’ve seen a fascinating shift in Asia, where Asian currencies are showing resilience against the mighty US dollar. What’s fueling this change? The ripples from former US President Trump’s auto tariffs are still being felt, leading to a softening of the dollar and a subsequent uplift for Asia FX . Why is Asia FX Ticking Up? Decoding the Dollar’s Dip To understand why Asia FX is experiencing this positive momentum, we need to dissect the factors weakening the US Dollar . The story begins with trade policies, specifically the auto tariffs imposed during the Trump administration. While the intended goal might have been to bolster domestic industries, the unintended consequence is now playing out in the Forex market. Trade Tensions and Dollar Weakness: Tariffs, especially on major industries like automobiles, can create uncertainty in international trade. This uncertainty can sometimes lead to investors seeking alternatives to the US Dollar, perceived as potentially vulnerable to trade disputes. Economic Repercussions: While tariffs are designed to protect domestic industries, they can also increase costs for businesses and consumers. If these economic repercussions are perceived as negative for the US economy, it can dampen investor appetite for the US Dollar . Market Sentiment Shift: The Forex market is heavily influenced by sentiment. If traders and investors believe the US Dollar’s strength is waning due to policy decisions or economic indicators, they may start to move away from it, leading to a decrease in its value. Essentially, the lingering effects of trade policies, combined with evolving global economic perceptions, are contributing to the current easing of the US Dollar , creating a window of opportunity for Asia FX to strengthen. Which Asian Currencies are Benefiting? A Closer Look at Asia FX Performance The rise in Asia FX isn’t a uniform wave; some currencies are riding this tide more strongly than others. Let’s examine which Asian currencies are showing the most significant gains against the backdrop of a softer US Dollar : The Chinese Yuan (CNY): As a major player in the Asian economy, the Yuan’s movement is closely watched. A weaker US Dollar often provides breathing room for the Yuan, allowing it to appreciate slightly. This is particularly relevant given the ongoing trade dynamics between the US and China. The Japanese Yen (JPY): Often considered a safe-haven currency, the Yen can react in complex ways to global economic shifts. However, in this scenario, a softer US Dollar can reduce pressure on the Yen, potentially leading to some appreciation. The South Korean Won (KRW): The South Korean economy is heavily export-oriented, and the Won’s value is sensitive to global trade conditions. A weaker US Dollar can make South Korean exports more competitive, potentially bolstering the Won. Emerging Asian Currencies: Currencies like the Indian Rupee (INR), Indonesian Rupiah (IDR), and Malaysian Ringgit (MYR) can also benefit. These emerging market currencies are often more volatile but can see upward movement when the US Dollar loses some of its shine. It’s important to note that the extent of gains varies for each currency based on their individual economic fundamentals and domestic policies. However, the overarching theme is that the easing US Dollar is providing a tailwind for a broad spectrum of Asia FX . Trump Tariffs and Forex: Understanding the Lingering Impact The term “ Trump tariffs ” evokes a specific period of global trade policy. But why are we still talking about them and their impact on the Forex market ? The reality is that trade policies have long-lasting effects. Here’s how Trump tariffs continue to influence the current Forex market landscape: Aspect Impact of Trump Tariffs on Forex Trade Relationships Tariffs strained relationships with key trading partners, creating lasting uncertainty about future trade flows. This uncertainty can weigh on the US Dollar . Supply Chains Tariffs disrupted global supply chains, forcing businesses to re-evaluate their sourcing and production strategies. This can lead to shifts in currency valuations as trade patterns adjust. Inflationary Pressures Tariffs can contribute to inflationary pressures by increasing the cost of imported goods. Inflation expectations can influence central bank policies and, consequently, currency values. Investor Sentiment The era of Trump tariffs fostered a sense of protectionism and trade friction. This legacy continues to shape investor sentiment regarding global trade and currency risk. While new administrations may bring policy changes, the economic architecture shaped by previous trade actions, like Trump tariffs , takes time to unwind. Their impact on the Forex market , particularly on the strength of the US Dollar and the performance of Asia FX , remains relevant. Navigating the Forex Market: Actionable Insights for Traders For those involved in the Forex market , understanding these dynamics is crucial. What actionable insights can we glean from the current situation where Asia FX is ticking up as the US Dollar eases? Monitor Asian Currency Trends: Keep a close eye on the performance of Asian currencies against the US Dollar . Look for sustained upward trends and identify which currencies are showing the strongest momentum. Assess Trade Policy Developments: Stay informed about any shifts in trade policies, both in the US and in Asia. Changes in tariffs or trade agreements can have a direct and often immediate impact on currency valuations. Analyze Economic Data: Pay attention to economic data releases from both the US and Asian economies. Indicators like GDP growth, inflation, and employment figures can provide clues about the relative strength of currencies. Consider Risk Management: Forex market trading involves risk. Use appropriate risk management strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders, to protect your capital. Diversification across different currency pairs can also be a prudent approach. Seek Expert Analysis: Consult with experienced Forex market analysts or financial advisors to gain deeper insights and informed perspectives on trading strategies. The current Forex market scenario presents both opportunities and challenges. By staying informed, analyzing trends, and employing sound risk management, traders can navigate these shifts effectively. The Future Outlook: Will Asia FX Continue its Ascent? Looking ahead, the question on everyone’s mind is: will Asia FX continue to strengthen against the US Dollar ? While predicting the future with certainty is impossible, we can consider some key factors that will likely shape the outlook: Global Economic Recovery: The pace of global economic recovery will play a significant role. If the global economy strengthens, particularly in Asia, it could provide further support for Asia FX . US Monetary Policy: The future direction of US monetary policy is crucial. If the Federal Reserve maintains a dovish stance, keeping interest rates low, it could continue to weigh on the US Dollar . Geopolitical Stability: Geopolitical events can always inject volatility into the Forex market . Stability in key regions and trade relationships will be conducive to a more predictable currency environment. Asian Economic Reforms: Ongoing economic reforms and structural changes within Asian economies can enhance their long-term growth prospects and currency strength.

This is one of two major concurrent developments, with the other being the completion of a sold-out Immortal Statue NFT sale just days before Immortal Rising 2’s Token Generation Event (TGE) , which started on March 27. Planetarium Labs is a community-focused Web3 gaming company that creates highly moddable blockchain-powered gaming experiences that feature immersive gameplay in player-driven economies. It is at the forefront of the decentralized gaming revolution and is redefining what is possible within the Web3 gaming ecosystem. The latest $3 million raise was driven by participation from some of the best-known players and investment firms in the Web3 blockchain gaming space, including the Spartan Group, Immutable, MARBLEX, Comma3 Ventures, Sovrun, 32-Bit Ventures, Notch Ventures, Cristian Manea, Niels de Ruiter , and other prominent angel investors. With this fresh capital injection, Planetarium Labs and the development team will be able to continue expanding the Immortal Rising 2 ecosystem while simultaneously enhancing gameplay mechanics and strengthening community engagement. These activities will help further solidify the studio’s position as a leader in – and the global face of – next-generation blockchain gaming. A Vision for the Future of Web3 Gaming The backing from these key investors highlights the industry’s confidence in Immortal Rising 2’s Play-to-Airdrop (P2A) model, which merges true digital ownership with engaging gameplay. Robbie Ferguson, the Co-Founder and President of Immutable , emphasized the game’s unique positioning by stating that Immortal Rising 2, with almost nine million downloads, has already proven its product-market fit. He also said that the title sits at the intersection of three major trends: Asia’s booming gaming market, the dominance of mobile gaming, and the seamless integration of Web3 mechanics. With Immutable zkEVM’s scaling solutions and Immutable Play , which is Immutable’s distribution platform, investors say they are excited to help bring this game to an even larger global audience. Other investors echoed similar sentiments, recognizing Immortal Rising 2 as a pioneering force in blockchain gaming. Kelvin Koh, a Co-founder & Partner at the Spartan Group , said that he sees the project as a milestone in decentralized gaming. He said that Immortal Rising 2 is setting new standards by offering players true ownership and meaningful rewards. He also stated that Planetarium Labs is at the forefront of this shift, and gave the unwavering support of the Spartan Group to Planetarium Labs in order to continue driving innovation in the Web3 blockchain gaming space. Finally, Jin-pyo Hong, the CEO of MARBLEX , pointed to the growing connection between Web2 and Web3 gaming by saying that Immortal Rising 2 bridges traditional and blockchain gaming in a way that makes sense for both gamers and investors. He said that MARBLEX is excited to partner with Planetarium Labs in this journey and to fully support the future of Immortal Rising 2. Sold-Out NFT Sale Sets the Stage for TGE Alongside the successful funding round, Immortal Rising 2’s Immortal Statue NFT sale has sold out, underscoring strong demand from not just players but collectors as well. These exclusive NFTs grant premium in-game rewards, token airdrops, and elevated status within the Immortal Rising 2 ecosystem. The NFT sale follows the game’s Play-to-Airdrop (P2A) launchpool, where the community has already claimed over 9 million SoulBound Tokens (SBTs). SBTs are digital assets tied exclusively to players’ achievements. Because SBTs unlock hidden rewards at the campaign’s conclusion, they add new layers of engagement with players. Token Generation Event (TGE) With both the funding and NFT sale secured, all eyes are now on Immortal Rising 2’s TGE that officially unlocks new opportunities for players and investors. This marks a crucial milestone in the game’s expanding economy and governance model, setting the foundation for a fully decentralized gaming future.For more details on the TGE and upcoming game developments, follow Immortal Rising 2 on X (Twitter) and Discord .",Information,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|AIRDROP|ASIA|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-27 09:50:33

Active users exceed 290M, with 1.5M daily active users on average. TRX price consolidates bullishly, with $0.22 as key support and $0.30 as major resistance. Whale activity rises, with large transactions up 12% month-over-month. The transaction volume at $10.2B daily, marking an 8.5% increase. TRX has surpassed both Ethereum and Solana in terms of transaction fees, showing its increasing adoption rate. TRON , which is generating an average of $1.86M a day in transaction fees and consistently surpassing its competitors, shows that as the network begins to see increased activity, the fundamentals for a bullish case have been strengthened. The unanswered question remains: Will TRX break resistance and see $0.40 in April? Technical Analysis: TRX Price Outlook TRX’s price activity indicates price action that is neutral to slightly bullish in its consolidation phase, with a developing medium-term uptrend only if resistance areas break. The long-term trend is bullish with improved adoption and transaction volume. Overview of Support and Resistance: Key Support: $0.22, the 200-day SMA level; $0.20, the historical demand zone. Key Resistance: $0.25, which is a pivot level of resistance; $0.30 for an additional breakout level toward the $0.40 level. Momentum Indicators: RSI 58, suggesting moderately bullish momentum. Volume: A 9.4% increase in the trading volume over the past week. Tron On-chain data & market sentiment – 290.4 M+ total TRX addresses with the growth of 2.1% monthly. – Daily active users at 1.5 M+ with an increase of 5.3% MoM increase. – Transaction volume on the verge of 10.2B daily which is increased by 8.5% MoM. Whale transactions ($ 500 K+): increased by 12% MoM, suggesting institutional participation. Fee revenue monthly at $53.16M – significantly higher fees than both Solana & Ethereum. Market sentiment: Bullish; TRX’s social engagement increased by 7.2% WoW. Will TRX reach $0.40? The increasing network fees on TRON, increase in whale accumulation, and new users participating in TRON’s ecosystem lead to a bullish setup, however, for TRX to reach $0.40 it must break and hold the $0.30 level. A close below support at the $0.22 level could open the door to a retest of the $0.20 level as well. TRON’s recent upgrades solidify any bullish thoughts one might have. The launch of AI-integrated features on the Sun Pump platform is a major key milestone that has granted AI integration for real-time automation and modification of process parameters related to AI and TRON. The added features will broaden TRON usability while trying to scale competitive advantage as more user adoption occurs. To add to that Bullish outlook, TRON recently announced tthat hey have partnered with Bitget, a leading cryptocurrency exchange. That expands the TRON ecosystem while user adoption increases. All of these upgrades add value to the TRON network, which may be key catalysts towards price appreciation in TRX. Suggested trade strategy for April: – Buy zone – $0.22 – $0.23 (200 day SMA support) – Profit targets – $0.25, $0.30, $0.40 – Stop loss – $0.18 With whale activity growing and volume trending up, traders should wait on confirmation of a breakout past the $0.30 for possible upside continuation.

However, the cryptocurrency couldn’t maintain its run and quickly slumped to $83,000. It bounced off and stood primarily around $84,000 during the weekend. It finally made a move on Sunday evening that continued on Monday. At the time, the largest digital asset spiked to $88,800 for the first time in just over two weeks. The predominantly bearish momentum took its toll on this rally, and BTC failed to continue upward.

According to a recent poll by Zuban Córdoba, nearly 58% of Argentinians expressed distrust in Milei, marking a significant blow to his public image. The survey, conducted between March 12 and 14, polled 1,600 participants with a 95% confidence level. When asked, “How much do you trust Milei today?” 57.6% of respondents disapproved of him, while only 36% maintained their support. The remaining 6.4% were unsure. This was the first time Zuban Córdoba included this specific question in their poll, but broader metrics also indicate that Milei’s popularity is slipping. For instance, the president’s national management approval rating dropped from 47.3% in November to 41.6% in March. Zuban Córdoba’s report noted that public dissatisfaction with Milei’s leadership is “slowly but steadily” increasing as political scandals continue to surface. Mixed Polls Reveal Divided Sentiment Despite Zuban Córdoba’s findings, not all surveys portray Milei’s approval in freefall. A separate poll by the University of San Andrés, conducted between March 11 and 20 with 1,020 respondents, found Milei’s approval rating at 45%. Meanwhile, data from Morning Consult, collected between February 27 and March 5—after the Libra scandal emerged—showed Milei still holding a 62.4% approval rating. However, the Libra controversy has clearly impacted his credibility. Following his controversial February 14 post on X, which many interpreted as an endorsement of the Libra token, the cryptocurrency briefly soared to a $4.6 billion market cap. It soon collapsed by nearly 94%, leaving many investors in the lurch. Though Milei denied promoting the token , claiming he merely “spread the word” about it, he is now facing fraud lawsuits over the incident. LIBRA Scandal Looms Over Upcoming Election The Libra scandal adds further volatility to Argentina’s already polarized political landscape, with the next presidential election slated for October 26. Although opposition parties have called for Milei’s impeachment, their efforts have so far gained little traction. Despite the fallout, Milei’s La Libertad Avanza party remains the frontrunner for the upcoming election, with 36.7% of respondents supporting the libertarian party. The rival Unión por la Patria trails slightly behind at 32.5%. Nonetheless, public dissatisfaction with Milei’s economic policies continues to mount. Only 43% of Argentinians believe he has effectively controlled inflation, while 63% oppose his attempts to secure a new loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

With the legal uncertainty largely resolved, analysts and firms like Bitwise are weighing the possibilities for XRP's future — from a potential surge in value driven by institutional adoption and real-world asset tokenization, to more conservative or bearish scenarios if those opportunities fail to materialize. XRP ETF Optimism Surges as Ripple-SEC Legal Battle Ends, Community Bets on 2025 Approval The crypto community is abuzz with renewed optimism over the potential approval of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) for XRP, following the long-awaited conclusion of Ripple’s landmark legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). After more than three years of court proceedings, Ripple has finally emerged victorious, setting the stage for what many believe could be the next major milestone for the digital asset: the launch of an XRP ETF. On March 19, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced on X that the SEC had officially dropped its appeal in the case against the company. The lawsuit, which began in December 2020, alleged that Ripple had conducted a $1.3 billion unregistered securities offering by selling XRP tokens. The case cast a long shadow over Ripple and XRP’s potential in the US financial markets, creating legal uncertainty that hindered institutional adoption. The conclusion of the lawsuit has reignited speculation around the regulatory path forward for XRP, particularly the possibility of an ETF backed by the token. Shortly after the case was dropped, Nate Geraci, president of advisory firm ETF Store, took to X to declare that an XRP ETF now appears inevitable. Geraci, a prominent voice in the ETF industry, also speculated that financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity could be among the first asset managers to file for or manage an XRP ETF. These firms have already shown substantial interest in crypto-backed ETFs, most notably through their filings and involvement with spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF applications. If history repeats itself, XRP could be the next major crypto asset to gain ETF approval, potentially joining the ranks of Bitcoin and Ethereum in regulated investment products. The bullish sentiment around a potential XRP ETF is not limited to crypto insiders. On decentralized prediction market Polymarket , bettors are placing significant wagers on the approval of an XRP ETF by the end of 2025. As of March 26, Polymarket showed an 86% probability that the SEC will greenlight an XRP ETF before Dec. 31 of this year. However, when it comes to short-term expectations, the outlook is more reserved. Polymarket users only gave a 42% chance that the ETF would be approved before July 31, suggesting that while optimism is high for 2025, traders anticipate a slower regulatory process in the first half of the year. Despite being a gambling site, Polymarket has built a strong reputation for accurate forecasting. Data from a Dune Analytics dashboard indicates that Polymarket predictions have historically had over 90% accuracy a month prior to market resolution — giving added weight to the platform’s current odds. Price Action Muted Despite Major Win Surprisingly, XRP’s price reaction to the legal victory was relatively muted. According to Nicolai Sondergaard, a research analyst at blockchain analytics firm Nansen, the modest price action was likely due to the legal resolution already being priced in by investors. This reaction echoes broader crypto market behavior, where even significant news can often be front-run by insider speculation or reflected early in price movements. With the regulatory cloud lifting, Ripple may now be able to pursue more aggressive expansion plans in the US and abroad. The company has long argued that XRP is not a security and has advocated for clearer digital asset regulations. The case’s conclusion may now serve as a precedent in future crypto-SEC disputes, especially regarding the classification of tokens. More immediately, attention will shift to whether Ripple or a third-party asset manager files for an XRP ETF. If Geraci’s forecast is correct and firms like BlackRock or Fidelity jump into the ring, XRP could soon have the legitimacy and market access that only regulated ETFs can provide. An ETF would offer traditional investors a seamless way to gain exposure to XRP without needing to hold or manage the token directly. This could open the floodgates to institutional capital and spark a new growth cycle for XRP — especially if macro conditions and regulatory clarity continue to improve. Bitwise Predicts XRP Could Soar to $29 by 2030 in Best-Case Scenario, But Warns of Collapse to $0.13 if Adoption Fails In related news, Bitwise, a leading cryptocurrency index fund manager, has released a bold price forecast for XRP, estimating that the Ripple-affiliated token could reach an eye-watering $29.32 by the end of this decade. However, the firm also cautioned that XRP could just as easily plummet to $0.13 if the blockchain fails to secure traction in key target markets, including payments and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. The wide-ranging forecast was based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), a traditional financial valuation framework adapted to assess cryptocurrency valuations in emerging sectors like blockchain infrastructure and tokenized finance. Bitwise’s most optimistic projection envisions XRP securing a “meaningful” share of the global payments and tokenization markets. Under this “max scenario,” XRP’s market cap would balloon to $2.9 trillion by 2030 — surpassing even Microsoft’s current valuation of $2.89 trillion and making XRP one of the most valuable digital assets in history. This level of growth would require XRP to become a critical backbone for institutional-grade payments and tokenized financial instruments, potentially powering transactions across banks, central banks, fintechs, and decentralized finance ecosystems alike. In such a scenario, XRP would be priced at $29.32 — a staggering leap from its current valuation hovering below $3. Bitwise believes this outcome, while ambitious, could materialize if Ripple succeeds in expanding XRPL (XRP Ledger) adoption among major financial institutions and if tokenization becomes a core pillar of the next generation financial infrastructure. While the “max scenario” projects a massive price explosion, Bitwise’s “bull scenario” offers a more conservative yet still bullish outcome. In this case, XRP could reach $12.70 by 2030. This forecast assumes continued growth of the XRP network with steady user adoption and infrastructure improvements — but without XRP gaining dominant market share in either payments or tokenization. In other words, XRP would still thrive as a utility token with real use cases, but not become the central player in cross-border transactions or the asset tokenization boom. This scenario also requires minimal regulatory or technical setbacks, especially in maintaining the XRPL’s speed, cost-efficiency, and decentralization. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Bitwise’s bear scenario paints a grim picture: if XRP fails to penetrate the payments or tokenization industries and institutional enthusiasm for the XRPL dwindles, the token’s price could collapse to as low as $0.13 by the end of the decade. Bitwise’s outlook factors in the potential XRP ETF, which could act as a powerful catalyst for price appreciation. The firm itself filed for an XRP ETF in October and has since maintained that regulatory approval is only a matter of time. Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store and a vocal advocate for crypto ETFs, recently said that firms like BlackRock and Fidelity are likely to enter the XRP ETF race as well. This would follow their participation in the spot Bitcoin ETF market, which gained traction after the SEC approved several applications in early 2024. With the legal uncertainties largely resolved and increasing attention from major financial players, the stage could be set for a regulatory green light that ushers XRP into the ETF spotlight — a move that could significantly increase its exposure to institutional and retail investors. Tokenization: The Multi-Trillion-Dollar Opportunity Bitwise’s projections are grounded in the idea that tokenization — the conversion of real-world assets like stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities into blockchain-based digital tokens — will be a multi-trillion-dollar industry by 2030. Should XRP and the XRP Ledger become one of the key infrastructures for this tokenized financial future, the upside potential is massive. Ripple’s long-standing relationships with banks and payment providers, coupled with XRPL’s reputation for speed and low transaction fees, position it well in this emerging sector. However, competition is fierce. Ethereum, Solana, and newer tokenization-focused chains are all vying for dominance.

For anyone navigating the complex world of crypto, this roadmap is essential reading. Let’s dive into the key takeaways and explore what this means for the future of crypto in the USA. Decoding the U.S. Blockchain Roadmap: 6 Pillars for Crypto’s Future The Digital Chamber’s roadmap isn’t just a wish list; it’s a structured plan to integrate blockchain technology and digital assets into the very fabric of the U.S. economy and governance. Let’s break down the six core policy recommendations: Strengthening Financial Stability Through Digital Assets: How can digital currencies contribute to a more robust financial system? Protecting Financial Freedom and Decentralization: Why is decentralization crucial, and how can policy safeguard financial autonomy in the digital age? Leading Global Capital Markets with Regulatory Clarity: What kind of regulations are needed to position the U.S. as a leader in the global digital economy? Advancing Energy Security Through Bitcoin Mining: Can Bitcoin mining be leveraged to enhance energy independence and grid stability? Modernizing the U.S. Banking System: How can blockchain technology revolutionize traditional banking and financial services? Exploring Blockchain Applications for Government Innovation and National Security: Where can blockchain drive efficiency and security in government operations and national defense? These aren’t just abstract concepts; they are actionable areas where policy changes can unlock significant potential. Let’s delve deeper into each pillar. Navigating Cryptocurrency Regulation: Charting a Course for Clarity One of the most pressing issues in the crypto space is the lack of clear cryptocurrency regulation. The Digital Chamber’s roadmap directly addresses this, emphasizing the need for regulatory clarity to lead global capital markets . But what does this actually mean? Clear Guidelines: Businesses and innovators need well-defined rules to operate confidently within the U.S. market. Ambiguity stifles innovation and drives talent overseas. Investor Protection: Robust regulations are crucial to protect investors from scams and market manipulation, fostering trust in the digital asset ecosystem. Global Competitiveness: Proactive and sensible regulation can position the U.S. as a hub for crypto innovation, attracting investment and talent. The roadmap advocates for a balanced approach – one that encourages innovation while mitigating risks. This includes: Passing Stablecoin Legislation: Providing a clear legal framework for stablecoins, which are vital for everyday crypto transactions. Enacting Bitcoin Legislation: Establishing a legal status for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to encourage adoption and innovation. Imagine a future where crypto businesses can operate with the same legal certainty as traditional financial institutions. This roadmap aims to pave the way for that reality. Unlocking the Potential of Digital Assets: Beyond Cryptocurrency The roadmap’s scope extends beyond just cryptocurrencies to encompass the broader realm of digital assets. This is a crucial distinction. Digital assets include everything from NFTs and security tokens to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The Digital Chamber recognizes the transformative potential of these assets to: Modernize the U.S. Banking System: Blockchain technology can streamline payments, reduce transaction costs, and enhance the efficiency of financial operations. Strengthen Financial Stability: Digital assets can diversify investment portfolios and potentially offer hedges against traditional market volatility. Protect Financial Freedom and Decentralization: Digital assets offer individuals greater control over their finances and can reduce reliance on intermediaries. However, realizing these benefits requires careful consideration of policy. The roadmap emphasizes the importance of: Reforming the Federal Reserve’s Master Account Process: Ensuring fair access to the Federal Reserve system for crypto-focused financial institutions, fostering competition and innovation. Exploring Blockchain Applications for Government Innovation and National Security: Investigating how blockchain can enhance government efficiency, transparency, and security across various sectors, from supply chain management to digital identity. Think about government services becoming more efficient and transparent through blockchain. This roadmap envisions a future where blockchain is not just about finance, but about transforming how government and society function. Bitcoin Mining and US Policy: Powering the Future Responsibly The inclusion of Bitcoin mining in the roadmap might raise eyebrows for some, but it’s a strategic move. The Digital Chamber highlights the potential of advancing energy security through Bitcoin mining . How? By: Utilizing Excess Energy: Bitcoin mining can absorb excess energy from renewable sources or during off-peak hours, improving grid efficiency and reducing energy waste. Supporting Energy Infrastructure: Mining operations can incentivize investment in energy infrastructure, particularly in remote or underutilized areas. Promoting Innovation in Energy Consumption: The energy demands of Bitcoin mining are driving innovation in energy-efficient mining technologies and sustainable energy solutions. However, it’s crucial to address environmental concerns. The roadmap likely implies a focus on responsible mining practices and the use of renewable energy sources. This is about harnessing the potential of Bitcoin mining in a way that aligns with broader energy and sustainability goals. The conversation needs to shift towards sustainable Bitcoin mining, and policy can play a crucial role in incentivizing green practices. US Policy in the Digital Age: A Roadmap for Action Ultimately, the U.S. Blockchain Roadmap is a call to action. It’s a framework for policymakers to engage with the rapidly evolving world of blockchain and digital assets. The roadmap isn’t just about reacting to trends; it’s about proactively shaping the future. It emphasizes the need for US policy to be forward-thinking and adaptable to the unique challenges and opportunities presented by this technology. The key takeaways are: Proactive Engagement: Policymakers need to actively engage with the crypto industry and understand the nuances of blockchain technology. Balanced Regulation: Regulations should be carefully crafted to foster innovation while protecting consumers and maintaining financial stability. Strategic Vision: The U.S. needs a clear, long-term vision for its role in the global digital economy, and blockchain technology must be a central part of that vision. This roadmap is a significant step towards establishing the United States as a leader in the blockchain and digital asset space. It’s a framework for informed discussions, collaborative policymaking, and ultimately, a more prosperous and innovative future powered by blockchain technology. The Road Ahead: What’s Next for the Blockchain Revolution? The Digital Chamber’s U.S. Blockchain Roadmap is more than just a document; it’s a starting point. It sets the stage for crucial conversations and actions needed to integrate blockchain and digital assets into the U.S. economy. The success of this roadmap hinges on collaboration – between industry leaders, policymakers, and the public. It requires open dialogue, a willingness to learn, and a commitment to building a regulatory environment that fosters innovation and protects consumers. This roadmap offers a hopeful vision for the future of crypto in the US, a future where innovation thrives within a clear and supportive regulatory framework.

The Trump administration issued Tokyo 25% duties on car imports to the U.S. Ishiba argued that Tokyo was the largest investor in the U.S., and it made no sense to impose tariffs on all states. He also urged parliament that the country needs to consider what’s best for Japan’s national interest. Tokyo plans to put ‘all options on the table’ in response to U.S. tariffs Japan's Prime Minister says ""all options"" are on the table after US President Trump announced 25% tariffs on all auto imports, targeting the world's biggest suppliers including key Asian allies Japan and South Korea. The latest. https://t.co/09KRJXHjIB pic.twitter.com/O973YYqNWP — Kristie Lu Stout✌🏽 (@klustout) March 27, 2025 Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba acknowledged that Tokyo was ready to put “all options on the table” in tackling the Trump administration’s heightened trade policies. U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday imposed a 25% tariff on imported cars and light trucks from Japan to the U.S. starting next week. “Japan is a country that is making the largest amount of investment to the United States, so we wonder if it makes sense for (Washington) to apply uniform tariffs to all countries. That is a point we’ve been making and will continue to do so.” – Shigeru Ishiba, the Prime Minister of Japan The President of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) revealed that the country was “putting all options on the table” in considering the most effective response. He did not specify the possible steps Tokyo may take in combating Washington’s trade policies. Data from the Ministry of Finance revealed that automobiles made up 28.3% of Japan’s total exports to the United States in 2024, the biggest ratio among all items. The data also showed that the auto industry makes up around 3% of Japan’s gross domestic product (GDP). Tokyo’s auto industry has been the driver of recent wage hikes in the country, as automakers distribute the huge profits they reaped overseas to their employees. Executive economist at Nomura Research Institute (NRI) Takahide Kiuchi believes that a 25% increase in U.S. auto tariffs will push down Japan’s GDP by roughly 0.2%. Kiuchi maintained that “the Trump tariff has the potential to immediately push Japan’s economy into deterioration. Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s largest carmaker by delivery, plummeted by 4% in Tokyo, while Honda Motor Co. sank as much as 3%. Nissan Motor Co. lost about 3.5%, while Mazda Motor Corp retreated by more than 5% after Trump’s tariff announcement. Automakers also performed the worst on the Topix Transportation Equipment index since automobiles and auto parts account for more than a third of Japan’s export products. The tariffs on automakers might lead to higher car prices for U.S. consumers, about half of whose purchases come from abroad. President and CEO of Autos Drive America Jennifer Safavian argued that “The tariffs imposed today will make it more expensive to produce and sell cars in the United States, ultimately leading to higher prices, fewer options for consumers, and fewer manufacturing jobs in the U.S. Trump ramps up trade war with 25% tariffs on automobiles *TRUMP ANNOUNCES 25% AUTO TARIFFS ON ALL CARS NOT MADE IN US Look on the bright side. If your Toyota Camry costs 25% more, maybe Japan will finally be incentivized to secure our southern border. — Spencer Hakimian (@SpencerHakimian) March 26, 2025 United States President Donald Trump imposed a 25 per cent tariff on imported cars and car parts. He said at the Oval Office on Wednesday that tariffs would “take back” money from foreign countries that have been “taking our jobs” and “taking our health.” The President pledged to revive manufacturing in the U.S. and argued that tariffs would “spur growth like you haven’t seen before.” Trump also mentioned in a fact sheet that the tariffs set to take effect on April 2 would “protect and strengthen” the U.S. auto industry. He also argued that the industry had been undermined by excessive imports that threatened America’s domestic industrial base and supply chains. Trump highlighted that foreign automobile industries, bolstered by unfair subsidies and aggressive industrial policies, had expanded while U.S. production remained stagnant. He also suggested that importers bringing in vehicles and parts under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement would have the chance to certify what portion of their products are U.S.-made so that they only pay the tariff on “non-U.S. content.” President of the European Union Ursula von der Leyen said , “Tariffs are taxes – bad for business, worse for consumers, in the U.S. and the EU.” Leyen also maintained that the EU will continue to seek negotiated solutions while safeguarding its economic interests.

After the recent market manipulation incident on Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) involving the Jelly Jelly (JELLY) token, the derivatives exchange decided to delist JELLY and reimburse affected users. Shortly after, Binance listed JELLY futures, followed by OKX . This was likely a move to seize the opportunity created by the token’s extreme price swing, which made it highly attractive for speculative trading. On March 26, the price of JELLY spiked from around $0.0095, where the exploiter opened his short position, to a high of $.0.050, marking approximately 426% increase. Given that high volatility drives trading volume, both exchanges stand to profit considerably from trading fees on JELLY perps. Source: Arkham Intelligence’s X However, some believe Binance and OKX’s move isn’t just about potential profit from fees, but also about wiping the competitor. One user even called it a “pure move to try and bury a competitor,” comparing it to Binance’s alleged role in FTX’s collapse, adding it “rewrites the history of what happened to FTX.” Interestingly, blockchain investigator ZachXBT pointed out that the two accounts linked to the manipulation 0x20e8 and 0x67f were funded via Binance. Source: @zachxbt Meanwhile, the price of JELLY has retraced to $0.020, according to CoinGecko .

The total amounted to $7.17M. Hyperliquid just got exploited. What happened? A trader deposited $7.167M on 3 separate Hyperliquid accounts within 5 minutes of each other. He then made leveraged trades on an illiquid coin, JELLYJELLY. However, he ended up losing money, and is down almost $1M unless… pic.twitter.com/uNyMwLS5Sc — Arkham (@arkham) March 26, 2025 Then, the trader aggressively bought JELLY on decentralized exchanges. Since liquidity on DEXes is low, their buying activity quickly drove JELLY price up. After the token’s price increased by over 400%, the $4.1 million short position was supposed to be liquidated. However, the liquidation was too large to be executed immediately, so it was transferred to HyperLiquid’s automated market-making vault , the Hyperliquidity Provider. At the same time, the trader quickly withdrew funds from their other two accounts with unrealized profit from the JELLY 400%+ price increase as a result of their DEX buying activity. According to Arkham, the trader managed to withdraw $6.26 million, with ~$900K still remaining in the accounts. At this point, HyperLiquid caught on to what was happening and restricted the trader’s accounts to reduce-only mode, freezing their ability to withdraw funds. With withdrawals blocked, the trader then started selling JELLY on the market. This selling helped them recover some of the funds, but it didn’t fully salvage their position because HyperLiquid then closed the market at $0.0095, the same price at which they opened their short trade. As a result, all floating PnL on the first two accounts were wiped. According to Abhi, founder of Web3 company AP Collective, said that if Hyperliquid didn’t close the position, it would’ve faced full liquidation if JELLY reached $150M market cap. After the incident, Hyperliquid’s decided to delist JELLY perpetuals. The decision was made by a consensus between Hyperliquid’s validators, sparking outrage from crypto community due to centralization concerns. Arthur Hayer said that HyperLiquid clearly wasn’t able to handle the situation with JELLY and that it’s time to stop pretending that HyperLiquid is a decentralized platform. $HYPE can’t handle the $JELLY Let’s stop pretending hyperliquid is decentralised And then stop pretending traders actually give a fuck Bet you $HYPE is back where is started in short order cause degens gonna degen — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) March 26, 2025 Echoing his sentiment, Bitget CEO Gracy Chen commented : “The decision to close the $JELLY market and force settlement of positions at a favorable price sets a dangerous precedent,” Chen said. “Trust—not capital—is the foundation of any exchange and once lost, it’s almost impossible to recover.” You might also like: Bitget CEO says Hyperliquid could become FTX 2.0 amid JELLY incident",News|Derivatives|fraud|Meme Coin,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|TRADING|MARKET|BNB|ZRX,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-03-27 10:00:44

XRP displays a bearish divergence on its 3-day chart, suggesting significant price jumps are unlikely soon. Conversely, SOL is positioning for a rebound from its recent decline, facing an initial resistance at $136.03. The BlockDAG (BDAG) community’s enthusiasm is sky-high as the much-awaited Keynote 3 draws near. The network’s presale has exploded beyond $207 million, driven by a spike in purchases, with participants anticipating pivotal updates from the event that could catalyze a dramatic price surge! XRP Price Analysis: Bearish Divergence Suggests Caution XRP price analysis reveals a bearish divergence on the 3-day chart, hinting that substantial upward trends may not be on the horizon. Currently, it’s testing the support zone between $2.25 and $2.30. A recovery from this range might push the price towards $2.65 to $2.80, though encountering resistance at $2.50 may hinder progress. Should the price dip below $2.25, it could fall to between $1.95 and $2.05. Presently, XRP price analysis indicates a lateral trading pattern, with short-term movements remaining unpredictable and no immediate signs of a breakout. Solana (SOL) Technical Outlook: Is a Recovery in Sight? Over the last day, Solana has seen a decline of 4.97%, but SOL’s technical outlook now suggests a potential rebound. Starting at $135.3, SOL dropped to $128.90 and briefly plummeted to $125.38, yet there are emerging indicators of an upward trend. Immediate resistance is found at $136.03, with subsequent levels at $152.77 and $178.63. Support lies at $125.38, extending to $113.18 and $110.6. If SOL manages to surpass the $136.03 resistance, it might climb 10.49%, potentially reaching $139.66 in the upcoming month. Countdown to BlockDAG Keynote 3: Presale Rockets to $207M! With just few hours until BlockDAG’s Keynote 3, the buzz within the community is skyrocketing. Anticipation is building with the 2025 mainnet debut in sight, featuring contributions from a renowned Hollywood producer. The event is expected to unveil new features, provide exclusive advantages for early adopters, and share deeper insights into BlockDAG’s ambitious growth plans. The fervor is mirrored in the ongoing presale of BlockDAG, having amassed $207 million with over 18.9 billion coins snapped up. Analysts are optimistic, forecasting a surge in BDAG’s value to $1 by 2025—a staggering potential return of 3932%. This surge in interest suggests BDAG could be a top contender for the best crypto for 2025, as enthusiasts rush to acquire coins before the keynote, hoping the revelations will boost BDAG’s market price. Past keynotes have significantly shaped BlockDAG’s trajectory, boosting its global profile. The imminent Keynote 3 is poised to amplify this impact, potentially accelerating the journey towards a $600 million target. With Batch 27 nearing sell-out, those keen on capitalizing on the current rates need to move quickly. Seize the Top Crypto Pick of 2025 Before It’s Gone! XRP’s price analysis indicates a static trend, with resistance capping gains at $2.50, while Solana’s (SOL) technical outlook suggests a possible uplift, with a breakthrough above $136.03 potentially yielding a 10.49% increase. Yet, for those targeting the best crypto for 2025 , BlockDAG emerges as a frontrunner with projections hitting $1. Currently valued at $0.0248 in batch 27, the potential for a 3932% return is massive. With Keynote 3 on the horizon, BlockDAG is poised to draw even greater attention, potentially fast-tracking it to meet its ambitious $600 million presale goal.

However, an official statement from Binance is still missing, so the situation remains unclear. The Reports and the Confusion Reports say that Binance has explained its decision not to list Pi Coin due to several reasons. These include Pi Network still being too centralized and not having an open mainnet. Binance has stated that Pi Coin can only be listed once these issues are fixed, with decentralization and an open mainnet being key to the process. Pi Coin fans and investors have quickly reacted on social media, saying that the reports are false. Many believe that Binance’s claims about the mainnet being closed are incorrect. “The mainnet is open! It launched on February 20,” one Pi Coin supporter pointed out.” Some people argue that because Binance hasn’t officially confirmed anything, this news may just be a rumor. “There’s no official statement from Binance saying they rejected Pi Coin, so that shows there might not be any truth to the reports,” one person said. What’s Going on with Pi Network? Pi Network officially launched its open mainnet on February 20, 2025, promising better decentralization and infrastructure. The Pi Network community has been working hard to grow and improve its platform, but there are still challenges ahead, such as getting more recognition and liquidity. Without an official statement from Binance, no one knows for sure whether Pi Coin will be listed. Some are hopeful that Binance will eventually recognize Pi Coin’s progress, while others remain skeptical. If Binance really has rejected Pi Coin, it could be a big setback for the project. On the other hand, if Binance is just waiting for more progress, Pi Coin’s supporters might still have hope. At press time, Pi coin has gained more than 3% and is trading at $0.84.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BNB|EXCHANGE|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-27 10:01:43

A new era begins : the stablecoin multiverse. Hundreds of companies and governments are launching (or will soon) their stablecoins. I'm very proud to see such massive adoption of a technology that Tether created back in 2014 🙏 Good luck everyone ♥️ — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) March 27, 2025 Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer with USDT’s market capitalization exceeding $144.1 billion, continues expanding across emerging markets and multiple blockchains, what Ardoino described as part of a broader trend, calling it “the stablecoin multiverse” and noting that “hundreds of companies and governments are launching (or will soon) their stablecoins.” The Tether CEO attributed the company’s growth to its focus on grassroots adoption, suggesting the company has taken a different approach from traditional financial institutions. “We always focused on the adoption from the ground up, working in the streets, among other people, while traditional finance was watching at us from their ivory towers.” Paolo Ardoino You might also like: Wyoming to launch first state-issued stablecoin on LayerZero by July Ardoino didn’t provide details on how Tether calculated its user estimates or how soon the company expects to reach the 1 billion mark. However, the stablecoin issuer has seen its expansion growing rapidly, particularly across networks like TRON, Ethereum, and other chains. In October 2024, Tether reported 350 million users, suggesting that the latest figure represents an approximate 14% increase in less than six months. Still, competition in the stablecoin market is heating up, with Tether’s main rival Circle continuing to strengthen its presence in Asia. Meanwhile, Tether is focusing on diversifying its investment portfolio. As crypto.news reported earlier, the stablecoin issuer is preparing to acquire a 30% stake in Be Water, a broadcast media company based in Rome, Italy.

Imagine earning yields not just from the potential price appreciation of Bitcoin, but also from traditional financial instruments like U.S. Treasuries. Avalon Labs, the innovative force behind the BTC-backed stablecoin USDa, is making this a reality by supporting BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). This strategic move promises to redefine how you can grow your Bitcoin holdings. Let’s dive into how this integration is set to create a revolutionary Bitcoin yield opportunity. Unlocking Enhanced Bitcoin Yield with Real World Assets (RWA) Avalon Labs has officially announced its support for BlackRock’s BUIDL fund via the Securitize platform. This isn’t just another partnership; it’s a significant leap towards bridging the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets. By integrating with BUIDL, Avalon Labs is injecting real-world asset (RWA) yields into its yield-bearing Bitcoin stablecoin, sUSDa. But what does this actually mean for you, the Bitcoin enthusiast? Essentially, holding sUSDa now becomes even more lucrative. It’s no longer just about the inherent potential of Bitcoin; it’s about earning a dual yield. Let’s break down the magic: BTC On-Chain Yield: sUSDa, being Bitcoin-backed, inherently participates in the on-chain yield opportunities within the Bitcoin ecosystem. RWA Yield from U.S. Treasuries: Through the integration with BlackRock’s BUIDL, sUSDa holders gain exposure to the yields generated from U.S. Treasury bills, brought into the digital realm. This combination creates a powerful “dual-yield engine,” offering a compounded return that traditional Bitcoin holding simply can’t match. For those looking to maximize their Bitcoin’s earning potential, this is a game-changer. Why is RWA Tokenization and BUIDL a Big Deal? The concept of Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization is gaining massive traction, and for good reason. It’s about bringing tangible assets from the traditional financial system onto the blockchain, unlocking new levels of efficiency, accessibility, and yield generation. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund is a prime example of this in action. Consider these benefits of RWA tokenization and BUIDL: Access to Institutional Grade Yields: BUIDL provides access to yields from high-quality assets like U.S. Treasury bills, typically reserved for institutional investors. Now, through sUSDa, even individual Bitcoin holders can tap into these yields. Increased Transparency and Efficiency: Blockchain technology inherently brings transparency and efficiency. Tokenizing RWAs on platforms like Securitize enhances these aspects, making transactions and ownership more streamlined. Diversification of Yield Sources: Relying solely on crypto-native yields can be volatile. RWA tokenization diversifies yield sources, potentially offering more stable and predictable returns, especially from assets like U.S. Treasuries. Bridging TradFi and DeFi: Initiatives like BUIDL are crucial in bridging the gap between Traditional Finance (TradFi) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi). This integration can lead to greater adoption and innovation across both sectors. BlackRock’s entry into the RWA tokenization space with BUIDL is a strong validation of the technology’s potential. Avalon Labs supporting this initiative further solidifies the narrative that RWAs are not just a fleeting trend but a fundamental evolution in finance. Stablecoin Yield: sUSDa Leading the Charge In the competitive world of stablecoins, finding an edge is crucial. sUSDa is differentiating itself by not just being pegged to the US dollar, but by actively seeking to provide superior yield opportunities for its holders. The integration with BlackRock’s BUIDL is a testament to this commitment to enhance stablecoin yield . Here’s what makes sUSDa stand out in the stablecoin landscape: Feature sUSDa Typical Stablecoin Yield Source Dual: BTC On-Chain + U.S. Treasury RWA Primarily Lending/Staking within Crypto Ecosystem Asset Backing Bitcoin (BTC) Fiat Reserves, Cash Equivalents, Commercial Paper Yield Stability Potentially more stable due to diversification with U.S. Treasuries Subject to crypto market volatility Risk Profile Combines crypto and traditional finance risks Primarily crypto-native risks By offering exposure to U.S. Treasury yields, sUSDa is aiming to provide a more robust and potentially less volatile yield compared to stablecoins relying solely on crypto-native yield strategies. This approach could attract a broader range of users, including those traditionally hesitant about the risks associated with purely crypto-based yields. Avalon Labs USDa: A Smart Move for Bitcoin Holders? Is integrating with BlackRock BUIDL a smart move for Avalon Labs and USDa? Absolutely. For Bitcoin holders, the benefits are clear. Avalon Labs USDa is positioning itself as a forward-thinking stablecoin project that understands the evolving needs of the crypto investor. Here’s why this integration makes strategic sense: Attracting More BTC Holders: The promise of enhanced yield through RWA exposure is a powerful incentive to attract Bitcoin holders to the sUSDa ecosystem. Increasing sUSDa Utility: Beyond just being a stable store of value, sUSDa is becoming a yield-generating asset, significantly increasing its utility within the crypto space. Strengthening Avalon Labs’ Position: By partnering with a financial giant like BlackRock and utilizing a platform like Securitize, Avalon Labs is bolstering its credibility and market position. Pioneering Innovation: This integration showcases Avalon Labs as a pioneer in exploring innovative yield generation strategies within the crypto market, specifically by leveraging RWAs. For Bitcoin holders seeking to maximize their returns without necessarily selling their BTC, sUSDa presents a compelling option. It’s about making your Bitcoin work harder for you, tapping into both the crypto and traditional finance yield landscapes. Navigating the Landscape of Tokenization and Yield Opportunities While the integration of BlackRock’s BUIDL into sUSDa presents exciting opportunities, it’s crucial to navigate the landscape with awareness. RWA tokenization and yield-bearing stablecoins are still relatively nascent areas, and understanding the nuances is key. Consider these points as you explore these opportunities: Risk Assessment: While U.S. Treasuries are considered low-risk, understanding the overall risk profile of sUSDa, including smart contract risks and the mechanics of yield generation, is essential. Platform Due Diligence: Securitize is a reputable platform for digital securities, but always conduct your own due diligence on any platform you use for interacting with digital assets. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory landscape for digital assets and RWAs is still evolving. Staying informed about any regulatory changes that could impact these assets is important. Yield Sustainability: Understand the factors that drive the yields generated by BUIDL and sUSDa. While U.S. Treasury yields are generally stable, market conditions can still influence overall returns. Education and informed decision-making are paramount in the rapidly evolving world of crypto and tokenized assets. As always, “do your own research” (DYOR) before diving into any new investment opportunity. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards the Future of Bitcoin Yield Avalon Labs’ support for BlackRock’s BUIDL and the integration of RWA yields into sUSDa marks a significant milestone in the crypto space. It’s a bold step towards creating more sophisticated and diversified yield opportunities for Bitcoin holders. By bridging the gap between Bitcoin and traditional finance through stablecoin yield innovation and RWA tokenization, Avalon Labs is paving the way for a more interconnected and potentially more rewarding financial future. This move is not just about yield; it’s about showcasing the evolving utility of Bitcoin and the transformative power of blockchain technology in reshaping the financial landscape. Keep an eye on sUSDa – it might just redefine how you think about earning yield on your Bitcoin.
