Technical indicators suggest that SHIB could embark on a massive rally once this breakout occurs, as analysis predicts a price surge of over 250% in the coming months. Shiba Inu Price Gears Up For 250% Rally Shiba Inu (SHIB), the second-largest meme cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is showing signs of a potential breakout to the upside. A crypto analyst identified as Rose Premium Signals on X (formerly Twitter) highlighted that SHIB is currently retesting the perfect accumulation zone, representing a crucial support level that historically acts as a launchpad for a price rally. The analyst predicts that Shiba Inu is set for a 250% price surge to new highs. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Gearing Up To Fly After Lows, Here’s The Target After experiencing months of decline and volatility, the price formed a unique technical pattern called a Falling Wedge. This pattern is a classic bullish reversal signal that forms when there is a downward trend in a cryptocurrency’s price action. Considering that Shiba Inu has recorded multiple price crashes to new lows, the emergence of this pattern breathes optimism into the meme coin’s future outlook. Rose Premium Signals has shared a price chart, providing a clearer view of this technical pattern. The chart shows that SHIB is nearing the apex of its Falling Wedge pattern and is on the verge of a breakout. A successful breakout from this bullish pattern could trigger a sharp upward movement, propelling the Shiba Inu price by 250% towards key resistance levels at $0.00002913, $0.00003612, and ultimately $0.00004401. This final price target represents a staggering 251% increase from Shiba Inu’s current market value. The analyst has set a timeline for his optimistic prediction, forecasting that Shiba Inu will hit a price peak of $0.00004401 in the next 77 days, around April 29, 2025. On a side note, Rose Premium Signals expects a breakdown in the Shiba Inu price before this projected rally. The analyst predicts that Shiba Inu could decline and hit a final price low of $0.00001299 before it embarks on its surge to $0.00004401. This price crash is expected to occur around March 2025. If this bearish projection holds, it may present a prime buying opportunity for investors aiming to capitalize on the analyst’s 250% SHIB price rally forecast. TD Sequential Flashes Buy Signal For SHIB According to data from CoinMarketCap, the SHIB price is currently trading at $0.000015, recording declines of over 3.9% in the last 24 hours and 23.8% over the past month. While the meme coin still faces bearish pressure, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has revealed that Shiba Inu’s TD Sequential indicator has flashed a buy signal on the weekly chart.

A regulated fund tied to Dogecoin could bring unprecedented inflows, pushing the meme coin toward mainstream adoption. Yet, as the market braces for this possibility, an unexpected beneficiary has emerged: RCO Finance. Analysts suggest that RCO Finance might witness a massive 44,000% surge if a Dogecoin ETF is approved. Can a coin, once dismissed as a mere internet joke become the catalyst for another DeFi breakthrough? The Rising Promise of a Dogecoin ETF An exchange-traded fund pegged to Dogecoin could dramatically reshape perceptions about this once-whimsical asset. Dogecoin soared on viral social media buzz in previous cycles, attracting celebrity endorsements and millions of new investors. But a Dogecoin ETF would mark a significant step up, giving more conservative investors an avenue to own Dogecoin through regulated channels without wrestling with private wallets or unregulated exchanges. Critics question whether a Dogecoin ETF can tame the meme-based volatility that defines this coin. Nonetheless, market history shows that ETFs often serve as gateways for mainstream capital. Even skeptics acknowledge that approval could funnel billions in fresh liquidity into Dogecoin, creating a tide that lifts other innovative platforms. If the hype surrounding a Dogecoin ETF matches early bitcoin ETF mania, the ripple effects could be enormous, impacting a broad swath of crypto assets, including those like RCO Finance offering more than just speculative value. Dogecoin’s Continued Magnetism Although Dogecoin started as a joke, it matured into a digital asset with a market cap in the billions of dollars. It briefly traded at $0.74 at its peak, turning many early holders into overnight millionaires. Even when the hype simmered, Dogecoin remained a staple of crypto discussions, thanks to its loyal community and frequent cameos in mainstream media. The possibility of a Dogecoin ETF amplifies the coin’s attraction. Investors who missed out on the original rally might jump in, hoping to see Dogecoin replicate its meteoric run. Others who once viewed it as a meme might consider if they can invest via traditional brokerage accounts. This influx of attention could revitalize Dogecoin’s price movement—and, by extension, create fertile ground for DeFi projects aligned with market expansion. Yet, Dogecoin is not alone in seizing this moment. As the spotlight intensifies, many traders scout for platforms bridging the gap between crypto speculation and real-world utility. This is where RCO Finance stands ready to captivate a wider audience, especially those who demand more comprehensive functionality than what meme coins typically deliver. RCO Finance: Bridging Assets and AI-Driven Insights With its token priced at $0.1 and over $13 million raised, RCO Finance has rapidly positioned itself as a next-generation DeFi hub. As a non-KYC platform, it lets users buy stocks, bonds, real estate, and cryptocurrencies under one roof, bypassing the hassle of converting to fiat. This practical approach to asset diversification sets RCO Finance apart from projects reliant solely on speculative momentum. Central to RCO Finance is the Robo Advisor, an AI-powered tool that aggregates signals from Bloomberg, Reuters, and on-chain analytics. Beyond spotting breakout tokens, it helps mitigate risk by indicating optimal times to take profits or reduce exposure. Imagine detecting a lesser-known coin like TRUMP, which soared by 646%—the Robo Advisor could have flagged such an opportunity well before social media chatter kicked in. Moreover, the Beta Platform allows hands-on experience with advanced features, including high-leverage trading and automated staking. Credibility is further strengthened by a SolidProof audit confirming robust smart contracts. RCO Finance offers a more grounded alternative to meme-driven runs by combining transparency, AI insights, and cross-asset transactions. Should a Dogecoin ETF pour new life into the broader crypto market, this utility-focused approach may attract an influx of capital seeking sustainable gains. 44,000% Surge: Why RCO Finance Could Ride the Dogecoin ETF Wave Historically, altcoins that delivered four- or five-digit returns found success by addressing untapped market needs. RCO Finance’s blend of AI technology, non-KYC onboarding, and multi-asset integration speaks to a maturing audience. As capital moves beyond meme coins in search of stable yet potent growth, the platform’s data-driven ecosystem could become a magnet for both institutional and retail players. Of course, even the best forecasts are not guaranteed, and crypto remains a high-risk space. Nonetheless, the synergy of a Dogecoin ETF rally and a platform like RCO Finance suggests the potential for an explosive 2025. If memes have taught us anything, timing and sentiment can spark a wildfire of investment—but projects offering tangible solutions often sustain that momentum, transforming initial hype into lasting relevance.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, the development team behind Ondo Finance says it’s collaborating with World Liberty Financial (WLFI) as a means of bringing traditional finance to the world of blockchains. According to Ondo, WLFI is adding Ondo’s tokenized assets – such as the stablecoin Ondo US Dollar Yield ( USDY ) and the Ondo Short-Term US Treasuries Fund ( OUSG ) – into its network as treasury reserve assets. Furthermore, WLFI is planning on integrating USDY, OUSG and other tokenized securities from Ondo’s upcoming global markets into its network as a means of enabling seamless borrowing, lending, and margin trading for eligible customers. “Through this collaboration, World Liberty Financial plans to become a strategic collaborator in Ondo’s journey to scale Ondo Global Markets, a platform designed to enable the tokenization of traditional financial assets like stocks and bonds.” As stated by Donald Trump Jr., the “Web3 Ambassador” at WLFI, “Our collaboration with Ondo Finance marks a significant step forward in aligning traditional financial systems with blockchain innovation. By integrating Ondo’s tokenized assets, we’re providing our network with access to traditional financial assets and new yield opportunities.” Current data from blockchain intelligence firm Arkham shows that WLFI currently holds about $465,000 worth of ONDO. ONDO is trading for $1.37 at time of writing, a 1.6% increase during the last 24 hours.

See what he actually said,https://crypto.news/saylor-is-going-to-burn-his-private-keys-as-he-dies/,"On Feb. 9, 2025, Cointelegraph published a clip of a January interview with Strategy chair Michael Saylor on Fox. According to the caption, in the video, Saylor hints he is going to burn his BTC keys as he dies to ensure the coins will never be sold. Let’s see what Saylor said, is there a hint, and what is the purpose of burning the keys. Several media channels reposted the clip from Cointelegraph, with various headlines, from which one could conclude the Strategy exec is indeed going to pull his stashes into the grave as he dies. However, that’s not what he said in the clip. 🚨 FOX BUSINESS: Michael Saylor hints that after his death, his Bitcoin keys will be destroyed, ensuring his BTC is never sold—calling it a “pro rata contribution” to all Bitcoin holders. pic.twitter.com/RhGgfIuvlq — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) February 9, 2025 In the video, Saylor says that it would be good for someone who has a lot of bitcoins to burn the keys to make a “pro rata contribution” to all the BTC holders across the world “based on their contribution and their knowledge of Bitcoin.” The idea is simple – due to the deflationary nature of Bitcoin, as a large amount of BTC leaves the circulation forever, the remaining bitcoins get more valuable. It means that the rest of the BTC holders may get richer as a result of the move. In this regard, Saylor’s idea is similar to Donald Trump’s urge not to sell bitcoins and accumulate them strategically. Various proposals for Bitcoin reserves have a clause forbidding the sale of BTC for years in order to ensure market stability and consistent demand. Although Saylor is definitely a person who accumulated much BTC, the way he put his idea doesn’t oblige him to follow the script he described. He didn’t add a single word that could be seen as a hint that he himself is going to lock his bitcoins forever. Rather, he shared the idea with others. And yes, there is a chance that Saylor is considering doing something like this. However, Saylor can come up with another decision in the future. He concluded that he sees himself as a person who took Satoshi’s torch and continues to commercialize Bitcoin with corporations and governments. How good is this idea? At least, the idea correlates with the vision of Satoshi Nakamoto, who created Bitcoin scarcity on purpose. When Saylor speaks about how great Bitcoin is, he often emphasizes its scarcity as the prime driver of its price. During the PBD Podcast episode in 2024, he said that he could create more real estate in New York City, create more watches, create more gold (sic!), and any kind of commodity if he had enough time and money. But Bitcoin has an absolute cap which is 21 million, said Saylor. As the commodity price goes up, the producers are incentivized to produce more, which is not the case with Bitcoin. That’s why Bitcoin is a great store of value, according to Saylor. He claims that the American dollar will be de facto-backed by Bitcoin as soon as the government starts to invest in it. In Saylor’s opinion, this will make the dollar more powerful, not less, as some experts warn. The reason is the same–as long as the country owns a huge chunk of the world’s BTC, its national currency will be strong. Nevertheless, it’s worth noting that scarcity drives the value of Bitcoin as long as demand for BTC stays strong. Let’s say someone draws a self-portrait, creating an extremely scarce item. Will it be extremely valuable? Not necessarily. Bitcoin is driven by demand. The growing scarcity of the asset boosts the demand further, increasing the urge of multiple entities (including corporations and governments) to acquire some. Let’s say someone with 450,000 BTC (an approximate amount in Saylor’s control as of January 2025) dies before the 2028 Bitcoin halving. In the 2024–2028 cycle, 450 BTC is produced every day. So, removing 450k bitcoins from circulation in one day eliminates the result of almost three years of mining between 2024 and 2028 or nearly everything that will be mined between 2028 and 2033. Some even compare this probable case to halving. However, unlike halving, a whale burning the keys is a different case. First off, unlike halving, it decreases the amount in circulation and second, it doesn’t involve miners having to raise BTC prices to keep mining profitability. However, the BTC buyers will have to compete for much fewer remaining bitcoins, which is a good climate for price growth. Generally, it seems that Saylor is right about the possible effect of such a move. However, there are some factors that may play his “plan” around. The future of lost bitcoins As of February 2025, over three million of the 20 million bitcoins that are already mined are considered “lost” due to forgotten or lost keys, coins sent to wrong addresses, and other reasons. According to other estimations, there are over 6 million lost bitcoins out there. You might also like: Nearly one-third of Bitcoin’s circulating supply possibly lost: report Although so many lost coins make Bitcoin even scarcer, the fate of these coins is not that conclusive. The very concept of a 21 million hard cap is not something unchangeable. The same mechanism that is used to improve the Bitcoin network can change the total supply of bitcoins or remove it altogether. This possibly was mentioned in an educational video on Bitcoin released by BlackRock, a company that has the largest amount of BTC. This unorthodox fact was met with anger and disapproval from the community, however, it doesn’t change the very fact that the hard cap can be changed if enough miners see this idea favorably, for any reason. If the hard cap goes away or the total supply increases, the value of lost bitcoins may drop and Saylor’s vision turns out to be false. Another concern is quantum computers. Quantum computers are one of the concerning technologies that are expected to drastically change the game as soon as they enter the scope. Quantum computers will be able to recover all lost coins, including Satoshi's if he's no longer living. Saylor better come up with a better plan than burying his keys with him. — LiveLifeWellNC (@30flygirl1) February 9, 2025 Their computational abilities may be strong enough to break BTC wallets. The Bitcoin community is preparing to prevent this but the outcome is not known as of now. There is a possibility that “lost” bitcoins will be freed or stolen via quantum computers.

Wainwright & Co. analyst Mike Colonnese Crypto exchange Coinbase is expected to report Q4 revenue of $1.911 billion in the first quarter, Colonnese said in a research note. This would imply upside potential compared to the Street’s consensus estimate of $1.8 billion. Coinbase is also expected to earn $2.21 per share in the quarter which is also ahead of the Street’s $2.16 per share estimate. ‘Strong tailwinds’ Colonnese noted that “strong tailwinds” in the fourth quarter contributed to better than expected results. Bitcoin ( BTC ) crossed $90,000 for the first time in history after Donald Trump’s election victory “proved to be a shot in the arm for the crypto industry,” the analyst wrote. BTC rallied hard and hit a new all-time high of $106,000 in mid-December, highlighting strong investor demand. Ethereum ( ETH ) also posted strong gains during the 4th quarter, rising 28% q/q to $3,330.

Coinbase to benefit from ongoing momentum According to the analyst, Coinbase is positioned to benefit from ongoing momentum.

Colonnese is also modeling Coinbase to earn $8.29 per share for the full-year 2025, up from a prior estimate of $2.77 per share.

Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said about the filing, “assuming this is acknowledged by the SEC (I'd probably make that assumption right now but you never know),” an SEC decision would be required by the end of October.

The video features an AI-generated version of the 40-year-old Hollywood actress alongside over a dozen other popular Jewish A-listers appearing to oppose rapper Kanye West’s recent antisemitic outburst on X. Scarlett Johansson denounces AI misuse Johansson is shown wearing a white T-shirt with an image of a hand flipping its middle finger. West, now Ye, went on a rant against Jews last weekend and even started selling Swastika T-shirts on his website. “It has been brought to my attention by family members and friends that an AI-generated video featuring my likeness…has been circulating online and gaining traction,” Johansson told People on Wednesday. “I am a Jewish woman who has no tolerance for antisemitism or hate speech of any kind. But I also firmly believe that the potential for hate speech multiplied by AI is a far greater threat than any one person who takes accountability for it. We must call out the misuse of AI, no matter its messaging, or we risk losing a hold on reality.” The video clip – reportedly created by Israeli generative AI expert Ori Bejerano, also features 20 AI versions of stars including Adam Sandler, Mila Kunis, Drake, Jerry Seinfeld, Steven Spielberg, Mark Zuckerberg, Sacha Baron Cohen, Jack Black, Lenny Kravitz, Ben Stiller, and David Schwimmer. In the video, the stars are wearing white T-shirts with the middle finger flipped off and a Star of David in the middle of the hand with Kanye’s name below it. In the end, the video declares that “Enough is Enough” and urges viewers to “Join the Fight Against Antisemitism”. In her statement, Johansson lamented how she has been “a very public victim of artificial intelligence”. But she also warned that the “threat of AI affects each and every one of us.” “There is a 1000-foot wave coming regarding AI that several progressive countries, not including the United States, have responded to in a responsible manner,” she detailed. “I urge the US government to make the passing of legislation limiting AI use a top priority; it is a bipartisan issue that enormously affects the immediate future of humanity at large.” Johansson. Johansson also said it was worrisome to note that the US government is “paralyzed when it comes to passing legislation that protects all of its citizens against the imminent dangers of AI.” The star has been caught up in AI controversy before This is not the first time that the “Fly Me to the Moon” star has had to deal with AI stealing her likeness. In May 2024, she criticized OpenAI after it emerged that the ChatGPT voice, Sky, resembled Johansson’s. OpenAI said Sky’s voice was “not an imitation of Johansson” but went on to suspend the voice anyway. And in November 2023, Johansson threatened to sue a company that used her likeness to create an advert. “The video included images produced by Lisa AI. It has nothing to do with this person,” the company denied the allegations. While Johansson is the only star in the fake video to speak against the Kanye West sentiments, other stars have previously aired their concerns. For instance, over the weekend before his Super Bowl ad aired, “Friends” actor David Schwimmer begged Elon Musk to block Kanye from X. “We can’t stop a deranged bigot from spewing hate-filled, ignorant bile… but we CAN stop giving him a megaphone, Mr. Musk,” Schwimmer wrote on Instagram . “Kanye West has 32.7 million followers on your platform, X. That’s twice as many people than the number of Jews in existence. His sick hate speech results in REAL LIFE violence against Jews,” added Schwimmer. According to CNN , Kanye West deactivated his X account on Sunday. An organization that works to combat Jewish hate and misinformation across social media Tel Aviv Institute co-founder Hen Mazzig commented on the AI video. “Misusing AI is dangerous, no doubt,” Mazzig wrote on X . “But you know what’s even more dangerous? Unchecked antisemitic hate being platformed to millions every single day.” Cryptopolitan Academy: FREE Web3 Resume Cheat Sheet - Download Now",AI,EN,0,0,REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-12 23:29:37

With these low costs, Adobe aims to compete with other AI startups like OpenAI and integrate artificial intelligence into its creative software package. Generate Video is available in public beta, following a limited early access testing period last year. The beta tool can be accessed via the redesigned Firefly web app, alongside new image generation and translation capabilities and AI credit subscription tiers for creators. Adobe added some minor improvements since it was first teased in September . Adobe lowers AI video pricing to compete with industry giants On Wednesday, Adobe unveiled its latest software, which creates 5-second videos with artificial intelligence for only 50 cents per video. In an attempt to compete with giants like OpenAI and Runway, Adobe is offering separate AI-specific subscriptions for only $9.99 and $29.99. Ely Greenfield, chief technology officer of Adobe’s creative software business, noted that the affordable prices serve to increase adoption rates while staying competitive and that the math speaks for itself. We’re pricing it at a lower point right now for adoption. If you do the math and look what’s out there, we’re competitive in the marketplace. Ely Greenfield This move most likely resulted from the massive 25% drop in Adobe’s shares in 2024, when investors feared that AI startups might subdue the company. Since then, the company has been integrating generative AI features into its star applications, like Photoshop. The computer software company began launching tools powered by its generative AI Firefly Video Model at the end of 2024, starting with the Generative Extend tool in beta for Premiere Pro that can be used to extend the end or beginning of footage. Adobe integrates AI into creative tools to compete with Runway and OpenAI Adobe’s Generate Video tool rollout comes a few weeks after OpenAI launched its own text-to-video generator, Sora, to ChatGPT paid subscribers, allowing them to generate AI videos using prompts. Runway charges users 70 cents to $1.20 to generate a 5-second video using its newest AI model and has an unlimited plan for $95 per month. Adobe faces growing competition in the AI video market. In addition to Sora, Google is testing the second generation of its Veo AI video model, which, judging by early demo examples, looks more impressive than OpenAI’s model. ByteDance and Pika Labs have also recently announced new video-focused generative AI tools. Adobe seeks to stand out from the crowd by integrating AI into its existing tools and working towards better controls over its output. With the new subscriptions, users can generate AI videos, photos, and illustrations and use the credits for different audio features like transcription. The computer software company claims that users have generated photos and other media using Firefly AI more than 18 billion times since December, when the numbers read 16 billion. This new AI integration will generate high-definition videos as the company works towards higher-resolution models for professional production.

With new projects emerging, investors are constantly on the lookout for the next big breakout. Could Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) be the one? While the meme coin market remains dynamic, two other projects have been making waves. Book of Meme has seen a surge in trading activity, and TRUMP Meme Coin continues to gather momentum among traders. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, Book of Meme, and TRUMP Meme Coin. Earn 66% APY Staking Rewards with Arctic Pablo Coin – A Golden Opportunity Arctic Pablo Coin is among the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now, and for good reason. One standout feature that sets it apart is its lucrative 66% APY staking rewards during the presale. Unlike most meme coins that rely purely on speculative hype, Arctic Pablo Coin provides an actual utility—allowing investors to stake their tokens and earn substantial passive income even before the official launch. This staking opportunity isn’t just a minor bonus; it’s a game-changer for those looking to maximize their holdings. Imagine accumulating more APC while the project moves through its presale stages, potentially increasing your overall profit at launch. The staking rewards ensure that early adopters reap continuous benefits while the project gains traction. With a high-yield staking mechanism already in place, Arctic Pablo Coin positions itself as a top-tier investment in the meme coin space. But the excitement doesn’t stop here—its presale is already making headlines. Arctic Pablo Coin Enters Aqua Frost Phase – Get in Before the Price Surges Arctic Pablo Coin is among the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now, and this meme coin presale is setting the stage for one of the most explosive launches in recent history. The project has now entered Aqua Frost, the 10th phase, marking a crucial milestone in its journey toward the official launch. Currently, 1 APC is priced at just $0.000059, but that won’t last long. Early investors have the potential to experience a staggering 13,451.72% ROI from this stage to the launch price of $0.008. The numbers speak for themselves: over $1.1 million has already been raised, reflecting strong investor confidence. As Arctic Pablo Coin progresses through its presale stages, each phase brings a price increase, meaning those who delay might find themselves paying significantly more. The window for getting in at an entry-level price is closing fast. The buzz surrounding Aqua Frost is undeniable. With such incredible ROI potential and the momentum building rapidly, Arctic Pablo Coin is drawing massive attention from both retail and whale investors alike. Book of Meme’s Surge: Price & Market Movement Book of Meme (BOME) continues to gain traction, making its presence felt in the meme coin space. Today, BOME is priced at $0.002031, with an astonishing $59,266,474 in 24-hour trading volume. This surge in trading activity highlights growing investor interest and confidence in the project. With meme coins proving to be volatile yet rewarding, Book of Meme is capturing attention as traders look for potential short-term and long-term gains. TRUMP Meme Coin Gathers Momentum TRUMP Meme Coin has been making headlines with increasing trading volume and investor engagement. The meme-inspired token has garnered significant attention, riding the wave of political and cultural trends that have driven its demand. The current price of the TRUMP Meme Coin is USD 0.000746, with a 24-hour trading volume of USD 1,901,237. Its unique branding and community-driven nature have solidified its place among the most talked-about meme coins today. As traders explore new opportunities, TRUMP Meme Coin remains an exciting project worth watching. Final Thoughts: Is Arctic Pablo Coin the Best Bet? Meme coins continue to evolve, offering diverse investment opportunities. Book of Meme has shown strong market activity, and TRUMP Meme Coin maintains its momentum among investors. However, Arctic Pablo Coin is among the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now and presents a highly lucrative presale with massive staking rewards and exceptional ROI potential. With its 66% APY staking rewards, the Aqua Frost presale phase, and the low current entry price of $0.000059, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as a top-tier contender in the meme coin space. As prices rise with each new phase, the best time to get in is now—before the window closes.

Market trends shift rapidly, prices fluctuate, and big names dominate headlines. What if the smartest investments lie in altcoins under $1, offering exponential growth before the masses catch on? JetBolt (JBOLT), VeChain (VET), Sei (SEI), and WallitIQ (WLTQ) are four promising altcoins still trading at bargain prices. Each holds potential, but one stands out above the rest. For investors looking to maximize returns, timing is everything. JetBolt (JBOLT): Early Hype, But Will It Last? Hyped as a futuristic DeFi solution, JetBolt (JBOLT) has gained traction among traders searching for innovative altcoins. Its rapid adoption and community-driven initiatives fuel speculation, but does it have the legs for long-term growth ? Crypto investors recognize the potential of getting in early, yet the lack of major exchange listings and an unproven track record leaves JetBolt (JBOLT) in uncertain waters. While it’s an exciting investment, the risk is high. Can it sustain momentum, or will early enthusiasm fizzle? VeChain (VET): A Veteran In The Game VeChain (VET) has cemented itself in the blockchain world. Known for its real-world applications in supply chain logistics, it has secured partnerships with major corporations. Investors seeking investment stability might find comfort in VeChain’s (VET) long-term roadmap, but does it still hold high-return potential? With a larger market cap and a more established ecosystem, this crypto asset offers security but lacks the explosive growth of emerging altcoins. VeChain (VET) may not be the best pick for investors chasing rapid multipliers. Sei (SEI): Speed And Scalability, But Competition Looms Sei (SEI) enters the scene as a high-speed blockchain promising efficiency and low fees. Crypto investors seeking performance-driven altcoins have taken notice, drawn by its scalable infrastructure and developer-friendly ecosystem. However, competition is fierce. Established blockchains already dominate this space, leaving Sei (SEI) fighting for adoption. While its potential is undeniable, true growth depends on whether it can differentiate itself enough to attract investor attention. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The Hidden Gem Set For A Breakout Among JetBolt (JBOLT), VeChain (VET), and Sei (SEI), one altcoin stands above the rest. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is not just another blockchain project. It is a game-changing investment opportunity . What makes this project a must-buy? Investors are drawn to its groundbreaking cashback rewards , allowing users to earn up to 12% cash back on transactions, unlike JetBolt (JBOLT), VeChain (VET), and Sei (SEI) offer. But that’s just the beginning. Investors gain passive income streams by staking WallitIQ (WLTQ), earning rewards while holding onto a high-growth asset. The upcoming MVP build of its Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App further amplifies its appeal. The SolidProof-audited platform prioritizes transparency, providing crypto investors custom alerts to manage volatile market movements. And here’s where things get urgent: the beta platform is launching soon. Waiting isn’t an option for first-time investors looking for an entry point into crypto, and the chance to secure WallitIQ (WLTQ) under $1 won’t last. Why WallitIQ (WLTQ) Is The Best Pick For First-Time Investors While JetBolt (JBOLT), VeChain (VET), and Sei (SEI) hold potential, WallitIQ (WLTQ) stands out as the ultimate investment opportunity. WallitIQ (WLTQ) isn’t just another altcoin—it’s an AI-powered financial disruptor designed for long-term gains. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) price won’t stay this low for long when mainstream adoption kicks in. For investors, the choice is clear: seize this moment to invest or miss out on life-changing gains. The Time To Act Is Now Altcoins under $1 are the golden ticket to exponential gains, but not all opportunities are created equal. JetBolt (JBOLT) may ride early hype, but its long-term success is uncertain. VeChain (VET) is a solid choice but lacks the parabolic growth of emerging cryptos. SEI (SEI) offers speed, but it faces stiff competition. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is different. This AI-powered financial powerhouse combines real-world utility with next-gen investment advantages, making it the best choice for first-time investors. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is still under $1, but not for long. Once the beta platform launches, prices will never be this low again. Don’t wait. Invest now and claim your stake before the real surge begins.

According to the Bitcoin ETF issuer, this Solana move will make the fund more accessible, improve transaction efficiency, and strengthen its commitment to blockchain-based investment products. Why This Matters Over time, Franklin Templeton has been strengthening its presence in the crypto space. For example, the fund, which maintains a stable $1 share price similar to a stablecoin, was introduced on Ethereum in November 2024. New chain unlocked. BENJI is now live on @solana !

Consequently, by integrating with Solana, a blockchain known for its speed and low fees, the firm intends to provide investors with a more efficient and cost-effective way to trade digital assets. The Bigger Picture Similarly, tokenization is becoming a major trend in the financial sector. Many top asset managers, including BlackRock and Fidelity, have adopted blockchain-based investment products, pointing to benefits such as faster transactions, lower costs, and increased transparency. Furthermore, industry reports indicate that the total value of tokenized U.S. Treasuries has reached $3.6 billion, showing the growing demand for blockchain-powered finance. What’s Next for Franklin Templeton? In another event, Franklin Templeton filed for a Solana-based ETF in Delaware , signaling further expansion into the crypto market. If the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves the filing, it could open up new investment opportunities. Investors can now access FOBXX through the Benji Investments app, where a BENJI token represents each share. Meanwhile, Franklin Templeton’s move comes as several firms file similar applications following President Donald Trump’s inauguration, which brought changes to the SEC, including the resignation of former Chair Gary Gensler. Additionally, the firm projected a significant shift for Bitcoin in December, predicting its transition from a speculative asset to a functional reserve as its underlying technologies become more integrated into global financial systems.

Achieving an astonishing 6,430% ROI, Web3Bay is quickly becoming a standout in the blockchain sector, signaling a seismic shift in investor preferences towards platforms offering more than just currency transactions. This dramatic return on investment highlights Web3Bay’s potential to redefine decentralized e-commerce, attracting a wide array of stakeholders looking to capitalize on its innovative transaction methods and robust technological framework. Here’s a closer look at why Web3Bay’s presale is outshining even the strongest competitors and what it means for the future of the digital marketplace. Web3Bay Presale: A Gateway to Exceptional Returns Web3Bay is quickly becoming a focal point in the decentralized e-commerce sector. Its presale is structured to reward early participants, with a total of 28 stages, each introducing incremental price increases. Currently, in Stage 4, the platform has already raised more than $1.1 million, selling over 295 million 3BAY tokens at $0.004562625 each. With a projected listing price of $0.1959, the expected ROI for early investors stands at an impressive 6,430%. This structured growth model ensures that those who invest early see the highest potential gains. Beyond its financial incentives, Web3Bay is designed to solve a major issue in online commerce—high transaction fees and lack of user control. Traditional e-commerce platforms like Amazon and eBay charge hefty commission fees on every transaction, cutting into sellers’ profits and increasing costs for buyers. Web3Bay eliminates these middlemen by enabling direct peer-to-peer transactions through blockchain technology. By reducing costs and enhancing transparency, it provides a fairer alternative to existing centralized marketplaces. A standout feature of Web3Bay is its governance model. Unlike centralized platforms, where corporate executives make all decisions, Web3Bay operates on a decentralized governance system where token holders have voting power. Users can propose and vote on platform policies, transaction fees, and new features, making it a truly user-driven marketplace. Additionally, Web3Bay supports multiple payment options, including stablecoins, making it easier for both crypto and non-crypto users to participate. Stablecoin integration ensures that buyers and sellers can transact without worrying about crypto price volatility, which has been a major barrier to widespread adoption. This hybrid payment system, combined with Web3Bay’s decentralized model, positions it as one of the most promising crypto projects to watch in 2025. VeChain: Enhancing Transparency and Security Amid Market Volatility VeChain (VET) has established itself as a leading blockchain platform focused on supply chain management and logistics. By leveraging blockchain technology, VeChain enhances product authentication, prevents fraud, and ensures transparency across industries like retail, healthcare, and luxury goods. As of the latest data, VET is trading at approximately $0.03285, with a 24-hour trading volume of $45,623,938. This represents a 0.55% price increase in the last 24 hours. Despite its innovative solutions, VeChain has faced market volatility, with its current price significantly lower than its all-time high of $0.28. However, strategic partnerships with major corporations like Walmart China and BMW continue to strengthen its credibility in the enterprise sector. As adoption of VeChain’s technology grows, long-term investors remain optimistic about its potential for price appreciation. Kaspa: Rapid Transactions Kaspa (KAS) is recognized for its ultra-fast transaction speeds and innovative proof-of-work consensus mechanism. Unlike traditional blockchains, Kaspa operates on a blockDAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) structure, allowing multiple blocks to be mined simultaneously. This approach improves network efficiency and scalability while maintaining high security standards. The current price of KAS is approximately $0.08735, with a 24-hour trading volume of $44,025,482. This reflects a 0.93% price increase in the last 24 hours. Over the past week, Kaspa has experienced a price decline of approximately 26.70%, indicating market volatility. However, continued network developments, increased adoption, and potential integrations with DeFi platforms could contribute to future price recoveries. With its emphasis on speed and security, Kaspa aims to address key challenges facing traditional blockchain networks. The Last Line: As Web3Bay’s presale progresses, offering a potential 6,430% ROI, it stands out as a compelling opportunity for investors seeking exposure to decentralized e-commerce innovations. VeChain’s real-world use cases in supply chain logistics and Kaspa’s scalable blockchain technology make them valuable assets for different segments of the market. With increasing adoption and development, all three projects present investment opportunities that cater to different objectives.

One project that has caught their attention is RCO Finance, an AI-powered investment ecosystem that eases participation in the financial sector. Read on to see why these investors believe RCO Finance could become the best crypto coin of 2025. Dogecoin and XRP Tops List of Biggest Losers in February Dogecoin and XRP dominated investor wishlists for the past three months as both tokens surged to 2-year highs in Q4 2024. Many investors expected this rally to continue, increasing their Dogecoin and XRP holdings. Unfortunately, things went very differently as both tokens slipped to a double-digit drop in early February. For Dogecoin, its value has fallen by 12.35% in the first week of February. XRP has also fallen by 14% in the same time, now trading at $2.45. With fears that bearish sentiment around Dogecoin and XRP will remain until the end of Q1 2025, investors are shifting their focus to alternative projects like RCO Finance, a new altcoin project that leverages AI and machine learning to streamline investments. RCO Finance: Creating AI-backed Tools for the Future of the Financial Sector RCO Finance (RCOF) is a platform that offers an innovative path to smarter, more responsive asset management, one that is accessible to amateur and seasoned investors. Central to the RCO Finance platform is the Robo Advisor—a cutting-edge system that continuously monitors market trends using real-time data from reputable sources like Bloomberg and Reuters. This AI-powered trading bot acts as your personal Wall Street broker, watching for market shifts that bring profit opportunities. When doing so, Robo Advisor takes into consideration your risk tolerance, investing goals, and market preference, crafting investment strategies tailored to your portfolio. This trading bot is particularly useful for new investors who don’t know how to get started in the financial landscape. For instance, picture Mr Carlos, a computer developer who wants to get started investing in the crypto sector. Instead of spending hours trying to read complex charts, they can rely on investment suggestions from Robo Advisor. RCO Finance’s trading bot can also rebalance your portfolio automatically, helping you to stay in the green zone while reducing losses from sudden market shifts. After leveraging artificial intelligence for streamlined investing, Robo Advisor lets investors trade access to a wide range of assets while enjoying up to a 1000x leverage. The platform allows you to trade over 120,000 assets including equities, stocks, bonds, ETFs, and tokenized real estate, allowing you to move from risky assets to more stable options all from the convenience of one trading bot. Picture an unexpected economic policy shift that rattles global markets, for instance, the early February 2025 market crash that was triggered by talks of a trade war between America and Canada. In such a scenario, Robo Advisor will quickly recalculate your risk exposure, diverting funds from volatile cryptocurrencies to more stable investments like high-grade corporate bonds. Whether you’re just beginning or are an experienced trader, this tool ensures your portfolio remains agile and well-protected. For traders looking to maximize short-term gains, RCO Finance offers leverage trading up to 1000x, amplifying both profit potential and risk. With this leverage, an investor with $200 can open a trading position of $200,000. Aside from high-leverage trading and access to diverse markets, RCO Finance offers yield-earning mechanisms that reward commitment to its ecosystem. Its staking program, offering up to 86% APY, provides an exceptional avenue for earning passive income. By locking up tokens in its staking program, investors help provide liquidity for trading pools. Additionally, investors can earn extra tokens just for keeping RCOF tokens in their wallets. The higher your token balance, the higher your trading fee discounts. RCO Finance users also enjoy a high level of security and privacy thanks to the absence of KYC policies. To further boost investor safety, RCO Finance uses smart contracts that have been rigorously audited by SolidProof, creating a secure environment where your financial data and assets are well-protected. RCO Finance Excites Investment Community with its Beta Launch The beta version of RCO Finance is now live, giving over 10,000 new users a chance to test out the Robo Advisor and witness firsthand the power of its Robo Advisor trading bot. In the meantime, Robo Advisor and the trading bot will keep undergoing tests and upgrades ahead of its forthcoming alpha release. Best Crypto Coin for 2025: RCO Finance Vs. Dogecoin Given its AI-driven trading solutions and high-yield staking options, RCO Finance has been compared to traditional crypto investments like Dogecoin. Additionally, RCO Finance’ ongoing ICO is offering the opportunity to join a rapidly expanding community with over 10,000 members and more than $12 million raised in the presale. RCOF tokens are now in stage 5 of their presale, trading at $0.100. With its expected increase to $0.130 by stage 6 and a future listing in the $0.4–$0.6 range, analysts say now might be the best time to join its ecosystem. Projections indicate that RCOF could achieve a 10,000x increase, meaning a $1,000 investment might grow to $150,000 by December. Don’t miss out on securing your place in this pioneering venture.

I'm Ben Schiller, CoinDesk’s Opinion and Features editor. In this issue: Can Based Rollups solve Ethereum’s problem? Lido goes modular Uniswap finally unveils Unichain Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade is coming Network news BASED ROLLUPS TO THE RESCUE: In recent years, Ethereum has embraced a layer-2 scaling roadmap—a plan that encouraged the development of third-party auxiliary networks called ""layer-2 rollups""—to help scale the base Ethereum ecosystem. Offloading activity to these upstart networks has helped bring down fees and improve speeds for end-users, but it has led to a massive, deeply fragmented ecosystem of layer 2s. But while layer-2 networks all post data back down to Ethereum, they often struggle to communicate directly with one another, meaning passing assets and data between them can become expensive and cumbersome. There's also the risk of centralized sequencers: reliance on company-controlled black boxes to pass transaction data between blockchain layers. As a result, some Ethereum developers are pushing rollup tech that takes a new approach to security and interoperability: “based rollups."" Based rollups differ from most existing rollups because they shift execution duties—such as processing transactions—back to Ethereum's layer-1 rather than handling them on a separate layer-2 network. When someone transacts on a layer-2 rollup, their transaction is processed through a component called a “sequencer.” The sequencer batches multiple transactions and submits them to Ethereum for settlement. While sequencers provide efficiency and generate revenue for rollup operators by strategically ordering transactions, they also introduce a single point of failure. Based rollups avoid this vulnerability by using Ethereum’s built-in sequencing—its massive community of validators—rather than a single centralized sequencer. Rollups like Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, zkSync, and Blast have quickly grown to support larger transaction volumes than Ethereum itself. According to L2Beat , there are currently 140 live layer-2 networks, but the experience of operating between them—passing assets and other data between networks—has become clunky. As Ethereum becomes bigger and layer-2 networks become more integral to its functioning, improving communication between layer-2s—in other words, improving ""composability""—has become more important than ever. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. LIDO GOES MODULAR: The developers behind Lido, the largest staking service on Ethereum, have proposed revamping the staking platform with modular ""vaults."" The new framework would introduce stVaults, a customizable component designed to help Lido accommodate institutions and more complex staking strategies. Lido currently allows investors to pool their ether (ETH) together and ""stake"" their crypto — locking up their tokens with the network, helping to secure it in exchange for interest. Lido pioneered liquid staking: users get a receipt on their deposits called Lido staked ETH (stETH) that they can trade at any time. With liquid staking on Lido, entering and exiting staking positions became as simple as buying and selling stETH tokens. Lido V3's stVaults are “modular smart contracts designed to meet the diverse and evolving needs of Ethereum participants,” according to a press release shared with CoinDesk. The upgrade would enable staking setups beyond cut-and-dry liquid staking. Specifically, stVaults will be able to help institutional stakers who want to personalize their staking setups, node operators who want to attract high-volume stakers, and asset managers who want to create new staking use cases. “What is important to understand with customizable infrastructure, is that you can in general build even more complex products,” said Konstantin Lomashuk, the founder of the Lido staking protocol. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. UNICHAIN FINALLY: Uniswap Labs, the primary developer behind one of the largest decentralized exchanges (DEX), Uniswap, shared Feb 13 that its long-awaited layer-2 network, Unichain, is now live. Powered by Optimism's OP stack, Unichain—like other layer-2s on Ethereum—offers faster and cheaper transactions compared to Ethereum's mainnet. Developers can deploy apps onto the network, which has been optimized specifically for decentralized finance (DeFi) and aims to serve as ""the home for liquidity across chains,"" according to Uniswap Labs. For Uniswap Labs, the benefit of launching a layer-2 is twofold: it will provide a better experience for users of Uniswap and similar platforms, and it will create a new revenue opportunity in the form of network fees. A representative for Uniswap Labs told CoinDesk that ""around 20%"" of the chain's revenue will go directly to the company. Unichain has been in testing since October 2024 and is classified by Uniswap Labs as a ""stage-1"" rollup, meaning it has elements of decentralization but retains some centrally-controlled safeguards at this early phase. The network is built on the OP Stack, a modular framework that lets developers build interoperable layer-2 chains based on Optimism’s optimistic rollup technology . Several well-known teams have come out with their own OP Stack-based layer-2’s, including Coinbase's ‘ Base ’, Kraken’s ‘ Ink ,’ World’s ‘ World chain ,’ and Sony’s ‘ Soneium .’ “We are anticipating a world of many, many different use cases, of which trading is a small subset,” Adams told CoinDesk in an interview. In collaboration with Ethereum research and development firm Flashbots, the Uniswap team said it has created a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) on Unichain, a secure area for more sensitive transactions and is meant to optimize the chain for DeFi by allowing for more advanced trades and faster transaction finality. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. PECTRA IN APRIL: Ethereum developers have officially set test dates for Pectra, the network's first upgrade in 11 months, putting it on track for a potential April release date. Pectra will contain an array of improvements — with a special focus on wallets and validators — but it comes at a period of heightened scrutiny for Ethereum, which has recently faced pressure from its community to refocus and catch up with competitors. Ethereum's core builders decided on Thursday during their bi-weekly ""All Core Developers"" call to begin testing Pectra on Feb. 26 on the Holesky testnet, with a follow-up test on the network's Sepolia testnet slated for Mar. 5. Should those tests succeed, the developers will reconvene on Mar. 6 to determine when to launch the upgrade officially. According to Tim Beiko, the protocol support lead at the Ethereum Foundation, developers expect the upgrade to hit mainnet in early April. Pectra — a portmanteau representing two separate upgrades, Prague and Electra — includes eight major improvements to the second-largest blockchain. Among the most-anticipated is EIP-7702, which is supposed to improve the user experience of crypto wallets. The Ethereum community has been facing an identity crisis over the last few weeks. Its native token, ether (ETH), is underperforming against other cryptocurrencies, and competitor networks like Solana have drawn attention and talent from the Ethereum ecosystem — the first-ever programmable blockchain and still the most trafficked. Amid the controversy — much of it directed at the Etheruem Foundation, which coordinates chain upgrades and is currently undergoing a major leadership shuffle — developers are hoping that Pectra will help put the network on steadier footing. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more.

Since early December, ADA has seen its price plummet by over 61%, with bears dominating the trend and bulls unable to reclaim momentum. Despite the challenging environment, Cardano has shown signs of recovery, experiencing a 15% breakout yesterday that has pushed the price to a critical level. Related Reading: Litecoin Approaches Daily Range Peak – Can LTC Break Multi-Year Highs? This breakout offers a glimmer of hope for investors, but ADA must hold its current level to confirm the possibility of a continuation. The market remains uncertain, and the coming days will be crucial in determining whether Cardano can sustain its recent gains. If momentum persists, analysts believe ADA could rally further, providing some much-needed optimism for holders. Top crypto analyst Ali Martinez weighed in on the situation, sharing a technical analysis that suggests Cardano is breaking out and has the potential for a move toward $0.83. Martinez emphasized that the next key challenge will be maintaining this momentum, as it could signal a reversal in the broader downtrend. For now, investors remain cautiously optimistic, watching closely to see if Cardano can sustain its upward trajectory. Cardano Could Start A Recovery Phase Cardano could be on the verge of a recovery rally as it finds strong demand at its current levels, with bears unable to push the price into lower demand zones. After months of sustained selling pressure, Cardano appears to be showing signs of strength. However, the path to recovery is not straightforward. Bulls must reclaim and hold key levels above the $0.85 mark to confirm the start of a sustained uptrend. Adding to the optimism, top analyst Ali Martinez shared a technical analysis on X that highlights a potential breakout for Cardano. According to Martinez, if current momentum holds, Cardano could make a move toward $0.83 in the coming days. This breakout represents an important opportunity for ADA to shift market sentiment and regain investor confidence. Despite the encouraging signs, the broader market remains shaky, with analysts calling for potential retracements as BTC and altcoins struggle to find direction. The entire crypto space seems to be battling uncertainty, which has weighed heavily on sentiment. However, there is hope that Bitcoin and altcoins, including Cardano, will begin a new recovery rally in the coming days. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Hold $97K? – 1-3 Month Holders’ Data Reveals Crucial BTC Demand For now, all eyes are on ADA’s ability to maintain its breakout and push through key resistance levels. The next few days will be critical in determining whether this recovery can gain traction or if further consolidation is needed before the next leg up. Investors are cautiously optimistic, waiting for Cardano to confirm its upward momentum and break free from its recent downtrend. Price Testing Crucial Supply Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.78 after an impressive 15% surge yesterday, signaling a potential shift in momentum. Despite this rally, ADA has faced resistance at the $0.85 level, unable to break through and reclaim critical liquidity levels above the $0.80 mark. The inability to push past this zone has raised questions about whether the recovery rally can sustain its momentum in the coming days. However, there is a silver lining for ADA bulls. The price has managed to climb above the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), which sits around $0.72. This is a crucial technical indicator that signals long-term strength and provides optimism for a potential continuation of the upward trend. Holding above the 200-day EMA could create a foundation for bulls to regain control and challenge higher levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Multi-Year Bullish Pattern – Expert Suggests The Next Move Will Be ‘The Real Deal’ The next key challenge for ADA is to hold above the current levels and build the momentum necessary to retest the $0.85 resistance. A breakout above this zone would confirm a short-term bullish trend and open the door for further gains. However, failure to hold above the 200-day EMA could invite renewed selling pressure, pushing the price back toward lower support zones. For now, ADA remains in a delicate position, with the next few days likely to define its short-term direction.

The fraudulent project, called $BARRON, quickly surged in market value before crashing within seconds. World Liberty Financial Co Founder X Account Hacked World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance project linked to the Trump family, has confirmed that its co founder Zach Witkoff X account has been breached and urged users to ignore the fraudulent posts. On Wednesday, Witkoff’s compromised X account was used to promote $BARRON, a Solana-based memecoin falsely linked to President Donald Trump’s youngest son, Barron Trump. The hacker claimed that Trump would soon confirm the token’s legitimacy. However, according to World Liberty Financial, “Zach Witkoff’s account was compromised. Please do not engage with any posts promoting this project,” the company posted on X. The coin briefly reached a market capitalization of $73 million in under ten minutes before suddenly plummeting by 99%. This rapid rise and collapse indicated a “rug pull,” a scam where creators artificially inflate a token’s value before dumping it for profit. Previous Trump-Themed Memecoin Scams World Liberty Financial, which is launching a macro strategy reserve for crypto , was founded in 2024 and launched its own cryptocurrency, WLFI, in October of the same year. Several members of the Trump family, including Barron Trump, are listed as part of the project’s team. The $BARRON incident follows a similar scam in January involving a memecoin named after Ivanka Trump. The former president’s daughter publicly distanced herself from the project and warned investors against fraudulent schemes using her likeness. Memecoins featuring the Trump family have gained traction since Donald Trump announced his own cryptocurrency, Official Trump, on Solana in January. Days later, Melania Trump launched Melania Meme, also on the Solana blockchain. Memecoin Scams and Growing Concerns The rise of celebrity-themed memecoins has raised concerns about misleading promotions and scams in the cryptocurrency market. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) commented on the growing trend, questioning how investors determine the legitimacy of such tokens. “How does this work? I share my dog’s name and picture, and then people create memecoins?” Zhao wrote on X. “How do you know which one is ‘official’? Or does that even matter?” According to experts, memecoins have gained popularity due to their viral nature and speculative appeal, but they also pose risks to investors. Many projects lack transparency, and sudden sell-offs, commonly known as “rug pulls,” can lead to significant financial losses. Despite these concerns, the US SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, in a February 11 interview, stated that most memecoins do not fall under the SEC’s current regulatory framework. “Many of the memecoins that are out there probably do not have a home in the SEC under our current set of regulations,” Peirce said.

For a coin that traded as low as $2,551.17 in the past 24 hours, it is now changing hands for $2,794.86, up 4.73% at the time of writing. The 21Shares Push for Ethereum ETF Staking The 19b-4 filing was filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Cboe BZX Exchange. Cboe argued to allow changes to the ETH ETP Amendment No 2 that will permit the staking. This filing makes 21Shares the first issuer to make a move for this product. “Based on discussions with the Sponsor, the Exchanges proposes to amend several portions of the Eth ETP Amendment No. 2, as amended, in order to allow the staking of the Ethereum held by the Trust,” Cboe noted in the filing Primarily, 21Shares wants to enhance the income accruable to the Ethereum it holds on behalf of its clients in the ETF. It said it would not stake the Ether with any of its affiliates but those of its custodians’. Despite the plans for the staking, the filing noted that it would keep sufficient liquidity to satisfy any redemptions. The impact of this offering on Ethereum price appears to be priced in by the market at the moment. Ethereum Price Selloff Fades With the current shift in the price of ETH, speculations of further breakout are now making the rounds in the market. Thus far in this bull cycle, Ethereum’s price has not moved above the $4,000 resistance level. With market bears swooping in recently, it even turned the $3,000 mark as a formidable resistance. This 21Shares update has helped break its bearish dormancy, aligning with an earlier ETH price analysis that signals a potential $10,000 play. While it remains unknown whether Ethereum will pare off the 13.06% 30-day loss recorded thus far, current sentiment points in that direction. Generally, the ETH/BTC ratio flipped to its lowest level, a trend that analysts hint might also contribute to its potential rebound moving forward. ETH Price and Coming Tailwinds The launch of Ethereum ETF by top asset managers has not significantly fueled a boost in price. At the time, the US SEC opposed staking on ETF, an offering that could have made more difference for the coin. However, under President Donald Trump, chances are that the improved regulations will see the SEC approve this proposal. While this marks a major tailwind for ETH, the coming Pectra upgrade might also serve as a complement for adoption and price in general.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Pentoshi tells his 854,200 followers on the social media platform X that the crypto market is not reacting to bad economic news, signaling that a possible bottom is in. “Now price not reacting to tariffs or negative news anymore while many, not all things, are at high timeframe supports. Not a bad sign for some relief.” He says several alts appear poised to undergo mean reversion moves after the market correction. In trading, mean reversion is the theory that prices will revert to their averages after an extreme move. First up, he says PENGU , the utility token for the non-fungible token (NFT) project Pudgy Penguins, may surge to $0.01658 and possibly higher. “PENGU mean reversion areas (probably will have a lot of resistance at the upper one if we get there to be honest). But the first one should be the first area of interest for now.” Source: Pentoshi/X PENGU is trading for $0.01 at time of writing, flat on the day. Next up, the trader says that automated staking service Lido DAO ( LDO ) is holding the key level of $1.54 as support and may soon bounce. “There’s a ton of charts that are essentially just retesting high timeframe supports. Several that look like this, in my opinion very clean invalidations across the board.” Source: Pentoshi/X LDO is trading for $1.59, down marginally on the day. Lastly, he says that IOTA , the native asset for a crypto project focused on the Internet of Things, may increase more than 21% its current value after flipping a key level into support on the daily chart. “IOTA another chart flipping its high timeframe support. Looking for a move up towards $0.27-$0.28 and a reclaim. These high timeframe historical areas are often great areas to get involved.” IOTA is trading for $0.23 at time of writing, flat on the day.

Currently, in Stage 4, the platform has already raised more than $1 million, selling over 295 million 3BAY tokens at $0.004562625 each. With a projected listing price of $0.1959, the expected ROI for early investors stands at an impressive 6,430%. This structured growth model ensures that those who invest early see the highest potential gains. Beyond financial incentives, Web3Bay is designed to address significant inefficiencies in online shopping. Traditional platforms impose excessive fees on merchants while limiting consumer options due to centralized decision-making. Web3Bay creates a decentralized shopping environment where transactions are settled directly between buyers and sellers, removing unnecessary overhead costs. One of Web3Bay’s standout features is its governance model. Instead of being dictated by a centralized entity, decisions regarding platform fees, policies, and updates are made collectively by token holders. This ensures that users retain control over the marketplace and can influence its future development. Additionally, Web3Bay incorporates multi-currency payments, including stablecoins, which provide price stability for transactions. This hybrid system bridges the gap between crypto and traditional payment systems, making Web3Bay accessible to a wider audience. DeXe: Decentralized Asset Management DeXe (DEXE) offers decentralized asset management solutions, enabling users to follow and invest in successful trading strategies without relinquishing control of their funds. As of the latest data, DEXE is trading at approximately $19.97, with a 24-hour trading volume of $50,000. The day’s range has seen a high of $22.58 and a low of $18.88. DeXe’s platform allows for transparent and efficient asset management, leveraging blockchain technology to ensure security and trust. The decentralized nature of the platform provides users with autonomy over their investments, a feature increasingly valued in the financial sector. Investors are observing DeXe’s growth and adoption rates to evaluate its potential in the evolving landscape of decentralized finance (DeFi). The platform’s unique approach to asset management could position it as a significant player in the DeFi space, especially as more traditional investors explore blockchain-based financial services. Render: Decentralized GPU Rendering Render (RNDR) is recognized for its decentralized GPU rendering services, providing a network that connects users looking to perform render jobs with GPU owners willing to rent their compute power. The current price of RNDR is approximately $4.24, with a 24-hour trading volume of $308 million. This represents a 3.2% increase in the last 24 hours. Render’s decentralized infrastructure allows creative professionals to access affordable, scalable rendering power without relying on centralized cloud providers. This model not only enhances efficiency but also democratizes access to high-performance computing for industries such as film production, gaming, and artificial intelligence. As demand for AI-driven applications and 3D rendering grows, Render is well-positioned to capitalize on these expanding markets. Strategic partnerships and integrations with industry-leading creative tools could further solidify its market presence in the coming years. Conclusion As Web3Bay’s presale progresses, offering a potential 6,430% ROI, it stands out as a compelling opportunity for investors seeking exposure to decentralized e-commerce innovations. Meanwhile, DeXe, and Render continue to expand their influence, addressing growing data privacy concerns, DeXe facilitating decentralized asset management, and Render optimizing distributed computing resources. Each of these projects presents a unique value proposition, catering to different segments of the market.

The surge comes as decentralized finance (DeFi) activity picks up, particularly on the Solana blockchain, boosting USDC adoption and demand. Over the past month, USDC added $10.2 billion to its market cap , significantly outpacing the $4.6 billion increase in Tether’s USDT, according to Artemis data. Despite the surge, USDT remains the dominant stablecoin, with a market capitalization of $142 billion. This milestone marks a full recovery for USDC after the 2023 US regional banking crisis, which temporarily caused the stablecoin to lose its peg to the US dollar. Circle had held part of its reserves in Silicon Valley Bank, which collapsed, leading to a temporary loss of confidence among investors. Meanwhile, Tether capitalized on the shift, surpassing its 2022 market cap peak by May 2023. Stablecoins, such as USDT and USDC, play a crucial role in crypto markets by providing liquidity and facilitating trading on exchanges. Their growing supply is often viewed as a key indicator of investor confidence and market strength. Recent data shows that stablecoin expansion, particularly in USDT and USDC, has accelerated in recent weeks, aligning with previous periods of strong Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoin rallies. While macroeconomic uncertainties persist, the rapid growth of stablecoins signals renewed investor interest and a potentially bullish outlook for the broader cryptocurrency market. Trump open to considering USDC for strategic reserves Meanwhile, the Trump administration is reportedly considering integrating cryptocurrencies such as XRP, Solana, and USDC into a national strategic reserve . According to a New York Post report, the Trump transition team is exploring the establishment of an “America-first strategic reserve”. However, some within the crypto sector worry that emphasizing alternative coins may dilute efforts to legitimize Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, which remains central to discussions of a strategic Bitcoin reserve.

While some observe from the sidelines, others are actively participating in three distinct sectors of the blockchain ecosystem. The Web3Bay presale has now crossed the $1.15 million mark, with nearly 300 million tokens sold across three completed stages. This achievement underscores the project’s growing appeal and positions early investors for substantial returns. The current price of 3BAY in Stage 4 is $0.004562625, a significant increase from the Stage 1 price of $0.003. This positions Stage 4 buyers for a potential 4200% gain upon launch at $0.1959, while those who participated in Stage 1 are looking at a potential return of 6430%. Simultaneously, XRP price faces significant challenges, and Dogecoin is making inroads in the NFT space. XRP Price Analysis: A Critical Juncture at $2.50 The XRP price currently hovers near the $2.50 support level, a crucial point that will likely determine its short-term direction. While the long-to-short ratio on Binance indicates a bullish sentiment among traders at 2.80, the XRP price has experienced a 6.5% decline in the last 24 hours. This price drop is accompanied by a substantial decrease in trading volume, which has fallen by 65%. This reduction in trading activity suggests a weakening of market participation, and if the XRP price fails to hold above $2.50, analysts suggest a potential further decline to $1.95, representing a 25% decrease. The XRP price’s ability to maintain this level is critical. If the XRP price breaks below this support, it could trigger further selling pressure. Conversely, if the XRP price manages to hold, it may signal a potential rebound. The XRP price remains a focal point for many traders. The XRP price’s future hinges on its ability to navigate this critical support level. Dogecoin’s NFT Market: A New Era for Digital Art Dogecoin, initially conceived as a lighthearted internet phenomenon, has now become a significant player in the NFT market. Its appeal stems from its lower transaction fees compared to other cryptocurrencies. This cost-effectiveness makes Dogecoin an attractive platform for artists to sell their digital creations without incurring significant expenses. Beyond affordability, Dogecoin’s blockchain technology provides each NFT with a unique, verifiable digital signature, ensuring authenticity and security for both creators and collectors. This feature has contributed to the growth of the Dogecoin NFT market, establishing it as a viable platform for digital artists to exercise control over their work and earnings. The success of Dogecoin in the NFT space demonstrates its evolution beyond its meme-coin origins. Web3Bay’s Million-Dollar Presale: A Gateway to Future Rewards Web3Bay has rapidly gained traction, demonstrating the appetite for its unique approach to e-commerce. The platform has successfully raised over $1.15 million in its presale, selling about 300 million 3BAY tokens, a testament to the project’s strong initial appeal. The ongoing Stage 4 presale, priced at $0.004562625 per token, presents a limited-time opportunity for potential investors seeking to capitalize on early adoption. This stage represents a crucial entry point before the price potentially increases in subsequent rounds. The Web3Bay presale numbers speak for themselves, demonstrating investor confidence in the project’s vision and potential for disruption. Web3Bay offers more than just investment potential; it aims to transform the e-commerce experience by creating a more inclusive and rewarding ecosystem for all participants. This focus on community and utility sets it apart from many other projects in the crypto space. Users earn 3BAY tokens through purchases and platform engagement, unlocking discounts, passive income opportunities, and governance rights. This empowers users to actively participate in shaping the future of Web3Bay, giving them a voice in the platform’s development and direction. This decentralized governance model fosters a sense of ownership and shared purpose among the community. Sellers also benefit from reduced transaction fees enabled by blockchain technology, enhancing profitability and efficiency. This streamlined approach to commerce lowers barriers to entry and promotes greater participation. The dual benefits of high ROI potential and practical utility make Web3Bay a compelling proposition for both individual users and businesses. Summing Up The rapid pace of the cryptocurrency market underscores the importance of timely action. While the XRP price faces challenges and Dogecoin expands its influence in the NFT space, Web3Bay’s presale success highlights the potential for substantial returns for early participants. With each presale stage, the entry point rises, and the potential for maximum gains diminishes. The Web3Bay presale represents an opportunity to participate in a platform with both high ROI potential and real-world utility.

You’re not alone. Recent reports indicate a significant slowdown in the Bitcoin network, with average Bitcoin confirmation times reaching an unprecedented 19 minutes. This alarming development, reported by Cointelegraph on X, has sparked concern and curiosity within the crypto community. Let’s dive into what’s causing these Bitcoin transaction delays and what it means for you. Why Are Bitcoin Confirmation Times Skyrocketing? Several factors contribute to the current surge in Bitcoin confirmation times . It’s a perfect storm of network dynamics, highlighting both the strengths and limitations of the Bitcoin blockchain. Here’s a breakdown: Network Congestion: Think of the Bitcoin network as a digital highway. When more transactions are submitted than the network can handle efficiently, traffic jams occur. This network congestion is a primary driver of longer confirmation times. Increased user activity, perhaps due to market volatility or new adoption waves, can quickly clog the network. Block Size Limits: Bitcoin’s blockchain operates with a block size limit of roughly 1MB. This constraint, designed for security and decentralization, means that only a limited number of transactions can be included in each block mined approximately every 10 minutes. When transaction volume exceeds block capacity, a backlog forms, leading to delays. Fee Dynamics: In Bitcoin, users attach fees to their transactions to incentivize miners to prioritize them. Transactions with higher fees are generally processed faster. When network congestion is high, users often need to increase their fees to ensure timely confirmation. However, this creates a competitive fee market, potentially pricing out users with lower fee tolerance and further contributing to overall delays. Understanding Bitcoin Transaction Delays: A Closer Look To truly grasp the impact of these delays, let’s break down what Bitcoin confirmation times mean and why they matter: Aspect Description Impact of Increased Confirmation Times Confirmation Time The time it takes for a Bitcoin transaction to be included in a block and considered verified by the network. Longer wait times for transactions to finalize. Network Throughput The number of transactions the Bitcoin network can process per second. Reduced throughput means the network struggles to keep up with demand, leading to backlogs. User Experience The overall ease and speed of using Bitcoin for transactions. Frustration for users expecting quick and efficient transactions, especially in time-sensitive situations like point-of-sale purchases. Fee Market The competitive environment where users bid transaction fees to get their transactions processed faster. Higher fees become necessary for faster confirmations, increasing the cost of using Bitcoin, particularly during peak congestion. What Does This Mean for Crypto Users? The record-high Bitcoin confirmation times present both challenges and opportunities for crypto users: Challenges: Slower Transactions: The most immediate impact is the increased wait time for transactions to be confirmed. This can be inconvenient for everyday use cases, especially when speed is crucial. Higher Fees: To expedite transactions during congestion, users may need to pay higher fees, making Bitcoin potentially less cost-effective for smaller transactions. Uncertainty: Longer confirmation times can introduce uncertainty, particularly in volatile markets where timely execution of trades is important. Opportunities & Actionable Insights: Layer-2 Solutions: This situation highlights the importance of Layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network, which offer faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions. Exploring and adopting these solutions can mitigate the impact of mainnet congestion. Fee Awareness: Understanding Bitcoin fee dynamics becomes crucial. Using fee estimators and adjusting fees based on network conditions can help optimize transaction speed and cost. Patience and Planning: For less time-sensitive transactions, patience is key. Planning transactions ahead and avoiding peak congestion times can help reduce delays. Consider Alternatives (Strategically): In situations where extremely fast and low-cost transactions are paramount, users might temporarily consider other cryptocurrencies with faster confirmation times and lower fees, while still holding Bitcoin for its store of value properties. Are There Solutions to Bitcoin Network Congestion? Addressing network congestion and improving crypto transaction speed on Bitcoin is an ongoing discussion within the community. Potential solutions and improvements include: Block Size Increase (Controversial): Increasing the block size limit could theoretically allow more transactions per block. However, this is a contentious topic with potential implications for decentralization and node operation. Segregated Witness (SegWit): Already implemented, SegWit optimized block space and increased transaction capacity to some extent. Further adoption and optimization can still contribute. Taproot Upgrade: This recent upgrade enhances Bitcoin’s scalability and privacy, potentially contributing to more efficient transaction processing in the long run. Layer-2 Scaling Solutions (Lightning Network): Continued development and adoption of the Lightning Network and other Layer-2 solutions are crucial for offloading transaction volume from the main Bitcoin blockchain and enabling faster, cheaper transactions. Conclusion: Navigating Bitcoin’s Evolving Landscape The surge in Bitcoin confirmation times to a record 19 minutes serves as a stark reminder of the challenges and trade-offs inherent in decentralized, permissionless blockchains. While these delays can be frustrating, they also underscore the importance of ongoing innovation and adaptation within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Understanding the causes behind these Bitcoin transaction delays , exploring Layer-2 solutions, and practicing fee awareness are crucial steps for users to navigate this evolving landscape effectively. As Bitcoin continues to mature, addressing scalability and improving crypto transaction speed will remain paramount for its widespread adoption and usability.

40259567,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=128240,1739412145,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Surprising Ethereum (ETH) Analysis: 4 Reasons Why a Price Rebound is Imminent,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-eth-price-rebound-analysis/,"Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been navigating a complex market landscape recently. Despite facing headwinds like increased token supply and a dip in staking ratios, a recent analysis from CryptoQuant paints a surprisingly optimistic picture. Could ETH be significantly undervalued, poised for a dramatic price rebound? Let’s delve into the insightful analysis that suggests just that, uncovering the key factors that could trigger a bullish resurgence for Ethereum. If you’re watching the crypto markets closely, especially Ethereum’s movements, this analysis reveals potential opportunities you won’t want to miss. Is Ethereum Truly Undervalued at Current Prices? According to CryptoQuant’s analysis, a primary indicator of Ethereum’s potential lies in comparing its market price to its realized price. The realized price essentially represents the average price at which all ETH tokens were last moved on the blockchain. Currently, ETH’s realized price sits around $2,200, significantly lower than its market price hovering around $2,600. This discrepancy is a powerful signal. It suggests that, on average, ETH holders are currently sitting on unrealized profits. Historically, when market prices are substantially above realized prices, it often indicates that an asset is undervalued . Think of it like this: the ‘fair value’ based on past transactions is lower than what the market is currently valuing ETH at. This gap can be a strong foundation for future price appreciation. To illustrate, consider a scenario outside of crypto. Imagine a house in your neighborhood. If similar houses recently sold for an average of $300,000 (realized price), but the current market value of comparable houses is around $350,000 (market price), the house could be considered undervalued and ripe for further price increases as the market catches up to its intrinsic value. This analogy helps understand the fundamental concept of Ethereum being undervalued based on realized price analysis. Why is Growing ‘Permanent Owner’ ETH Holdings a Bullish Sign? Another compelling factor supporting a potential price rebound for Ethereum is the increasing amount of ETH held by ‘permanent owners.’ These are long-term holders who are less likely to sell their ETH during short-term price fluctuations. Think of them as the bedrock of the Ethereum market, providing stability and reducing sell-side pressure. The growth in holdings by these permanent owners is significant because it signals a strong belief in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition. As more ETH gets locked away in these long-term wallets, the circulating supply effectively decreases. This scarcity, coupled with consistent or increasing demand, can create a powerful upward pressure on price. It’s basic supply and demand economics at play. Here’s a breakdown of why this trend is beneficial: Reduced Volatility: Permanent holders are less prone to panic selling during market dips, thus dampening price volatility. Supply Squeeze: As more ETH is held long-term, the available supply for trading reduces, potentially driving prices up. Stronger Market Foundation: A larger base of long-term holders indicates a more mature and confident market. Imagine a company with a large portion of its shares held by institutional investors with a long-term outlook. This scenario is often viewed positively by the market because it suggests confidence in the company’s future and reduces the likelihood of drastic price swings. Similarly, the growth of permanent ETH owners acts as a strong foundation for future Ethereum price rebound . Decreased Futures Market Selling Pressure: A Shift in Sentiment? The futures market provides valuable insights into market sentiment. CryptoQuant’s analysis points to a notable decrease in selling pressure within the Ethereum futures market. This is a significant shift and a potential indicator of strengthening bullish momentum. In futures trading, ‘selling pressure’ is often reflected in metrics like negative funding rates or a high number of short positions. A decrease in this pressure suggests that traders are becoming less bearish (or more bullish) on Ethereum’s future price. This can be driven by various factors, including: Profit Taking on Shorts: Traders who were previously shorting ETH might be closing their positions, reducing sell pressure. Increased Long Positions: A decrease in selling pressure could also mean more traders are opening long positions, betting on a price rebound . Shifting Market Sentiment: Overall market sentiment towards Ethereum might be turning more positive, encouraging buying rather than selling in the futures market. This shift in the futures market is like observing the weather vane changing direction. It suggests a potential change in the prevailing winds of market sentiment, hinting at a possible upward trajectory for Ethereum. When combined with other positive indicators, decreased selling pressure in futures markets strengthens the case for an impending ETH price rebound . Institutional Investors Accumulating ETH: The Smart Money is Moving In? Perhaps one of the most compelling reasons for optimism is the increasing accumulation of ETH by major institutional investors. CryptoQuant highlights BlackRock and Cumberland as key examples of institutions that have been actively increasing their Ethereum holdings during recent price dips. Institutional investment is often considered a strong validation signal in the crypto market. These entities typically conduct thorough due diligence and have a longer-term investment horizon. When giants like BlackRock and Cumberland increase their ETH holdings, it suggests a strong belief in Ethereum’s future potential and its ability to deliver substantial returns. Why is institutional investment so crucial for an Ethereum price rebound ? Benefit of Institutional Investment Explanation Large Capital Inflows Institutions bring significant capital into the market, driving up demand and potentially prices. Increased Legitimacy Institutional participation enhances the legitimacy and maturity of the crypto market, attracting further investment. Long-Term Perspective Institutions often have a longer-term investment horizon, providing stability and reducing short-term volatility. Positive Market Signal Institutional buying activity is often interpreted as a positive signal by the broader market, encouraging retail and other investors to follow suit. The fact that major players like BlackRock and Cumberland are accumulating ETH during market dips is a powerful vote of confidence. It suggests that these institutions see the current prices as attractive entry points and are positioning themselves for potential future gains. This institutional investment is a crucial pillar supporting the thesis of an upcoming ETH price rebound . Navigating Sideways Movement and Macroeconomic Factors While the analysis points to strong underlying bullish factors for Ethereum, it’s important to acknowledge the potential for sideways price movement in the short term. Macroeconomic conditions, such as inflation, interest rate hikes, and global economic uncertainty, can exert downward pressure on all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Therefore, while the fundamental indicators suggest a strong potential for an Ethereum price rebound , external macroeconomic factors could lead to continued volatility and sideways price action in the immediate future. Investors should be prepared for potential market fluctuations and exercise caution while remaining optimistic about the longer-term prospects for ETH. Conclusion: Is Ethereum Primed for a Powerful Rebound? The CryptoQuant analysis presents a compelling case for Ethereum being significantly undervalued and poised for a price rebound . The combination of a lower realized price, increasing permanent owner holdings, decreased futures market selling pressure, and strong institutional accumulation paints a bullish picture. While macroeconomic headwinds might introduce short-term volatility, the underlying fundamentals suggest that Ethereum has strong potential for upward trajectory in the near future. For investors looking at the crypto market, particularly Ethereum, these factors offer a glimmer of hope and a potential opportunity to capitalize on what appears to be an undervalued asset. Keep a close watch on these indicators, and you might just witness the surprising Ethereum price rebound unfold.

The investment bank’s Q4 2024 filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) show an explosive 2,000% jump in their Ethereum ETF holdings , catapulting their investment from $22 million to a substantial $476 million. This bold step by a traditional finance heavyweight like Goldman Sachs is being widely interpreted as a powerful signal of growing institutional confidence in Ethereum and the broader digital asset space. Why the Massive Surge in Goldman Sachs’s Spot ETH ETF Holdings? The sheer scale of Goldman Sachs’s investment – a twenty-fold increase in a single quarter – is grabbing headlines and prompting crucial questions. What’s behind this dramatic pivot towards spot ETH ETF products? Several factors are likely at play, reflecting a confluence of market trends and strategic considerations: Increasing Institutional Acceptance of Crypto: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier in 2024 by the SEC paved the way for greater institutional involvement in crypto. This regulatory milestone has legitimized digital assets in the eyes of many traditional finance players, making investments in Ethereum ETF products like ETHA, FETH, and ETHE more palatable and compliant. Ethereum’s Growing Maturity and Use Cases: Ethereum has solidified its position as the leading smart contract platform, underpinning a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Its ongoing evolution and the anticipation surrounding upgrades like the Dencun upgrade further enhance its investment appeal. Institutions are increasingly recognizing Ethereum’s long-term potential beyond just a store of value. Client Demand for Crypto Exposure: Goldman Sachs, catering to high-net-worth individuals and institutional clients, is likely responding to growing client demand for exposure to the cryptocurrency market. Spot Ethereum ETF s offer a regulated and relatively straightforward way for these clients to gain access to ETH without the complexities of direct digital asset ownership and custody. Strategic Diversification: In a volatile global economic landscape, institutions are constantly seeking diversification to optimize portfolio returns and manage risk. Cryptocurrencies, with their low correlation to traditional assets, can serve as valuable diversifiers. Goldman Sachs’s increased ETH ETF holdings could be part of a broader strategy to diversify its asset allocation and capitalize on the potential upside of the crypto market. Breaking Down the Investment: ETHA, FETH, and ETHE According to the Cointelegraph report, citing the 13F filing, Goldman Sachs strategically allocated its $476 million across three prominent spot Ethereum ETF offerings: ETF Product Issuer Ticker Investment Amount (Approx.) BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust BlackRock ETHA ~$235 million (estimated half of total) Fidelity Ethereum Fund Fidelity FETH ~$235 million (estimated half of total) Grayscale Ethereum Trust Grayscale ETHE ~$6.3 million The even split between BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH suggests a balanced approach, potentially aiming for diversification across ETF providers or reflecting different client preferences. The smaller allocation to Grayscale’s ETHE, which is a converted Ethereum Trust rather than a newly launched ETF, could be due to various factors such as management fees, liquidity, or investment strategy. What Does This Mean for the Future of Spot ETH ETFs and Institutional Crypto Investment? Goldman Sachs’s substantial investment serves as a powerful validation of institutional crypto investment in general, and spot Ethereum ETFs specifically. Here’s why this development is particularly significant: Increased Market Confidence: When a Wall Street titan like Goldman Sachs makes such a bold move, it sends a strong signal to the broader market. It can alleviate concerns among other institutions and high-net-worth investors who might have been hesitant to enter the crypto space. This influx of institutional capital can contribute to greater market stability and maturity. Potential Price Impact on Ethereum: Increased demand from institutional investors can exert upward pressure on the price of Ethereum. As more institutions allocate capital to spot ETH ETF products, the underlying ETH holdings of these ETFs need to be acquired, potentially driving up ETH prices. This bullish scenario could attract further investment and fuel a positive feedback loop. Broader Adoption of Crypto ETFs: Goldman Sachs’s move could encourage other major financial institutions to increase or initiate their own allocations to spot crypto ETFs, both Bitcoin and Ethereum. This broader adoption would further mainstream crypto investments and make them more accessible to a wider range of investors. Evolution of Crypto as an Asset Class: Institutional investments like this reinforce the narrative that cryptocurrencies are evolving from a niche asset class to a mainstream component of diversified investment portfolios. As regulatory frameworks become clearer and institutional infrastructure develops further, we can expect to see even greater participation from traditional finance in the crypto market. Navigating the Evolving Landscape of Ethereum and Crypto Investments While the news of Goldman Sachs’s ETH ETF holdings surge is undoubtedly positive, it’s crucial to approach crypto investments with a balanced perspective. The cryptocurrency market remains inherently volatile, and regulatory landscapes are still evolving. Here are some key considerations for investors: Due Diligence is Paramount: Whether investing in spot Ethereum ETF s or directly in ETH, thorough research is essential. Understand the risks involved, the specific ETF products, their fees, and the underlying assets. Risk Management and Diversification: Crypto investments should be part of a well-diversified portfolio, not the sole focus. Determine your risk tolerance and allocate capital accordingly. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Stay Informed About Regulatory Developments: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is constantly changing. Keep abreast of updates from the SEC and other regulatory bodies, as these developments can significantly impact the market. Long-Term Perspective: Institutional investments often signal a long-term outlook. While short-term price fluctuations are inevitable, focus on the long-term potential of Ethereum and the underlying technology. Conclusion: A Bullish Signal for Ethereum and the Crypto Market Goldman Sachs’s 2000% surge in spot Ethereum ETF holdings is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a resounding endorsement of Ethereum’s growing prominence and the increasing institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies. This massive investment signals a potential shift in the crypto landscape, paving the way for greater mainstream adoption, increased market maturity, and potentially significant price appreciation for Ethereum and other digital assets. As traditional finance giants like Goldman Sachs embrace crypto, the future for this innovative asset class looks increasingly bright.

40259635,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=128177,1739412224,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Strategy Warning: Small Firms Risk Becoming ‘Zombie Companies’ – Shocking Analyst Prediction,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-strategy-small-firms-risk/,"In a surprising turn of events, small businesses are increasingly diving into the world of cryptocurrency, specifically adopting a Bitcoin acquisition strategy pioneered by larger entities like Michael Saylor’s Strategy. This bold move, while potentially lucrative, is raising eyebrows and sparking serious concerns among financial analysts. Is this a revolutionary step towards modernizing corporate finance, or a reckless gamble that could lead to financial ruin? Let’s delve into this intriguing trend and uncover the potential pitfalls. Why are Small Firms Embracing the Bitcoin Strategy for Corporate Treasury? Inspired by the pioneering approach of companies like Strategy, a growing number of small firms are allocating a portion of their corporate treasury to Bitcoin. Data from Coinkite reveals that 78 companies globally are now holding Bitcoin as part of their reserves. But what’s driving this surge in adoption? Here are a few key reasons: Diversification Beyond Traditional Assets: In an era of economic uncertainty, businesses are looking to diversify beyond traditional assets like cash and bonds. Bitcoin, with its uncorrelated nature to traditional markets, offers an alternative avenue for diversification. Inflation Hedge: With inflation on the rise globally, many view Bitcoin as a hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Its limited supply and decentralized nature are seen as attractive qualities in inflationary environments. Boosting Share Value and Investor Appeal: In the crypto-enthusiastic market, holding Bitcoin can be perceived as innovative and forward-thinking, potentially attracting investors and boosting share prices, especially for publicly listed small firms. Future-Proofing Finances: Some businesses believe that embracing digital assets like Bitcoin is a way to future-proof their finances and position themselves at the forefront of technological advancements in finance. The Shadow Side: Risk of ‘Zombie Company’ Status and Bitcoin Holdings While the allure of Bitcoin is undeniable, analysts like Mark Palmer from Benchmark are raising critical concerns. Palmer warns that for small firms, adopting a Bitcoin strategy for their corporate treasury could be a perilous path, potentially leading to the dreaded “zombie company” status. But what exactly are the risks? Increased Financial Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price volatility. Holding a significant portion of treasury in such a volatile asset exposes small firms to substantial financial risks. A sharp downturn in Bitcoin’s price could severely impact their balance sheets. Distraction from Core Business: Managing Bitcoin holdings, understanding market fluctuations, and dealing with crypto-related regulations can divert management’s attention and resources away from the core business operations of small firms. Liquidity Concerns: While Bitcoin is liquid, converting large amounts back to fiat currency quickly, especially during market downturns, might not always be seamless and could incur slippage costs. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Small firms holding Bitcoin face uncertainty regarding future regulations and compliance requirements, which could add complexity and costs. Sign of Underlying Business Weakness?: Palmer’s warning highlights a crucial point: firms with less robust business models might be more inclined to adopt risky strategies like Bitcoin acquisition in a desperate attempt to boost their appeal or stock price. This can be a red flag indicating underlying financial weaknesses. Examples of Firms and Their Bitcoin Corporate Treasury Journey While Coinkite’s data points to 78 companies, specific examples of small firms embracing Bitcoin as corporate treasury are still emerging. It’s important to note that the trend is relatively nascent, and many firms may be hesitant to publicly disclose their Bitcoin holdings due to competitive reasons or regulatory uncertainties. However, the increasing number of companies tracked by Coinkite signals a growing, albeit potentially risky, trend. As the market matures, we are likely to see more case studies emerge, both success stories and cautionary tales. Navigating the Risks: Actionable Insights for Small Firms Considering a Bitcoin Strategy If your small firm is considering dipping its toes into the Bitcoin waters, proceed with caution. Here are some actionable insights to consider to mitigate the risk: Conduct Thorough Due Diligence: Before allocating any capital to Bitcoin, conduct extensive research and understand the intricacies of the cryptocurrency market, including its volatility and regulatory landscape. Define a Clear Strategy and Risk Tolerance: Establish a well-defined Bitcoin strategy with clear objectives, allocation percentages, and risk management protocols. Determine your firm’s risk tolerance and ensure the Bitcoin strategy aligns with it. Start Small and Scale Gradually: Don’t jump in headfirst. Begin with a small allocation to Bitcoin and gradually scale up as you gain experience and confidence, and as your understanding of the market deepens. Seek Expert Advice: Consult with financial advisors and crypto experts to get tailored guidance on implementing a Bitcoin strategy that is appropriate for your firm’s specific circumstances and risk profile. Monitor and Re-evaluate Regularly: The cryptocurrency market is dynamic. Continuously monitor your Bitcoin investments, re-evaluate your strategy regularly, and be prepared to adapt to market changes and evolving regulations. Transparency and Communication: If your firm is publicly listed, ensure transparent communication with investors about your Bitcoin strategy and the associated risks. Will Bitcoin Lead to a Wave of ‘Zombie Companies’? The question remains: will the Bitcoin strategy adopted by small firms truly lead to a surge in “zombie companies”? While the risk is certainly real, it’s not a foregone conclusion. The outcome will depend on various factors, including: Bitcoin Market Performance: Sustained growth in the Bitcoin market could validate the strategy for some firms, while a prolonged bear market could expose vulnerabilities. Risk Management by Firms: How effectively small firms manage the risks associated with Bitcoin holdings will be crucial. Prudent risk management can mitigate the chances of falling into “zombie company” territory. Broader Economic Conditions: The overall economic climate and the performance of traditional markets will also play a role. A strong economy could provide a buffer, while a recession could exacerbate the risks. Ultimately, the adoption of Bitcoin as corporate treasury by small firms is a high-stakes gamble. While the potential rewards are enticing, the risks are equally significant. Firms must tread carefully, conduct thorough due diligence, and prioritize sound risk management to avoid the dreaded “zombie company” fate. The analyst’s warning serves as a crucial reminder of the potential downsides of this emerging trend.

Understanding market sentiment is crucial, and one powerful tool in your arsenal is the Bitcoin long-short ratio. This metric offers a glimpse into the collective positioning of traders in the perpetual futures market, helping you gauge whether the majority are leaning bullish or bearish on Bitcoin. Let’s dive into the latest 24-hour Bitcoin long-short ratio data and decode what it means for you. Decoding the 24-Hour BTC Futures Long-Short Ratio For the past 24 hours, the overall Bitcoin long-short ratio across major cryptocurrency exchanges paints a picture of near equilibrium. Here’s the snapshot: Total: Long 49.46%; Short 50.54% This data suggests a very slight bearish sentiment prevails across the entire tracked market, with short positions marginally outweighing long positions. However, to get a more granular view, let’s examine the top exchanges individually. Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio Breakdown by Exchange Analyzing individual exchanges provides deeper insights into where traders are placing their bets. Here’s a look at the Bitcoin long-short ratio on three leading platforms: Binance: Long 49.71%; Short 50.29% Bybit: Long 48.89%; Short 51.11% Bitget: Long 50.54%; Short 49.46% As you can see, the ratios are remarkably close across these top exchanges. Binance and Bybit show a slightly higher inclination towards short positions, while Bitget leans marginally towards long positions. The differences, however, are minimal, reinforcing the overall picture of a market in relative balance regarding BTC futures . Why is the Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio Important for Crypto Traders? Understanding the Bitcoin long-short ratio offers several benefits for crypto traders: Gauge Market Sentiment: The ratio acts as a sentiment indicator. A significantly higher long ratio might suggest excessive bullishness (potential market top), while a high short ratio could indicate extreme fear (potential bottom). Identify Potential Reversals: Extreme long or short ratios can sometimes precede market reversals. For example, if everyone is long, there might be fewer buyers left to push prices higher, increasing the likelihood of a correction. Confirmation Tool: Use the ratio to confirm signals from other technical indicators or fundamental analysis. If your analysis suggests a bullish move, and the long ratio is also increasing, it can add conviction to your trade. Risk Management: Understanding the prevailing sentiment can help you manage risk. Knowing if the market is heavily leaning in one direction can inform your position sizing and stop-loss placement. Navigating Perpetual Futures with Long-Short Ratios Perpetual futures are derivative contracts that, unlike traditional futures, do not have an expiry date. This makes them popular for traders who want to hold positions for longer durations or engage in strategies like hedging. The Bitcoin long-short ratio is particularly relevant for perpetual futures because it reflects the ongoing sentiment and positioning in these contracts. Here’s how to effectively use the Bitcoin long-short ratio when trading perpetual futures: Monitor Trends: Track the ratio over time. A consistent increase in the long ratio could signal growing bullishness, while a rising short ratio might indicate increasing bearishness. Compare Across Exchanges: Look for discrepancies in ratios across different exchanges. Significant variations could highlight localized sentiment or potential arbitrage opportunities. Combine with Other Data: Don’t rely solely on the long-short ratio. Use it in conjunction with price action, volume analysis, open interest, and other on-chain metrics for a comprehensive market view. Challenges in Interpreting Crypto Market Sentiment While the Bitcoin long-short ratio is a valuable tool, it’s important to acknowledge its limitations: Exchange Specific Data: The reported ratios are usually specific to individual exchanges. The total ratio is an aggregation, but it might not represent the entire global market perfectly. Lagging Indicator: Like many sentiment indicators, the long-short ratio is somewhat lagging. It reflects past positioning and might not predict immediate future price movements. Manipulation Potential: In less regulated markets, there’s always a potential for manipulation. Large players could potentially influence the ratio to create misleading signals, although this is less likely on major, reputable exchanges. Context is Key: The interpretation of the ratio depends heavily on market context. A 60% long ratio in a bull market might be normal, but the same ratio in a bear market could be considered excessively bullish and risky. Actionable Insights for Bitcoin Trading So, what actionable insights can we derive from the current Bitcoin long-short ratio data? Neutral Market Stance: The near 50/50 split suggests a market in indecision. Traders are not overwhelmingly bullish or bearish at this moment. Cautious Trading: In such balanced conditions, consider adopting a more cautious trading approach. Avoid over-leveraging and be prepared for potential volatility in either direction. Focus on Price Action: Pay close attention to price action and technical patterns. In a neutral sentiment environment, price movements might be more technically driven. Monitor for Shifts: Keep an eye on how the Bitcoin long-short ratio evolves over the coming hours and days. A significant shift towards either long or short could signal the beginning of a new trend. Conclusion: Staying Informed in the Crypto Landscape In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency trading, staying informed is paramount. The Bitcoin long-short ratio for BTC futures provides a valuable snapshot of market sentiment, helping you understand the collective positioning of traders. By monitoring this metric, along with other market indicators, you can enhance your trading strategy and navigate the exciting, yet challenging, crypto landscape with greater confidence. Remember to always conduct thorough research and consider your own risk tolerance before making any trading decisions. The current data suggests a balanced market, but vigilance and continuous analysis are key to success in crypto trading.

40259669,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=128282,1739412323,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Move: Toyota Finance Issues Corporate Bonds as Security Tokens in Japan,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/toyota-finance-security-tokens-japan/,"In a groundbreaking move that signals a significant shift in traditional finance, Toyota Financial Services (TFS), the financial powerhouse behind the globally recognized Toyota automotive brand, is diving headfirst into the world of blockchain technology. They are set to issue corporate bonds in the innovative form of security tokens . This exciting development, slated for March 3rd, is not just a solo venture; it’s a collaborative symphony of financial giants including Daiwa Securities, MUFG Bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation, and the blockchain platform Progmat. Let’s delve into what this means for the future of finance and why this is a game-changer you need to know about. What are Security Tokens and Why Toyota is Choosing Them? Security tokens are essentially digital representations of traditional financial securities, like stocks or bonds, but they live on a blockchain. Think of them as the next evolution of financial assets, bringing together the security of regulated securities with the efficiency and transparency of blockchain technology. But why are established giants like Toyota Financial Services choosing this route? Enhanced Efficiency and Speed: Blockchain technology promises faster settlement times and streamlined processes compared to traditional bond issuance. Imagine transactions settling in minutes rather than days! Increased Accessibility: Security tokens can potentially lower the barrier to entry for investors, allowing for fractional ownership and broader market participation. This could open up corporate bond investments to a wider range of investors. Improved Transparency: Every transaction on the blockchain is recorded and immutable, offering a higher level of transparency for both issuers and investors. This reduces information asymmetry and builds trust. Reduced Costs: By automating many manual processes involved in traditional bond issuance, security tokens can lead to significant cost savings for issuers like Toyota Finance. For Toyota Finance, a company synonymous with innovation and efficiency in the automotive industry, embracing security tokens for corporate bond issuance aligns perfectly with their ethos. It’s a bold step into the future of finance, showcasing their commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technology. The Power of Tokenization in Corporate Finance The process of converting rights to an asset into a digital token is known as tokenization . This isn’t just about creating digital versions of existing assets; it’s about unlocking new possibilities and efficiencies within the financial system. In the context of corporate bonds, tokenization offers a plethora of benefits: Benefit Description Impact on Corporate Bonds Fractional Ownership Tokens can be divided into smaller units, allowing multiple investors to own a fraction of a bond. Democratizes investment, enabling smaller investors to participate in corporate bond markets. 24/7 Trading Blockchain-based assets can be traded around the clock, unlike traditional markets with set hours. Increases liquidity and provides flexibility for global investors. Smart Contracts Automated contracts embedded in the blockchain can streamline processes like interest payments and maturity payouts. Reduces administrative overhead and ensures timely and accurate payments. Global Reach Security tokens can be accessible to investors worldwide, expanding the investor base for corporate bonds. Facilitates cross-border investments and diversifies funding sources. Toyota Finance’s foray into tokenization of corporate bonds is a testament to the transformative potential of this technology in reshaping corporate finance. It’s about making financial instruments more accessible, efficient, and globally connected. Blockchain: The Backbone of Security Token Issuance At the heart of this revolution lies blockchain technology. A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and immutable ledger that records transactions in blocks linked together chronologically. This technology provides the infrastructure for security tokens to operate securely and transparently. Key features of blockchain that make it ideal for security token issuance: Decentralization: No single entity controls the blockchain, reducing the risk of censorship or single points of failure. Immutability: Once a transaction is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring data integrity and trust. Transparency: Transaction records are publicly auditable (depending on the type of blockchain), enhancing transparency and accountability. Security: Cryptographic techniques secure the blockchain network, making it highly resistant to fraud and hacking. By leveraging blockchain , Toyota Finance and its partners are building a robust and secure foundation for their security token issuance, ensuring investor confidence and operational efficiency. Why Japan is Becoming a Hotspot for Security Tokens Japan is emerging as a progressive hub for blockchain innovation and digital asset adoption, creating a fertile ground for security token initiatives like Toyota’s. Several factors contribute to Japan’s growing prominence in this space: Pro-regulatory Environment: The Japanese government has been proactive in establishing clear regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies and digital assets, providing legal clarity and fostering innovation. Tech-Savvy Population: Japan has a high level of technological adoption and a population comfortable with digital innovations, creating a receptive market for security tokens. Financial Innovation Focus: Japanese financial institutions are increasingly exploring and investing in fintech solutions, including blockchain and digital assets, to enhance their services and competitiveness. Strong Financial Infrastructure: Japan boasts a robust financial infrastructure and a deep pool of institutional investors, creating a supportive ecosystem for the growth of the security token market. Toyota Finance launching its security token corporate bonds in Japan is strategically significant, capitalizing on the country’s favorable regulatory landscape and vibrant fintech ecosystem. This move could inspire other Japanese corporations to explore security token offerings. The Collaborative Effort: Key Players Behind Toyota’s Security Token Bonds The success of Toyota Finance’s security token issuance hinges on the collaborative expertise of several key players: Toyota Financial Services (TFS): As the issuer, TFS is taking the pioneering step to tokenize its corporate bonds, demonstrating leadership in financial innovation. Daiwa Securities: A leading Japanese securities firm, Daiwa Securities brings its expertise in traditional bond markets and regulatory compliance to the security token offering. MUFG Bank & Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation: These banking giants provide crucial banking and trust services, ensuring the seamless integration of security tokens within the existing financial infrastructure. Progmat: As a blockchain platform provider, Progmat offers the technological backbone for issuing and managing security tokens, ensuring a secure and efficient platform. This collaborative approach highlights the importance of partnerships between traditional financial institutions and blockchain technology providers to drive the adoption of security tokens in mainstream finance. Looking Ahead: The Future of Corporate Bonds and Security Tokens Toyota Financial Services’ venture into security token corporate bonds is more than just a single issuance; it’s a potential catalyst for wider adoption of security tokens in the corporate bond market globally. While challenges remain, such as regulatory harmonization across jurisdictions and educating investors about this new asset class, the benefits are undeniable. Potential Future Developments: Increased Institutional Adoption: As regulatory clarity improves and success stories like Toyota’s emerge, more institutional investors are likely to allocate capital to security tokens. Expansion to Other Asset Classes: The tokenization framework proven with corporate bonds could extend to other asset classes, such as real estate, private equity, and commodities. Development of Secondary Markets: Robust secondary markets for security tokens will be crucial for liquidity and price discovery, further enhancing their attractiveness to investors. Integration with DeFi: The intersection of security tokens and decentralized finance (DeFi) could unlock new possibilities for yield generation and innovative financial products. Conclusion: A Bold Step into the Tokenized Future Toyota Financial Services’ issuance of corporate bonds as security tokens is a revolutionary move that underscores the growing convergence of traditional finance and blockchain technology. By embracing tokenization and leveraging the power of blockchain , Toyota Finance is not just issuing bonds; they are paving the way for a more efficient, transparent, and accessible financial future. This development in Japan signals a pivotal moment for the security tokens market and the broader adoption of digital assets in corporate finance.

Navigating CPI-Driven Crypto Volatility for Epic Rebound,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-cpi-crypto-volatility-rebound/,"Get ready for a rollercoaster ride in the crypto market! Bitcoin (BTC), the king of cryptocurrencies, is bracing for potential turbulence as the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report looms large. Market analysts are predicting increased crypto volatility , and for savvy investors, understanding these potential swings is key to navigating the market successfully. Let’s dive into what experts are saying and how you can prepare for what might come next. Why is the CPI Report Triggering Bitcoin Price Volatility? The upcoming release of the U.S. CPI report is sending ripples through the financial markets, and the cryptocurrency sector is no exception. Why? Because the CPI is a crucial indicator of inflation. Here’s a breakdown: Inflation Gauge: The CPI measures the average change in prices consumers pay for a basket of goods and services over time. It’s a primary way to track inflation. Federal Reserve Response: Higher-than-expected inflation figures can prompt the Federal Reserve (the Fed) to take action, often by raising interest rates to cool down the economy. Market Sensitivity: Cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin price , are sensitive to macroeconomic factors. Interest rate hikes can impact investor sentiment, often leading to shifts in investment strategies and potentially causing market downturns. Uncertainty Breeds Volatility: Anticipation surrounding the CPI report, especially if there’s uncertainty about the figures, naturally leads to increased crypto volatility as traders react to potential scenarios. According to Yann Allemann and Jan Happel, the co-founders of Glassnode and prominent voices on X (formerly Twitter) under the handle Negentropic, we should anticipate exactly this: heightened market volatility. They foresee inflation data potentially exceeding expectations, which could inject significant uncertainty into the market. This anticipation is already contributing to the current market sentiment. Decoding the Bitcoin Price Dip and Rebound Scenario Negentropic’s analysis suggests a specific scenario for Bitcoin price action in response to the CPI report. Let’s break down their prediction: Current Bitcoin Stance: Bitcoin is currently hovering around the $95,000 mark. Potential Dip Zone: They anticipate a possible, albeit brief, dip in Bitcoin price to the $92,000–$94,000 range. This dip is expected as the market absorbs liquidity, meaning there might be a temporary decrease in buying pressure. Bullish Reversal Opportunity: Crucially, this dip is viewed as a potential setup for a BTC rebound . If the predicted scenario unfolds, it could pave the way for a bullish reversal. Key Resistance Levels: The analysts highlight the $97,000–$98,500 zone as a critical level for Bitcoin to reclaim. Overcoming this resistance is seen as essential for a sustained upward movement. $100,000 Target in Sight: Successfully breaching the $97,000–$98,500 range could reignite bullish momentum, potentially setting the stage for Bitcoin to target the coveted $100,000 milestone. Actionable Insights: Navigating Crypto Volatility and Potential Rebound So, how can you, as a crypto enthusiast or investor, navigate this potentially volatile period and position yourself for a potential BTC rebound ? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on the CPI report release and subsequent market reactions. Reputable crypto news sources and analytical platforms will provide real-time updates and expert commentary. Manage Risk: Crypto volatility is inherent in the market. Avoid over-leveraging and ensure your portfolio allocation aligns with your risk tolerance. Consider diversifying your crypto holdings. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For long-term investors, DCA can be a prudent strategy during periods of volatility. Instead of trying to time the market bottom, DCA involves investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of price fluctuations. This can smooth out your entry price over time. Prepare for Opportunities: If the predicted dip to the $92,000–$94,000 range materializes, it could present a buying opportunity for those who believe in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. However, always conduct thorough research and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Monitor Key Levels: Pay close attention to the $97,000–$98,500 resistance zone. A decisive break above this level could signal the start of a more significant bullish move towards $100,000 and beyond. Bitcoin analysis is crucial: Utilize technical analysis tools and on-chain metrics to gain a deeper understanding of market trends and potential price movements. Platforms like Glassnode (co-founded by the analysts mentioned) offer valuable data and insights.

The Road Ahead: Riding the Waves of Crypto Volatility The cryptocurrency market, and Bitcoin price specifically, is known for its dynamic nature. The upcoming CPI report is just one factor that can introduce periods of crypto volatility . Understanding these potential market swings, staying informed, and having a well-thought-out strategy are crucial for navigating the crypto landscape successfully. While short-term dips can be unnerving, they can also present opportunities for those prepared to act strategically. The potential for a BTC rebound after a CPI-driven dip is a scenario that many market participants are watching closely. Whether this prediction materializes or not, the key takeaway is to remain adaptable and informed in the ever-evolving world of crypto.

40259671,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=128296,1739412394,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Critical Bitcoin Price Test: Can BTC Conquer the $97.2K Resistance?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-resistance-analysis/,"Bitcoin (BTC), the king of cryptocurrencies, is currently navigating a crucial juncture in its price journey. Data from IntoTheBlock reveals a significant hurdle: a robust resistance level looming large at $97,200. This isn’t just an arbitrary number; it represents the average purchase price for a substantial 1.57 million BTC held by approximately 1.6 million addresses. What does this mean for Bitcoin’s next move? Let’s dive into this fascinating crypto market analysis. Decoding the Bitcoin Price Resistance at $97.2K So, why is $97,200 such a critical level for Bitcoin right now? It all boils down to basic market psychology. Imagine you bought Bitcoin at an average of $97,200. The price then dropped, putting you in the red. As the price climbs back up towards your purchase price, you’re likely thinking about breaking even. This is the scenario for a large number of Bitcoin holders right now. IntoTheBlock’s data highlights this perfectly. A massive 1.57 million BTC is held by addresses that bought in around this price point. These holders, currently underwater on their investment, represent potential selling pressure. As Bitcoin approaches $97,200, many of these holders might decide to sell to recoup their initial investment or minimize losses. This influx of sell orders creates significant resistance, making it harder for Bitcoin to push through and reach new highs. Why is This Bitcoin Resistance Level So Strong? The strength of this resistance isn’t just about individual sellers; it’s a confluence of factors: Psychological Breakeven Point: As mentioned, for many holders, $97,200 is their breakeven point. Human psychology often dictates that people are more inclined to sell at breakeven to avoid further losses or simply to exit a losing position with their capital intact. Large Volume of BTC: The sheer volume of BTC involved – 1.57 million – is substantial. This isn’t a small pocket of holders; it’s a significant portion of the Bitcoin supply. When such a large group is potentially looking to sell, it naturally creates strong downward pressure. Market Dynamics: Resistance levels are self-fulfilling prophecies to some extent. Traders and algorithms identify these levels and often place sell orders around them, anticipating a price rejection. This further reinforces the resistance. [img src=”image-placeholder.jpg” alt=”Bitcoin Price Resistance at $97.2K”] Crypto Market Analysis: Beyond the $97.2K Hurdle Understanding this Bitcoin resistance level is crucial for broader crypto market analysis. Bitcoin’s price action often sets the tone for the entire cryptocurrency market. If Bitcoin struggles to break through this resistance, it could lead to: Market Consolidation: A prolonged period of price consolidation around the $97,200 level, as bulls and bears battle for control. Potential Pullback: If selling pressure intensifies, Bitcoin could experience a pullback, potentially testing lower support levels. Altcoin Impact: Bitcoin’s struggles could negatively impact altcoins, as the broader market sentiment might turn cautious. However, if Bitcoin successfully breaks through this resistance, it could signal a strong bullish continuation, potentially paving the way for new all-time highs. The crypto market is notoriously volatile, and anything can happen, but understanding these key resistance levels provides valuable insights. BTC Price Prediction: Breakout or Breakdown? Predicting the future of Bitcoin price with certainty is impossible, but we can analyze the potential scenarios based on this resistance level: Scenario Probability Market Impact Key Indicators to Watch Bullish Breakout (BTC breaks above $97.2K decisively) Medium Positive. Potential for significant upward momentum, altcoin rally. Strong buying volume, positive news flow, breaking through resistance with conviction. Rejection at Resistance (BTC fails to break $97.2K) Medium Negative to Neutral. Potential for price consolidation or pullback, cautious market sentiment. Increased selling volume near $97.2K, failure to sustain prices above this level. Prolonged Consolidation (BTC trades sideways around $97.2K) Low to Medium Neutral. Market indecision, potential for sideways trading in the short term. Balanced buying and selling volume, lack of clear directional momentum. Ultimately, the direction of Bitcoin’s price will depend on a multitude of factors, including overall market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and institutional adoption. However, the $97.2K resistance level is undoubtedly a significant point of contention right now. The Role of Bitcoin Holders at $97.2K The behavior of Bitcoin holders around this $97.2K price point is critical. Are they going to succumb to selling pressure, or will they hold strong and allow Bitcoin to break through? Here’s what to consider about these Bitcoin holders: Profit-Taking vs. Holding Strong: Some holders may see reaching their breakeven point as an opportunity to take profit, especially given the volatility of the crypto market. Others, particularly long-term holders, might see this as a temporary hurdle and remain confident in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Market Sentiment Influence: The actions of these holders will significantly influence market sentiment. If they collectively decide to sell, it could create a negative feedback loop, further pushing the price down. Conversely, if they hold, it strengthens the base for a potential breakout. Broader Market Context: Their decisions are also likely influenced by the broader market context. Positive news and overall bullish sentiment might encourage them to hold, while negative news or market uncertainty could trigger selling. Conclusion: Navigating the $97.2K Bitcoin Crossroads Bitcoin’s journey to new heights faces a significant test at the $97.2K resistance level. The data from IntoTheBlock clearly highlights the potential selling pressure from a large cohort of holders looking to break even. Whether Bitcoin can overcome this hurdle will depend on a complex interplay of market dynamics, holder behavior, and broader economic factors. For investors and traders, closely monitoring Bitcoin’s price action around $97.2K and observing market reactions will be crucial in the coming days and weeks. This critical juncture could very well determine the short-term trajectory of Bitcoin and the wider crypto market.

The often volatile and unpredictable cryptocurrency market is showing signs of maturity, with a noticeable change in investor behavior. Forget the fleeting frenzy of meme coins – smart money is now flowing towards the foundational pillars of the crypto world: Bitcoin and robust layer-1 networks . Let’s dive into this exciting development and understand what it means for the future of crypto investments. What’s Driving Crypto Investors Away from Meme Coins? According to recent insights from on-chain analytics platform Santiment, the crypto community is experiencing a significant pivot. Investors are increasingly turning their attention away from the high-risk, high-reward game of meme coins and refocusing on assets perceived as more stable and fundamentally sound. This trend is clearly highlighted by the declining interest in once-popular meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe. But what’s causing this change of heart? Meme Coin Mania is Cooling Down: The initial hype and novelty surrounding meme coins, often driven by social media trends and celebrity endorsements, are naturally waning. Investors are realizing that quick riches are rarely sustainable, and the inherent volatility of meme coins presents significant risks. Search for Real Utility: As the crypto market matures, investors are becoming more discerning. They are seeking projects that offer tangible utility, solve real-world problems, and demonstrate long-term growth potential. This naturally leads them towards assets like Bitcoin and layer-1 networks that underpin the entire crypto ecosystem. Market Correction and Risk Aversion: Market corrections and economic uncertainties often drive investors towards safer havens. In the crypto space, while still volatile compared to traditional assets, Bitcoin and established layer-1 networks are generally considered less risky than highly speculative meme coins. The Allure of Bitcoin and Layer-1 Networks: Why the Strategic Shift? So, why are crypto investors gravitating towards Bitcoin and layer-1 networks ? It boils down to a quest for substance and sustainable growth. These assets offer a compelling alternative to the meme coin frenzy, grounded in technology, utility, and broader market adoption. Bitcoin: The Digital Gold Standard Bitcoin , the original cryptocurrency, remains the king for a reason. Its benefits are well-documented and continue to attract investors: Store of Value: Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a digital store of value, similar to gold, offering a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Its scarcity (limited to 21 million coins) is a key driver of this perception. Market Dominance and Liquidity: Bitcoin boasts the highest market capitalization and liquidity in the crypto market. This makes it a relatively safer and more accessible entry point for institutional and retail investors alike. Established Infrastructure: After over a decade, Bitcoin has a well-established infrastructure, including exchanges, wallets, and custody solutions, making it easier and safer to buy, hold, and transact with. Layer-1 Networks: The Foundation of the Crypto Ecosystem Layer-1 networks , such as Ethereum, Solana, Toncoin, and Cardano, are the foundational blockchains that support the entire decentralized ecosystem. They are the platforms upon which decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi protocols, and NFTs are built. Their appeal to crypto investors stems from: Utility and Innovation: These networks are constantly evolving and innovating, driving real-world use cases through smart contracts, scalability solutions, and diverse applications. Ethereum, for instance, is the backbone of DeFi and NFTs, while Solana is known for its speed and low transaction fees. Growth Potential: As the demand for decentralized applications and services grows, the value of these layer-1 networks is expected to increase. They are essential infrastructure, and their native tokens often appreciate as their ecosystems expand. Staking and Yield Opportunities: Many layer-1 networks offer staking mechanisms, allowing holders to earn passive income by participating in network security and validation. This provides an additional incentive for long-term holding. Examples of Layer-1 Networks Gaining Investor Attention Let’s take a closer look at some of the layer-1 networks attracting significant investor interest: Layer-1 Network Key Features Why Investors are Interested Ethereum (ETH) Smart contracts, largest dApp ecosystem, DeFi and NFT leader Dominant platform, massive developer community, continuous upgrades (like the Merge) Solana (SOL) High speed, low fees, scalable, growing DeFi and NFT ecosystem Efficient and cost-effective transactions, attracting projects seeking performance Cardano (ADA) Research-driven, focus on security and sustainability, strong community Rigorous development process, long-term vision, emphasis on scalability and interoperability Toncoin (TON) Fast transactions, Telegram integration, user-friendly, growing ecosystem Seamless integration with Telegram’s massive user base, potential for widespread adoption Is This a Healthier Market Cycle?

Recent analysis suggests Bitcoin, the bellwether cryptocurrency, is at a critical juncture. A prominent market analyst is sounding the alarm, indicating that a significant Bitcoin sell-off could be on the horizon if a key support level crumbles. Let’s dive into the details and understand what this means for your crypto portfolio. Decoding the Bitcoin Price Analysis: What’s the Current Market Sentiment? According to Adam, a macro researcher from Greeks.live, the prevailing market sentiment is leaning towards bearish. This observation, shared on X (formerly Twitter), highlights a crucial shift in trader behavior. Instead of bullish optimism, we’re seeing traders actively closing their long positions. But what exactly does this mean? Closing Long Positions: In simple terms, traders who had bet on Bitcoin’s price going up (long positions) are now exiting these positions. This suggests a lack of confidence in immediate upward price movement and potentially anticipates a price decrease. Weak Price Trends: This bearish sentiment is further fueled by weak price trends. Bitcoin hasn’t been showing strong upward momentum, leading traders to believe that the price might stagnate or decline further. Overall Market Uncertainty: The combination of these factors contributes to an overall sense of uncertainty and caution within the crypto market. This bearish outlook forms the backdrop for the analyst’s crucial warning regarding a critical Bitcoin support level. The Critical Bitcoin Support Level: $92K–$94K – A Line in the Sand? Adam points to a key support level around $95,000 that has been tested recently. However, the truly critical zone lies slightly lower, between $92,000 and $94,000. Why is this range so important, and what could happen if it breaks? Why is the $92K–$94K Zone a Potential Trigger for a Bitcoin Sell-Off? Support levels in trading act as floors, areas where buying interest is expected to outweigh selling pressure, preventing further price declines. However, if a support level is decisively broken, it signals a shift in market dynamics. In the context of this Bitcoin sell-off warning, here’s what a break below $92K–$94K could signify: Triggering Stop-Loss Orders: Many traders place stop-loss orders just below key support levels to limit potential losses. If Bitcoin’s price falls below $94K and then $92K, these stop-loss orders could be triggered, automatically initiating sell orders. Increased Selling Pressure: As stop-loss orders execute, they add to the existing selling pressure. This can create a snowball effect, leading to a rapid and potentially massive sell-off as more and more traders rush to exit their positions. Psychological Impact: Breaking a significant support level can also have a negative psychological impact on the market. It can reinforce bearish sentiment, leading to further selling based on fear and panic. Therefore, the $92,000–$94,000 zone isn’t just another price point; it’s a potential tipping point that could exacerbate selling pressure and lead to a significant downward move for Bitcoin. Hope on the Horizon? Examining Potential Rebound Factors in the Crypto Market Despite the bearish warnings, the analysis isn’t entirely devoid of hope. Adam also highlights a potentially bullish counterpoint: significant buy orders lurking just below the surface. What are these buy orders, and could they prevent a Bitcoin sell-off ? Large Buy Orders: A Safety Net or a False Dawn? The report mentions substantial buy orders totaling around 900 BTC positioned between current price levels and $98,000. This is a noteworthy observation because: Demand at Lower Prices: These buy orders indicate that there is still significant demand for Bitcoin at lower price levels. Large investors or institutions might be looking to accumulate Bitcoin if the price dips. Potential for a Rapid Rebound: If these buy orders are strong enough, they could absorb selling pressure and potentially trigger a rapid rebound. Imagine a scenario where the price dips slightly, triggers some stop-losses, but then encounters a wall of buying demand – this could lead to a sharp reversal. Low Volume and Volatility Context: The current market conditions, characterized by low volume and volatility (around 45-48%), are also important. In a low-volume environment, large buy orders can have a more pronounced impact on price movement. However, it’s crucial to remember that the presence of buy orders doesn’t guarantee a rebound. Market dynamics are complex, and several factors can influence the ultimate price direction. The CPI Release and Options Activity: What’s Next for the Crypto Market? Adding another layer of complexity to the current situation is the upcoming release of the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI). This economic data release is a closely watched indicator of inflation and can significantly impact financial markets, including the crypto market . How does the CPI and options activity factor into the Bitcoin outlook? CPI Release: A Potential Catalyst for Volatility The CPI release can act as a catalyst for increased volatility in the crypto market. Here’s why: Inflation Expectations: The CPI data provides insights into inflation trends. Higher-than-expected inflation could lead to expectations of more aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, which can be negative for risk assets like Bitcoin. Market Reaction: The market’s reaction to the CPI data is often swift and significant. Depending on whether the data is perceived as positive or negative, we could see sharp price swings in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Options Positioning: The analyst notes that options activity suggests traders are adjusting their positions ahead of the CPI release. This implies that traders are anticipating potential volatility and are positioning themselves to profit from or hedge against price fluctuations. Therefore, the CPI release is a key event to watch in the coming days. It could either exacerbate bearish sentiment or provide a catalyst for a potential rebound, depending on the data and market interpretation. Navigating the Volatile Bitcoin Landscape: Key Takeaways and Actionable Insights The current Bitcoin price analysis paints a picture of uncertainty and potential volatility. While a Bitcoin sell-off remains a possibility if the $92K–$94K support breaks, there are also factors that could support a rebound. So, what are the key takeaways and actionable insights for crypto enthusiasts and investors? Key Observation Potential Implication Actionable Insight Bearish market sentiment and closing of long positions Increased risk of downward price pressure Exercise caution, consider risk management strategies like setting stop-loss orders. Critical support zone at $92K–$94K Break below could trigger a significant sell-off Closely monitor price action around this level. Be prepared for potential volatility. Large buy orders between current levels and $98K Potential for a rebound if support holds or dip is shallow Don’t rule out the possibility of a positive price reversal. Look for signs of buying strength. Upcoming CPI release Increased market volatility expected Stay informed about economic data releases. Be prepared for potential price swings and adjust trading strategies accordingly. In conclusion, the Bitcoin market is at a fascinating crossroads. The analyst’s warning of a potential massive sell-off if the crucial support breaks is a serious consideration. However, the presence of significant buy orders and the upcoming CPI release introduce elements of uncertainty and potential for both downside and upside volatility. Navigating this landscape requires vigilance, informed decision-making, and a robust risk management strategy.

The ever-optimistic Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Investment Management, has dropped another bombshell Bitcoin price prediction that’s sending ripples through the financial world. If you thought previous forecasts were ambitious, prepare to have your mind blown. Wood now envisions Bitcoin potentially hitting a staggering $1.5 million by 2030. Let’s dive deep into this explosive forecast and explore what it means for the future of digital gold. Cathie Wood’s Jaw-Dropping $1.5 Million Bitcoin Price Prediction In a recent video update on Ark Investment’s official YouTube channel, Cathie Wood reiterated her bullish stance on Bitcoin, not just as a digital asset, but as a burgeoning Bitcoin institutional adoption story. She boldly stated that Bitcoin could skyrocket to $1.5 million by the end of the decade. This isn’t just a casual guess; it’s a projection rooted in Ark Invest’s research and conviction in Bitcoin’s evolving role in the global financial landscape. For those who follow Wood’s pronouncements, this isn’t entirely new territory. Back in December 2023, in an interview with CNBC, she already hinted at this possibility. At the time, her base case was a Bitcoin price prediction of over $600,000 before 2030, but she also laid out a more optimistic scenario – the very $1.5 million figure that’s now capturing headlines. Here’s a quick recap of Cathie Wood’s evolving Bitcoin 2030 price targets: Date Prediction Source December 2023 Base Case: $600,000+ by 2030 CNBC Interview Present Optimistic Case: $1.5 Million by 2030 Ark Investment YouTube Channel So, what’s fueling this incredible optimism? Let’s break down the key factors driving Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest Bitcoin thesis. The Power of Institutional Adoption for Bitcoin’s Price Surge The core of Wood’s argument rests on the accelerating Bitcoin institutional adoption . She emphasizes that Bitcoin is no longer a fringe asset class but is rapidly maturing into a mainstream component of institutional portfolios. This shift is crucial because institutional investors bring in significantly larger capital flows compared to retail investors alone. Imagine pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and major corporations allocating even a small percentage of their vast assets to Bitcoin – the impact on demand and price would be substantial. Here’s why institutional interest is a game-changer: Increased Legitimacy: Institutional involvement validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset, reducing perceived risk and attracting even more institutions. Larger Capital Inflows: Institutions manage trillions of dollars. Even a small allocation can inject billions into the Bitcoin market, driving up prices. Long-Term Investment Horizon: Institutions often have longer investment horizons, reducing short-term volatility and creating a more stable and mature market. Diversification Benefits: Bitcoin offers diversification benefits due to its low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds, making it attractive for portfolio diversification strategies. Wood highlights that while a $1.5 million Bitcoin price prediction might sound outlandish, the probability of it materializing has actually increased. This is largely due to the growing acceptance and integration of Bitcoin into the traditional financial system. Bitcoin as an Institutional Asset Class: Benefits and Challenges The journey of Bitcoin to becoming a fully recognized Bitcoin institutional adoption asset class is not without its hurdles. Let’s examine both the compelling benefits and the potential challenges: Benefits of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption: Inflation Hedge: In an era of potential inflationary pressures, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a store of value and a hedge against inflation, similar to gold but with digital advantages. Diversification: As mentioned earlier, Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional markets offers valuable diversification benefits, reducing overall portfolio risk. Potential for High Returns: The upside potential of Bitcoin, as highlighted by Wood’s Bitcoin price prediction , offers the prospect of significant returns, attractive in a low-yield environment. Decentralization and Security: Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and robust cryptography offer security and censorship resistance, appealing to institutions seeking assets outside traditional financial systems. Challenges of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption: Volatility: Bitcoin remains a volatile asset, which can be a concern for risk-averse institutions. However, as the market matures and institutional participation grows, volatility is expected to decrease over time. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Clarity and consistent regulations are crucial for widespread institutional adoption. Custody and Security Concerns: Institutions require robust and secure custody solutions for managing large Bitcoin holdings. The development of institutional-grade custody services is essential. Environmental Concerns: Bitcoin’s energy consumption has been a point of criticism. However, efforts are underway to transition towards more sustainable mining practices, and institutions are increasingly focusing on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors. Is a $1.5 Million Bitcoin Price Prediction Realistic by 2030? The million-dollar question (or rather, the $1.5 million question!) is: can Bitcoin 2030 really reach this price target? While no one has a crystal ball, let’s consider some factors that could contribute to or hinder this ambitious forecast. Factors Supporting a $1.5 Million Bitcoin Price: Continued Institutional Adoption: If institutional adoption accelerates as Wood predicts, the demand-side pressure could be immense. Limited Supply: Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins creates inherent scarcity. As demand increases and supply remains fixed, prices are likely to rise. Halving Events: Bitcoin’s halving events, which reduce the reward for mining new blocks, further constrain supply over time, historically leading to price surges. Global Economic Uncertainty: In times of economic uncertainty, geopolitical instability, or currency devaluation, Bitcoin’s safe-haven appeal could strengthen. Technological Advancements: Improvements in Bitcoin’s scalability, security, and usability could further drive adoption and value. Potential Headwinds for Bitcoin Price Growth: Regulatory Crackdowns: Aggressive regulatory actions or outright bans in major economies could significantly impact Bitcoin’s price. Black Swan Events: Unforeseen global events or economic crises could trigger market-wide sell-offs, including Bitcoin. Competition from Other Cryptocurrencies: The emergence of compelling alternative cryptocurrencies could potentially divert some capital away from Bitcoin. Technological Failures: While unlikely, any major technological flaw discovered in Bitcoin’s protocol could erode trust and value. What Does This Mean for Investors? Actionable Insights on Bitcoin Investment Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest Bitcoin projection, while bold, underscores the potential long-term growth trajectory of Bitcoin. For investors, this raises some crucial questions and actionable insights: Consider Bitcoin as a Long-Term Investment: Wood’s Bitcoin 2030 forecast is a long-term outlook. If you believe in the institutional adoption narrative, consider Bitcoin as a part of a diversified long-term investment portfolio. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Given Bitcoin’s volatility, dollar-cost averaging – investing a fixed amount regularly – can be a prudent strategy to mitigate risk and capitalize on long-term growth. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): While Wood’s analysis is insightful, always conduct your own thorough research before making any investment decisions. Understand the risks and rewards involved in Bitcoin. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments, technological advancements, and institutional adoption trends in the cryptocurrency space. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose, and ensure Bitcoin aligns with your overall risk tolerance and investment goals. Conclusion: The Explosive Potential of Bitcoin Cathie Wood’s jaw-dropping Bitcoin price prediction of $1.5 million by 2030 is undoubtedly audacious, but it’s grounded in a compelling narrative of increasing Bitcoin institutional adoption and Bitcoin’s evolving role as a significant asset class. Whether this exact target is reached remains to be seen, but Wood’s forecast highlights the immense potential that many see in Bitcoin’s future. As the digital asset landscape continues to mature and institutions further embrace cryptocurrencies, the journey of Bitcoin is likely to be anything but boring. Keep watching this space – the crypto revolution is far from over, and the most exciting chapters might still be ahead.

Expert Reveals Crypto Sentiment Divide and Bitcoin Price Surge Potential,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-sentiment-alt-season-bitcoin/,"Is the crypto market sending mixed signals? Absolutely. While headlines often focus on price swings, a fascinating divergence is unfolding beneath the surface. Leading crypto expert Matt Hougan, CIO of Bitwise, has highlighted a striking split in crypto sentiment : Institutional investors are charging in with bullish conviction, while retail investors are showing historic levels of pessimism. Could this unusual dynamic be the secret signal for the next big alt season ? Let’s dive into this intriguing market scenario. Decoding the Crypto Sentiment Divide: Bullish Institutions vs. Cautious Retail The cryptocurrency market is rarely monolithic. Currently, it’s displaying a stark contrast in investor behavior. On one side, we have institutional investors , the big players with deep pockets, demonstrating unwavering optimism. On the other, retail investors , the everyday crypto enthusiasts, are exhibiting caution, even pessimism. This divergence isn’t just interesting; it could be a key indicator of future market movements. Institutional Investors: Riding the Bullish Wave Let’s break down why institutions are so bullish: Record ETF Inflows: Crypto ETFs, particularly Bitcoin ETFs, are seeing unprecedented inflows of capital. This signifies strong institutional demand and a willingness to allocate significant funds to crypto assets. Growing Institutional Adoption: Major corporations, traditional financial institutions, and even sovereign wealth funds are increasingly exploring and investing in cryptocurrencies. This broad adoption validates crypto as a legitimate asset class. Long-Term Vision: Institutions often operate with a longer investment horizon. They are less swayed by short-term volatility and more focused on the long-term potential of blockchain technology and digital assets. Retail Investors: Navigating Altcoin Underperformance In contrast, retail sentiment is lagging. Why the caution? Altcoin Underperformance: While Bitcoin has shown resilience and even growth, many altcoins have struggled. This underperformance can erode retail investor confidence, who often gravitate towards altcoins for higher potential gains (and losses). Market Fatigue: After periods of market volatility and uncertainty, retail investors can experience fatigue and become risk-averse. The perceived lack of immediate, substantial gains in altcoins can contribute to this pessimism. Focus on Bitcoin Dominance: Bitcoin’s strong performance often overshadows the altcoin market. When Bitcoin dominates, it can create a perception that altcoins are less attractive or riskier investments. The Alt Season Opportunity: Is Pessimism the Perfect Setup? Here’s where things get interesting. Matt Hougan suggests that this very pessimism amongst retail investors, coupled with strong institutional demand, could be the perfect breeding ground for an alt season . Why? Contrarian Indicator: Often, the best investment opportunities arise when sentiment is low. When everyone is bearish, it can signal that the market is oversold and ripe for a reversal. Pent-Up Demand: Retail investors may be sitting on the sidelines, but their interest in altcoins hasn’t vanished. If market conditions improve and positive catalysts emerge, this pent-up demand could fuel a significant altcoin rally. Market Fundamentals Strengthening: Hougan points out that market fundamentals are indeed strengthening. Increased adoption, technological advancements, and growing use cases are laying a solid foundation for future growth in the broader crypto market, including altcoins. Bitcoin Price: The Catalyst for Altcoin Rally? Bitcoin price plays a crucial role in the altcoin narrative. Hougan believes that Bitcoin’s supply-demand dynamics are exceptionally strong, potentially driving its price to new all-time highs. How does this relate to altcoins? Bitcoin as the Market Leader: Bitcoin often acts as the bellwether for the crypto market. A strong Bitcoin performance can boost overall market confidence and investor sentiment, creating a more favorable environment for altcoins. Capital Rotation: Historically, after Bitcoin experiences a significant rally, profits often rotate into altcoins. Investors may seek higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities in altcoins once Bitcoin has established a strong uptrend. Increased Liquidity: A rising Bitcoin price can inject more liquidity into the entire crypto market. This increased liquidity can benefit altcoins, making it easier for them to rally. Navigating the Potential Alt Season: Actionable Insights So, how can you position yourself to potentially benefit from a future alt season? Stay Informed on Crypto Sentiment: Keep an eye on market sentiment indicators, both institutional and retail. Divergences can signal emerging opportunities. Research Promising Altcoins: Don’t just chase hype. Focus on altcoins with strong fundamentals, innovative technology, and real-world use cases. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your crypto portfolio across different asset classes, including Bitcoin and select altcoins. Manage Risk Wisely: Altcoins are inherently more volatile than Bitcoin. Invest only what you can afford to lose and use risk management strategies like stop-loss orders. Patience is Key: Alt seasons don’t happen overnight. Be prepared to hold your altcoin investments for the medium to long term to realize their potential. Conclusion: Is the Crypto Market Primed for an Exciting Turnaround? The current crypto landscape presents a fascinating paradox. While retail crypto sentiment may be subdued due to recent altcoin performance, the underlying strength of institutional investors and the bullish outlook on Bitcoin price suggest a compelling narrative. Matt Hougan’s analysis points towards a potential alt season brewing beneath the surface of market pessimism. By understanding these dynamics and acting strategically, investors can position themselves to potentially capitalize on the next wave of crypto market growth. The secret signal might just be the sentiment divide itself – a contrarian indicator whispering of opportunity amidst the caution.

Why is it possible?,https://crypto.news/armstrong-says-billions-of-people-will-use-bitcoin-by-2030/,"Commenting on an X post about the high speed of crypto adoption, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said that several billion people will be using Bitcoin by 2030. Armstrong was commenting on a post that shares the statistics from the recent BlackRock study. It says that crypto hit the 300 million users landmark in just 12 years. Allegedly, it is 43% quicker than a mobile phone adoption and 20% quicker than an Internet adoption. It really depends what you count as the official start year – for Bitcoin, Internet, and mobile phones – to make this comparison. But regardless, this is directionally correct. Bitcoin adoption should get to several billion people by 2030 at current rates. https://t.co/JEU8P7YmLP — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) February 10, 2025 Reposting this post, Armstrong added that the estimation may vary depending on what we see as the starting day of the Internet or mobile phone adoption, but he agrees with the overall direction of the BlackRock findings. Coinbase CEO concluded that by 2030, several billion people will be using Bitcoin. You might also like: Crypto adoption beats mobile phones by 43% and Internet by 20%, reports BlackRock BlackRock study According to a BlackRock study released in January 2025, Bitcoin experienced rapid adoption, quickly attracting the attention of both individual and institutional investors. The study stresses the increasing relevance of Bitcoin in times when the general public loses trust in traditional financial institutions. More than that, the study outlines the global trend aimed at making digital money easier for the masses. The study suggests it took 21 years for mobile phones to reach the 300 million users mark. The count begins with 1972, when the first cellular mobile phone was used. The same amount of users was reached by the Internet in 15 years, starting with 1983, the official year of the Internet creation. On top of the questionability of the dates chosen as the starting dates for the Internet and mobile phone adoption expressed by Brian Armstrong, some people question the methodology used to count the number of Bitcoin users. What counts as a user in this? I think it might be the number of addresses, but keep in mind that many of these haven't been touched in years. Also, one person can have more than one address. In fact, because of Bitcoin's poor privacy, many people create a new address every… pic.twitter.com/imYux7SWIr — Victor (@VictorMoneroXMR) February 9, 2025 The study doesn’t reveal the source of the number of Bitcoin users and what are the criteria for someone to fit the ‘Bitcoin user’ definition. Other studies According to the Chainalysis article, in December 2018, of 460 million Bitcoin addresses, only 172 million addresses had economic relevancy . The article notes that 25 million addresses were associated with private holders, while the rest were the addresses of exchanges, dark web marketplaces, and other platforms. This data refers to the times when Bitcoin was ten years old. The number of addresses doesn’t represent the actual number of Bitcoin users or owners, as one person can have a potentially infinite amount of addresses. In contrast, the addresses used on exchanges may be used by several people simultaneously. The BiTBO findings show that only around 106 million people own Bitcoin as of 2025. It is not clear if BlackRock considers ex-owners to be Bitcoin users. According to the study, Bitcoin is used by a mere 500k people a day. For comparison, Visa processes over 700 million transactions daily. Although the Bitcoin network does substantially fewer transactions than traditional payment operators, it allegedly outperforms both Visa and MasterCard in terms of the combined daily value of operated transactions. Bitcoin sends approximately $46.4 billion per day, while Visa operates around $38.9 billion per day, and MasterCard transacts around $24.7 billion each day. Does Armstrong’s prediction look realistic? Comparing Bitcoin to cell phones in terms of adoption is pretty hard, considering that phones are getting increasingly cheaper while Bitcoin is getting more expensive. The modern-day services are designed for smartphone owners, while Bitcoin enthusiasts have to look for opportunities to buy, store, or spend crypto in spite of hurdles. At large, these differences can be attributed to the fact that Bitcoin is much younger than the first commercially available cell phone that hit the market in 1984. More than that, cellphones were never deemed ‘crime telephones’ or something like this, while Bitcoin is still seen as drug money or a tool for money laundering and corruption by some. Bitcoin is a tough war on the part of several governments, but that’s not something that mobile phones have gone through. It took around 30 years for cell phones to become ubiquitous. By 2014, the number of active cell phones had reached around 7 billion. By 2005, when mobile phones were on the market for 21 years, over 60% of adults in the U.S. owned them. In 2030, Bitcoin will be 21 years old, and it doesn’t seem that it will be as widespread as cell phones in 2005. It takes great effort from regulators and businesses around the world to make Bitcoin as simple and safe to use as mobile phones to make billions of people use it. El Salvador made a bold move by making Bitcoin a legal tender. Still, it retreated after a three-and-a-half-year experiment with data showing that most residents didn’t even try to use Bitcoins despite the fact that it was legal and encouraged by the government.

The Extension That Determines Where Price Goes Next",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-166000-target-in-play/,"Crypto analyst CryptoCon has reaffirmed that a Bitcoin price rally to the $166,000 target is still in play. The analyst further revealed what needs to happen for the flagship crypto to reach this ambitious price target. What Determines The Bitcoin Price Rally To $166,000 In an X post, CryptoCon stated that the Bitcoin price simply needs to mirror its last year’s move in order to reach the next rung on this hyper-accurate extension in March. His accompanying chart showed that the next rung is at the $166,000 price level. Meanwhile, Bitcoin recorded a significant price rally between January 2024 and March 2024, a historical move CryptoCon believes the flagship crypto needs to mirror to reach this target. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Not The End Of The Road As Analyst Shares Roadmap To $200,000 The analyst remarked that it might seem ridiculous, but he asserted that a run to this $166,000 target next month is not far-fetched. A few days ago, CryptoCoon predicted that the Bitcoin price could rally to $160,000 in the next thirty days, meaning it could hit this target by next month. These predictions undoubtedly provide some optimism, especially considering the downward pressure that the flagship crypto is currently facing. Meanwhile, CryptoCon also suggested that there was the possibility of the Bitcoin rally to $166,000 taking longer. However, he added that the cycle isn’t over, and this price target isn’t going anywhere, indicating that BTC will reach it in this bull market. Market experts like research firm Matrixport have also predicted that Bitcoin could rally to $160,000 this year. Meanwhile, asset manager Bitwise predicted that the Bitcoin price would rally to $200,000 this year. Standard Chartered also asserted that BTC reaching around $200,000 by year-end is achievable. State Of Things For BTC Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto provided some insights into the current Bitcoin price action. In an X post, he stated that BTC is still holding the higher timeframe support zone at $94,553. As long as BTC continues to hold this support zone, he expects some further consolidation around this area. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4th Wave Ends With Price Crash To $91,000, 5th Wave Shows $210,000 Is Coming The crypto analyst also drew attention to a potential PO3 that was forming for the Bitcoin price at these levels. He remarked that he would like to see a move below the lows at $94,100 and then reclaim and push to local supply right above the last local highs. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez also confirmed that the Bitcoin price is in a consolidation phase. He revealed that BTC’s accumulation trend score is zero, which signals a period of consolidation. The crypto analyst added that a shift in demand here could set the stage for the next big move. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $95,800, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Volatility is through the roof, leaving investors scrambling for something more stable—something that promises long-term growth instead of quick, risky speculation. But amidst the chaos, one name is shining through: Lightchain AI . Already making waves with a presale that’s raised over $15.3 million and a price of just $0.006, Lightchain AI is carving out its place as a game-changing alternative. With cutting-edge blockchain solutions built for sustainability and security, this project is proving there’s hope beyond the turmoil. Why Crypto Prices Are Crashing—And What It Means for Investors Cryptocurrency markets have recently experienced significant downturns, primarily due to geopolitical tensions and economic policy shifts. President Donald Trump’s announcement of substantial tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China has heightened market uncertainty, leading investors to retreat from riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, for instance, saw a decline of approximately 4.1%, trading around $95,400, while Ethereum dropped by 17% to $2,577. The overall market capitalization decreased from about $3.6 trillion to $3.1 trillion. This volatility underscores the sensitivity of digital assets to global economic developments. Investors should exercise caution, recognizing the inherent risks and ensuring their portfolios are diversified to mitigate potential losses during such turbulent periods. How Lightchain AI Provides Stability in a Volatile Market Lightchain AI stands apart from speculative assets by focusing on innovation and utility. Its AI-Powered Automated Scaling dynamically adjusts network resources to handle increased transaction loads, eliminating bottlenecks and improving overall blockchain performance. This gives it a significant edge over outdated systems that struggle under high demand. Another key feature is its Adaptive Smart Contracts, which introduce unparalleled flexibility by adjusting contract parameters based on real-time data. This not only enhances efficiency but also reduces the risk of security vulnerabilities , making it a more reliable solution for blockchain applications. Lightchain AI’s focus on scalability and adaptability positions it as a cutting-edge platform designed to meet the evolving demands of modern blockchain technology. tor Confidence Market Shift Is Happening—Are You Positioned for It? As crypto prices remain volatile, investors are turning to projects that promise sustainable growth and innovative technology. Lightchain AI stands out with its unique blockchain features designed for the future. Its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) introduces a dedicated layer for AI-specific tasks like model training and inference, fully integrated into the blockchain. Additionally, the groundbreaking Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism not only secures the network but also rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations. With impressive presale performance and cutting-edge functionality, Lightchain AI is emerging as one of the most promising alternatives in the crypto market.

While Ripple’s (XRP) global expansion continues to get attention, a larger development is occurring. WallitIQ (WLTQ) , a platform that is transforming blockchain-based financial solutions , is attracting the attention of major banks and institutional investors. Banks Bets Big On This AI Altcoin Over Ripple (XRP) In An Unseen Power Play. Ripple (XRP) has dominated the institutional blockchain adoption market for many years, capitalizing on the token’s effective cross-border payment solutions. Given that Ripple (XRP) is trading at $2.44, some predict its real breakout moment is imminent. Despite Ripple’s (XRP) rise, major banks are placing their attention elsewhere. WallitIQ (WLTQ), the new attention center, is quickly becoming the most promising AI cryptocurrency. Ripple (XRP) is benefiting from its banking alliances. Major banks, however, recognize the WallitIQ (WLTQ) AI altcoin potential to transform the sector and are supporting it. For instance, the AI altcoin is heavily ingrained in the platform’s AI-driven cryptocurrency system. This contrasts Ripple (XRP), which is mainly used for payments. In addition, many investors, including banks, understand the underlying influence of AI in the economy and how it spreads across the financial industry. These investors underpin WallitIQ (WLTQ) as a forerunner due to its technological capacity to incorporate AI-powered automation into cryptocurrency transactions. To this end, cryptocurrency transactions are becoming an attractive and long-term investment option for these investors. The AI Altcoin With Massive Financial Backing That’s Changing Everything Ripple (XRP) extends its reach across international payment systems, while WallitIQ (WLTQ) redefines how people interact with cryptocurrency assets. Its AI-powered cryptocurrency wallet management app is revolutionizing the market with its unrivaled automated transaction features, real-time market tracking, and smooth multi-wallet integration. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) app is designed to be user-friendly and efficient. It offers multiple wallet management, simulated transactions, and AI-powered insights on when to buy and sell assets. In addition, its interactive charts offer sophisticated analytical tools for well-informed investment decision-making. At the same time, CoinGecko’s live market data integration guarantees that investors can always access the most recent pricing information. With WallitIQ (WLTQ), trading becomes increasingly easy with quick cryptocurrency swaps that let customers trade assets for little money. Custom price notifications inform investors of significant market fluctuations, and scheduled cryptocurrency purchases allow investors to automate their purchases at predetermined periods. Furthermore, a smart contract audit by SolidProof helps identify security as a core feature of WallitIQ (WLTQ). Aside from the audit, the platform uses AI fraud detection to prevent suspicious activity. Above all, a significant milestone in the platform’s development is approaching with an anticipated beta platform launch . Investors are realizing that this AI altcoin is a fully fledged ecosystem with practical applications rather than just another cryptocurrency. The rapid growth of this AI altcoin has already exceeded experts’ estimates. Over 300 million tokens have been sold in a short period, raising more than $7 million. There is no doubt about the significant profit potential, given the token cap of 1 billion. Analysts who previously focused solely on Ripple’s (XRP) global growth are now highlighting the disruptive potential of this AI altcoin. Some even claim that its AI-driven system will surpass the innovations of Ripple’s (XRP) blockchain. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Will Become The Future Of AI Crypto Trading Major banks are turning their attention to WallitIQ (WLTQ) . This platform is poised to redefine the crypto sector as Ripple’s (XRP) worldwide expansion propels the AI altcoin to new heights. Selling at a presale price of $0.0420 , the next crypto breakthrough is already here, alongside the support of major banks. Similar to how Ripple (XRP) rose to fame, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is currently becoming the AI altcoin with the potential to be a competent rival. Before this opportunity becomes widely known, lock down your assets at $0.0420 and set yourself up for the kind of rewards that have the potential to change your financial future completely!

While major tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) , and Ethereum (ETH) have strong use cases, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL sets itself apart as the most exciting opportunity for exponential value creation. Here’s why this token is dominating the conversation. Why THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL Stands Out 1. Limited Supply Creates Scarcity With a total supply capped at 100 billion tokens, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL ensures scarcity that fuels long-term value. Unlike BTC and LTC, which have slower growth due to high circulation, this token’s deflationary model guarantees increasing demand. 2. Exclusive Availability Unlike UNI and DOT, which are available on multiple exchanges, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL is sold exclusively at magacoinofficial.com . This exclusivity gives early adopters an edge and keeps the token’s growth stable and controlled. >>>>> PRESALE SELLING OUT – CLICK HERE TO SECURE YOUR SPOT! > OVER $1.9 MILLION SOLD INSTANTLY – PRESALE SELLING OUT FAST! CLICK HERE NOW! 3. Unparalleled Growth Potential Analysts project that THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL could deliver returns of up to 2,000%, thanks to its early-stage momentum and community-driven development. While Bitcoin and Polkadot are well-established, they can’t match the rapid trajectory of this groundbreaking token. 4. Investor Demand at Record Levels Raising $1,000,000 within minutes of its presale launch, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL has proven its appeal. Investors recognize its potential to redefine the market, driving interest far beyond what UNI, BTC, or LTC have recently seen. How THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL Compares Uniswap (UNI): A strong DeFi platform but lacks the exclusivity and demand-driving scarcity of THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL . Polkadot (DOT): Reliable for interoperability but cannot match the early-stage explosive growth seen here. Bitcoin (BTC): A store of value, yet its market maturity limits growth opportunities compared to THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL . Litecoin (LTC): Known for efficiency, but it hasn’t captured the market excitement that this new token has.

Web3Bay’s presale is on fire, XRP price target predictions are hitting astronomical figures, and Ethereum is facing headwinds. Let’s dive into the details! Web3Bay has already raked in over $1.08 million in its presale, with over 275 million tokens flying off the virtual shelves. Early birds who snagged 3BAY at the initial $0.003 price are looking at a potential 6,430% return when it launches at $0.1959. Even now, in Stage 4, with tokens priced at $0.004562625, a 4,200% ROI is on the table for savvy investors. But the clock is ticking, this stage is expected to sell out very soon! XRP Price Target: A Moonshot to $13? XRP has shown remarkable resilience, holding steady at the $3 support level—a price point not seen in seven years. This has ignited excitement, with some analysts projecting a jaw-dropping $13 XRP price target. EGRAG Crypto, a well-known market analyst, points to XRP’s recent move above the Bull Market Support Band (BMSB) as a signal of significant strength. His XRP price target forecasts a range from $8 to $13, which translates to a 159% to 322% surge. While market conditions will play a role, the technical indicators paint a very bullish picture for XRP. Imagine the ripple effect if the XRP price target of $13 is reached! It would send shockwaves through the entire digital asset ecosystem. The potential for XRP to reach its $13 price target is a hot topic among investors right now. Ethereum Price Analysis: Navigating Choppy Waters While XRP is riding high, Ethereum faces some significant challenges. Recent Ethereum price analysis reveals increasing sell pressure. Exchange supply has risen from 15.39 million to 16.04 million ETH, suggesting potential sell-offs. Further adding to the concern, Ethereum ETFs have experienced substantial outflows of $141 million this week. This indicates a cautious, or even bearish, sentiment among some large investors. Despite these challenges, Ethereum maintains crucial support levels between $2,230 and $2,610. This range is supported by nearly 12 million wallets holding a substantial 62 million ETH. Analysts suggest this zone could provide some stability, but Ethereum’s near-term performance is heavily dependent on the overall market climate. Whether Ethereum can hold above its support levels and weather the storm remains to be seen. The Ethereum price analysis is something every investor should be paying attention to. Web3Bay: Putting Users in the Driver’s Seat Traditional e-commerce platforms operate under a centralized model, where a single entity controls all aspects of the business. They set the fees, manage user data, and make all the decisions. Web3Bay is turning this model on its head. By implementing a decentralized governance system, Web3Bay puts the power back into the hands of its users. Holding 3BAY tokens gives users a direct voice in the platform’s future. Community members can propose changes, vote on policies, and influence key decisions, from transaction fees to platform features. Once a majority of the tokens are in circulation, Web3Bay will transition into a fully decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), making governance entirely community-driven. Even Web3Bay itself won’t have control over the platform’s smart contracts after full decentralization. This eliminates the risk of sudden policy changes or arbitrary account bans. Instead, the marketplace will be shaped by the very people who use it. This revolutionary approach has attracted a massive community from across the digital asset space. The presale has been a resounding success, with over 275 million tokens sold and more than $1.08 million raised. Early investors who participated in Stage 1 at $0.003 per token are looking at a potential 6,430% ROI at launch. For those who missed Stage 1, there’s still a chance to grab a 4,200% ROI by purchasing 3BAY at the current $0.004562625 price during Stage 4. But don’t wait too long, this stage is expected to sell out quickly! The Web3Bay presale numbers speak for themselves. Key Takeaways The XRP price target is projected between $8 and $13. Achieving this would represent a 159% to 322% increase, potentially reshaping perceptions of XRP within the crypto community. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s price analysis has revealed some concerning trends, with exchange supply increasing and Ethereum ETFs experiencing significant outflows, indicating potential sell pressure. Despite these challenges, Ethereum has strong support levels that could provide stability. Beyond price predictions and market sentiment, the digital asset world is undergoing a major transformation with Web3Bay redefining ownership and control in e-commerce. Early 3BAY investors are poised for a 6,430% return at launch, and even current presale participants can see a 4,200% ROI if they jump in now. But with the presale heating up and nearing its end, time is of the essence!

SEC To Discuss ‘Settlements’ And Other Legal Matters Today appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The ripple effect in the XRP community is palpable as the SEC gears up for another closed-door meeting, scheduled for February 13, 2025. This marks the third consecutive weekly closed session under the Sunshine Act, and the excitement is building. Could this be the meeting where the SEC finally pulls the plug on its appeal against Ripple, leading to a significant rally? The stakes are high as XRP’s future may rest on the commission’s next steps. A withdrawal of the appeal could potentially trigger a surge, pushing XRP toward a new all-time high. At the same time, the market is awaiting greater legal clarity, as asset managers are keenly interested in XRP ETFs. Key Topics on the Agenda Institution and settlement of administrative proceedings; Institution and settlement of injunctive actions; Resolution of litigation claims; and Other matters relating to examinations and enforcement proceedings. In particular, the meeting will address the institution and settlement of injunctive actions, administrative proceedings, and the resolution of litigation claims—subjects closely tied to the ongoing SEC vs. Ripple case. Experts are speculating that an official move toward resolving the SEC vs. Ripple case could set off a massive rally within the broader crypto space. The potential end of this legal battle could also pave the way for a Ripple IPO and open up other market opportunities, possibly leading to a more favorable tax environment for XRP holders. While the immediate focus is on the SEC’s next moves, many are looking beyond the Ripple case to the broader regulatory landscape. The SEC’s establishment of a new task force to clarify crypto rules under the Trump Administration has led to optimism that clearer regulations are on the horizon.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-13 03:07:27

The bill makes New Mexico join other states that are also working to establish Bitcoin Reserves for their respective treasury departments. New Mexico has introduced Senate Bill 275 (SB 275), also known as the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act. Senator Anthony Thornton introduced the bill proposing a 5% allocation of New Mexico’s public funds into Bitcoin. New Mexico begins exploring Bitcoin through its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act Another state making moves! 🚀 New Mexico joins the Bitcoin reserve race—who's next? — Giannis Andreou (@gandreou007) February 12, 2025 The 5% of funds will be drawn from various state funds, including the grant permanent fund, severance tax permanent fund, tobacco settlement permanent fund, and other state funds that the state investment council deems appropriate. New Mexico has joined other U.S. states in the race to Bitcoin reserves. In November 2024, Pennsylvania proposed a bill centered around the creation and establishment of a Bitcoin reserve becoming among the first states to pursue BTC reserves. The Pennsylvania Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act would allow the state’s treasury to hold Bitcoin in its reserves once passed into law. The act proposed that the state seclude 10% of its general fund, investment fund, and rainy day fund into the digital asset. The state’s Rainy Day Fund totals $7 billion, and the General Fund holds over $9.7 billion making the proposed investment significant and substantial. In December 2024, the head of the Florida Blockchain Business Association (FBBA), Samuel Armes, announced that Florida could join the Bitcoin reserve bandwagon by the first quarter of 2025. According to Armes, the Speaker of the Florida House Danny Perez, and Senate President Ben Albritton are supportive of Bitcoin, and with Governor Ron DeSantis also a proponent, Florida is well-positioned to adopt a Bitcoin reserve. Armes proposed leveraging Florida’s $185.7B pension fund by allocating a small percentage to Bitcoin to hedge against inflation. Armes also explained that Florida had already invested in Bitcoin and other crypto assets through its pension fund. Texas, Ohio, and Alabama are considering Bitcoin reserves Texas also joined the race in December 2024 during its 89th legislative session, where the State introduced Senate Bill 778, proposing a Bitcoin reserve secluded from the state’s general revenue fund. The legislation would allow Texas to hold Bitcoin as an asset and appropriate funds for further BTC purchases. Residents would also be able to donate Bitcoin to the reserve. Ohio and Alabama also joined the bandwagon with Bitcoin reserve proposals. In December 2024, Ohio State Representative Derek Merrin introduced a proposal dubbed the Ohio Bitcoin Reserve Act, which would establish a state Bitcoin fund. Alabama state auditor Andrew Sorrell suggested that the state initiate a strategic Bitcoin reserve. On 10th January, North Dakota legislators and a New Hampshire state representative introduced proposals allowing individual states to invest in Bitcoin. New Hampshire state representative Keith Ammon’s proposal did not mention Bitcoin explicitly but set high market value requirements that only make BTC eligible for the state’s investments. North Dakota legislators’ proposal suggested the state seclude a portion of its funds to digital assets. Massachusetts, Utah, and Arizona make their first strides toward Bitcoin Reserves On Jan. 18, Massachusetts state senator Peter Durant and five Republican senators in Wyoming introduced bills calling for the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the two states. Massachusetts’ proposal suggested a 10% allocation to Bitcoin from its rainy-day fund, while Wyoming proposed allocating only 3% of the public funds to BTC. Other states like Utah, Arizona, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, and Montana also made their first strides toward establishing independent Bitcoin reserves. Iowa has introduced a new Bitcoin reserve bill, HF 246, which would permit the investment of up to 5% of public funds in digital assets with a market cap of $750 billion or more. The U.S. states follow the federal government’s move to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the U.S. Treasury. The discussion has gained momentum at the federal level after the White House’s AI and crypto policy lead, David Sacks, confirmed that reviewing Bitcoin as a potential strategic reserve asset is a priority for the administration’s digital assets working group.

The first major resistance is near the $2,780 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,800 or $2,820. A clear move above the $2,820 resistance might send the price toward the $2,920 resistance. An upside break above the $2,920 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,000 resistance zone or even $3,050 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,780 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,675 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,550 swing low to the $2,794 high. The first major support sits near the $2,640 zone. A clear move below the $2,640 support might push the price toward the $2,600 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,550 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,440.

The crypto market is heating up, and new meme coins are making waves. Investors are searching for the next Shiba Inu or Dogecoin, but one project is standing out from the rest— BTFD Coin (BTFD) . With an insane 100% bonus in Stage 14, a live Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, and a massive 90% APY staking reward, BTFD is turning heads and stacking up serious momentum. Meanwhile, Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW) is gaining attention with its charitable donation to animal welfare, reinforcing its community-driven mission. Mog Coin (MOG) is also making headlines as it maintains strong trading volume after a high-flying December. With meme coin hype reaching new heights, this might be your last chance to get in early before prices skyrocket. Let’s dive into why BTFD Coin is the top new meme coin to join this week , and how MEW and MOG are also stirring up the market. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Most Hyped Presale of 2025 Ever wish you could go back in time and buy Dogecoin before it blew up? Well, this might be your second chance. BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a movement. The presale is flying through the stages, and Stage 14 is now live with an eye-popping 100% bonus when investors use the LAUNCH100 promo code . What makes BTFD stand out? First, its P2E game went fully live on January 1, 2025, letting players earn rewards while gaming. Imagine earning real crypto just by playing—BTFD is turning that into reality. The staking platform is already paying out 90% APY, and the referral program lets top players earn 10% in extra rewards. If that wasn’t enough, the presale is skipping ahead, and all unsold tokens from Stage 13 are getting burned. That means fewer tokens in circulation, stronger demand, and a tighter supply—a perfect storm for future price pumps. How to Claim the 100% Bonus on BTFD Want to double your coins instantly? Here’s what to do: Go to BTFD’s presale page Connect your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.) Enter the promo code LAUNCH100 before making a purchase Buy your BTFD and watch your coins double instantly The bonus only lasts during Stage 14, so time is running out. Presale Numbers That Are Blowing Minds BTFD’s presale started at $0.000004 and is now priced at $0.00016 in Stage 14. Here’s why people are scrambling to invest: Over $6 million raised More than 69 billion BTFD coins sold Over 10,600 Bulls holding BTFD ROI is set for 275% without a bonus and 550% with the LAUNCH100 code To put that into perspective, a $3,500 investment today at the current price of $0.00016 will get you 21,875,000 BTFD coins. But with the LAUNCH100 bonus, that doubles to 43,750,000 BTFD coins. When BTFD hits its listing price of $0.0006, that same investment could be worth $26,250, locking in a massive 650% gain. BTFD’s Play-to-Earn Game – The Future of Meme Coins The BTFD P2E game isn’t just a side feature—it’s a game-changer. Players can level up, unlock rewards, and cash out their in-game earnings in real BTFD tokens . Unlike other meme coins that rely on hype alone, BTFD actually has utility, making it a solid investment rather than just a speculative gamble. This game isn’t in beta anymore—it’s fully live, and early players are already stacking up rewards. If Axie Infinity taught us anything, a successful P2E game can take a crypto project to the moon. Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW) – Charity and Community in One MEW is proving that meme coins can have heart. In January 2025, the project donated $10,000 to the Pasadena Humane Organization to help animals affected by the California wildfires​. This move isn’t just good PR—it reinforces the idea that MEW is a community-driven project with real-world impact. Launched in March 2024 on the Solana blockchain, MEW quickly gained traction as a top cat-themed memecoin. At its peak, its market cap topped $1 billion, and while the price has pulled back, it remains one of the most active meme coins on Solana. MEW’s biggest win was its listing on the Revolut app, making it accessible to over 45 million users worldwide. With its strong branding and engaged community, MEW continues to hold its own in the meme coin space. Mog Coin (MOG) – A Silent Giant in the Meme Coin World MOG may not be as loud as BTFD, but it’s still making moves. After hitting an all-time high in December 2024, the token remains a major player with a market cap of $343 million​. The big reason for MOG’s strong performance? Its Coinbase listing in late 2024, which opened it up to millions of new investors. Since then, its trading volume has remained strong, showing that investors still have faith in its potential. While MOG isn’t making major headlines, it remains one of the most actively traded meme coins, proving that strong fundamentals can keep a project relevant even after its initial hype fades. The BTFD Referral Program – Earn 10% in Extra BTFD Another way to stack even more BTFD coins is by referring friends. Here’s how it works: Share your unique referral code If someone buys at least $50 in BTFD, they get a 10% bonus You earn 10% on their purchase if you rank in the top 20 referrers With the presale flying through stages, getting in early means more people will be buying after you, increasing your potential rewards. Conclusion – BTFD Is the Best Bet Right Now With the meme coin market exploding, there are plenty of options out there. But based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands out as the top new meme coin to join this week. Its 100% presale bonus, booming P2E game, and staking rewards make it a must-watch. MEW’s charity move and MOG’s strong trading volume are impressive, but BTFD is where the real action is right now. The clock is ticking. Join the BTFD presale now and claim your 100% bonus before Stage 14 ends. Find Out More: Website: https://www.btfd.io/ X/Twitter: https://x.com/BTFD_COIN Telegram: https://t.me/btfd_coin FAQs 1.

This request, filed through a Form 19b-4, aims to enable staking for the Ethereum held by the ETF trust. If approved, it would become the first ETF in the U.S. to incorporate staking. The SEC has previously approved several Ethereum ETFs, such as the 21Shares Ethereum ETF, alongside other high-profile offerings from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity. However, most of these approvals excluded staking due to regulatory concerns. The filing said, “Based on discussions with the Sponsor, the Exchanges proposes to amend several portions of the Eth ETP Amendment No. 2, as amended, in order to allow the staking of the Ethereum held by the Trust.” What Does This Mean for Ethereum? Staking is an important feature for Ethereum, as it allows holders to earn passive rewards for helping secure the network. However, staking hasn’t been part of the Ethereum ETF offerings so far, as the SEC had previously raised concerns about whether staking could be considered a security. This was part of broader regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies, which saw SEC Chairman Gary Gensler labeling various crypto-related activities, including staking and stablecoins, as potential securities. However, this approach is now shifting, and many expect that the SEC will greenlight staking in 2025. This rule change request could pave the way for more crypto-related ETFs to incorporate staking, creating new opportunities for investors to earn rewards on their holdings. As a result, Ethereum ETFs could attract capital, as passive staking rewards become a compelling benefit for investors. The ETF Race Heats Up The SEC’s approval of the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF with staking could set a precedent, with other crypto firms looking to follow suit. The Cboe BZX Exchange has been very active in the ETF space, having also filed proposals for other assets like XRP.",News|Crypto news|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ETH|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-13 03:49:21

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. SHIB and DOGE traders are jumping into this under-the-radar crypto before its surge. Discover why smart money is making their move now. Table of Contents Why SHIB and DOGE traders are exploring new opportunities RCO Finance: The AI crypto set for a major surge Conclusion The meme coin sector has always stunned the crypto market with its ability to produce staggering gains, as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) have done over the years. DOGE and SHIB, which are the two biggest memecoins by market cap, used to rule the market. But now they are stuck, with prices dropping by over 28% and 25% in the last month, respectively. This sloping transition has pushed traders to seek alternatives, with their attention turning to RCO Finance (RCOF), an AI altcoin changing how investors interact with crypto. Offering AI-powered investment tools, real-world integration, and early-stage pricing, RCOF is an attractive project. Why SHIB and DOGE traders are exploring new opportunities In their prime, Shiba Inu and Dogecoin undoubtedly made headlines; however, their declining performance and overreliance on speculative hype rather than intrinsic value for growth has made them less appealing to long-term investors. Despite their past successes, Shiba Inu and Dogecoin are struggling to maintain upward momentum. SHIB experienced a steady decline since the last quarter of 2024, falling from $0.000033 to $0.000016, a 51.52% drop. Similarly, DOGE fell from $0.4835 to now trade at $0.2546, a 47.34% drop. This downturn comes from their overreliance on speculative hype and celebrity endorsements to drive growth. While Shiba Inu has attempted to expand its ecosystem with the Shibarium network and metaverse initiatives, these developments have yet to drive sustained demand. Similarly, Dogecoin’s potential for mainstream payment adoption has not materialized at the scale investors had hoped. You might also like: Ethereum lags behind Bitcoin but is expected to reach $14K, boosting RCOF to new high RCO Finance: The AI crypto set for a major surge RCOF is a technological movement, integrating AI-powered investment tools and real-world asset integration to create an ecosystem whose value proposition goes beyond what Dogecoin and Shiba Inu offer. Driving RCOF’s innovation is its robo-advisor, a tool that uses AI machine learning to analyze market and user data to create personalized investment plans. It analyses users’ financial goals, risk tolerance, investment timelines, and more to create custom strategies that are best suited to investment needs. If users want quick gains and are open to taking on more risk, it can recommend high-reward but higher-risk assets. If users are more conservative and prefer low to mid-risk investments, it can suggest more stable lower-risk assets to invest in. This customization ensures all users benefit despite their experience level. This tool also uses predictive analytics to provide real-time investment insights that help users make data-backed decisions, remove indecision and optimize outcomes. For instance, let’s say users wanted to invest in XRP before its ETF approval, but the news of its regulatory struggles is putting them off. Instead of relying on gut instincts, traders can use the robo-advisor for clear, data-driven recommendations based on current market conditions, historical patterns, and global financial indicators. If XRP shows signs of weakness, it can suggest reducing exposure; if bullish trends emerge, it advises increasing the position. This clarity minimizes hesitation and maximizes profitability. One of RCO Finance’s most creative features is its ability to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs), such as stocks, ETFs, and commodities. Including RWAs opens up previously inaccessible markets to retail investors, enabling them to build diversified portfolios all from one platform. It also enables users to buy RWAs directly using cryptocurrency, avoiding the need for crypto-to-fiat currency conversion. In the crypto industry, trust is crucial, so RCO Finance underwent a thorough SolidProof audit. This accreditation shows the platform adheres to the highest safety and reliability standards, making it a trustworthy investment. Privacy-conscious investors will appreciate this crypto’s KYC-free ecosystem, which eliminates demanding identity verification processes while remaining compliant. RCO Finance guarantees speedier onboarding, more anonymity, and worldwide accessibility, attracting more users. This altcoin recently unveiled its beta platform, allowing users to get hands-on experience with its features before the official launch. This is a rare opportunity, given very few DeFi platforms release a beta version during their presale stage. With over 10k active users already on the platform, its popularity is growing. Since this is just the beta version, users can expect more improvements the closer the project gets to the launch. Try out the beta platform here . Conclusion Just like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, RCOF offers unmatched potential. Plus, RCOF’s utility-focused approach ensures its gains are sustainable. Powered by its AI-driven ecosystem, advanced tools, and practical utility, this crypto is poised to surge. Priced at $0.10 during the presale, it is the perfect entry point. To learn more about RCOF, visit the RCO Finance presale and join the community.

Bulls are in trouble as the price remains trapped under key supply levels, leaving investors concerned about Ethereum’s short-term future. Many who expected a bullish year for the second-largest cryptocurrency are now questioning their outlook after last week’s massive selling pressure took ETH from $3,150 to $2,150 in less than two days. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Hold $97K? – 1-3 Month Holders’ Data Reveals Crucial BTC Demand The recent price action has amplified fear and uncertainty among retail investors, with many continuing to sell amid the market turbulence. However, on-chain metrics tell a different story, signaling growing confidence from larger players. Key data shared by top crypto analyst Ali Martinez reveals that whales have accumulated over 600,000 Ethereum in the past week, even as retail investors remain cautious. This divergence highlights a critical trend in the market—retail investors appear scared and reactive, while big players are quietly buying up ETH at discounted prices. As the market grapples with indecision and volatility, this accumulation by whales could set the stage for a significant shift in momentum. If bulls manage to reclaim the $2,800 and $3,000 levels, Ethereum may begin a recovery rally. For now, all eyes are on whether the divergence will lead to a turning point in ETH’s price action. Ethereum Investors Are Divided: Retail Fears Vs. Whales Trust Ethereum remains in a challenging position after last week’s dramatic sell-off, which saw the price drop from $3,150 to $2,150 in less than 48 hours. Despite a strong recovery back into the $2,700 range, ETH has struggled to reclaim key supply levels, leaving many investors cautious. The price remains trapped below crucial resistance at $2,800, with bulls needing to push above the $3,000 mark to shift the bearish trend and regain market confidence. Key metrics shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez reveal a promising trend amidst the uncertainty. Whales have accumulated over 600,000 Ethereum in the past week, signaling strong buying activity from big players. This accumulation trend is a stark contrast to the cautious behavior of retail investors, many of whom continue to sell amid fear and uncertainty. The divergence between whale accumulation and retail selling suggests that large investors remain optimistic about Ethereum’s long-term prospects, even as short-term price action remains shaky.

A breakout above $3,000, which aligns with the 200-day moving average, could mark a significant turning point for ETH, sparking a rally toward higher price levels. Until then, ETH remains in a critical phase as it navigates between bearish pressure and the potential for recovery. ETH Price Action: Key Levels To Reclaim Ethereum is currently trading at $2,620, attempting to reclaim the $2,700 mark as it battles against key supply levels. Bulls are under pressure to break through resistance at $2,800 and $3,000, as reclaiming these levels would signify a reversal of the daily downtrend that has persisted since late December. The $3,000 mark holds particular significance, as it aligns with the 200-day moving average, a widely watched indicator that signals long-term strength when prices hold above it. A successful push above the $3,000 level could ignite a strong rally, with Ethereum targeting higher price levels quickly. Such a move would restore confidence in the market and signal a potential bullish trend for ETH, which has struggled to regain its footing following last week’s dramatic sell-off. Related Reading: Cardano Is Showing Signs Of A Potential Rebound As Key Indicator Flashes A Buy Signal – Analyst However, if Ethereum fails to hold above the $2,600 mark, the outlook becomes bearish. A breakdown below this level could open the door to further declines, with ETH potentially testing lower demand zones in the coming days. The market remains at a critical juncture, and Ethereum’s ability to reclaim and hold key levels will determine its short-term direction as investors closely monitor the next moves.

This achievement, particularly at Stage 4 with a price of $0.004562625, begs the question: how does Web3Bay’s approach compare to established players like Cardano and Tron, and what does this mean for the future of blockchain technology? This article offers a provocative look at these projects, examining their growth, investor returns, and market impact. The Web3Bay presale, with its impressive $1.15 million raised, signals a strong appetite for its vision. Web3Bay: Disrupting E-commerce with Decentralization – $1.15M & Counting Web3Bay’s presale has been nothing short of explosive, exceeding $1.15 million and moving over 300 million tokens. Currently in Stage 4 at $0.004562625, the project’s traction raises eyebrows and opens up a discussion about the future of online shopping. What’s the secret sauce? Web3Bay’s decentralized marketplace model directly challenges the established order of e-commerce giants. By cutting out the middleman, it aims to eliminate hefty fees and return control to sellers. This, coupled with the acceptance of both cryptocurrency and traditional payment methods, positions Web3Bay to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3 commerce, casting a wide net for users. The Web3Bay presale, with its impressive figures, has certainly stirred the pot. The project’s structured presale, with its tiered pricing across 28 stages, has also played a crucial role. Early birds get the worm (and lower prices), creating a sense of urgency and driving demand as later stages see price increases. This strategy has incentivized early adoption and built a community of invested stakeholders. The Web3Bay presale numbers speak for themselves, don’t they? Beyond the hype, Web3Bay offers a compelling value proposition for investors. The 3BAY token isn’t just a speculative asset; it’s a utility token that unlocks discounts, voting rights, and staking opportunities. This focus on utility within a growing ecosystem differentiates Web3Bay from projects built on pure speculation. Web3Bay, with its $1.15 million presale raise, has definitely caught the attention of the crypto world. Cardano: A Layered Approach to Scalability Cardano, conceived in 2015 and launched in 2017 by former Ethereum contributors, has carved its own niche in the blockchain space. Its layered architecture, separating ADA transactions from smart contracts, is designed to enhance scalability and flexibility. The Ouroboros proof-of-stake consensus mechanism underpins its operations, prioritizing energy efficiency and security. Cardano’s initial coin offering (ICO) raised over $60 million, primarily from Japanese investors, setting the stage for its growth. Cardano’s market capitalization has seen substantial increases over the years, reaching $77 billion by May 2021. As of January 31, 2025, ADA is trading at around $0.96, reflecting a modest increase. Tron: Scaling the Entertainment Industry Tron, launched in 2017 by Justin Sun, focuses on decentralizing the entertainment and digital content industry. Its delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism enables high throughput and scalability. The TRX cryptocurrency powers the Tron network, facilitating transactions and smart contracts. TRX experienced rapid price appreciation after its launch, reaching an all-time high of $0.30 in January 2018. In 2024, Tron continued its growth, with market capitalization and revenue showing significant increases. The Final Verdict: Which Project Will Deliver Tangible Value? In the cryptocurrency world, success hinges on utility, adoption, and a clear vision. Cardano and Tron have demonstrated growth by focusing on scalability and digital content, attracting significant investor interest. However, Web3Bay’s rapid presale, with its $1.15 million raise and its unique approach to decentralized e-commerce set it apart. Its structured token sale and real-world application offer a practical solution that could drive sustained demand. The key question isn’t simply which project will grow, but which will deliver the most tangible value. Web3Bay’s strategy of merging blockchain with everyday commerce makes it a project to watch. Web3Bay’s $1.15 million presale is a strong indicator of investor confidence.

40262925,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=128326,1739419243,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Why a Surge in the Solana Price Will Push This Altcoin to Massive Gains,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/why-a-surge-in-the-solana-price-will-push-this-altcoin-to-massive-gains/,"The Solana price is making waves again, climbing steadily and drawing renewed investor interest. But here’s the bigger story; when Solana surges, it often sparks rallies across the broader crypto market. And one AI altcoin, RCOF , is set to benefit the most. With cutting-edge technology and skyrocketing demand, this hidden gem could see explosive gains as SOL leads the charge. Let’s break down why this is the perfect moment to get in before the price soars. The Solana Price Surge Is Reshaping the Crypto Market The Solana price has been showing strong bullish signals, capturing the attention of investors. After hitting $290 in January, it briefly retraced to $200 in early February. Despite this dip, the uptrend remains intact, with technical indicators pointing toward another major breakout. Analysts predict that if Solana price breaks past the key $245 level, it could trigger a wave of liquidations, forcing short sellers to cover their positions. This buying pressure could catapult Solana toward its next target of $565. Market trends suggest that a rising Solana price often fuels gains in other altcoins. When SOL experiences a breakout, investor sentiment improves across the crypto market, leading to capital flowing into promising projects. And with the Solana price regaining momentum, now is the time to identify the next big winner. RCOF is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this momentum. Unlike most altcoins, it isn’t just benefiting from the hype. It’s offering cutting-edge AI-driven financial tools that set it apart. This AI-Powered Crypto Is Set to Ride the Wave RCOF is a revolutionary AI-powered financial platform that’s changing the way people invest. At its core is the Robo Advisor, an AI-driven tool that gives real-time entry and exit signals, helping traders make informed decisions. It pulls data from top financial sources like Bloomberg and Reuters, analyzes trends, and delivers actionable insights with unmatched precision. The market moves fast, and by the time most traders hear about a hot token, the opportunity is gone. But with the Robo Advisor, you get early alerts on trending altcoins before they explode. Say, for instance, you had access to early signals on the TRUMP token before it launched. With the right timing, your $500 investment could have turned into $50,000. The AI doesn’t just help with entry points, it also spots downturns, allowing you to sell before a crash. Unlike human investors who get caught up in emotions, AI is purely data-driven. Beyond trading, RCOF brings personalized investment strategies tailored to your financial goals. Whether you’re a conservative investor or a high-risk trader, the AI adapts, optimizing your portfolio without you needing to micromanage it. And it’s only getting better. RCOF’s AI monitoring facilities ensure that the Robo Advisor continuously improves, learning from market data to enhance its accuracy over time. This means that as the market evolves, your investment strategy does too. But RCOF isn’t just about AI; it’s a full-fledged financial ecosystem. With its KYC-free platform, investors can trade freely without identity restrictions. The upcoming debit card integration will allow users to spend crypto like cash, and you can diversify into over 120,000 investment options, from stocks and ETFs to real estate and bonds. Presale Demand Skyrockets as Investors Rush In RCOF has launched a Beta Platform , giving investors a real taste of its AI-driven ecosystem before the token even hits major exchanges. With over 10,000 users actively testing its features, the project is proving its potential in real time. And this is just the beginning. The Alpha phase, currently in internal testing, will introduce even more powerful trading tools, making RCOF’s ecosystem even stronger. With this level of progress, it’s no surprise that the presale is gaining serious momentum. Currently in Stage 5, RCOF tokens are priced at $0.10, but the next stage will jump to $0.13, marking a 30% increase in Q1 alone. Investors who get in now are locking in instant gains, and those who wait risk paying more for the same opportunity. RCOF has already raised over $12 million, and demand is soaring. A simple $1,000 investment today will be worth $1,300 by the next stage—but that’s just the beginning. Upon listing, analysts predict that $1,000 will be worth over $400,000 or more. And safety is a non-issue. RCOF has been audited by SolidProof , a leading blockchain security firm. The audit confirmed zero vulnerabilities, making it one of the safest investments in the space. As Solana price climbs, investors are looking for the next big winner, and RCOF’s presale is shaping up to be the perfect early entry before it skyrockets on major exchanges. Solana’s Rally Is Big, but This Altcoin’s Growth Could Be Bigger The Solana price momentum has been undeniable, breaking through key resistance levels, and investors are seeing solid returns. But for those looking to maximize their gains, RCOF presents a far more explosive opportunity. Because it’s still in presale, RCOF offers the greatest upside. Early investors are already sitting on gains, and those entering before the next price increase stand to make even more. But this window won’t stay open for long. The smart money is getting in now.

The price must clear the $2.50 and $2.52 levels to start a fresh increase in the near term. XRP price started a decent upward move from the $2.320 zone. The price is now trading above $2.420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.380 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start a fresh increase if it clears the $2.50 resistance zone. XRP Price Holds Support XRP price managed to stay above the $2.32 support and avoided more losses, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . A base was formed, and the price started a decent upward move above the $2.35 and $2.40 levels. The price surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.5241 swing high to the $2.3353 low. The current price action is positive, and the price is now trading near the $2.50 resistance zone. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.380 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $2.420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.480 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.5241 swing high to the $2.3353 low. The first major resistance is near the $2.50 level. The next resistance is $2.520. A clear move above the $2.520 resistance might send the price toward the $2.60 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.650 resistance or even $2.720 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.80. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.50 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.420 level. The next major support is near the $2.380 level and the trend line. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.380 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.320 support. The next major support sits near the $2.20 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.420 and $2.380.

While the session falls under the Sunshine Act, meaning discussions remain private, speculation is rife about its potential implications for Ripple and the wider digital asset sector. With XRP’s price movements closely tied to regulatory developments, any sign of a settlement or withdrawal of the SEC’s appeal against Ripple could trigger significant market reactions. The SEC’s handling of this case will also set a precedent for future enforcement actions in the crypto industry, influencing the regulatory landscape and asset managers’ interest in XRP-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The broader crypto market is also watching closely, as any major legal shift could impact investor sentiment across multiple digital assets. At the time of writing, XRP price was up over 3% to trade at $2.48. Ripple lawsuit in focus The SEC’s agenda includes administrative proceedings, litigation claims, and injunctive actions—all directly tied to the Ripple case. The lawsuit, which began in December 2020, accused Ripple of conducting an unregistered securities offering through its sale of XRP. Recent court rulings have favoured Ripple, including a decision that secondary XRP sales are not securities transactions. However, the SEC remains firm in its appeal, keeping uncertainty alive. A resolution today could signal de-escalation, providing much-needed legal clarity to Ripple and the broader crypto market. Investors and analysts anticipate that a decision could provide insights into how the regulator plans to handle other crypto-related enforcement actions in the future. XRP price reaction Traders are closely monitoring the SEC’s decision, as a positive outcome could lead to a price surge. Historically, regulatory clarity has driven crypto rallies, and a settlement could eliminate a major hurdle for Ripple’s expansion. Additionally, legal certainty could revive discussions on a Ripple initial public offering (IPO), a move previously hinted at by CEO Brad Garlinghouse. An IPO would attract institutional investors and solidify Ripple’s position in the fintech sector, potentially expanding its role in cross-border payments and digital asset adoption. A settlement could also open doors for XRP-focused ETFs, as asset managers await regulatory approval to launch investment products. If approved, these ETFs could drive further institutional adoption of XRP, making it a more accessible asset for traditional investors looking for exposure to digital currencies. Regulatory shift ahead? The SEC’s approach to Ripple will influence broader regulatory discussions. The commission is under pressure to provide clearer guidelines on digital assets, especially as global markets, including the UK, UAE, and Singapore, implement structured policies for crypto firms. A shift in regulatory strategy, particularly under the new Trump administration’s financial task force, could signal a more crypto-friendly stance. Meanwhile, a continued enforcement-heavy approach could push innovation offshore, weakening the US’s competitiveness in digital assets. The ongoing legal battle has already contributed to uncertainty, leading some blockchain firms to relocate operations to jurisdictions with more favorable regulations.

Bitcoin Has Significant Resistance At Price Levels Just Ahead In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has discussed how BTC support and resistance levels are looking from an on-chain perspective right now. In on-chain analysis, the potential of any price level to act as support or resistance lies in the amount of supply that was last transferred or purchased at it. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm, that shows the supply distribution of the cryptocurrency at price levels near the current spot Bitcoin value. In the graph, the size of the dot correlates to the amount of BTC that the investors bought in the corresponding price range. It would appear that the $96,400 to $98,400 range currently has a particularly large dot associated with it, which implies these levels host the cost basis of a significant number of holders. More specifically, around 1.6 million addresses last acquired a total of 1.57 million BTC inside the range. Since Bitcoin is trading under these levels at the moment, all of these investors would be underwater. Related Reading: Dogecoin Mania No More: Memecoin Interest Plunging On Social Media Holders in loss can be desperate to recoup their investment, so selling from them can sometimes occur as soon as the price of the cryptocurrency rises back to its cost basis. Naturally, such selling is of no relevance to the asset when just a few investors participate in it, but when the price is retesting a range holding the acquisition level of a significant number of addresses, a reaction large enough may be produced to influence the asset’s value. The $96,400 to $98,400 range is clearly quite large, so it’s possible that it could be the reason why Bitcoin has been unable to find any bullish breaks during the past week. Just like how supply blocks above the spot price can end up acting as a source of resistance for the asset, those below can be a point of support. This happens because investors who were once in profit may believe that the price would go up again in the near future so they could decide to double down on their bet, taking advantage of the ‘dip’. Currently, $93,400 to $96,200 is the strongest support wall that BTC has out of the nearby ranges. However, it contains a lower amount of supply than the aforementioned resistance block, meaning that its effect should be weaker.

It now remains to be seen whether Bitcoin can surpass the resistance, or if it would find itself retesting one of these weaker support levels. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $96,000, down around 2% in the last 24 hours.

By 2028, LINK could reach a maximum price of $102.75. In 2031, Chainlink will range between $256.84 to $319.36. Chainlink (LINK) emerged as a prominent player in the cryptocurrency market. It provides a decentralized oracle network that connects smart contracts with real-world data. As the adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi), and blockchain technology continues to grow, Chainlink’s innovative solutions have attracted significant attention from investors, and developers alike. Chainlink continues to expand its reach, and utility across the blockchain ecosystem, showcasing its robust integration capabilities. Recent updates highlight 14 new integrations of 5 Chainlink services across 10 different blockchain platforms, including prominent names like Arbitrum, Avalanche, and Ethereum. These integrations enhance Chainlink’s network and solidify its position as a critical player in decentralized applications’ interoperability and functionality. Understanding Chainlink’s potential price movements involves analyzing market trends, technological advancements, partnerships, and overall market sentiment. This chainlink price history prediction aims to provide insights into its future performance by examining technical analysis, and fundamental aspects that could influence its value.

LINK has stabilized near the key level of $20.0. Chainlink price analysis on February 13th shows LINK is trading around $19.056, showing bearish pressure after failing to hold above $20. The price briefly peaked near $19.30 but faced selling pressure, leading to a decline. If LINK fails to hold the $19 support level, it may drop toward $18.50 or even $16, a key psychological level. Resistance remains near $19.50, and a break above this level could push the price back toward $20. The market trend remains weak, with sellers controlling momentum. A further drop below $19 could confirm increased bearish dominance. If buying volume increases, LINK may attempt to stabilize, but a sustained recovery requires breaking past $20. Traders should watch for any signs of reversal or continued downside movement. Chainlink daily chart analysis: LINK trades near key support at $19 The Chainlink (LINK) daily chart shows significant price volatility as the cryptocurrency trades near the key support levels. The Bollinger Bands indicate a widening range, suggesting increased market volatility. Currently, LINK is hovering near the lower band at $19.84, which could act as immediate support. Chainlink daily chart analysis: LINK trades near key support at $19 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 37.60, signaling that LINK is approaching oversold territory. This level suggests potential buying interest if the selling pressure eases. However, the RSI has not yet reversed upward, indicating bearish momentum still dominates. Key resistance lies at the midline of the Bollinger Bands, around $23.77. A sustained move above this level could indicate a reversal toward $27.70, the upper band. Conversely, failure to hold the $19 support may push LINK toward the previous intraday low of $16. LINK 4-hour chart analysis: Struggles near $19 amid bearish pressure Chainlink price analysis on the 4-hour chart reveals LINK is facing resistance near $19.30. The price has been attempting to recover from recent lows but remains below key moving averages, indicating continued bearish pressure. The 50-EMA at $18.835 is acting as immediate support, while the 100-EMA at $20.389 and the 200-EMA at $21.387 serve as major resistance levels. A breakout above $19.30 could push LINK toward $20.00, while rejection may lead to further downside, with $18.50 and $17.30 as key support zones. LINK 4-hour chart analysis: Struggles near $19 amid bearish pressure The MACD indicator shows a weak bullish crossover, with the MACD line slightly above the signal line at 0.062. However, the histogram remains near zero, signaling weak momentum. If buying volume increases, LINK could gain strength and attempt to reclaim $20.00.

Chainlink’s historic price sentiment Chainlink price history Chainlink launched at around $0.20, staying mostly under $1 throughout 2018, with moderate market cap growth. In 2019, LINK saw substantial growth, reaching $1 in May and peaking around $3 by year-end, driven by its utility in providing reliable data feeds for smart contracts. 2020 marked a breakout year as LINK surged from $2 to $20 by August, fueled by DeFi demand. In 2021, it reached an all-time high of around $52 in May but dropped to $22 by mid-year due to market volatility. In 2022, LINK ranged between $15 and $25 amid broader market corrections. In 2023, it further declined, stabilizing in the $6 to $13 range as investor sentiment cooled. Starting 2024 at $15, LINK briefly spiked to $18 in February before falling to $12 by April. The coin’s price has fluctuated throughout 2024, peaking near $15 in May, dropping to around $10 by August, and stabilizing between $10 and $12.28 in October. In November, LINK is trading within the range of $10.68 to $11.94. In December, LINK maintained a range of $18.43 to $30.94. In January 2025, Chainlink peaked at $22.9 but lost momentum towards the end of the month, leading to a trading range of $19.20- $21.00 in February.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,LINK|TRADING|ALTCOIN|ICO|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|SHIB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-13 05:00:40

SOL price is consolidating and might aim for a fresh move above the $200 resistance zone. SOL price started a fresh decline below the $205 and $200 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $200 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $198 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if the bulls clear the $200 zone. Solana Price Faces Hurdles Solana price struggled to clear the $210 resistance and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL declined below the $202 and $200 support levels. It even dived below the $192 level. The recent low was formed at $188 before the price started a recovery wave. There was a move above the $190 and $192 levels. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $209 swing high to the $188 swing low. However, the bears are active below the $200 level. They protected the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $209 swing high to the $188 swing low. Solana is now trading above $200 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $198 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $198 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. The next major resistance is near the $200 level. The main resistance could be $202. A successful close above the $202 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $210. Any more gains might send the price toward the $220 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $200 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $194 zone. The first major support is near the $188 level. A break below the $188 level might send the price toward the $180 zone. If there is a close below the $180 support, the price could decline toward the $175 support in the near term.

The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index has jumped 13% since January 17, the last full trading day before Trump took office, making it the best-performing index among 92 global benchmarks. The broader Hang Seng Index follows closely at 12%, according to Bloomberg data . Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies have plummeted (with Bitcoin even touching $94k at one point), the US dollar has weakened, and the S&P 500 remains stagnant. The unexpected rally in Chinese equities comes despite Trump’s promises to crack down on China. His 10% tariffs on Chinese imports, imposed within his first month, are far below the 60% or more he threatened during his campaign. Investors betting on China’s downfall are now reconsidering as the country’s tech sector gains ground and money managers slowly change their strategies. Chinese AI breakthrough fuels stock surge Chinese tech stocks are leading the market. Alibaba, Lenovo, and BYD have each surged over 33%, Bloomberg reported. On Wednesday, Alibaba jumped 8% after reports claimed the company is working with Apple to bring AI features to China. A key driver behind the surge is DeepSeek, the Chinese AI startup that stunned the global tech industry last month by unveiling an AI model rivaling US tech giants at a fraction of the cost. This of course triggered a reassessment of China’s role in AI development. Investors who once dismissed China’s tech industry as “uninvestable” are now piling in. Hedge funds are taking notice. A Goldman Sachs trader note released last week said that hedge funds bought more Chinese shares than at any time in the past four months. The Hang Seng China gauge closed at its highest level since October. As investor confidence rises, CATL, a major Tesla battery supplier, just filed for a $5 billion listing in Hong Kong, and if approved, it would be a game-changer for the city’s IPO market, which has struggled through a dry spell in deal-making. Trump ramps up tariffs, Modi braces for impact Meanwhile as he promised last week, Trump is moving ahead with his reciprocal tariff plan. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Wednesday that the announcement could come before Trump meets Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday. “I do believe it will come before the prime minister’s visit tomorrow,” she said. Trump’s tariff plan targets any country that imposes import duties on the US “Very simply, it’s if they charge us, we charge them,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, as reported by NBC News. The tariffs are now a key part of his economic strategy. House Speaker Mike Johnson told Reuters that Trump may grant exemptions for pharmaceutical and auto industries, but the broader plan is moving ahead. Trump first imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico, then had to pause them for 30 days after both countries agreed to crack down on illegal border crossings and drug trafficking. On Monday, he signed an order imposing 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Modi, who is visiting Washington, D.C., is trying to avoid a trade war. Reuters, citing government officials, reported that Modi is preparing to cut India’s tariffs across multiple sectors ahead of his meeting with Trump. While in Washington, Modi is set to meet Elon Musk, head of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E). According to a CNBC report , their discussion will focus on expanding Starlink and Tesla operations in India. Wall Street’s volatility eases a bit Despite low volatility levels on Wall Street, demand for options that hedge against tail risks—low probability but high-impact events—has spiked. Many investors are still hoping that Trump will boost corporate profits, but they’re not taking any chances. “If you’re a money manager, do you shift your entire portfolio on the back of one headline? You can’t, because you don’t know if the headline is going to last. So what do you do? You use options,” said Mandy Xu, head of derivatives market intelligence at Cboe Global Markets. She added, “People are nervous and reaching for tail hedges.” The rush for protection has sent option prices surging toward record highs, even though the VIX (Wall Street’s “fear index”) remains below its long-term average, Cboe data shows. Investors are betting heavily on put options that will pay out if the S&P 500, which has risen 3% since late 2024, suddenly tanks. Retail traders are driving most of this demand, Xu said, while hedge funds, pension funds, and asset managers are leaning toward VIX call options instead. But retail investors are also gambling on riskier short-term trades. On Jan. 31st, the same day Trump threatened tariffs, a record-breaking 2.4 million “zero-day” options contracts tied to the S&P 500 were traded—contracts that expire within a day if target prices aren’t hit.

The company is aiming to unify GPT-series and o-series models. OpenAI seems to be taking this approach due to the fact that its offerings have already become too complex, and and the company wants to “return to magic unified intelligence.” He also added that ChatGPT’s free trier will receive unlimited chat access to GPT-5. However, free users will only have access to the standard intelligence setting, which is subject to abuse thresholds. As expected, Plus subscribers will get access to higher-level intelligence, and Pro subscribers will be able to run GPT-5 “at an even higher level of intelligence.” These upcoming models will include features like deep research, search, canvas, voice, and more.

The controversy that broke out on X has sparked a debate about data ownership and ethics within the Web3 and decentralized finance (DeFi) space. DefiLlama is the largest DeFi data analytics platform, providing real-time data across various DeFi protocols. It has proven to be an essential tool for investors and researchers who need reliable metrics in DeFi. Artemis used DeFiLlama’s data without attribution In a tweet that went viral on crypto twitter, @0xngmi said, “i found out that one of our competitors, a vc-backed data site, was using our data without attribution.” Uploaded screenshots by @0xngmi show charts, which both have the source as “Artemis.” @0xngmi explained in the tweet that they had noticed that the competitor’s data was exactly the same as what was in DeFiLlama’s DB, and in a bid to confirm this, they uploaded random numbers into the database of a dead protocol, and “Then those same artificial numbers appeared on their site, on a chart that had ‘Source: Artemis’.” In response to the tweet by @0xngmi, Crystal Tai (@crystaltaixyz), an engineer at Artemis, claims that the attribution issue stemmed from a bug and that Artemis had accurately referenced DefiLlama in other places. hey @0xngmi thanks for flagging this to us apologies, this is a bug in our attribution system we've attributed to defillama in other places but missed a few cases we'll work to get this fixed asap pic.twitter.com/kuT1pncEco — Crystal Tai (@crystaltaixyz) February 12, 2025 Following this, Artemis posted a statement from its X page confirming that it sources certain metrics for certain assets from DeFiLlama. However, the team missed attributing some due to oversight. “We want to clarify that we source some metrics for certain assets from Defillama and have always aimed to properly attribute this data. We had missed attributing fees for a few assets – this was an oversight, which we’ve now corrected.” Open-source projects are vulnerable to data misuse DefiLlama , which is widely known for its comprehensive analytics, has become an essential tool for investors and analysts who need reliable metrics on decentralized platforms. The data it produces gives it a competitive advantage. However, when another company like Artemis, a competitor that also provides real-time data and financial information services on digital assets, fails to acknowledge its use of such data, it strikes at the core of trust and collaborative ethics in the decentralized space. The DeFi and crypto space thrives on decentralization and transparency. So, ethical data handling and use are paramount. Critics of the open-source model have used the rift between both data analytic platforms to revive their argument about how predatory competitors can use data without proper attribution. However, Artemis insists this is only an oversight issue and without malicious intent, saying, “We value data transparency and proper attribution, and have verified all other sources are correctly credited.” Cryptopolitan Academy: FREE Web3 Resume Cheat Sheet - Download Now",News|Artemis|Defillama,EN,0,0,ZRX|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-13 05:50:19

The OCC oversees and regulates national banks that are part of the Federal Reserve System. Meanwhile, Franklin Templeton expanded its OnChain US Government Money Fund (FOBXX) to Solana due to the blockchain’s growing institutional adoption. New York Lawmakers Consider Crypto Task Force New York state Senator James Sanders Jr introduced a new bill proposing the creation of a cryptocurrency task force to investigate the current state of digital assets in the state. The New York State Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Study Act was introduced on Feb. 12, and it aims to establish a 17-member task force to analyze the impact of cryptocurrencies, their adoption, and their effects on tax receipts at both the state and local levels. (Source: The New York State Senate ) According to the bill’s description, the task force will assess the number of digital currencies being traded, the number of cryptocurrency exchanges operating in New York, and the broader implications of crypto on the state's financial ecosystem. Additionally, the task force identified key priorities like the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining, energy consumption, and how New York’s regulatory framework compares to other jurisdictions. If the bill is enacted, task force members will be appointed within 90 days and will be expected to deliver a comprehensive report on their findings before Dec. 15 of 2027. This report will include recommendations for legislative and regulatory measures that could enhance transparency, security, and consumer protection while also addressing the long-term effects of crypto adoption. Currently, the bill is still under committee review and has to undergo floor debates and votes in both the New York Senate and Assembly before it can be signed into law by the governor. New York has long been regarded as a major hub for the crypto industry, yet its regulatory landscape has faced a lot of criticism. The BitLicense program was introduced in 2015, and it requires crypto businesses to get approval from the New York Department of Financial Services to operate in the state. However, industry players and even pro-crypto New York City Mayor Eric Adams argued that the framework is overly restrictive because of its high licensing costs and stringent compliance requirements. Across the United States, interest in cryptocurrency legislation is growing. In fact, more than 20 states are actively considering new bills related to digital assets. Arizona and Utah have already advanced legislation beyond the House committee level. States considering crypto (Source: Bitcoin Reserve Monitor ) Asset manager VanEck suggested that if all proposed state-level crypto bills were to pass, it could generate an estimated $23 billion in additional demand for Bitcoin. Meanwhile, institutional adoption of Bitcoin is also rising as over 100 public entities, including governments and private companies, are accumulating Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. Trump Nominates Former Crypto Executive to Lead OCC Meanwhile, former crypto firm executive Jonathan Gould was nominated by US President Donald Trump to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which is the country’s bank regulator. The White House submitted Gould’s nomination to the Senate on Feb. 11, and if confirmed, he will serve a five-year term as Comptroller of the Currency. (Source: Congress.gov ) Gould previously served as the OCC’s senior deputy comptroller and chief counsel from late 2018 to mid-2021 during Trump’s first administration. Before that, he was a director at BlackRock from 2014 to 2018. More recently, he worked as the chief legal officer of blockchain infrastructure firm Bitfury and is currently a partner at the law firm Jones Day . The OCC oversees and regulates national banks that are part of the Federal Reserve System, including major institutions like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. Overall, it ensures the safety and stability of the US banking system. Kristin Smith , CEO of the Blockchain Association, welcomed Gould’s nomination by stating that he is an excellent choice for the role and has the experience necessary to effectively lead the agency. Avichal Garg , co-founder of investment firm Electric Capital, called the nomination a positive development for fintech and crypto companies due to the fact that Gould supports fair banking access for crypto firms and is opposed to what the industry calls Operation Chokepoint 2.0. This term refers to claims that the Biden administration wanted to cut off crypto firms from banking services. Gould previously shared his concerns about regulatory actions stifling banks’ willingness to engage with crypto businesses. In March of 2023, during a House Financial Services Digital Assets Subcommittee hearing, he warned that certain regulatory measures could have a chilling effect on banks' ability to work with digital asset entities. His nomination comes as Trump administration officials are reportedly exploring whether to merge the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) with the Treasury Department or consolidate its regulatory role with the OCC, according to The Wall Street Journal. This nomination is also part of a broader trend of Trump selecting people with crypto industry ties for key financial regulatory positions. Brian Quintenz , head of policy for Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto division, was also recently nominated to chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). If confirmed, he is expected to advocate for the CFTC to take the lead in crypto regulation over the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Another important nomination is John Hurley , who was tapped to serve as the Treasury’s undersecretary for terrorism and financial crimes. Hurley reportedly invested in Bitcoin, and is expected to focus on anti-money laundering enforcement and stablecoin oversight. Franklin Templeton Launches FOBXX on Solana Franklin Templeton, a leading US-based financial services company, announced the launch of its OnChain US Government Money Fund (FOBXX) on Solana. The fund was originally launched in 2021, and FOBXX primarily invests in US government securities, cash, and fully collateralized repurchase agreements, offering minimal credit risk. As of Jan. 31 of 2025, the fund managed $512 million in assets, with a seven-day effective yield of 4.2%. A Franklin Templeton representative shared that the decision to expand to Solana aligns with the blockchain’s growing institutional adoption. The fund is already available on multiple networks, including Ethereum and Avalanche, as well as layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum, Base, Polygon, and Aptos. It is recognized as the first US mutual fund to use blockchain for record-keeping and transaction processing, with each BENJI token representing one share in the fund. The launch of FOBXX on Solana happened after the recent debut of another tokenized institutional investment fund, the Apollo Diversified Credit Securitize Fund, on the same blockchain. Franklin Templeton has been actively expanding its presence in the digital asset sector, and even launched Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in early 2024. It is also currently seeking approval from the SEC for a Crypto Index ETF. In addition to expanding its tokenized asset offerings, Franklin Templeton has been increasing its involvement with Solana as well. On Feb. 10, the firm registered a trust in Delaware linked to a Solana ETF. However, there are still some regulatory hurdles that need to be overcome as lawsuits continue to challenge whether SOL should be classified as an unregistered security.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-13 05:55:53

Recent data from ARK Invest highlights Bitcoin’s aggregate cost basis reaching a record $40,980, underscoring growing investor confidence and a potential long-term support level. At the same time, projections for Bitcoin’s future price remain optimistic, with ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood reaffirming the firm’s $1.5 million bull case, driven by increasing institutional exposure. While short-term volatility persists amid economic data releases and geopolitical tensions, analysts point to key indicators—such as the 200-week moving average and Bitcoin’s dwindling exchange reserves—as signs of resilience and potential future growth. Bitcoin’s Path to $1.5 Million Gains Momentum as Institutional Interest Grows The possibility of Bitcoin reaching $1.5 million per coin is becoming increasingly realistic, according to ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood. With institutional investors steadily increasing their exposure to digital assets, Bitcoin’s bullish trajectory remains strong despite short-term market fluctuations. Bitcoin (BTC) has faced resistance near the psychological $100,000 level since Feb. 4, following global economic tensions fueled by new import tariffs imposed by the United States and China. This geopolitical uncertainty momentarily dampened investor sentiment, but long-term projections for Bitcoin remain overwhelmingly positive. Cathie Wood, a well-known advocate for Bitcoin’s long-term value, reaffirmed ARK Invest’s bullish outlook in a video released on Feb. 11. “Many people know us for our [Bitcoin] bull case, $1.5 million,” Wood stated . “We actually think the odds have gone up that our bull case will be the right number because of what is becoming the institutionalization of this new asset class.” As institutional adoption accelerates, more large-scale investors are considering Bitcoin as a core portfolio asset. Wood emphasized that Bitcoin’s return and risk profile are vastly different from traditional asset classes, making it an attractive hedge against economic instability. Institutional investors have played a crucial role in Bitcoin’s journey toward mainstream acceptance. With the rise of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), traditional financial entities now have easier access to Bitcoin investments, leading to significant inflows of capital. Publicly traded companies such as Tesla and MicroStrategy have already incorporated Bitcoin into their balance sheets, and more institutions are expected to follow suit. The continued rise of Bitcoin ETFs further supports this narrative, with institutions leveraging these financial instruments to gain exposure to digital assets without directly holding Bitcoin. Institutional demand is a key driver of long-term price appreciation, as these investors typically have a lower turnover rate than retail traders, leading to reduced volatility and sustained price appreciation. The increased allocation of Bitcoin in institutional portfolios is likely to act as a catalyst for further upward movement in the market. ARK Invest’s latest report, Big Ideas 2025, outlines a compelling case for Bitcoin’s trajectory toward the $1.5 million mark by the end of the decade. According to the report, Bitcoin would need to maintain an average compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 58% over the next five years to reach this ambitious target. While this represents the firm’s most optimistic scenario, ARK Invest also provided a base case projection of $710,000 per BTC by 2030, assuming a 40% CAGR. In the bear case, even a more conservative growth rate of 21% would see Bitcoin reaching $300,000 by the decade’s end. Despite the long-term optimism, Bitcoin faces short-term hurdles, with analysts pointing to the $100,000 resistance level as a critical psychological and technical barrier. Iliya Kalchev, a market analyst at Nexo, highlighted that Bitcoin’s next move depends on whether it can decisively break above this level. “A failure to breach could lead to short-term selling pressure toward $95,000, while a successful move might push prices toward the next resistance at approximately $106,500,” Kalchev noted. Bitcoin’s Supply Shock Could Fuel Further Growth Another factor contributing to Bitcoin’s long-term price potential is its decreasing supply on crypto exchanges. According to data from CryptoQuant, only 2.5 million BTC remain available for trading on centralized exchanges. This supply crunch, coupled with increasing institutional demand, could lead to a classic supply shock scenario, where strong buyer interest and limited availability drive prices upward. Historically, Bitcoin’s price has seen substantial growth during periods of declining exchange reserves. As more investors move their Bitcoin to cold storage or long-term holdings, the available circulating supply diminishes, intensifying the scarcity effect and putting upward pressure on prices. While short-term market fluctuations and macroeconomic uncertainties may continue to impact Bitcoin’s price action, the long-term outlook remains overwhelmingly bullish. With institutional adoption gaining momentum and Bitcoin’s supply dwindling, ARK Invest’s prediction of $1.5 million per coin by 2030 is increasingly plausible. Cathie Wood and ARK Invest have consistently emphasized that Bitcoin represents more than just a speculative asset—it is evolving into a core component of institutional investment strategies. If current adoption trends persist, Bitcoin’s role as a global store of value may become firmly cemented, reinforcing its potential to reach unprecedented price levels in the years ahead. Bitcoin’s Aggregate Cost Basis Hits Record High as Market Matures In related news, Bitcoin’s aggregate cost basis—a fundamental metric assessing the original value of all Bitcoin holdings—reached an all-time high of $40,980 at the end of 2024, according to ARK Invest’s Big Ideas 2025 report . Over the past year, Bitcoin’s cost basis surged by 86%, reaching a total value of $811.7 billion. Some analysts interpret this metric as an indication of Bitcoin’s fair long-term value, potentially forming a strong support level during future bear markets. Notably, Adam Back, co-founder of Blockstream, has suggested that Bitcoin’s “floor price” has surpassed the $40,000 threshold, highlighting its growing resilience in the face of market fluctuations. Key market indicators suggest that Bitcoin’s floor price is approaching $44,000. A significant factor in this assessment is the 200-week moving average, a widely used technical indicator that smooths daily volatility to gauge long-term market trends. On Feb. 11, the 200-week moving average climbed to $43,983, with Bitcoin trading above $95,740, according to CoinGlass data. The 200-week moving average surpassed the critical $40,000 psychological mark on Oct. 18, 2024, reinforcing the notion that Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory remains bullish. Adam Back emphasized the significance of this indicator, calling it Bitcoin’s “up-only” price benchmark and a reliable measure of the asset’s historical floor. Macroeconomic Data May Influence Bitcoin’s Near-Term Price Despite its strong long-term outlook, Bitcoin remains sensitive to short-term macroeconomic trends. Investors are closely monitoring upcoming economic data, including the United States Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for January, set to be released on Feb. 12. Inflation readings and central bank policies could influence Bitcoin’s near-term price movements by shaping investor sentiment. According to Iliya Kalchev, a market analyst at Nexo, an unexpectedly high CPI reading could shift investor focus toward potential rate hikes, leading to short-term price volatility. In addition to US inflation data, upcoming economic reports from Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom will provide further insight into global market conditions, which could also impact Bitcoin’s trajectory. Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience above the $95,000 mark despite recent market turbulence. On Feb. 9, Bitcoin endured one of its most significant intraday sell-offs since 2022—comparable to the aftermath of Three Arrows Capital’s collapse. This selling event was largely driven by escalating trade tensions between the United States, China, and other major economies, raising investor concerns about potential economic disruptions. While geopolitical and macroeconomic factors continue to influence short-term price movements, Bitcoin’s increasing aggregate cost basis suggests strong long-term conviction among investors. As institutional adoption continues to grow and Bitcoin solidifies its position as a global store of value, analysts remain optimistic about its future price trajectory.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|ASIA,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-13 06:00:00

A Close Look at Realized Price and Institutional Activity,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/is-ethereum-undervalued-a-close-look-at-realized-price-and-institutional-activity/,"Ethereum price action amid the broader crypto market bearish sentiment over recent weeks hasn’t been any different from the performance recorded in the past months. Over this period, Ethereum’s price has struggled to gain significant upward momentum, remaining in a prolonged consolidation phase. Amid this, a recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor MAC_D has shed light on Ethereum’s current state and factors that may influence its future price trajectory. The analysis notes that Ethereum’s “ultrasound money” narrative—an idea tied to its post-Merge deflationary tokenomics—has faced challenges. Total supply has reached record highs, and the staking ratio has decreased by 1% since November. However, despite these supply-side hurdles, several demand-side factors suggest Ethereum might be positioned for long-term growth. Related Reading: Ethereum Outflows On Derivative Exchanges Hit Record Lows: What It Means for ETH Undervaluation, Holder Behavior, and Institutional Interest One other key insight from the analysis is that Ethereum appears undervalued based on its realized price. The realized price reflects the average acquisition cost of ETH holdings across all wallets, currently sitting at approximately $2,200. With the current market price around $2,600, the analyst calculates a market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio slightly above 1, indicating that ETH remains undervalued relative to historical norms. This level could act as a strong support base, potentially limiting further downside. Another factor supporting Ethereum’s potential upside is the behavior of long-term holders. The analysis highlights an increasing number of addresses that accumulate Ethereum without selling, akin to Bitcoin’s “permanent holders.” Although some larger investors have sold during recent downturns, their positions have been absorbed by these long-term holders, helping stabilize the market. This trend suggests that Ethereum’s investor base is maturing, with a growing segment committed to holding the asset through market volatility. Ethereum: A Major Rebound On The Horizon? Furthermore, the analyst points out that selling pressure in the futures market has eased. Data shows a notable reduction in market price trading volume on the sell side since Ethereum’s price near $4,000 in November last year. This decline in selling activity, even as prices fell, signals a relative influx of buying power, which could set the stage for a recovery if market conditions improve. Institutional participation is another encouraging factor. Major players, including BlackRock, Cumberland, and other prominent firms, have reportedly accumulated substantial amounts of ETH during the recent downturn. For example, BlackRock is said to have purchased over 100,000 ETH, valued at more than $270 million. Such significant institutional inflows not only boost demand but also lend credibility to Ethereum’s long-term investment thesis. Despite these positive indicators, the analysis acknowledges lingering challenges. The increase in total supply and the slight dip in the staking ratio could weigh on sentiment, particularly if macroeconomic conditions remain uncertain. Related Reading: Analyst Says You’ll Regret Not Buying Ethereum At These Prices, Here’s Where It’s Headed Moreover, Ethereum’s price movement may remain constrained in the short term as the broader market digests ongoing economic shifts. However, the combination of undervaluation, strong long-term holder participation, reduced selling pressure, and institutional accumulation paints a more optimistic medium- to long-term outlook. While Ethereum may continue to trade sideways in the near term, the factors outlined in the analysis suggest that it could be well-positioned for growth once broader market conditions stabilize.

The 19b-4 filed by the Cboe BZX Exchange is for a product called the “21Shares Core Ethereum ETF”, which was previously named ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF. Its purpose is to allow staking of the ETF’s Ethereum holdings. “I believe this is the first ETF to file with the SEC and request the ability to permit staking,” said Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart. “The final deadline for this filing will be somewhere around the end of October,” he added.

Staking rewards would be treated as income for the fund, which will use trusted staking providers. There are key differences from “Staking-as-a-Service.” The ETF will only stake ETH held by the Trust itself, it will not pool with other entities’ ETH, will not advertise staking services or promise specific returns, and will not subsidize slashing risks. “Not staking the Trust’s Ether would amount to waiving the Trust’s right to free additional Ether, an act analogous to an equity ETP refusing dividends from the companies it holds,” it explained. “Allowing the Trust to stake its Ether would benefit investors and help the Trust to better track the returns associated with holding Ether.” In January, the SEC announced a new crypto task force dedicated to developing regulations for the space led by the pro-crypto Commissioner Hester Peirce , who had earlier hinted that staked ETH ETFs would be approved under the new administration. Ethereum prices gained 8% over the past 12 hours following the news, hitting an intraday high of $2,790 from a low of $2,565, according to CoinGecko. The asset retreated slightly during the Thursday morning Asian trading session to $2,720 at the time of writing. However, ETH remains bearish, having lost 26% from its 2025 high of $3,700 in early January, and no recent news or bullish fundamentals have been able to change that trend. ETH ETF Latest Institutional investors also seem to be getting cold feet on ETH as US spot ETFs saw their second outflow day of the month on Wednesday. $41 million left the products, with Grayscale (ETHE) shedding $30 million, while Fidelity (FETH) lost almost $11 million. BlackRock’s ETHA fund saw zero flows for the day. Nevertheless, it was also recently reported that Goldman Sachs had increased its ETH exposure and held almost $500 million in Ethereum ETFs, split equally between BlackRock and Fidelity.

In a recent filling submitted as a Form 19b-4, Cboe BZX has requested SEC approval for the Ethereum ( ETH ) held within the fund to be staked. This is first time an ETF in the U.S. has proposed staking. If approved, this would allow investors to earn rewards by staking their ether, which is something not currently possible in Ethereum ETFs. Staking involves locking up ETH to help secure the Ethereum network while earning passive income in the process. Staking could open up new opportunities for investors to earn extra returns compared to just holding ETH ETFs. Cboe BZX plans to use a “point-and-click” method for staking, meaning the ETH won’t be moved, lowering the risk of theft during the staking process. You might also like: Ethereum ETFs added 16% of their lifetime inflows in one week—is a breakout coming? Despite being certified last year, the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF did not allow for staking. The SEC has been hesitant to allow staking in ETFs because of worries that it would violate securities laws. However, leadership changes within the SEC have renewed investors’ confidence that the regulator might finally consider staking in ETF products. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has been advocating for regulatory changes that would allow Ethereum ETFs to include staking. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart expressed optimism about the filing’s chances, saying he believes it will likely be approved.

As of now, ETH price has recorded a gain of 5.5% and trading around $2728 . This surge has stirred excitement among crypto users questioning the reason behind the surge. Cboe files for 21Shares Ethereum ETF One big reason for Ethereum’s price surge is a new ETF proposal. Recently Cboe BZX Exchange has filed a request with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow staking for the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF. If approved, this would let Ethereum holdings earn rewards while staying secure with the custodian. This staking method reduces security risks and could attract more institutional investors. Since the SEC has up to 240 days to decide. Whale Accumulating ETH Massively Ethereum is also getting a boost from large whales. Recent on-chain data shows that over 600,000 ETH was bought by whales last week alone. This suggests that major whales are positioning themselves ahead of a potential price breakout. Whales have bought over 600,000 #Ethereum $ETH in the past week! pic.twitter.com/y736DxlGSP — Ali (@ali_charts) February 12, 2025 When whales buy in large amounts and move their holdings off exchanges, it reduces the available supply. This can create buying pressure, pushing the price higher. Ethereum L2 Growing Adoption Another key factor supporting Ethereum’s rise is the growing adoption of Layer 2 solutions. Recently, Tether announced it will use Ethereum’s Arbitrum network to support a new cross-chain system. This move strengthens Ethereum’s position as a leading blockchain for financial applications. With lower transaction costs and faster processing, more companies may start using Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions, boosting its value. Ethereum Eye For $3000 Looking at Ethereum’s price charts, analysts see strong potential for further gains. ETH has been trading within a key range since early 2024, holding support near $2,200 while facing resistance around $4,100. For Ethereum to continue its upward trend, it needs to break above the $2,817 to $3,000 range . If ETH secures support at this level, it could set the stage for a rally toward $4,000. However, technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic Oscillator suggest that bearish momentum still exists, meaning traders should remain cautious.",News,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-13 06:07:06

The price is now eyeing to break the $2.50 mark and is now bouncing from an important support zone. However, according to analyst Josh of Crypto World, there are significant resistance levels above, which could limit its movement in the short term. he primary support for XRP lies between $2.25 and $2.30. As long as the price stays above this range, there’s potential for the price to hold steady or recover. On the upside, XRP faces resistance between $2.58 and $2.73, with an additional resistance point around $2.53 based on recent highs. Short-Term Outlook: Range-Bound Movement The price of XRP had been showing a bullish divergence, but this signal has recently been invalidated, reducing confidence in a strong upward move. Despite this, XRP is still holding above its support zone, which means there is a possibility for price stability in the near term. Given the current support and resistance levels, XRP is likely to remain within a sideways price range over the next few days, unless a breakout above resistance or a breakdown below support occurs. Bearish Divergence and Market Sentiment On larger timeframes, such as the daily and 3-day charts, there is still a larger bearish divergence present, which could indicate further downside risk. However, the strong support currently in place should prevent a significant drop in the short term, at least for now. Bitcoin’s Influence on XRP XRP’s price often mirrors the trend of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin moves sideways, XRP is likely to follow suit.

This volatility in the last 24 hours has triggered a strong $75 million in BTC liquidations. Market analysts are closely watching whether there’s enough bullish momentum to pull BTC above $97,530 or not. Bitcoin Price Faces a Make-or-Break Situation Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez has identified $97,530 as a critical resistance level for Bitcoin (BTC) in its current market trajectory. Martinez also cautioned that support below $92,110 is notably weak, highlighting a significant gap between $90,000 and $70,000. This analysis suggests that if Bitcoin were to fall below the $92,110 level, it could face accelerated downward momentum due to the lack of strong support in the $20,000 range as shown in the below image. Source: Ali charts Crypto analyst Rekt Capital has shared a similar opinion noting that Bitcoin price is once again nearing the pivotal light blue resistance level (in the below image) at $97,700. For the cryptocurrency to confirm its bullish trajectory, it must secure a daily close above this level or perform a successful retest. A breakthrough at this key resistance point could pave the way for continued upward momentum. Source: Rekt Capital As of press time, the BTC price is trading 1.06% up at $96,753 with its daily trading volume up 32% to more than $48 billion. The Coinglass data shows that the 24-hour liquidations have surged to $76 million of which over $40 million is in long liquidation. The surge in US CPI for January led to major market turbulence on Wednesday. Bitcoin Retail Wallets on the Decline Blockchain analytics firm Santiment added that although top altcoins like Ethereum, and XRP, have seen their networks growing with the addition of new wallets, the same is not the case for Bitcoin. Blockchain analytics firm Santiment has observed a decline in retail participation in cryptocurrency markets, attributing the drop to fears of further price declines across the sector. Historically, such retreats by small traders have signaled potential positive outcomes for mid- to long-term Bitcoin price performance. According to Santiment, large holders, including whales and sharks, often take advantage of these periods of fear, accumulating assets at discounted prices. Source: Santiment BTC Whale Accumulation Is Surging On the other hand, the Bitcoin whale accumulation has been on the rise recently. Whale activity in Bitcoin’s spot market has surged to a multi-year high, as indicated by a steady rise in the Exchange Whale Ratio since late 2024. While market momentum has recently cooled, historical trends suggest that reduced whale deposits on exchanges often precede Bitcoin rallies. This development could hint at a potential shift in market dynamics, with investors closely watching for signs of renewed upward momentum for Bitcoin price. Source: CryptoQuant On the other hand, the discussions around Bitcoin strategic reserves persist even today. VanEck’s Head of Digital Assets, Matthew Sigel, forecasts that proposed Bitcoin reserve bill s could inject $23 billion in buying pressure, potentially leading to the purchase of 247,000 BTC if implemented.

Boasting enormous social-media traction and armies of meme-loving investors, both aim to outdo each other through quick pumps and spirited branding. Yet the market also whispers about a PayFi alt that might overshadow comedic tokens. Many now believe Remittix (RTX) could leap 50x by July if adoption accelerates. Below, we explore how the DOGE vs PEPE showdown reflects a broader meme coin rivalry, and why a cross-border solution might soon outshine even the most viral memes. DOGE vs PEPE Showdown Intensifies Although Dogecoin pioneered meme-based crypto, PEPE exploded onto the scene last year, generating swift gains for early backers. Aggregator data shows Dogecoin’s daily volume hovering in the billions, yet its price can swing wildly if celebrity interest dips. Pepe soared hundreds of percent in days, then retraced when whales sold out or social-media chatter faded. Critics claim both tokens rely heavily on influencer pushes, lacking deeper financial use. Meanwhile, analysts eye 2025 for decisive momentum: will DOGE’s brand loyalty prevail, or can PEPE maintain fresh mania? The market’s short attention span means each meme coin must consistently deliver hype to stay afloat. Remittix Synergy Could Upend Meme Dominance While memes battle for online clout, Remittix addresses a multi-trillion-dollar remittance market, already attracting $11.7 million in presale funds. Instead of comedic marketing, Remittix (RTX) promises cheaper cross-border payments. Think of a teacher in Southeast Asia paid in crypto: with Remittix, she can convert digital funds into local cash at minimal cost, bypassing expensive wire services. Liquidity locks for three years plus contract renouncement post-presale aim to reduce rug-pull fears. Skeptics note that success hinges on forging partnerships and building user-friendly apps, but bridging finance resonates more deeply than meme-driven antics. If Remittix nails compliance and straightforward interfaces, a 50x leap by July might not be far-fetched. Those intrigued by real utility can explore Remittix before tokens run out. Meme Coin Rivalry Meets PayFi Reality In this meme coin rivalry, DOGE and PEPE thrive on comedic appeal, yet aggregator data reveals a pattern: massive gains often fade unless new hype arrives. Remittix (RTX), by contrast, stands to grow through daily usage. Bills, rent, or cross-border remittances could all become easier if families tap RTX to convert crypto into local currency in minutes. That real-world edge may prove more sustainable than waiting on a tweet from a famous personality. Of course, meme coins still attract thrill-seekers craving explosive short-term returns. Yet as adoption matters more in a maturing market, practical solutions might overshadow even the wildest memes. Could Remittix Eclipse DOGE And PEPE? While DOGE and PEPE continue to dominate memes, some watchers suspect their longevity depends on repeated social-media pushes. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) aims to solve tangible money-transfer headaches, which may yield stronger, longer-lasting growth. The DOGE vs PEPE showdown remains entertaining, yet stable user adoption can be elusive without utility. Remittix may flourish as PayFi tokens gain traction among freelancers, migrant workers, and small businesses looking to escape wire transfer fees. Analysts believe a 50x by July is plausible if Remittix meets regulatory needs and mainstream partnerships. If comedic memes hold less appeal than bridging real finances, head to Remittix before presale tokens vanish. Whether DOGE or PEPE can maintain the meme crown for 2025 remains uncertain. One thing’s clear: everyday problems often trump novelty, paving the way for altcoins offering actual solutions to emerge as the true winners in a rapidly evolving crypto arena.

Recently, both the SEC and Binance requested a Washington, D.C. federal judge to pause the ongoing enforcement action for two months. This pause is seen as part of the agency’s effort to develop a clearer framework through its newly formed crypto task force. As part of this process, the SEC may reconsider its entire approach to crypto regulation, potentially influencing the ongoing Ripple case. The Ripple Case in Context: A Pause Amidst Regulatory Uncertainty The ongoing litigation involving Ripple has become emblematic of the larger questions surrounding the SEC’s jurisdiction over cryptocurrencies. John Reed Stark, a former SEC official, has analyzed the potential impact of the SEC’s shift in enforcement strategy, suggesting that Ripple and similar cases could be stalled or resolved with favorable outcomes for the defendants. Stark predicts a disruption in the SEC’s crypto enforcement efforts, with a shift towards pausing ongoing litigation and reconsidering how digital assets are classified under U.S. securities laws. Ripple, which has been embroiled in a legal battle with the SEC over the classification of its XRP token, is particularly affected by the SEC’s reconsideration of its crypto enforcement strategy. The SEC’s initial position was that XRP, as a cryptocurrency, should be treated as a security. Stark’s View on the Future of Crypto Regulation While Stark recognizes the regulatory vacuum in crypto space, he has also been outspoken about the dangers he believes cryptocurrencies pose. He critiques the crypto industry’s propensity for fraud, manipulation, and systemic risks, particularly citing the connection between crypto assets and criminal activities like ransomware and human trafficking. Criticizing the agency, he wrote, “The Stark reality is that shutting down the SEC’s crypto-enforcement program will make matters a lot worse not only for investors but for everyone everywhere. The crypto-contagion will spread like a plague and infect all aspects of global securities markets — including those who have nothing to do with, and want nothing to do with, digital assets.”",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|BNB|EXCHANGE|XRP|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-13 07:07:26

The company is engaging with Indian regulators to ensure compliance as the government reconsiders its stance on crypto policies. Coinbase in Talks with Indian Authorities According to TechCrunch , Coinbase is in talks with Indian authorities, including the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), which monitors financial transactions. The company is focused on meeting regulatory requirements and is optimistic about its return. A Coinbase spokesperson stated, “We are excited about the opportunities in India and are committed to complying with local regulations.” Coinbase’s renewed interest in India comes as part of its larger global expansion plans. Recently, its Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, joined the board of the U.S.-India Business Council (USIBC), strengthening ties between the two countries in the financial sector. India’s Changing Crypto Policies This decision came after the company stopped allowing new users in India in June 2023. India has strict rules for digital assets, even though their use is growing. Coinbase had initially entered India in April 2022, launching support for the Unified Payments Interface (UPI). However, the service was suspended just three days later after India’s National Payments Corporation refused to acknowledge Coinbase’s operations. Despite India’s strict regulations, crypto adoption continues to grow. The government imposed a 30% tax on crypto income and a 1% tax on each transaction in 2022, discouraging many investors. However, with policy adjustments happening worldwide, India may take a softer approach to crypto regulations in the future. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Binance Lawsuit Paused, Former SEC Official Says Ripple Lawsuit Could Be ‘Fully Withdrawn’ , Binance Takes the Lead In India Coinbase’s stronger rival, Binance the world’s largest crypto exchange successfully resumed operations in India in August 2023 after addressing compliance issues.

The additions include Michael Turner, former president of Oxford Properties and global head of real estate at OMERS, one of Canada's largest pension funds, alongside Jaime Leverton, ex-CEO of Hut 8 Mining (HUT), and Doug Mouton, a data center development veteran from Microsoft and Meta, the company said in a release on Thursday . The appointments come as Riot considers repurposing its mining infrastructure, particularly its Corsicana Facility in Texas, for AI workloads, and has tapped investment banks Evercore and Northland Capital Markets to assist with this transition. Riot’s move follows a broader industry trend as miners seek new revenue streams amid rising energy costs and lower mining rewards after the recent Bitcoin halving.

As a result of this move, ETH has formed a key support level at $2,680 that could provide the last buying opportunity before a new ATH. Ethereum price analysis forecasts a bullish reversal that could set up a new all-time high of $5,200 next. Realized Ethereum Price Bands Forecast Next ETH Target is $5,200 Based on CryptoQuant data , the realized Ethereum price bands showcase key support and resistance levels. The realized price metric tracks the price at which each ETH was last transacted . For ETH, the realized price hovers around $2,263, which was tagged on February 3 after a massive crypto market correction. The upper realized price band is 2.3 standard deviations, and the lower is 0.5 standard deviations. The chart shows that most Ethereum cycle tops and bottoms have occurred close to the upper and lower realized price bands, respectively. The upper realized Ethereum price band stands at $5,206, which is the next target for ETH bulls. Realized Ethereum Price Bands Considering the recent recovery and stabilization around $2,600 and Wednesday’s 5.21% rally, the momentum seems to be picking up, indicating that ETH is ready for a reversal. Ethereum Price Analysis: Key Levels to Watch Ethereum price prediction notes several key hurdles that investors need to watch. The next key but minor hurdles include the previous month and previous week VWAPs at $2,683 and $3,306, respectively. If Ethereum manages to flip this key hurdle into a support level, it could lead to a retest of $4,000, the next critical psychological level, where investors can consider booking profits . With such a bullish Ethereum price forecast, investors can expect ETH to not only revisit ATH of $4,868 but also set up a new one at $5,200 . ETH/USDT 3-day chart While realized price bands forecast the next ATH target and Ethereum price analysis backs up this claim, lets’s take a look at other on-chain metrics that support a reversal for ETH in the coming months. ETH Network Growth in an Uptrend Despite the recent market corrections , the 30-day averages of the Network Growth and Daily Active Addresses are on an uptrend . The Network Growth metric tracks the number of new addresses joining the Ethereum network, signaling capital inflow. The daily active address spike signals investors’ interest in ETH at the current levels. Both on-chain metrics are painting a bullish picture for Ethereum price reversal. ETH Network Growth and Daily Active Addresses 1-Year ETH Holders At Loss The 365-day MVRV tracks the average profit/loss of investors who purchased ETH over a year ago. Currently, this indicator hovers around -14%, indicating the average loss of these holders. The last time the MVRV dropped into this level was in Q3, 2024, which sparked a bottom formation and restarted the uptrend that pushed the Ethereum price close to $4,000 in the next four months. ETH 365-day MVRV Whales Bought Ethereum (ETH) on Recent Dips Tying the above three indicators together is the whale transaction count indicator. The chart below contains two metrics: one that tracks transfers worth $100K or more and the other for more than $1 million. A spike in ETH whale transaction count after a rally suggests profit-taking and could lead to top formation and correction . On the other hand, if the ETH price crashes and this indicator spikes, it denotes accumulation. As seen below, the July 2024 spike in whale transfer marked a top formation, leading to a steep correction. On the other hand, the uptick in early August 2024 formed a bottom, sparking a minor bounce and eventually a rally toward $4,000. The February 3 crash led to a spike in whale transfers worth more than $100K and $1M, signaling a massive accumulation spree . All these signs point to one thing – a renewed interest in Ethereum and a potential reversal that leads to a price rally to new highs. Whale Transaction Count To conclude, Ethereum price seems primed for a bullish reversal as indicated by the 365-day MVRV, growth in daily active addresses and network growth. The 5.2% gain on Wednesday is just the start of this uptrend, with a target of $5,200, as indicated by the realized price bands metric.

According to a recent Bloomberg report , Waller stated that stablecoins have the potential to expand the reach of the U.S. dollar on an international scale. However, the scale and utility of stablecoins will depend on a clear set of regulations. In a conference in San Francisco, Waller said the stablecoin market requires a regulatory framework that encompasses stablecoin risks “directly, fully, and narrowly” before financial institutions will be able to issue them. “This framework should allow both non-banks and banks to issue regulated stablecoins and should consider the effects of regulation on the payments landscape,” said Waller. Stablecoins are digital currencies known for their steady value because they are typically pegged to fiat currencies, most commonly the U.S. dollar or Treasury bills. Two of the largest stablecoins by market cap, USDT ( USDT ) and USDC ( USDC ), are both pegged to the U.S. dollar. You might also like: Stablecoin transaction value in 2024 surpasses Visa and Mastercard Waller’s remarks echo those of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in February last year. Powell expressed wholehearted support for the creation of a stablecoin framework in a meeting with the House Financial Services Committee, reiterating the Fed’s commitment to developing stablecoins and Central Bank Digital Currencies in the U.S. More recently, Rep. Maxine Waters, the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, introduced a proposal for stabelcoin oversight involving the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Reserve. Earlier this month, Republican Chair of the House Financial Services Committee, French Hill, had submitted a draft bill for stablecoin regulation, co-sponsored by Rep. Bryan Steil. In contrast to Water’s proposal, Hill’s bill grants stablecoin oversight to the OCC instead of the Federal Reserve. This means that both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have introduced stablecoin regulations under the Trump administration. Read more: Rep.

Right now, Brett (BRETT) is seeing a 10.8% increase in trading volume, signaling renewed interest in the Base Chain meme coin. Floki Inu (FLOKI) remains one of the most recognized meme coins, continuing to attract investors. But one coin is making the biggest waves—BTFD Coin (BTFD). With a powerful Bulls Squad backing it, a presale surpassing $6 million, and a projected moonshot to $0.006, BTFD Coin is quickly positioning itself as one of the top new meme coins to invest in this month . The hype is real, and early investors are lining up to secure a spot before this opportunity disappears. BTFD Coin’s Bulls Squad Eyes a 3,650% Moonshot Something big is happening in the BTFD Coin ecosystem. This isn’t just another meme token—it’s a movement powered by the Bulls Squad, a growing army of crypto believers looking to take BTFD straight to the top. The presale has already raised over $6 million, and more than 69 billion tokens have been sold. With just a few stages left before the final presale closes, the FOMO is reaching new heights. The hype around BTFD Coin’s projected $0.006 price isn’t just speculation. Analysts are backing this number, and the math speaks for itself. Right now, investors can buy at just $0.00016, which means massive gains are on the table. Let’s break it down: if an investor puts $15,000 into BTFD Coin at Stage 14, they’d get 93,750,000 tokens. At the listing price of $0.0006, that investment becomes $56,250. But if BTFD hits the projected moonshot price of $0.006, that $15,000 investment turns into a mind-blowing $562,500—a 3,650% ROI that could be life-changing. Getting into BTFD Coin is straightforward. Investors just need to set up a wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT, and connect it to the presale page . With the LAUNCH100 bonus code, every purchase during Stage 14 is doubled, giving investors even more potential gains. The Bulls Squad isn’t just about numbers—it’s about momentum. This community is made up of traders, crypto enthusiasts, and early believers who see the potential of BTFD Coin and are ready to run with the bulls. With a P2E game, staking rewards of 90% APY, and exclusive benefits for early adopters, BTFD Coin is shaping up to be one of the top new meme coins to invest in this month.

Tied to one of crypto’s most beloved cultural icons, Brett has solidified its position in the rapidly expanding Base Chain ecosystem. As more projects launch on Base, Brett’s exposure and potential for growth increase. Despite recent market shifts, Brett has seen a 10.8% surge in trading volume, indicating renewed investor interest. The meme coin’s connection to the ever-growing Base Chain community could set the stage for further expansion. With its mascot status and strong community backing, Brett is making a name for itself among the top new meme coins to invest in this month. Floki Inu’s Meme Status Keeps It in the Spotlight Floki Inu (FLOKI) continues to hold a special place in the meme coin market. Named after Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu, Floki has built a community-driven ecosystem that thrives on viral marketing and meme culture. With a 7% drop in the last 24 hours, FLOKI is still holding strong as one of the most widely recognized meme coins in crypto. Its longstanding reputation and passionate community continue to push its presence forward. As meme coins evolve, Floki remains a key player in the space, consistently attracting traders and investors looking for potential gains. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin, Brett, and Floki Inu are some of the top new meme coins to invest in this month. Each project has a strong community, high market activity, and solid potential for future growth. But BTFD Coin is leading the charge, with over $6M raised, a 3,650% potential ROI , and an engaged Bulls Squad fueling its momentum.

Deflationary Tokenomics With a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL creates scarcity that directly drives value. Its deflationary model offers early investors significant advantages, surpassing the gradual inflationary nature of tokens like APT and INJ. 3. Exclusive Availability Unlike BTC and ETH, which are traded on virtually every platform, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL is exclusively available at MAGACOINOFFICIAL. This exclusivity creates a controlled market environment, driving demand and making it an excellent choice for early adopters. How It Compares to Other Top Cryptos Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin may have hit $100K, but its market is mature, making THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL a stronger choice for exponential returns. Ethereum (ETH): A leader in smart contracts, ETH offers stability, but it lacks the exclusivity and early-stage growth of THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL. Aptos (APT): Aptos focuses on scalability but hasn’t captured the same market excitement as this token. Injective Protocol (INJ): INJ excels in DeFi but cannot compete with the overwhelming momentum of THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL. Seize the Opportunity Now Bitcoin’s success paved the way for standout cryptos like THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL to dominate the market. With limited supply, overwhelming demand, and exclusive availability, it’s the ultimate choice for investors seeking the next big win.

Currently trading at $2.45, up 0.92% from the previous day, XRP has demonstrated resilience amid fluctuating market conditions. Many analysts are confident that the digital asset will enjoy bullish momentum in 2025, and we consulted ChatGPT to see how high the asset can climb. ChatGPT provided an estimated price range for XRP in 2025, suggesting that the token could trade between $3 and $10 depending on several key factors. Bullish Scenario: XRP Reaches $7 to $10 According to ChatGPT, a bullish outlook for XRP would require a combination of favorable regulatory developments, increased adoption, and a strong market cycle. ChatGPT outlined the following factors that could push the digital asset toward the $7 to $10 range: Regulatory Clarity: “If Ripple secures more favorable legal outcomes against the SEC, institutional investors may flood in.” Experts have outlined a potential timeline for the dismissal of the Ripple lawsuit, and this positive resolution could enhance investor confidence and increase demand. Adoption Growth: Increased integration of XRP in banking and remittance services could also strengthen its market position, driving higher demand and increasing its price. Bitcoin’s Market Influence: Historically, altcoins have benefited from Bitcoin-led market uptrends, and a strong performance from Bitcoin could positively impact XRP’s trajectory. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Neutral Scenario: Trading Between $3 and $6 In a neutral market environment, the cryptocurrency may experience steady growth without significant price surges, potentially peaking around $6. ChatGPT identified the following factors for this scenario: Steady Expansion: While Ripple could continue forming strategic partnerships , a potential absence of breakthroughs may limit the digital asset’s growth. Market Stability: If cryptocurrency markets remain strong but do not experience extreme bullish momentum, the asset could see gradual appreciation rather than a sharp increase. Bearish Scenario: Falling Below $3 Regulatory uncertainty or a broader market downturn could drive a bearish outcome. This could keep XRP below $3. ChatGPT highlighted the primary risks: Regulatory Setbacks: “If legal troubles persist, investors might hesitate.” Any unfavorable ruling in Ripple’s legal disputes could negatively impact investor sentiment. Crypto Market Downturn: A significant decline in overall cryptocurrency markets could drag the asset’s price down, similar to previous bear markets. Can XRP Surpass Its All-Time High? XRP hit an all-time high of $3.84 in 2018. According to ChatGPT, the digital asset has the potential to break past this level, but hitting double digits would require major adoption and a strong bull market. Well-respected experts have set the $10 target , and under the right circumstances, XRP could reach this lofty target.

According to Martinez, 119,400 BTC were accumulated by whales at $97,800, and therefore this level could act as critical resistance for Bitcoin. At the time of writing, it is trading at $97,530. Speaking about Ethereum, the analyst said that investors “seem to be worried” that the Ethereum price has not been able to break $3,000. He added that a move above this level could bring back the lost confidence. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Announces to List Two New Altcoins Regarding Cardano, Ali Martinez stated in his statement that the ADA price may be performing a slow version of the price action it performed between 2020 and 2021.

President Donald Trump got a $10 million settlement out of his lawsuit against X for deplatforming him. Meanwhile, a judge found that Musk’s unofficial $97.4 billion bid for OpenAI contradicts his lawsuit against the $157 billion AI company. The motive behind Elon Musk’s OpenAI lawsuit is now being called into question at the same time that the X social media company he acquired from Jack Dorsey is expected to pay out a $10 million settlement to his close pal, President Donald Trump. Elon Musk inherited the Trump lawsuit Elon Musk’s social media platform, X, will pay President Trump $10 million to settle a lawsuit filed after the social media platform banned him following his involvement in the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. The lawsuit was filed against X while Jack Dorsey was still CEO. After Elon Musk purchased X, he reinstated Trump’s account and began developing a relationship with the president, spending $250 million on his re-election campaign. However, his status as “first buddy” did not stop Trump’s legal team from going ahead with the suit, although they did consider abandoning it. The $10 million settlement will mark the second time a social media platform has paid President Trump millions after the 2021 siege of the Capitol. In January, Meta lost a similar lawsuit to President Trump and had to pay $25 million to settle. The lawsuit came because Facebook suspended Trump’s account. President Trump’s attorneys are expected to pursue a similar settlement with Google over its decision to ban the president from YouTube after the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Judge rules in favor of Altman vs. Musk In a court filing on February 12, 2025, OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, emphasized that Elon Musk’s offer to buy the company undermines his lawsuit’s claim that OpenAI’s assets should not be “transferred away” for “private gain.” Elon Musk’s problems began after he made an all-cash bid to buy OpenAI from Sam Altman. He made an unsolicited offer of $97.4 billion to acquire the company. Sam Altman has leveraged that bid to point out the contradiction in Elon’s lawsuit. Musk’s lawsuit has been questioned before by a hearing judge, Judge Gonzalez Rogers, who remarked that it was a “stretch” for Musk to assert he would suffer irreparable harm without judicial intervention to halt OpenAI’s corporate restructuring. Musk’s lawsuit requests an immediate court order to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit model, alleging that such a move deviates from the organization’s original non-profit mission. However, OpenAI’s legal team is now arguing that Musk’s proposal to buy the company is inconsistent with his stated concerns. This suggests that his legal actions against OpenAI may just be an attempt to disrupt a competitor rather than uphold the company’s foundational principles, as he claims.

The company first planned to use this money to buy more Bitcoin but later decided to use it for bond repayments. This move helps Metaplanet manage its funds better, reduce foreign exchange risks, and still keep Bitcoin as an important part of its financial strategy. Despite the change, Metaplanet’s stock price has jumped 64% this year, showing strong market confidence in its Bitcoin-focused approach. https://twitter.com/Metaplanet_JP/status/1889840829893841327 Building Asia’s Largest Bitcoin Holdings Metaplanet started buying Bitcoin in April 2024 and has already collected 1,762 BTC, spending $137 million. The company believes Bitcoin is valuable because it has a limited supply and isn’t controlled by any government. By 2026, Metaplanet plans to increase its holdings to 21,000 BTC , aiming to become the biggest Bitcoin holder in Asia. Their growing Bitcoin reserves have also attracted more investors, with their shareholder count increasing by 500% to 50,000 in 2024. https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1889516114905842141 Backed by MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor Metaplanet’s strategy has caught the attention of Strategy’s executive chairman michael saylor michael saylor Michael J.

BlackRock’s Multi-Million Investment in BTC and ETH , Is This a Winning Formula? Strategy has started this trend and have successfully borrowed money to buy Bitcoin , and Metaplanet seems to be following the same playbook. Strategy doubled its stock price in five years with this approach, proving that Bitcoin can be a strong financial asset. Since Japan has low interest rates, Metaplanet can borrow money cheaply to keep adding more Bitcoin to its reserves. The companies are cashing on these recent dips to add more BTC on low rates. Bitcoin is currently trading at $96,226, with a market cap of $1.90 trillion. As the U.S. considers holding Bitcoin as part of its financial reserves , more companies might copy Metaplanet’s strategy. However, Bitcoin’s price can be unpredictable, and its limited supply could make future purchases harder. If Metaplanet manages its risks well, it could become Asia’s leading Bitcoin-holding company. But if the market turns against them, this bold move could also backfire. Only time will tell if this is a genius financial play or a high-risk gamble. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

An Istanbul court has sentenced Mehmet Aydin, the creator of Çiftlik Bank (“Farm Bank”), to 45,376 years in prison for embezzling large sums of money from hundreds of thousands of people. The game was inspired by Farmville and allowed users to “invest” in virtual livestock in order to supposedly earn a return on real-world agricultural assets in Turkey. After scamming over 350,000 domestic Turkish investors and another 150,000 foreigners, authorities seized the company’s assets and arrested several executives, while Aydin fled to Uruguay, where he was on the run for years. Aydin was eventually spotted in Uruguay driving a Ferrari, triggering a manhunt before he ultimately agreed to turn himself into the Turkish embassy in Sao Paolo, Brazil. The Daily Sabah reports that at a hearing, Aydin claimed complete innocence and that the seizure of his assets prevented him from compensating the victims. “I did not intend to defraud anyone; I had no intention of committing fraud… I did not make any false statements to the plaintiffs. I seek acquittal.” The man’s brother, Fatih Aydin, while also charged by authorities, claimed that he was not involved in the scheme at all. “I am not a member of any organization. Most of the defendants do not know me, and I do not know them. I request acquittal.” It is estimated that Farm Bank wrongfully profited at least 1.1 billion Turkish lira, or about $131 million.

Notably, BTC was already trending downward due to escalating geopolitical tensions following Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on all aluminum and steel imports. Bitcoin Slumps Amid Surprising Inflation Data The latest US inflation data came in higher than anticipated, triggering declines in both equity and cryptocurrency markets. Instead of the expected 0.3% increase, the CPI rose by 0.5% in January, compared to December’s 0.4% reading. Related Reading: Bitcoin Withstands DeepSeek Dip And FOMC Volatility – How Close Is A New ATH? On a year-over-year (YoY) basis, inflation climbed 3%, exceeding forecasts of a 2.9% increase. For those unfamiliar, the CPI measures the average change in prices consumers pay for goods and services over time and is a key indicator of inflation. Meanwhile, Core CPI – which excludes food and energy costs – rose by 0.4% in January, surpassing the expected 0.3% gain. YoY, Core CPI climbed 3.3%, higher than the forecasted 3.1%. As a result, US stocks followed the crypto market downturn, with stock index futures falling roughly 1% after the report. On the other hand, the 10-year Treasury yield jumped 10 basis points to 4.63%, while the Dollar Index (DXY) strengthened by 0.5%. Could There Be More Downside Ahead? Following the CPI release, markets are now pricing in fewer or possibly no interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve for the remainder of 2025. In an X post, financial journalist Walter Bloomberg noted: Capital Economics’ Paul Ashworth thinks a cut this year looks increasingly unlikely. “With tariffs likely to keep core PCE inflation close to, or above, 3% this year now, the Fed will stand pat for at least the next 12 months.” Treasury yields jumped on the inflation data and are holding on to their gains, with the 10-year at 4.651%, on path for its highest close since mid-January. A reduced likelihood of rate cuts poses additional downside risk for risk-on assets like BTC. Further compounding this uncertainty, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testified before Congress yesterday, emphasizing that central bank rate cuts remain unlikely in the foreseeable future. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Steady Amid NASDAQ Decline, Analyst Calls It ‘Extremely Bullish’ Crypto analyst HurryNFT shared insights on BTC’s price movement following the CPI data release. The analyst noted that while inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target, Trump is pushing for rate cuts to stimulate the economy. The ongoing friction between the Federal Reserve and Trump could increase market volatility, potentially pushing BTC further down to $92,000. Additionally, the recent US employment report did little to support Bitcoin’s price. On the contrary, however, a recent CryptoQuant report posits that BTC may surge to anywhere between $145,000 to $249,000 under the Trump administration. At press time, BTC trades at $95,240, up 0.8% in the past 24 hours.

The advisory panel under Trump’s presidency remains poised to offer updates on governmental spending cuts with this endeavor, further streamlining federal operations. Meanwhile, the Tesla & SpaceX lead revealed what the panel eyes for its future initiatives, further echoing a buzz nationwide. Elon Musk’s DOGE Official Website Goes Live: Here’s All According to an official X post by the Department of Government Efficiency on February 13, the official website ‘doge.gov’ is now live. This portal will offer the public vital updates on governmental spending cuts, the functioning of agency employees, and the panel’s role in streamlining federal operations. As per Elon Musk, “Details of cost savings” are to be posted on this site. Further, the Tesla & SpaceX lead also revealed that he aims to spend the next 4 months working in the panel, primarily to slash $2 trillion from the budget. Source: Elon Musk, X What To Expect? In light of this development, FOX Biz correspondent Charles Gasparino revealed on X that once the advisory department’s goals are met, the anticipation is that ‘inflation will be dropping to 2%.’ Notably, CoinGape reported that the latest U.S. CPI inflation data for January came in hotter than expected at a 3% basis YoY. Given that the newly launched government panel achieves what it plans, the broader risk assets market sentiment could substantially benefit. Further, the imminent developments for the advisory panel are that it aims to launch an ‘overall savings scorecard’ and a ‘description for the amount of each cost reduction’ by February 14. Altogether, these recent developments have echoed a buzz across the American landscape, whilst crypto market participants keenly eye Dogecoin. Elon Musk’s governmental advisory panel under Trump’s presidency has garnered significant attention to the dog-themed meme coin in light of a similar name. Also, the market hype is attributable to the American entrepreneur’s previous backing and influence over the token. Dogecoin Under The Spotlight Amid Recent Advancements At the time of reporting, Dogecoin’s price witnessed an uptick of over 4%, exchanging hands at $0.2579. The coin’s intraday low and high were $0.2489 and $0.267, respectively. Intriguingly, the current rising trajectory falls in line with the broader crypto market’s bullish trend . Further, the recent Elon Musk DOGE-related advancement has added a layer of intrigue surrounding the coin’s future movements. Notably, crypto market analyst ‘VipRoseTr’ conveyed optimism on the meme coin amid current developments, revealing that the price is rebounding from the Fibonacci support zone, signaling a potential bullish reversal. This projection indicates that a massive upside price movement is incoming, with the upcoming targets for the token being $0.4993, $0.5740, and $0.6543, given the price sustains a bullish movement. However, traders and investors continue to trade cautiously, given the meme coin sector’s turbulent nature.

The investment round was led by gumi Cryptos Capital, with participation from well-known venture firms like Spartan, No Limit Holdings, YZi Labs, and OKX Ventures. The funds will be used to improve Blum’s trading bot and Memepad platform, strengthening its position in the TON ecosystem , where it aims to become a leading multichain platform. Since its launch in July 2024, Blum has gained significant traction, attracting over 32 million members in its Telegram community. The project’s success is largely due to its shift from a ""tap-to-earn"" model to a ""trade-to-earn"" approach, which has encouraged long-term engagement. Blum has recorded 2.2 million unique wallets with the highest on-chain activity, making it a key player in decentralized trading. One of Blum’s standout features is its trading bot, which has already surpassed 1 million users, making it the largest of its kind on Telegram. The team is now working on expanding its capabilities with multichain support. Additionally, the Memepad platform, which enables users to create meme coins, is leading The Open Network (TON) and ranks second globally with $200 million in trading volume. So far, users have created 200,000 tokens, with 380 listed on decentralized exchanges. Investors saw several reasons to support Blum: its high user engagement, its successful shift to a sustainable earnings model, and its potential to dominate the TON ecosystem, which currently lacks a major DEX. The funding will help Blum accelerate feature rollouts, ensuring a seamless trading experience. Blum’s funding round also included backing from The Open Platform (TOP) and Binance Labs, highlighting the strong industry confidence in its vision. CEO and Co-Founder Gleb Kostarev emphasized that securing capital was not just about money but about selecting the right partners to enhance the platform’s growth. The decline of ""tap-to-earn"" projects, such as Hamster Kombat and Notcoin, has shown the difficulty of maintaining user interest solely through incentives like airdrops. Interest in this model has dropped by 80% from June to December 2024, according to Google Trends. Blum has adapted by focusing on AI-powered trading, ensuring users remain engaged with advanced features rather than temporary rewards. CMO & Co-Founder Vlad Smerkis reinforced the company’s commitment to building a trading app that caters to both traders and the community. Blum is taking a careful, step-by-step approach to feature development, including multichain trading, an AI-enhanced Memepad, and futures trading. With strong investor support, the team is confident in its ability to bring these innovations to life at an accelerated pace.",,EN,0,0,TRADING|TON|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-13 07:40:24

Despite being exposed as a scam, the token’s price has remained stable, showing the crypto market’s ongoing risk from fraudulent schemes. Political meme coin scams are spreading fast, with scammers taking advantage of inexperienced investors and well-known figures to push their projects. Hackers hijacked Witkoff’s X account to advertise a fraudulent coin linked to Barron Trump. The post was removed swiftly, yet BARRON’s price didn’t drop . The rise of political meme coins has led to an increase in scams across the crypto world. Since Donald Trump introduced his TRUMP token, the sector has taken a troubling turn. In just his first week as president, scammers reportedly stole $857 million using the TRUMP token. Today, the same pattern emerged when Witkoff’s account was hacked to promote the fake BARRON meme coin. “Account was hacked. Thanks to X and James Musk [Elon’s cousin] for acting fast. You guys are great!” Witkoff later posted. Of course, the meme coin had no connection to Barron Trump. Similarly, Trump’s daughter had to distance herself from an IVANKA meme coin , yet that scam still made a profit. Even after Witkoff’s warning and the post's removal, the BARRON token’s price held steady, showing that fraudulent meme coins continue to attract traders. Political-themed scams are becoming more aggressive, and even high-profile figures like Vitalik Buterin feel powerless to stop them. The crypto community is seeing an alarming rise in fake meme coins linked to politicians, fueled by speculation and new investors willing to take risks. BARRON’s price remains strong despite being fake. The trend of fraudulent meme coins isn’t slowing down. In January, scammers falsely linked an XRP wallet to the US Treasury, though it’s unclear how much money they gained. More recently, the X accounts of two former world leaders—a Brazilian President and a Malaysian Prime Minister —were hacked to promote fake tokens, generating over $1 million. With meme coin speculation becoming more like gambling, the crypto space should prepare for even more scams like BARRON. A survey showed that 40% of TRUMP investors were completely new to crypto, and scammers are taking full advantage of this wave of inexperienced traders. Even though many traders know these tokens are fake, they still gamble on them, hoping for quick profits. This growing trend is starting to damage the credibility of the industry.",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TRADING|REGULATION|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-13 07:42:51

In a surprising turn, prosecutors weakened their own case by overestimating claims and discrediting a key witness. The two have agreed to forfeit assets and assist in reimbursing victims, though their sentencing remains uncertain. HashFlare was once seen as a respected cloud mining business, but things unraveled in 2022 when Potapenko and Turõgin were arrested for defrauding investors of $575 million. Following a long legal battle, they pleaded guilty today. ""As Ivan admitted, their business did mine crypto, but not as much as promised. Sometimes, instead of real mining profits, they repaid users with crypto bought from the market. However, no customer has suffered actual harm,"" their defense lawyer stated. While they accepted guilt, they tried to emphasize that the damage was limited. HashFlare lured users with the promise of mining cryptocurrency from home, but it never had enough resources to deliver. Instead, customer funds were used to buy assets, which were falsely presented as mining earnings. According to the FBI , this fraudulent scheme ran from 2015 to 2018, when HashFlare invoked a clause allowing it to shut down after 28 days of unprofitability. The bulk of user funds went to their own enrichment. However, in their guilty plea, the founders expressed regret and a willingness to pay back victims. They agreed to surrender frozen assets, including luxury cars and real estate, and to provide customer data to aid reimbursement. Despite this, their guilty plea might not be enough to significantly reduce their sentence. The prosecution made major mistakes in its handling of the case. The Department of Justice (DoJ) initially accused them of moving $95 million in crypto after their arrest, arguing that this showed they had lied to pretrial services and couldn’t be trusted. However, federal prosecutors' key witness lost credibility, weakening the case. One of the most serious missteps was an overstatement of damages by $225 million . This led to rushed negotiations to salvage some form of justice. Ultimately, the two executives pleaded guilty to a single charge while nearly 20 others were dropped. Their final sentence is still unknown, but the situation could have been far worse for them.",,EN,0,0,MINING|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-13 07:45:23

Despite Trump’s recent crypto-friendly actions , this deal was not about supporting the industry but securing Fogel’s release. Vinnik, tied to a massive money laundering case, is expected to remain in Russian custody. Vinnik has faced years of legal trouble since his arrest in 2017. He launched BTC-e, an early crypto exchange, in 2011, but the platform was shut down amid serious allegations of money laundering and other crimes. Now, according to the New York Post , Trump has sent Vinnik back to Russia in exchange for Fogel. “We now know what Russia received in this deal. Accused Russian money launderer Alexander Vinnik is being released from US custody in exchange for Marc Fogel,” CNN’s Zachary Cohen reported. The swap allows Fogel, who was sentenced to 14 years in Russia for carrying marijuana, to return to the US. Vinnik’s legal battles have stretched across multiple countries. After his 2017 arrest in Greece, he was extradited to France and later sent to the US in 2022. While facing previous money laundering charges, new allegations surfaced in 2024, leading to a guilty plea . The White House defended the deal, stating, “We view this as a very fair trade. We are not exchanging the Merchant of Death for a basketball player.” Officials confirmed that Vinnik remains in US custody in northern California, awaiting his transfer to Russia . While this exchange may seem like part of Trump’s broader support for crypto figures , it’s not the same as his recent pardon of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht. Ulbricht was freed after over a decade in prison, a decision widely celebrated in the crypto space. However, Vinnik’s case is different. The Russian government has been pushing for his extradition since at least 2018. Reports suggest that he admitted to Russian law enforcement that he was involved in a cyber fraud case linked to BTC-e, with damages totaling $14.6 million. Even though he may prefer being in Russia, Vinnik is unlikely to gain full freedom. The US government’s priority was Fogel’s release , not helping Vinnik. Fogel has already returned home, visited the White House , and publicly thanked Trump. Meanwhile, Vinnik remains in custody, awaiting his transfer to Russia.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-13 07:47:18

Between February 1 and 5 alone, the market plummeted by over 5.62%. Importantly, it has not yet recovered from the aforementioned correction. In the last seven days, the BTC price has dropped by almost 1.9%. Renowned technical and on-chain analyst Ali Martinez suggests that if the Bitcoin price falls below $92,110, it could slip sharply to $70,000. Currently, the price of Bitcoin stands at $96,037.47 . Bitcoin’s Key Resistance at $97,530 Between February 4 and 5, the Bitcoin market declined sharply from $101,333.27 to $96,607.94. Since February 6, the market has remained inside the range of $97,896.66 and $95,791.74. Ali notes that there exists a strong resistance in the BTC market at the range of $97,530. It is sensible to assume that if the market breaks above this range, it could experience a strong bullish momentum. The most important resistance level for #Bitcoin $BTC is at $97,530. However, support below $92,110 is weak, as there’s a gap between $90,000 and $70,000. pic.twitter.com/yW575BOBKk — Ali (@ali_charts) February 13, 2025 Bitcoin’s Weak Support Below $92,110 It was on January 9 that Bitcoin touched its lowest yearly closing price of $92,569.92. Notably, at a point on February 3, the market slipped to a low of $91,238.24. Ali opines that there exists a weak support in the market at around $92,110. This implies that it is less strength for the market to resist a serious selling pressure at this level. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bullish Sign for Crypto? BlackRock’s Multi-Million Investment in BTC and ETH , Bitcoin’s Dangerous Price Gap Between $90K and $70K Importantly, Ali warns that there is a serious price gap between $90,000 and $70,000. This means that if the BTC price falls below the $90,000 range, it could drop swiftly to $70,000. Notably, at a point on January 13, the Bitcoin market touched as low as $89,305,15. On that day, buyers managed to push the price to around $94,545.97 by the time of market closing. In conclusion, Bitcoin’s current price levels are critical. A break above $97,530 could lead to strong gains, but falling below $92,110 may cause a sharp drop. The gap between $90,000 and $70,000 adds further risk. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

If these bills pass, they would require $23 billion in Bitcoin purchases, creating significant demand. This could also lead to state pension funds investing in BTC , further increasing pressure on supply. With Bitcoin already approaching a supply shock , even a few successful bills could send prices soaring. Since President Trump first pledged to create a national Bitcoin Reserve, several states have taken steps to build their own. Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck , analyzed these proposals, highlighting their potential impact. “We reviewed 20 state-level Bitcoin reserve bills. If enacted, they could lead to 247,000 BTC in purchases, worth $23 billion. This figure doesn’t include pension fund investments, which could add even more demand,” Sigel stated. Although Trump ordered the creation of a federal crypto stockpile, it hasn’t fully delivered on his campaign promise. Meanwhile, individual states are making progress. Utah’s Bitcoin Reserve bill has passed its first committee, while Oklahoma and Arizona have reached the same stage. North Carolina also advanced its proposal today, moving it to the Committee for Commerce and Economic Development. If these Bitcoin Reserve bills become law, the impact on BTC’s price could be massive. States would be legally required to buy Bitcoin, adding a wave of demand. This doesn’t even account for pension funds, which in some cases could become tied to these reserves. Beyond state governments, a flood of consumer interest could follow. If multiple states are mandated to hold Bitcoin, everyday investors might jump in, fearing they’ll miss out. With Bitcoin already nearing a supply crisis, these proposals could act as a detonator for an even bigger price surge. Right now, Bitcoin’s supply struggles to meet rising demand , and 20 state-level reserves could add enormous pressure. While it's unclear how many of these bills will ultimately pass, even a handful could significantly shift the market. A federal Bitcoin Reserve, if created, would be a game-changer that could reshape the crypto landscape entirely.",,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-13 07:49:51

From regulatory victories to growing interest from institutional investors, XRP’s journey to a potential $15 target comes from big developments like Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin launch. Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) is stepping up to potentially solve Bitcoin’s long-standing issues with its Layer-2 technology. Let’s check out the details. In-Depth Analysis of XRP’s Technical Trends and Market Drivers – Can It Reach $15 in 2025? XRP is currently trading at around $2.40, marking a 1.8% jump in the past 24 hours. Its market cap is sitting at a hefty $137.4 billion, which makes it the third-largest cryptocurrency out there. Over the past week, XRP has climbed 15.8%, contributing to a massive 322.9% surge over the last year. Daily trading volume is impressive too, with about $3.46 billion changing hands in the last 24 hours. The all-time high for XRP was $3.40 back in January 2018, so its current price is still about 30% below that peak. With 57.41 billion XRP tokens circulating and a total supply of nearly 100 billion, there’s plenty of it in play. The RSI is currently at 54, which puts XRP in the neutral zone. Ripple Labs recently got the green light from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to launch its RLUSD stablecoin. This approval has given XRP a serious boost, with its price surging by over 23% in just a few days. More asset management firms are starting to take an interest in XRP. WisdomTree, for example, has rolled out a new XRP exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe. It’s physically backed and comes with a super-low management fee of 0.50%—the lowest in Europe for this kind of product. This move gives investors an easy and affordable way to get in on the action with XRP. Now, let’s talk about the predictions. The XRP Avengers believe XRP could hit $15 by the end of January 2025 and draw parallels to its explosive rise back in March 2017. Armando Pantoja says XRP will climb to $2.89 soon, then break past $3. He identifies key resistance levels at $3.50 and $4, with the potential to surge to $8 and even $10. He credits this outlook to a balanced RSI, whales buying during price dips, and growing utility from the RLUSD stablecoin launch. On a more conservative side, AltcoinMarksman expects XRP to touch $3 in January 2025, with price swings between $3.50 and $5. They predict a peak of $5 to $7 during the next bull run. PlutoChain’s ($PLUTO) Layer-2 Technology Could Bridge Bitcoin with DeFi and NFTs PlutoChain ($PLUTO) offers a new, robust approach to some of Bitcoin’s biggest hurdles. Slow transactions, congestion, and high fees often leave users frustrated. PlutoChain could address these issues with a hybrid Layer-2 network that works alongside Bitcoin’s blockchain. This design could help reduce traffic, cut costs, and improve scalability. Another one of Bitcoin’s hurdles is that its 10-minute block time can’t match the speed of Ethereum or Solana. PlutoChain’s Layer-2 tech, however, could slash transaction times to just 2 seconds on its own chain. This breakthrough wouldn’t just make Bitcoin faster—it would open the door to smart contracts while keeping its rock-solid security intact. With this upgrade, Bitcoin could shift from being a store of value to a more dynamic platform. PlutoChain also supports Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which could enable Ethereum-based projects to integrate with Bitcoin. This compatibility could spark a new wave of DeFi, NFTs, and even AI applications within Bitcoin’s ecosystem. Tests have already shown promise, with the network handling 43,200 transactions a day without a hitch. To guarantee top-notch security, PlutoChain has already undergone audits from SolidProof, QuillAudits, and Assure DeFi. Regular checks and stress tests make sure the system stays reliable and meets global standards. The PlutoChain core contributors put its community first. Users play a key role in shaping the network by proposing ideas on Discord for upgrades, partnerships, and new features. Final Words With predictions ranging from conservative estimates to ambitious goals, XRP remains one of the most talked-about assets in the crypto space. Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) might show us how blockchain technology can advance and offer a glimpse of a more scalable, versatile future for Bitcoin. With the mainnet launch, PlutoChain could be an interesting project to watch in the next couple of weeks. ——————— This article is purely informational and should not be interpreted as financial advice.

Yesterday, the X account of Eric Semler, the president of the giant company Semler Scientific listed on Nasdaq, was hacked, while today, the X account of one of the names close to Donald Trump was hacked. At this point, the X account of Zach Witkoff, co-founder of the Trump-backed DeFi project World Liberty Financial, was hacked. The hacker hacked Zach Witkoff’s X account and then introduced a fake memecoin called BARRON, which was related to Trump’s youngest son, Barron Trump. The hacker went on to claim that Trump would soon verify the legitimacy of the token. The fake memecoin called BARRON rose rapidly after this fake post, but its collapse was also very fast. While the hacking incident was confirmed by the WLFI X account, the team told users to ignore the fake posts. “Zach Witkoff's account was compromised and a fake Barron's meme was shared.

33767162,[object Object],1739433649,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Holds Steady Amid Volatility As Altcoins And ERC20 Tokens Face Significant Sell Pressure – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-holds-steady-amid-volatility-as-altcoins-and-erc20-tokens-face-significant-sell-pressure-details/,"Bitcoin has experienced a quiet weekend following the massive volatility it faced last week. The price closed around the $96,500 mark for five consecutive days and has ranged between $95K and $98K in the past hours, signaling a lack of clear direction in the short term. This indecisive price action has left bulls struggling to reclaim control, while bears are unable to push the price into lower demand zones. Despite the recent consolidation, market uncertainty continues to weigh on investor sentiment, with both sides waiting for a decisive move. Bitcoin’s resilience above critical support levels contrasts sharply with the significant sell pressure faced by altcoins. According to key metrics shared by Glassnode, Bitcoin has remained near its starting position over recent weeks despite ongoing market volatility. Meanwhile, altcoins, particularly Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens, have experienced notable underperformance, reflecting weakness in adoption and positioning within the broader market. As Bitcoin holds steady in its range, it highlights its strength compared to the broader crypto market, signaling a shift in investor preference toward the leading cryptocurrency. However, with no clear breakout above $98K or breakdown below $95K, the coming days will be crucial in determining Bitcoin’s short-term direction amid the ongoing market uncertainty. Bitcoin Outperforms As Altcoins Bleed Bitcoin is leading the crypto market amid ongoing volatility and uncertainty, demonstrating resilience while most altcoins continue to bleed. Bulls have managed to push BTC above the $90K level, maintaining the bullish structure despite turbulent market conditions. However, price action remains indecisive in the short term, with no clear breakout or breakdown as volatility continues to dominate. Key metrics from Glassnode shared on X reveal that Bitcoin has remained near its starting position over recent weeks despite experiencing significant volatility. In contrast, altcoins have faced heavy sell pressure, particularly those built on Ethereum’s ERC20 standard. ERC20 tokens are a type of cryptocurrency that operates on the Ethereum blockchain, following a standardized set of rules for token creation and deployment. They are widely used for decentralized applications, initial coin offerings (ICOs), and various DeFi projects. All ERC20 sub-sectors, including DeFi, gaming, and utility tokens, have underperformed recently, reflecting broad-based weakness in both adoption and market positioning. This stark contrast highlights Bitcoin’s relative strength, as investors increasingly favor the leading cryptocurrency amid uncertain conditions. While Bitcoin holds steady, the lack of a decisive move suggests the market is still seeking clarity. Bulls must push BTC above key levels like $98K and $100K to reignite bullish momentum, while bears aim to test demand closer to $90K. The coming weeks will be critical in determining whether Bitcoin can sustain its leadership role or if market-wide uncertainty will trigger further downside. Price Struggles Between Key Liquidity Levels Bitcoin is trading at $96,100 after several days of sideways price action, ranging between $94,700 and $98,500. Short-term direction remains uncertain as bulls and bears continue to battle for control. Bulls have struggled to reclaim the $100K mark, a critical level for confirming bullish momentum, while bears have failed to push the price below $95K, where strong demand continues to hold. For Bitcoin to confirm a short-term reversal, bulls must reclaim the $98K mark as support and push decisively above $100K. This move would signal strength and set the stage for a potential rally toward all-time highs around $109K. However, the inability to break above $100K has left the market in a speculative phase, with both sides cautious about the next significant move. If the $95K level is lost, Bitcoin could face a sharper correction, with lower demand levels around $89K likely coming into play. This area represents critical support, as it aligns with the realized price of new whale investors, a level where large players are unlikely to sell at a loss. The coming days will be pivotal in determining whether BTC can regain bullish momentum or if further downside is on the horizon, deepening uncertainty across the market.

In a new video, Pizzino tells his 348,000 YouTube subscribers that the “probabilities of a crash continue to increase” for Bitcoin and other crypto assets. According to Pizzino, one of the bearish signals he has observed is a falling interest in Bitcoin. “Some more things that I’m seeing in regard to the probabilities of a crash increasing here are the interests through Google Trends. So less people are searching for Bitcoin and crypto… …the volumes are now down to 24 [out of a maximum 100] for Bitcoin and 12 for crypto.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube On the wider crypto market, the widely followed analyst says that one of the signals suggesting bearishness is the daily exchange volume, the value of all cryptocurrency trades executed on centralized exchanges within a 24-hour period, which is on a downtrend. “We haven’t broken down from the $50 billion [of daily exchange volume], we haven’t got back to the previous lows of $30 billion but we’re not back at those highs of $130, $120 billion either. So we’re in this sort of middle period but you can clearly see the trends are down – lower highs, lower lows… …so essentially I’m seeing more weakness in this particular [daily exchange volume] chart because there haven’t been higher highs continuing to form with the exchange volume.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube For Bitcoin to change the momentum to a bullish one, Pizzino says, “I would need to see Bitcoin’s price break above this top – that’s on the 3rd of February, that big dump and pump day, and the top there was $102,600… so for a round number, call it $103,000. And I want to see the pump get above there and sustain above that level, above $103,000. So some closes, another day’s price action above there, some closes. It can dip down intra-day but at the end of the day I want to see the closes above those levels.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube Bitcoin is trading at $96,220 at time of writing. ?

Moreover, investors are curious with questions like “Will XRP price ever recover?” In this article, we at CoinPedia have uncovered the market sentiments and possible short-term Ripple Price Analysis just for you! Ripple Price On The Verge Of A Major Breakout? Amid increased market volatility, the XRP price has jumped ~2% in 24 hours with a trading volume of $5.446 billion, a change of +14.61%. Despite recording a correction of 3.57% over the last 30 days, the XRP coin price has soared 17.14% this year, suggesting a long-term bullish action. TradingView: XRP/USDT The Simple Moving Average (SMA) is on the path of recording a bullish convergence in the daily time frame. This highlights an increase in the positive influence of altcoin on the cryptocurrency market. Furthermore, the MACD indicator records a constant decline in the red histogram with its averages witnessing a high possibility of a positive crossover in the upcoming time. This suggests that the XRP price may continue gaining value this week. Will Ripple Price Hit $3 This Week? Suppose, the bullish sentiment sustains, in that case, the XRP coin price could surpass its immediate resistance of $2.5 and head toward its $3 mark. Maintaining the price above that level could push the price of XRP token beyond $3.5 in the coming time. Conversely, if the Ripple price faces rejection at its resistance level of $2.5, this could result in it dropping toward its low of $2.25.

Six men have been charged in connection with the crime after allegedly stealing $15 million in cryptocurrency, including Zehuan Wei, Fan Zhang, Huajing Yan, Shengnan Jiang, Shiqiang Lian, and Ye Cao, a Chicago Tribune story citing recently unsealed FBI records reported on Feb. 12. According to the FBI, the kidnapping took place in a Chicago townhouse when one of the suspects knocked on the door, pretending to have damaged the victim’s garage door. When the victim answered, armed men forced their way inside and took the family and their nanny at gunpoint. The victims were taken in a van to an Airbnb in Forest Park, where they were held for a night before being moved to another house. The kidnappers demanded ransom payments in Bitcoin, Ether, and other cryptocurrencies, threatening to kill them if they refused. The kidnappers also gained access to the victims’ crypto accounts and made transactions themselves. One of the victims was hit on the head with a gun, though he later believed it might have been fake. He also managed to contact his father through WeChat, alerting him to the situation. After five days in captivity, the kidnappers released the victims on Nov. 1. Of the $15 million stolen, authorities later determined that $9 million remains unaccounted for.

Security cameras at the Forest Park Airbnb captured the kidnappers arriving in a white van and making phone calls. Investigators matched this footage to the suspects using U.S. Customs and Border Protection records and state-issued driver’s licenses. At least two victims were able to identify some of the suspects in a photo lineup. Wei was the first suspect to be apprehended. U.S. Customs and Border Protection arrested him on Jan. 17 while he attempted to re-enter the country from Mexico at the Otay Mesa border crossing in California. The FBI later determined that Jiang and Yan had boarded a flight from Tijuana, Mexico, to Beijing on Jan. 19, followed by Lian the next day. Authorities believe some of the remaining suspects fled to China after Wei’s arrest. On Dec. 13, all six men were formally charged with kidnapping. Recent crypto kidnappings As cryptocurrencies become mainstream, they are also becoming prime targets for crime. Last month, David Balland, the co-founder of cryptocurrency hardware wallet manufacturer Ledger, was kidnapped and held for ransom. In November, Dean Skurka, CEO of WonderFi, was abducted in Toronto and was released after a $1 million ransom was paid. According to reports, the suspects believed the victim held a significant amount of Bitcoin, which, however, was not the case.

However, historical data reveals that most of these face a sell-off right after that, continuing for weeks or even months. This trend is clearly visible in three meme coins: Pudgy Penguin (PENGU), Animecoin (ANIME), and Berachain (BERA). These coins witnessed an initial influx of gains but have plummeted more than 60%. Let’s look at their performance. PENGU, ANIME, & BERA Altcoins Dropped 60% Post Launch A renowned crypto analyst, FFV, has an interesting finding about new crypto tokens’ performance. According to FFV’s X post , people quickly move on from altcoins that lack significant value, as has happened with the PENGU, ANIME, and BERA. The analyst reveals that since the airdrop for Pudgy Penguin and the other two tokens were placed, their price has declined by at least 60%, showcasing a troubling trend. All these trending meme coins had different launch timelines but the same result. The price of PENGU dropped 70% since the airdrop, the price of ANIME dropped 80% from launch, and the price of BERA dropped 60% from its peak. The biggest challenge with crypto airdrops is that people quickly move on from assets that lack an incentive model. Most investors sell their airdropped tokens immediately after receiving them, resulting in price crashes. How Are These Crypto Tokens Performing Today? Ever since the recent crypto market crash in January, the majority of digital assets have struggled. This includes the Bitcoin price wreck and continued consolidation, which has stagnated the recovery for the rest of the crypto tokens as well. Although BERA, ANIME, and PENGU are struggling with the larger picture, their performance has improved today. According to the CoinMarketCap data, BERA is new to the market and trades at $5.491 after an 8% surge in the last 24 hours. Also, its market capitalization and trading volume are at $653.54M and $368.47M, respectively. However, despite the rising value, BERA’s price is 60% down from its ATH of $14.99, set just a week ago. Pudgy Penguin token also witnessed increased investor interest. It is trading at $0.01076 after an 11% surge today. The demand is clearly visible, as the trading volume has surged 98% to $166.01M due to its listing on the Coinbase exchange. The increased visibility and investor interest could fuel its recovery, overcoming the 81% drop it faced from its prime of $0.05738, set two months ago. Lastly, the ANIME token price surged 4% today after facing a complete downtrend for a month. Although its peak is $0.1861, it has declined 82% from that, currently trading at $0.02754. The broader recovery in the meme coin sector has favored this surge. Interestingly, the meme-themed cryptocurrency category has been struggling for an entire month. Today, the category witnessed a 5% surge in market capitalization to $72.67 billion, hinting at the possibility of recoveries for these aforementioned altcoins. Should You Buy These Crashing Altcoins? It is important to analyze which crypto tokens to buy amid the volatile crypto market. However, what’s more important is the price you buy. Notably, buying the dip is a standard norm in the industry, where traders buy where prices are down. However, a few other factors, like market sentiments, token utility, and upcoming updates, are important, as meme coins usually thrive on hype. Among these three altcoins, PUDGY’s hype is thriving amid the Coinbase listing. Meanwhile, the two lack any fundamental hyped factors. More importantly, BERA is facing post-airdrop consolidation and controversy around the Berachain airdrop, so the future remains uncertain. Traders should lead the activities cautiously and build proper trading strategies before buying these tokens. Key Things To Remember No cryptocurrency is entirely safe from the market’s volatility. As a result, the value of these crypto changes, but the recovery may decide their future. Some analysts consider a dip a buying opportunity, but traders should consider many other factors before randomly buying a token. Pudgy Penguin, Berachain, and Animecoin altcoins were thriving with gains at one point but have declined 60% past then. Amid these, PENGU is still gaining attention, hinting at the possibility of better recovery, but the other two struggle with post-launch volatility.
