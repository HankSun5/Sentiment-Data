Technical indicators suggest that SHIB could embark on a massive rally once this breakout occurs, as analysis predicts a price surge of over 250% in the coming months. Shiba Inu Price Gears Up For 250% Rally Shiba Inu (SHIB), the second-largest meme cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is showing signs of a potential breakout to the upside. A crypto analyst identified as Rose Premium Signals on X (formerly Twitter) highlighted that SHIB is currently retesting the perfect accumulation zone, representing a crucial support level that historically acts as a launchpad for a price rally. The analyst predicts that Shiba Inu is set for a 250% price surge to new highs. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Gearing Up To Fly After Lows, Here’s The Target After experiencing months of decline and volatility, the price formed a unique technical pattern called a Falling Wedge. This pattern is a classic bullish reversal signal that forms when there is a downward trend in a cryptocurrency’s price action. Considering that Shiba Inu has recorded multiple price crashes to new lows, the emergence of this pattern breathes optimism into the meme coin’s future outlook. Rose Premium Signals has shared a price chart, providing a clearer view of this technical pattern. The chart shows that SHIB is nearing the apex of its Falling Wedge pattern and is on the verge of a breakout. A successful breakout from this bullish pattern could trigger a sharp upward movement, propelling the Shiba Inu price by 250% towards key resistance levels at $0.00002913, $0.00003612, and ultimately $0.00004401. This final price target represents a staggering 251% increase from Shiba Inu’s current market value. The analyst has set a timeline for his optimistic prediction, forecasting that Shiba Inu will hit a price peak of $0.00004401 in the next 77 days, around April 29, 2025. On a side note, Rose Premium Signals expects a breakdown in the Shiba Inu price before this projected rally. The analyst predicts that Shiba Inu could decline and hit a final price low of $0.00001299 before it embarks on its surge to $0.00004401. This price crash is expected to occur around March 2025. If this bearish projection holds, it may present a prime buying opportunity for investors aiming to capitalize on the analyst’s 250% SHIB price rally forecast. TD Sequential Flashes Buy Signal For SHIB According to data from CoinMarketCap, the SHIB price is currently trading at $0.000015, recording declines of over 3.9% in the last 24 hours and 23.8% over the past month. While the meme coin still faces bearish pressure, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has revealed that Shiba Inu’s TD Sequential indicator has flashed a buy signal on the weekly chart.

A regulated fund tied to Dogecoin could bring unprecedented inflows, pushing the meme coin toward mainstream adoption. Yet, as the market braces for this possibility, an unexpected beneficiary has emerged: RCO Finance. Analysts suggest that RCO Finance might witness a massive 44,000% surge if a Dogecoin ETF is approved. Can a coin, once dismissed as a mere internet joke become the catalyst for another DeFi breakthrough? The Rising Promise of a Dogecoin ETF An exchange-traded fund pegged to Dogecoin could dramatically reshape perceptions about this once-whimsical asset. Dogecoin soared on viral social media buzz in previous cycles, attracting celebrity endorsements and millions of new investors. But a Dogecoin ETF would mark a significant step up, giving more conservative investors an avenue to own Dogecoin through regulated channels without wrestling with private wallets or unregulated exchanges. Critics question whether a Dogecoin ETF can tame the meme-based volatility that defines this coin. Nonetheless, market history shows that ETFs often serve as gateways for mainstream capital. Even skeptics acknowledge that approval could funnel billions in fresh liquidity into Dogecoin, creating a tide that lifts other innovative platforms. If the hype surrounding a Dogecoin ETF matches early bitcoin ETF mania, the ripple effects could be enormous, impacting a broad swath of crypto assets, including those like RCO Finance offering more than just speculative value. Dogecoin’s Continued Magnetism Although Dogecoin started as a joke, it matured into a digital asset with a market cap in the billions of dollars. It briefly traded at $0.74 at its peak, turning many early holders into overnight millionaires. Even when the hype simmered, Dogecoin remained a staple of crypto discussions, thanks to its loyal community and frequent cameos in mainstream media. The possibility of a Dogecoin ETF amplifies the coin’s attraction. Investors who missed out on the original rally might jump in, hoping to see Dogecoin replicate its meteoric run. Others who once viewed it as a meme might consider if they can invest via traditional brokerage accounts. This influx of attention could revitalize Dogecoin’s price movement—and, by extension, create fertile ground for DeFi projects aligned with market expansion. Yet, Dogecoin is not alone in seizing this moment. As the spotlight intensifies, many traders scout for platforms bridging the gap between crypto speculation and real-world utility. This is where RCO Finance stands ready to captivate a wider audience, especially those who demand more comprehensive functionality than what meme coins typically deliver. RCO Finance: Bridging Assets and AI-Driven Insights With its token priced at $0.1 and over $13 million raised, RCO Finance has rapidly positioned itself as a next-generation DeFi hub. As a non-KYC platform, it lets users buy stocks, bonds, real estate, and cryptocurrencies under one roof, bypassing the hassle of converting to fiat. This practical approach to asset diversification sets RCO Finance apart from projects reliant solely on speculative momentum. Central to RCO Finance is the Robo Advisor, an AI-powered tool that aggregates signals from Bloomberg, Reuters, and on-chain analytics. Beyond spotting breakout tokens, it helps mitigate risk by indicating optimal times to take profits or reduce exposure. Imagine detecting a lesser-known coin like TRUMP, which soared by 646%—the Robo Advisor could have flagged such an opportunity well before social media chatter kicked in. Moreover, the Beta Platform allows hands-on experience with advanced features, including high-leverage trading and automated staking. Credibility is further strengthened by a SolidProof audit confirming robust smart contracts. RCO Finance offers a more grounded alternative to meme-driven runs by combining transparency, AI insights, and cross-asset transactions. Should a Dogecoin ETF pour new life into the broader crypto market, this utility-focused approach may attract an influx of capital seeking sustainable gains. 44,000% Surge: Why RCO Finance Could Ride the Dogecoin ETF Wave Historically, altcoins that delivered four- or five-digit returns found success by addressing untapped market needs. RCO Finance’s blend of AI technology, non-KYC onboarding, and multi-asset integration speaks to a maturing audience. As capital moves beyond meme coins in search of stable yet potent growth, the platform’s data-driven ecosystem could become a magnet for both institutional and retail players. Of course, even the best forecasts are not guaranteed, and crypto remains a high-risk space. Nonetheless, the synergy of a Dogecoin ETF rally and a platform like RCO Finance suggests the potential for an explosive 2025. If memes have taught us anything, timing and sentiment can spark a wildfire of investment—but projects offering tangible solutions often sustain that momentum, transforming initial hype into lasting relevance.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, the development team behind Ondo Finance says it’s collaborating with World Liberty Financial (WLFI) as a means of bringing traditional finance to the world of blockchains. According to Ondo, WLFI is adding Ondo’s tokenized assets – such as the stablecoin Ondo US Dollar Yield ( USDY ) and the Ondo Short-Term US Treasuries Fund ( OUSG ) – into its network as treasury reserve assets. Furthermore, WLFI is planning on integrating USDY, OUSG and other tokenized securities from Ondo’s upcoming global markets into its network as a means of enabling seamless borrowing, lending, and margin trading for eligible customers. “Through this collaboration, World Liberty Financial plans to become a strategic collaborator in Ondo’s journey to scale Ondo Global Markets, a platform designed to enable the tokenization of traditional financial assets like stocks and bonds.” As stated by Donald Trump Jr., the “Web3 Ambassador” at WLFI, “Our collaboration with Ondo Finance marks a significant step forward in aligning traditional financial systems with blockchain innovation. By integrating Ondo’s tokenized assets, we’re providing our network with access to traditional financial assets and new yield opportunities.” Current data from blockchain intelligence firm Arkham shows that WLFI currently holds about $465,000 worth of ONDO. ONDO is trading for $1.37 at time of writing, a 1.6% increase during the last 24 hours.

See what he actually said,https://crypto.news/saylor-is-going-to-burn-his-private-keys-as-he-dies/,"On Feb. 9, 2025, Cointelegraph published a clip of a January interview with Strategy chair Michael Saylor on Fox. According to the caption, in the video, Saylor hints he is going to burn his BTC keys as he dies to ensure the coins will never be sold. Let’s see what Saylor said, is there a hint, and what is the purpose of burning the keys. Several media channels reposted the clip from Cointelegraph, with various headlines, from which one could conclude the Strategy exec is indeed going to pull his stashes into the grave as he dies. However, that’s not what he said in the clip. 🚨 FOX BUSINESS: Michael Saylor hints that after his death, his Bitcoin keys will be destroyed, ensuring his BTC is never sold—calling it a “pro rata contribution” to all Bitcoin holders. pic.twitter.com/RhGgfIuvlq — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) February 9, 2025 In the video, Saylor says that it would be good for someone who has a lot of bitcoins to burn the keys to make a “pro rata contribution” to all the BTC holders across the world “based on their contribution and their knowledge of Bitcoin.” The idea is simple – due to the deflationary nature of Bitcoin, as a large amount of BTC leaves the circulation forever, the remaining bitcoins get more valuable. It means that the rest of the BTC holders may get richer as a result of the move. In this regard, Saylor’s idea is similar to Donald Trump’s urge not to sell bitcoins and accumulate them strategically. Various proposals for Bitcoin reserves have a clause forbidding the sale of BTC for years in order to ensure market stability and consistent demand. Although Saylor is definitely a person who accumulated much BTC, the way he put his idea doesn’t oblige him to follow the script he described. He didn’t add a single word that could be seen as a hint that he himself is going to lock his bitcoins forever. Rather, he shared the idea with others. And yes, there is a chance that Saylor is considering doing something like this. However, Saylor can come up with another decision in the future. He concluded that he sees himself as a person who took Satoshi’s torch and continues to commercialize Bitcoin with corporations and governments. How good is this idea? At least, the idea correlates with the vision of Satoshi Nakamoto, who created Bitcoin scarcity on purpose. When Saylor speaks about how great Bitcoin is, he often emphasizes its scarcity as the prime driver of its price. During the PBD Podcast episode in 2024, he said that he could create more real estate in New York City, create more watches, create more gold (sic!), and any kind of commodity if he had enough time and money. But Bitcoin has an absolute cap which is 21 million, said Saylor. As the commodity price goes up, the producers are incentivized to produce more, which is not the case with Bitcoin. That’s why Bitcoin is a great store of value, according to Saylor. He claims that the American dollar will be de facto-backed by Bitcoin as soon as the government starts to invest in it. In Saylor’s opinion, this will make the dollar more powerful, not less, as some experts warn. The reason is the same–as long as the country owns a huge chunk of the world’s BTC, its national currency will be strong. Nevertheless, it’s worth noting that scarcity drives the value of Bitcoin as long as demand for BTC stays strong. Let’s say someone draws a self-portrait, creating an extremely scarce item. Will it be extremely valuable? Not necessarily. Bitcoin is driven by demand. The growing scarcity of the asset boosts the demand further, increasing the urge of multiple entities (including corporations and governments) to acquire some. Let’s say someone with 450,000 BTC (an approximate amount in Saylor’s control as of January 2025) dies before the 2028 Bitcoin halving. In the 2024–2028 cycle, 450 BTC is produced every day. So, removing 450k bitcoins from circulation in one day eliminates the result of almost three years of mining between 2024 and 2028 or nearly everything that will be mined between 2028 and 2033. Some even compare this probable case to halving. However, unlike halving, a whale burning the keys is a different case. First off, unlike halving, it decreases the amount in circulation and second, it doesn’t involve miners having to raise BTC prices to keep mining profitability. However, the BTC buyers will have to compete for much fewer remaining bitcoins, which is a good climate for price growth. Generally, it seems that Saylor is right about the possible effect of such a move. However, there are some factors that may play his “plan” around. The future of lost bitcoins As of February 2025, over three million of the 20 million bitcoins that are already mined are considered “lost” due to forgotten or lost keys, coins sent to wrong addresses, and other reasons. According to other estimations, there are over 6 million lost bitcoins out there. You might also like: Nearly one-third of Bitcoin’s circulating supply possibly lost: report Although so many lost coins make Bitcoin even scarcer, the fate of these coins is not that conclusive. The very concept of a 21 million hard cap is not something unchangeable. The same mechanism that is used to improve the Bitcoin network can change the total supply of bitcoins or remove it altogether. This possibly was mentioned in an educational video on Bitcoin released by BlackRock, a company that has the largest amount of BTC. This unorthodox fact was met with anger and disapproval from the community, however, it doesn’t change the very fact that the hard cap can be changed if enough miners see this idea favorably, for any reason. If the hard cap goes away or the total supply increases, the value of lost bitcoins may drop and Saylor’s vision turns out to be false. Another concern is quantum computers. Quantum computers are one of the concerning technologies that are expected to drastically change the game as soon as they enter the scope. Quantum computers will be able to recover all lost coins, including Satoshi's if he's no longer living. Saylor better come up with a better plan than burying his keys with him. — LiveLifeWellNC (@30flygirl1) February 9, 2025 Their computational abilities may be strong enough to break BTC wallets. The Bitcoin community is preparing to prevent this but the outcome is not known as of now. There is a possibility that “lost” bitcoins will be freed or stolen via quantum computers.

Wainwright & Co. analyst Mike Colonnese Crypto exchange Coinbase is expected to report Q4 revenue of $1.911 billion in the first quarter, Colonnese said in a research note. This would imply upside potential compared to the Street’s consensus estimate of $1.8 billion. Coinbase is also expected to earn $2.21 per share in the quarter which is also ahead of the Street’s $2.16 per share estimate. ‘Strong tailwinds’ Colonnese noted that “strong tailwinds” in the fourth quarter contributed to better than expected results. Bitcoin ( BTC ) crossed $90,000 for the first time in history after Donald Trump’s election victory “proved to be a shot in the arm for the crypto industry,” the analyst wrote. BTC rallied hard and hit a new all-time high of $106,000 in mid-December, highlighting strong investor demand. Ethereum ( ETH ) also posted strong gains during the 4th quarter, rising 28% q/q to $3,330.

Coinbase to benefit from ongoing momentum According to the analyst, Coinbase is positioned to benefit from ongoing momentum.

Colonnese is also modeling Coinbase to earn $8.29 per share for the full-year 2025, up from a prior estimate of $2.77 per share.

Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said about the filing, “assuming this is acknowledged by the SEC (I'd probably make that assumption right now but you never know),” an SEC decision would be required by the end of October.

The video features an AI-generated version of the 40-year-old Hollywood actress alongside over a dozen other popular Jewish A-listers appearing to oppose rapper Kanye West’s recent antisemitic outburst on X. Scarlett Johansson denounces AI misuse Johansson is shown wearing a white T-shirt with an image of a hand flipping its middle finger. West, now Ye, went on a rant against Jews last weekend and even started selling Swastika T-shirts on his website. “It has been brought to my attention by family members and friends that an AI-generated video featuring my likeness…has been circulating online and gaining traction,” Johansson told People on Wednesday. “I am a Jewish woman who has no tolerance for antisemitism or hate speech of any kind. But I also firmly believe that the potential for hate speech multiplied by AI is a far greater threat than any one person who takes accountability for it. We must call out the misuse of AI, no matter its messaging, or we risk losing a hold on reality.” The video clip – reportedly created by Israeli generative AI expert Ori Bejerano, also features 20 AI versions of stars including Adam Sandler, Mila Kunis, Drake, Jerry Seinfeld, Steven Spielberg, Mark Zuckerberg, Sacha Baron Cohen, Jack Black, Lenny Kravitz, Ben Stiller, and David Schwimmer. In the video, the stars are wearing white T-shirts with the middle finger flipped off and a Star of David in the middle of the hand with Kanye’s name below it. In the end, the video declares that “Enough is Enough” and urges viewers to “Join the Fight Against Antisemitism”. In her statement, Johansson lamented how she has been “a very public victim of artificial intelligence”. But she also warned that the “threat of AI affects each and every one of us.” “There is a 1000-foot wave coming regarding AI that several progressive countries, not including the United States, have responded to in a responsible manner,” she detailed. “I urge the US government to make the passing of legislation limiting AI use a top priority; it is a bipartisan issue that enormously affects the immediate future of humanity at large.” Johansson. Johansson also said it was worrisome to note that the US government is “paralyzed when it comes to passing legislation that protects all of its citizens against the imminent dangers of AI.” The star has been caught up in AI controversy before This is not the first time that the “Fly Me to the Moon” star has had to deal with AI stealing her likeness. In May 2024, she criticized OpenAI after it emerged that the ChatGPT voice, Sky, resembled Johansson’s. OpenAI said Sky’s voice was “not an imitation of Johansson” but went on to suspend the voice anyway. And in November 2023, Johansson threatened to sue a company that used her likeness to create an advert. “The video included images produced by Lisa AI. It has nothing to do with this person,” the company denied the allegations. While Johansson is the only star in the fake video to speak against the Kanye West sentiments, other stars have previously aired their concerns. For instance, over the weekend before his Super Bowl ad aired, “Friends” actor David Schwimmer begged Elon Musk to block Kanye from X. “We can’t stop a deranged bigot from spewing hate-filled, ignorant bile… but we CAN stop giving him a megaphone, Mr. Musk,” Schwimmer wrote on Instagram . “Kanye West has 32.7 million followers on your platform, X. That’s twice as many people than the number of Jews in existence. His sick hate speech results in REAL LIFE violence against Jews,” added Schwimmer. According to CNN , Kanye West deactivated his X account on Sunday. An organization that works to combat Jewish hate and misinformation across social media Tel Aviv Institute co-founder Hen Mazzig commented on the AI video. “Misusing AI is dangerous, no doubt,” Mazzig wrote on X . “But you know what’s even more dangerous? Unchecked antisemitic hate being platformed to millions every single day.” Cryptopolitan Academy: FREE Web3 Resume Cheat Sheet - Download Now",AI,EN,0,0,REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-12 23:29:37

With these low costs, Adobe aims to compete with other AI startups like OpenAI and integrate artificial intelligence into its creative software package. Generate Video is available in public beta, following a limited early access testing period last year. The beta tool can be accessed via the redesigned Firefly web app, alongside new image generation and translation capabilities and AI credit subscription tiers for creators. Adobe added some minor improvements since it was first teased in September . Adobe lowers AI video pricing to compete with industry giants On Wednesday, Adobe unveiled its latest software, which creates 5-second videos with artificial intelligence for only 50 cents per video. In an attempt to compete with giants like OpenAI and Runway, Adobe is offering separate AI-specific subscriptions for only $9.99 and $29.99. Ely Greenfield, chief technology officer of Adobe’s creative software business, noted that the affordable prices serve to increase adoption rates while staying competitive and that the math speaks for itself. We’re pricing it at a lower point right now for adoption. If you do the math and look what’s out there, we’re competitive in the marketplace. Ely Greenfield This move most likely resulted from the massive 25% drop in Adobe’s shares in 2024, when investors feared that AI startups might subdue the company. Since then, the company has been integrating generative AI features into its star applications, like Photoshop. The computer software company began launching tools powered by its generative AI Firefly Video Model at the end of 2024, starting with the Generative Extend tool in beta for Premiere Pro that can be used to extend the end or beginning of footage. Adobe integrates AI into creative tools to compete with Runway and OpenAI Adobe’s Generate Video tool rollout comes a few weeks after OpenAI launched its own text-to-video generator, Sora, to ChatGPT paid subscribers, allowing them to generate AI videos using prompts. Runway charges users 70 cents to $1.20 to generate a 5-second video using its newest AI model and has an unlimited plan for $95 per month. Adobe faces growing competition in the AI video market. In addition to Sora, Google is testing the second generation of its Veo AI video model, which, judging by early demo examples, looks more impressive than OpenAI’s model. ByteDance and Pika Labs have also recently announced new video-focused generative AI tools. Adobe seeks to stand out from the crowd by integrating AI into its existing tools and working towards better controls over its output. With the new subscriptions, users can generate AI videos, photos, and illustrations and use the credits for different audio features like transcription. The computer software company claims that users have generated photos and other media using Firefly AI more than 18 billion times since December, when the numbers read 16 billion. This new AI integration will generate high-definition videos as the company works towards higher-resolution models for professional production.

With new projects emerging, investors are constantly on the lookout for the next big breakout. Could Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) be the one? While the meme coin market remains dynamic, two other projects have been making waves. Book of Meme has seen a surge in trading activity, and TRUMP Meme Coin continues to gather momentum among traders. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, Book of Meme, and TRUMP Meme Coin. Earn 66% APY Staking Rewards with Arctic Pablo Coin – A Golden Opportunity Arctic Pablo Coin is among the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now, and for good reason. One standout feature that sets it apart is its lucrative 66% APY staking rewards during the presale. Unlike most meme coins that rely purely on speculative hype, Arctic Pablo Coin provides an actual utility—allowing investors to stake their tokens and earn substantial passive income even before the official launch. This staking opportunity isn’t just a minor bonus; it’s a game-changer for those looking to maximize their holdings. Imagine accumulating more APC while the project moves through its presale stages, potentially increasing your overall profit at launch. The staking rewards ensure that early adopters reap continuous benefits while the project gains traction. With a high-yield staking mechanism already in place, Arctic Pablo Coin positions itself as a top-tier investment in the meme coin space. But the excitement doesn’t stop here—its presale is already making headlines. Arctic Pablo Coin Enters Aqua Frost Phase – Get in Before the Price Surges Arctic Pablo Coin is among the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now, and this meme coin presale is setting the stage for one of the most explosive launches in recent history. The project has now entered Aqua Frost, the 10th phase, marking a crucial milestone in its journey toward the official launch. Currently, 1 APC is priced at just $0.000059, but that won’t last long. Early investors have the potential to experience a staggering 13,451.72% ROI from this stage to the launch price of $0.008. The numbers speak for themselves: over $1.1 million has already been raised, reflecting strong investor confidence. As Arctic Pablo Coin progresses through its presale stages, each phase brings a price increase, meaning those who delay might find themselves paying significantly more. The window for getting in at an entry-level price is closing fast. The buzz surrounding Aqua Frost is undeniable. With such incredible ROI potential and the momentum building rapidly, Arctic Pablo Coin is drawing massive attention from both retail and whale investors alike. Book of Meme’s Surge: Price & Market Movement Book of Meme (BOME) continues to gain traction, making its presence felt in the meme coin space. Today, BOME is priced at $0.002031, with an astonishing $59,266,474 in 24-hour trading volume. This surge in trading activity highlights growing investor interest and confidence in the project. With meme coins proving to be volatile yet rewarding, Book of Meme is capturing attention as traders look for potential short-term and long-term gains. TRUMP Meme Coin Gathers Momentum TRUMP Meme Coin has been making headlines with increasing trading volume and investor engagement. The meme-inspired token has garnered significant attention, riding the wave of political and cultural trends that have driven its demand. The current price of the TRUMP Meme Coin is USD 0.000746, with a 24-hour trading volume of USD 1,901,237. Its unique branding and community-driven nature have solidified its place among the most talked-about meme coins today. As traders explore new opportunities, TRUMP Meme Coin remains an exciting project worth watching. Final Thoughts: Is Arctic Pablo Coin the Best Bet? Meme coins continue to evolve, offering diverse investment opportunities. Book of Meme has shown strong market activity, and TRUMP Meme Coin maintains its momentum among investors. However, Arctic Pablo Coin is among the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now and presents a highly lucrative presale with massive staking rewards and exceptional ROI potential. With its 66% APY staking rewards, the Aqua Frost presale phase, and the low current entry price of $0.000059, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as a top-tier contender in the meme coin space. As prices rise with each new phase, the best time to get in is now—before the window closes.

Market trends shift rapidly, prices fluctuate, and big names dominate headlines. What if the smartest investments lie in altcoins under $1, offering exponential growth before the masses catch on? JetBolt (JBOLT), VeChain (VET), Sei (SEI), and WallitIQ (WLTQ) are four promising altcoins still trading at bargain prices. Each holds potential, but one stands out above the rest. For investors looking to maximize returns, timing is everything. JetBolt (JBOLT): Early Hype, But Will It Last? Hyped as a futuristic DeFi solution, JetBolt (JBOLT) has gained traction among traders searching for innovative altcoins. Its rapid adoption and community-driven initiatives fuel speculation, but does it have the legs for long-term growth ? Crypto investors recognize the potential of getting in early, yet the lack of major exchange listings and an unproven track record leaves JetBolt (JBOLT) in uncertain waters. While it’s an exciting investment, the risk is high. Can it sustain momentum, or will early enthusiasm fizzle? VeChain (VET): A Veteran In The Game VeChain (VET) has cemented itself in the blockchain world. Known for its real-world applications in supply chain logistics, it has secured partnerships with major corporations. Investors seeking investment stability might find comfort in VeChain’s (VET) long-term roadmap, but does it still hold high-return potential? With a larger market cap and a more established ecosystem, this crypto asset offers security but lacks the explosive growth of emerging altcoins. VeChain (VET) may not be the best pick for investors chasing rapid multipliers. Sei (SEI): Speed And Scalability, But Competition Looms Sei (SEI) enters the scene as a high-speed blockchain promising efficiency and low fees. Crypto investors seeking performance-driven altcoins have taken notice, drawn by its scalable infrastructure and developer-friendly ecosystem. However, competition is fierce. Established blockchains already dominate this space, leaving Sei (SEI) fighting for adoption. While its potential is undeniable, true growth depends on whether it can differentiate itself enough to attract investor attention. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The Hidden Gem Set For A Breakout Among JetBolt (JBOLT), VeChain (VET), and Sei (SEI), one altcoin stands above the rest. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is not just another blockchain project. It is a game-changing investment opportunity . What makes this project a must-buy? Investors are drawn to its groundbreaking cashback rewards , allowing users to earn up to 12% cash back on transactions, unlike JetBolt (JBOLT), VeChain (VET), and Sei (SEI) offer. But that’s just the beginning. Investors gain passive income streams by staking WallitIQ (WLTQ), earning rewards while holding onto a high-growth asset. The upcoming MVP build of its Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App further amplifies its appeal. The SolidProof-audited platform prioritizes transparency, providing crypto investors custom alerts to manage volatile market movements. And here’s where things get urgent: the beta platform is launching soon. Waiting isn’t an option for first-time investors looking for an entry point into crypto, and the chance to secure WallitIQ (WLTQ) under $1 won’t last. Why WallitIQ (WLTQ) Is The Best Pick For First-Time Investors While JetBolt (JBOLT), VeChain (VET), and Sei (SEI) hold potential, WallitIQ (WLTQ) stands out as the ultimate investment opportunity. WallitIQ (WLTQ) isn’t just another altcoin—it’s an AI-powered financial disruptor designed for long-term gains. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) price won’t stay this low for long when mainstream adoption kicks in. For investors, the choice is clear: seize this moment to invest or miss out on life-changing gains. The Time To Act Is Now Altcoins under $1 are the golden ticket to exponential gains, but not all opportunities are created equal. JetBolt (JBOLT) may ride early hype, but its long-term success is uncertain. VeChain (VET) is a solid choice but lacks the parabolic growth of emerging cryptos. SEI (SEI) offers speed, but it faces stiff competition. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is different. This AI-powered financial powerhouse combines real-world utility with next-gen investment advantages, making it the best choice for first-time investors. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is still under $1, but not for long. Once the beta platform launches, prices will never be this low again. Don’t wait. Invest now and claim your stake before the real surge begins.

According to the Bitcoin ETF issuer, this Solana move will make the fund more accessible, improve transaction efficiency, and strengthen its commitment to blockchain-based investment products. Why This Matters Over time, Franklin Templeton has been strengthening its presence in the crypto space. For example, the fund, which maintains a stable $1 share price similar to a stablecoin, was introduced on Ethereum in November 2024. New chain unlocked. BENJI is now live on @solana !

Consequently, by integrating with Solana, a blockchain known for its speed and low fees, the firm intends to provide investors with a more efficient and cost-effective way to trade digital assets. The Bigger Picture Similarly, tokenization is becoming a major trend in the financial sector. Many top asset managers, including BlackRock and Fidelity, have adopted blockchain-based investment products, pointing to benefits such as faster transactions, lower costs, and increased transparency. Furthermore, industry reports indicate that the total value of tokenized U.S. Treasuries has reached $3.6 billion, showing the growing demand for blockchain-powered finance. What’s Next for Franklin Templeton? In another event, Franklin Templeton filed for a Solana-based ETF in Delaware , signaling further expansion into the crypto market. If the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves the filing, it could open up new investment opportunities. Investors can now access FOBXX through the Benji Investments app, where a BENJI token represents each share. Meanwhile, Franklin Templeton’s move comes as several firms file similar applications following President Donald Trump’s inauguration, which brought changes to the SEC, including the resignation of former Chair Gary Gensler. Additionally, the firm projected a significant shift for Bitcoin in December, predicting its transition from a speculative asset to a functional reserve as its underlying technologies become more integrated into global financial systems.

Achieving an astonishing 6,430% ROI, Web3Bay is quickly becoming a standout in the blockchain sector, signaling a seismic shift in investor preferences towards platforms offering more than just currency transactions. This dramatic return on investment highlights Web3Bay’s potential to redefine decentralized e-commerce, attracting a wide array of stakeholders looking to capitalize on its innovative transaction methods and robust technological framework. Here’s a closer look at why Web3Bay’s presale is outshining even the strongest competitors and what it means for the future of the digital marketplace. Web3Bay Presale: A Gateway to Exceptional Returns Web3Bay is quickly becoming a focal point in the decentralized e-commerce sector. Its presale is structured to reward early participants, with a total of 28 stages, each introducing incremental price increases. Currently, in Stage 4, the platform has already raised more than $1.1 million, selling over 295 million 3BAY tokens at $0.004562625 each. With a projected listing price of $0.1959, the expected ROI for early investors stands at an impressive 6,430%. This structured growth model ensures that those who invest early see the highest potential gains. Beyond its financial incentives, Web3Bay is designed to solve a major issue in online commerce—high transaction fees and lack of user control. Traditional e-commerce platforms like Amazon and eBay charge hefty commission fees on every transaction, cutting into sellers’ profits and increasing costs for buyers. Web3Bay eliminates these middlemen by enabling direct peer-to-peer transactions through blockchain technology. By reducing costs and enhancing transparency, it provides a fairer alternative to existing centralized marketplaces. A standout feature of Web3Bay is its governance model. Unlike centralized platforms, where corporate executives make all decisions, Web3Bay operates on a decentralized governance system where token holders have voting power. Users can propose and vote on platform policies, transaction fees, and new features, making it a truly user-driven marketplace. Additionally, Web3Bay supports multiple payment options, including stablecoins, making it easier for both crypto and non-crypto users to participate. Stablecoin integration ensures that buyers and sellers can transact without worrying about crypto price volatility, which has been a major barrier to widespread adoption. This hybrid payment system, combined with Web3Bay’s decentralized model, positions it as one of the most promising crypto projects to watch in 2025. VeChain: Enhancing Transparency and Security Amid Market Volatility VeChain (VET) has established itself as a leading blockchain platform focused on supply chain management and logistics. By leveraging blockchain technology, VeChain enhances product authentication, prevents fraud, and ensures transparency across industries like retail, healthcare, and luxury goods. As of the latest data, VET is trading at approximately $0.03285, with a 24-hour trading volume of $45,623,938. This represents a 0.55% price increase in the last 24 hours. Despite its innovative solutions, VeChain has faced market volatility, with its current price significantly lower than its all-time high of $0.28. However, strategic partnerships with major corporations like Walmart China and BMW continue to strengthen its credibility in the enterprise sector. As adoption of VeChain’s technology grows, long-term investors remain optimistic about its potential for price appreciation. Kaspa: Rapid Transactions Kaspa (KAS) is recognized for its ultra-fast transaction speeds and innovative proof-of-work consensus mechanism. Unlike traditional blockchains, Kaspa operates on a blockDAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) structure, allowing multiple blocks to be mined simultaneously. This approach improves network efficiency and scalability while maintaining high security standards. The current price of KAS is approximately $0.08735, with a 24-hour trading volume of $44,025,482. This reflects a 0.93% price increase in the last 24 hours. Over the past week, Kaspa has experienced a price decline of approximately 26.70%, indicating market volatility. However, continued network developments, increased adoption, and potential integrations with DeFi platforms could contribute to future price recoveries. With its emphasis on speed and security, Kaspa aims to address key challenges facing traditional blockchain networks. The Last Line: As Web3Bay’s presale progresses, offering a potential 6,430% ROI, it stands out as a compelling opportunity for investors seeking exposure to decentralized e-commerce innovations. VeChain’s real-world use cases in supply chain logistics and Kaspa’s scalable blockchain technology make them valuable assets for different segments of the market. With increasing adoption and development, all three projects present investment opportunities that cater to different objectives.

One project that has caught their attention is RCO Finance, an AI-powered investment ecosystem that eases participation in the financial sector. Read on to see why these investors believe RCO Finance could become the best crypto coin of 2025. Dogecoin and XRP Tops List of Biggest Losers in February Dogecoin and XRP dominated investor wishlists for the past three months as both tokens surged to 2-year highs in Q4 2024. Many investors expected this rally to continue, increasing their Dogecoin and XRP holdings. Unfortunately, things went very differently as both tokens slipped to a double-digit drop in early February. For Dogecoin, its value has fallen by 12.35% in the first week of February. XRP has also fallen by 14% in the same time, now trading at $2.45. With fears that bearish sentiment around Dogecoin and XRP will remain until the end of Q1 2025, investors are shifting their focus to alternative projects like RCO Finance, a new altcoin project that leverages AI and machine learning to streamline investments. RCO Finance: Creating AI-backed Tools for the Future of the Financial Sector RCO Finance (RCOF) is a platform that offers an innovative path to smarter, more responsive asset management, one that is accessible to amateur and seasoned investors. Central to the RCO Finance platform is the Robo Advisor—a cutting-edge system that continuously monitors market trends using real-time data from reputable sources like Bloomberg and Reuters. This AI-powered trading bot acts as your personal Wall Street broker, watching for market shifts that bring profit opportunities. When doing so, Robo Advisor takes into consideration your risk tolerance, investing goals, and market preference, crafting investment strategies tailored to your portfolio. This trading bot is particularly useful for new investors who don’t know how to get started in the financial landscape. For instance, picture Mr Carlos, a computer developer who wants to get started investing in the crypto sector. Instead of spending hours trying to read complex charts, they can rely on investment suggestions from Robo Advisor. RCO Finance’s trading bot can also rebalance your portfolio automatically, helping you to stay in the green zone while reducing losses from sudden market shifts. After leveraging artificial intelligence for streamlined investing, Robo Advisor lets investors trade access to a wide range of assets while enjoying up to a 1000x leverage. The platform allows you to trade over 120,000 assets including equities, stocks, bonds, ETFs, and tokenized real estate, allowing you to move from risky assets to more stable options all from the convenience of one trading bot. Picture an unexpected economic policy shift that rattles global markets, for instance, the early February 2025 market crash that was triggered by talks of a trade war between America and Canada. In such a scenario, Robo Advisor will quickly recalculate your risk exposure, diverting funds from volatile cryptocurrencies to more stable investments like high-grade corporate bonds. Whether you’re just beginning or are an experienced trader, this tool ensures your portfolio remains agile and well-protected. For traders looking to maximize short-term gains, RCO Finance offers leverage trading up to 1000x, amplifying both profit potential and risk. With this leverage, an investor with $200 can open a trading position of $200,000. Aside from high-leverage trading and access to diverse markets, RCO Finance offers yield-earning mechanisms that reward commitment to its ecosystem. Its staking program, offering up to 86% APY, provides an exceptional avenue for earning passive income. By locking up tokens in its staking program, investors help provide liquidity for trading pools. Additionally, investors can earn extra tokens just for keeping RCOF tokens in their wallets. The higher your token balance, the higher your trading fee discounts. RCO Finance users also enjoy a high level of security and privacy thanks to the absence of KYC policies. To further boost investor safety, RCO Finance uses smart contracts that have been rigorously audited by SolidProof, creating a secure environment where your financial data and assets are well-protected. RCO Finance Excites Investment Community with its Beta Launch The beta version of RCO Finance is now live, giving over 10,000 new users a chance to test out the Robo Advisor and witness firsthand the power of its Robo Advisor trading bot. In the meantime, Robo Advisor and the trading bot will keep undergoing tests and upgrades ahead of its forthcoming alpha release. Best Crypto Coin for 2025: RCO Finance Vs. Dogecoin Given its AI-driven trading solutions and high-yield staking options, RCO Finance has been compared to traditional crypto investments like Dogecoin. Additionally, RCO Finance’ ongoing ICO is offering the opportunity to join a rapidly expanding community with over 10,000 members and more than $12 million raised in the presale. RCOF tokens are now in stage 5 of their presale, trading at $0.100. With its expected increase to $0.130 by stage 6 and a future listing in the $0.4–$0.6 range, analysts say now might be the best time to join its ecosystem. Projections indicate that RCOF could achieve a 10,000x increase, meaning a $1,000 investment might grow to $150,000 by December. Don’t miss out on securing your place in this pioneering venture.

I'm Ben Schiller, CoinDesk’s Opinion and Features editor. In this issue: Can Based Rollups solve Ethereum’s problem? Lido goes modular Uniswap finally unveils Unichain Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade is coming Network news BASED ROLLUPS TO THE RESCUE: In recent years, Ethereum has embraced a layer-2 scaling roadmap—a plan that encouraged the development of third-party auxiliary networks called ""layer-2 rollups""—to help scale the base Ethereum ecosystem. Offloading activity to these upstart networks has helped bring down fees and improve speeds for end-users, but it has led to a massive, deeply fragmented ecosystem of layer 2s. But while layer-2 networks all post data back down to Ethereum, they often struggle to communicate directly with one another, meaning passing assets and data between them can become expensive and cumbersome. There's also the risk of centralized sequencers: reliance on company-controlled black boxes to pass transaction data between blockchain layers. As a result, some Ethereum developers are pushing rollup tech that takes a new approach to security and interoperability: “based rollups."" Based rollups differ from most existing rollups because they shift execution duties—such as processing transactions—back to Ethereum's layer-1 rather than handling them on a separate layer-2 network. When someone transacts on a layer-2 rollup, their transaction is processed through a component called a “sequencer.” The sequencer batches multiple transactions and submits them to Ethereum for settlement. While sequencers provide efficiency and generate revenue for rollup operators by strategically ordering transactions, they also introduce a single point of failure. Based rollups avoid this vulnerability by using Ethereum’s built-in sequencing—its massive community of validators—rather than a single centralized sequencer. Rollups like Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, zkSync, and Blast have quickly grown to support larger transaction volumes than Ethereum itself. According to L2Beat , there are currently 140 live layer-2 networks, but the experience of operating between them—passing assets and other data between networks—has become clunky. As Ethereum becomes bigger and layer-2 networks become more integral to its functioning, improving communication between layer-2s—in other words, improving ""composability""—has become more important than ever. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. LIDO GOES MODULAR: The developers behind Lido, the largest staking service on Ethereum, have proposed revamping the staking platform with modular ""vaults."" The new framework would introduce stVaults, a customizable component designed to help Lido accommodate institutions and more complex staking strategies. Lido currently allows investors to pool their ether (ETH) together and ""stake"" their crypto — locking up their tokens with the network, helping to secure it in exchange for interest. Lido pioneered liquid staking: users get a receipt on their deposits called Lido staked ETH (stETH) that they can trade at any time. With liquid staking on Lido, entering and exiting staking positions became as simple as buying and selling stETH tokens. Lido V3's stVaults are “modular smart contracts designed to meet the diverse and evolving needs of Ethereum participants,” according to a press release shared with CoinDesk. The upgrade would enable staking setups beyond cut-and-dry liquid staking. Specifically, stVaults will be able to help institutional stakers who want to personalize their staking setups, node operators who want to attract high-volume stakers, and asset managers who want to create new staking use cases. “What is important to understand with customizable infrastructure, is that you can in general build even more complex products,” said Konstantin Lomashuk, the founder of the Lido staking protocol. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. UNICHAIN FINALLY: Uniswap Labs, the primary developer behind one of the largest decentralized exchanges (DEX), Uniswap, shared Feb 13 that its long-awaited layer-2 network, Unichain, is now live. Powered by Optimism's OP stack, Unichain—like other layer-2s on Ethereum—offers faster and cheaper transactions compared to Ethereum's mainnet. Developers can deploy apps onto the network, which has been optimized specifically for decentralized finance (DeFi) and aims to serve as ""the home for liquidity across chains,"" according to Uniswap Labs. For Uniswap Labs, the benefit of launching a layer-2 is twofold: it will provide a better experience for users of Uniswap and similar platforms, and it will create a new revenue opportunity in the form of network fees. A representative for Uniswap Labs told CoinDesk that ""around 20%"" of the chain's revenue will go directly to the company. Unichain has been in testing since October 2024 and is classified by Uniswap Labs as a ""stage-1"" rollup, meaning it has elements of decentralization but retains some centrally-controlled safeguards at this early phase. The network is built on the OP Stack, a modular framework that lets developers build interoperable layer-2 chains based on Optimism’s optimistic rollup technology . Several well-known teams have come out with their own OP Stack-based layer-2’s, including Coinbase's ‘ Base ’, Kraken’s ‘ Ink ,’ World’s ‘ World chain ,’ and Sony’s ‘ Soneium .’ “We are anticipating a world of many, many different use cases, of which trading is a small subset,” Adams told CoinDesk in an interview. In collaboration with Ethereum research and development firm Flashbots, the Uniswap team said it has created a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) on Unichain, a secure area for more sensitive transactions and is meant to optimize the chain for DeFi by allowing for more advanced trades and faster transaction finality. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. PECTRA IN APRIL: Ethereum developers have officially set test dates for Pectra, the network's first upgrade in 11 months, putting it on track for a potential April release date. Pectra will contain an array of improvements — with a special focus on wallets and validators — but it comes at a period of heightened scrutiny for Ethereum, which has recently faced pressure from its community to refocus and catch up with competitors. Ethereum's core builders decided on Thursday during their bi-weekly ""All Core Developers"" call to begin testing Pectra on Feb. 26 on the Holesky testnet, with a follow-up test on the network's Sepolia testnet slated for Mar. 5. Should those tests succeed, the developers will reconvene on Mar. 6 to determine when to launch the upgrade officially. According to Tim Beiko, the protocol support lead at the Ethereum Foundation, developers expect the upgrade to hit mainnet in early April. Pectra — a portmanteau representing two separate upgrades, Prague and Electra — includes eight major improvements to the second-largest blockchain. Among the most-anticipated is EIP-7702, which is supposed to improve the user experience of crypto wallets. The Ethereum community has been facing an identity crisis over the last few weeks. Its native token, ether (ETH), is underperforming against other cryptocurrencies, and competitor networks like Solana have drawn attention and talent from the Ethereum ecosystem — the first-ever programmable blockchain and still the most trafficked. Amid the controversy — much of it directed at the Etheruem Foundation, which coordinates chain upgrades and is currently undergoing a major leadership shuffle — developers are hoping that Pectra will help put the network on steadier footing. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more.

Since early December, ADA has seen its price plummet by over 61%, with bears dominating the trend and bulls unable to reclaim momentum. Despite the challenging environment, Cardano has shown signs of recovery, experiencing a 15% breakout yesterday that has pushed the price to a critical level. Related Reading: Litecoin Approaches Daily Range Peak – Can LTC Break Multi-Year Highs? This breakout offers a glimmer of hope for investors, but ADA must hold its current level to confirm the possibility of a continuation. The market remains uncertain, and the coming days will be crucial in determining whether Cardano can sustain its recent gains. If momentum persists, analysts believe ADA could rally further, providing some much-needed optimism for holders. Top crypto analyst Ali Martinez weighed in on the situation, sharing a technical analysis that suggests Cardano is breaking out and has the potential for a move toward $0.83. Martinez emphasized that the next key challenge will be maintaining this momentum, as it could signal a reversal in the broader downtrend. For now, investors remain cautiously optimistic, watching closely to see if Cardano can sustain its upward trajectory. Cardano Could Start A Recovery Phase Cardano could be on the verge of a recovery rally as it finds strong demand at its current levels, with bears unable to push the price into lower demand zones. After months of sustained selling pressure, Cardano appears to be showing signs of strength. However, the path to recovery is not straightforward. Bulls must reclaim and hold key levels above the $0.85 mark to confirm the start of a sustained uptrend. Adding to the optimism, top analyst Ali Martinez shared a technical analysis on X that highlights a potential breakout for Cardano. According to Martinez, if current momentum holds, Cardano could make a move toward $0.83 in the coming days. This breakout represents an important opportunity for ADA to shift market sentiment and regain investor confidence. Despite the encouraging signs, the broader market remains shaky, with analysts calling for potential retracements as BTC and altcoins struggle to find direction. The entire crypto space seems to be battling uncertainty, which has weighed heavily on sentiment. However, there is hope that Bitcoin and altcoins, including Cardano, will begin a new recovery rally in the coming days.

The next few days will be critical in determining whether this recovery can gain traction or if further consolidation is needed before the next leg up. Investors are cautiously optimistic, waiting for Cardano to confirm its upward momentum and break free from its recent downtrend. Price Testing Crucial Supply Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.78 after an impressive 15% surge yesterday, signaling a potential shift in momentum. Despite this rally, ADA has faced resistance at the $0.85 level, unable to break through and reclaim critical liquidity levels above the $0.80 mark. The inability to push past this zone has raised questions about whether the recovery rally can sustain its momentum in the coming days. However, there is a silver lining for ADA bulls. The price has managed to climb above the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), which sits around $0.72. This is a crucial technical indicator that signals long-term strength and provides optimism for a potential continuation of the upward trend. Holding above the 200-day EMA could create a foundation for bulls to regain control and challenge higher levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Multi-Year Bullish Pattern – Expert Suggests The Next Move Will Be ‘The Real Deal’ The next key challenge for ADA is to hold above the current levels and build the momentum necessary to retest the $0.85 resistance. A breakout above this zone would confirm a short-term bullish trend and open the door for further gains. However, failure to hold above the 200-day EMA could invite renewed selling pressure, pushing the price back toward lower support zones. For now, ADA remains in a delicate position, with the next few days likely to define its short-term direction.

The fraudulent project, called $BARRON, quickly surged in market value before crashing within seconds. World Liberty Financial Co Founder X Account Hacked World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance project linked to the Trump family, has confirmed that its co founder Zach Witkoff X account has been breached and urged users to ignore the fraudulent posts. On Wednesday, Witkoff’s compromised X account was used to promote $BARRON, a Solana-based memecoin falsely linked to President Donald Trump’s youngest son, Barron Trump. The hacker claimed that Trump would soon confirm the token’s legitimacy. However, according to World Liberty Financial, “Zach Witkoff’s account was compromised. Please do not engage with any posts promoting this project,” the company posted on X. The coin briefly reached a market capitalization of $73 million in under ten minutes before suddenly plummeting by 99%. This rapid rise and collapse indicated a “rug pull,” a scam where creators artificially inflate a token’s value before dumping it for profit. Previous Trump-Themed Memecoin Scams World Liberty Financial, which is launching a macro strategy reserve for crypto , was founded in 2024 and launched its own cryptocurrency, WLFI, in October of the same year. Several members of the Trump family, including Barron Trump, are listed as part of the project’s team. The $BARRON incident follows a similar scam in January involving a memecoin named after Ivanka Trump. The former president’s daughter publicly distanced herself from the project and warned investors against fraudulent schemes using her likeness. Memecoins featuring the Trump family have gained traction since Donald Trump announced his own cryptocurrency, Official Trump, on Solana in January. Days later, Melania Trump launched Melania Meme, also on the Solana blockchain. Memecoin Scams and Growing Concerns The rise of celebrity-themed memecoins has raised concerns about misleading promotions and scams in the cryptocurrency market. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) commented on the growing trend, questioning how investors determine the legitimacy of such tokens. “How does this work? I share my dog’s name and picture, and then people create memecoins?” Zhao wrote on X. “How do you know which one is ‘official’? Or does that even matter?” According to experts, memecoins have gained popularity due to their viral nature and speculative appeal, but they also pose risks to investors. Many projects lack transparency, and sudden sell-offs, commonly known as “rug pulls,” can lead to significant financial losses. Despite these concerns, the US SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, in a February 11 interview, stated that most memecoins do not fall under the SEC’s current regulatory framework. “Many of the memecoins that are out there probably do not have a home in the SEC under our current set of regulations,” Peirce said.

For a coin that traded as low as $2,551.17 in the past 24 hours, it is now changing hands for $2,794.86, up 4.73% at the time of writing. The 21Shares Push for Ethereum ETF Staking The 19b-4 filing was filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Cboe BZX Exchange. Cboe argued to allow changes to the ETH ETP Amendment No 2 that will permit the staking. This filing makes 21Shares the first issuer to make a move for this product. “Based on discussions with the Sponsor, the Exchanges proposes to amend several portions of the Eth ETP Amendment No. 2, as amended, in order to allow the staking of the Ethereum held by the Trust,” Cboe noted in the filing Primarily, 21Shares wants to enhance the income accruable to the Ethereum it holds on behalf of its clients in the ETF. It said it would not stake the Ether with any of its affiliates but those of its custodians’. Despite the plans for the staking, the filing noted that it would keep sufficient liquidity to satisfy any redemptions. The impact of this offering on Ethereum price appears to be priced in by the market at the moment. Ethereum Price Selloff Fades With the current shift in the price of ETH, speculations of further breakout are now making the rounds in the market. Thus far in this bull cycle, Ethereum’s price has not moved above the $4,000 resistance level. With market bears swooping in recently, it even turned the $3,000 mark as a formidable resistance. This 21Shares update has helped break its bearish dormancy, aligning with an earlier ETH price analysis that signals a potential $10,000 play. While it remains unknown whether Ethereum will pare off the 13.06% 30-day loss recorded thus far, current sentiment points in that direction. Generally, the ETH/BTC ratio flipped to its lowest level, a trend that analysts hint might also contribute to its potential rebound moving forward. ETH Price and Coming Tailwinds The launch of Ethereum ETF by top asset managers has not significantly fueled a boost in price. At the time, the US SEC opposed staking on ETF, an offering that could have made more difference for the coin. However, under President Donald Trump, chances are that the improved regulations will see the SEC approve this proposal. While this marks a major tailwind for ETH, the coming Pectra upgrade might also serve as a complement for adoption and price in general.
