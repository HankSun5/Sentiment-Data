Technical indicators suggest that SHIB could embark on a massive rally once this breakout occurs, as analysis predicts a price surge of over 250% in the coming months. Shiba Inu Price Gears Up For 250% Rally Shiba Inu (SHIB), the second-largest meme cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is showing signs of a potential breakout to the upside. A crypto analyst identified as Rose Premium Signals on X (formerly Twitter) highlighted that SHIB is currently retesting the perfect accumulation zone, representing a crucial support level that historically acts as a launchpad for a price rally. The analyst predicts that Shiba Inu is set for a 250% price surge to new highs. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Gearing Up To Fly After Lows, Here’s The Target After experiencing months of decline and volatility, the price formed a unique technical pattern called a Falling Wedge. This pattern is a classic bullish reversal signal that forms when there is a downward trend in a cryptocurrency’s price action. Considering that Shiba Inu has recorded multiple price crashes to new lows, the emergence of this pattern breathes optimism into the meme coin’s future outlook. Rose Premium Signals has shared a price chart, providing a clearer view of this technical pattern. The chart shows that SHIB is nearing the apex of its Falling Wedge pattern and is on the verge of a breakout. A successful breakout from this bullish pattern could trigger a sharp upward movement, propelling the Shiba Inu price by 250% towards key resistance levels at $0.00002913, $0.00003612, and ultimately $0.00004401. This final price target represents a staggering 251% increase from Shiba Inu’s current market value. The analyst has set a timeline for his optimistic prediction, forecasting that Shiba Inu will hit a price peak of $0.00004401 in the next 77 days, around April 29, 2025. On a side note, Rose Premium Signals expects a breakdown in the Shiba Inu price before this projected rally. The analyst predicts that Shiba Inu could decline and hit a final price low of $0.00001299 before it embarks on its surge to $0.00004401. This price crash is expected to occur around March 2025. If this bearish projection holds, it may present a prime buying opportunity for investors aiming to capitalize on the analyst’s 250% SHIB price rally forecast. TD Sequential Flashes Buy Signal For SHIB According to data from CoinMarketCap, the SHIB price is currently trading at $0.000015, recording declines of over 3.9% in the last 24 hours and 23.8% over the past month. While the meme coin still faces bearish pressure, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has revealed that Shiba Inu’s TD Sequential indicator has flashed a buy signal on the weekly chart.

A regulated fund tied to Dogecoin could bring unprecedented inflows, pushing the meme coin toward mainstream adoption. Yet, as the market braces for this possibility, an unexpected beneficiary has emerged: RCO Finance. Analysts suggest that RCO Finance might witness a massive 44,000% surge if a Dogecoin ETF is approved. Can a coin, once dismissed as a mere internet joke become the catalyst for another DeFi breakthrough? The Rising Promise of a Dogecoin ETF An exchange-traded fund pegged to Dogecoin could dramatically reshape perceptions about this once-whimsical asset. Dogecoin soared on viral social media buzz in previous cycles, attracting celebrity endorsements and millions of new investors. But a Dogecoin ETF would mark a significant step up, giving more conservative investors an avenue to own Dogecoin through regulated channels without wrestling with private wallets or unregulated exchanges. Critics question whether a Dogecoin ETF can tame the meme-based volatility that defines this coin. Nonetheless, market history shows that ETFs often serve as gateways for mainstream capital. Even skeptics acknowledge that approval could funnel billions in fresh liquidity into Dogecoin, creating a tide that lifts other innovative platforms. If the hype surrounding a Dogecoin ETF matches early bitcoin ETF mania, the ripple effects could be enormous, impacting a broad swath of crypto assets, including those like RCO Finance offering more than just speculative value. Dogecoin’s Continued Magnetism Although Dogecoin started as a joke, it matured into a digital asset with a market cap in the billions of dollars. It briefly traded at $0.74 at its peak, turning many early holders into overnight millionaires. Even when the hype simmered, Dogecoin remained a staple of crypto discussions, thanks to its loyal community and frequent cameos in mainstream media. The possibility of a Dogecoin ETF amplifies the coin’s attraction. Investors who missed out on the original rally might jump in, hoping to see Dogecoin replicate its meteoric run. Others who once viewed it as a meme might consider if they can invest via traditional brokerage accounts. This influx of attention could revitalize Dogecoin’s price movement—and, by extension, create fertile ground for DeFi projects aligned with market expansion. Yet, Dogecoin is not alone in seizing this moment. As the spotlight intensifies, many traders scout for platforms bridging the gap between crypto speculation and real-world utility. This is where RCO Finance stands ready to captivate a wider audience, especially those who demand more comprehensive functionality than what meme coins typically deliver. RCO Finance: Bridging Assets and AI-Driven Insights With its token priced at $0.1 and over $13 million raised, RCO Finance has rapidly positioned itself as a next-generation DeFi hub. As a non-KYC platform, it lets users buy stocks, bonds, real estate, and cryptocurrencies under one roof, bypassing the hassle of converting to fiat. This practical approach to asset diversification sets RCO Finance apart from projects reliant solely on speculative momentum. Central to RCO Finance is the Robo Advisor, an AI-powered tool that aggregates signals from Bloomberg, Reuters, and on-chain analytics. Beyond spotting breakout tokens, it helps mitigate risk by indicating optimal times to take profits or reduce exposure. Imagine detecting a lesser-known coin like TRUMP, which soared by 646%—the Robo Advisor could have flagged such an opportunity well before social media chatter kicked in. Moreover, the Beta Platform allows hands-on experience with advanced features, including high-leverage trading and automated staking. Credibility is further strengthened by a SolidProof audit confirming robust smart contracts. RCO Finance offers a more grounded alternative to meme-driven runs by combining transparency, AI insights, and cross-asset transactions. Should a Dogecoin ETF pour new life into the broader crypto market, this utility-focused approach may attract an influx of capital seeking sustainable gains. 44,000% Surge: Why RCO Finance Could Ride the Dogecoin ETF Wave Historically, altcoins that delivered four- or five-digit returns found success by addressing untapped market needs. RCO Finance’s blend of AI technology, non-KYC onboarding, and multi-asset integration speaks to a maturing audience. As capital moves beyond meme coins in search of stable yet potent growth, the platform’s data-driven ecosystem could become a magnet for both institutional and retail players. Of course, even the best forecasts are not guaranteed, and crypto remains a high-risk space. Nonetheless, the synergy of a Dogecoin ETF rally and a platform like RCO Finance suggests the potential for an explosive 2025. If memes have taught us anything, timing and sentiment can spark a wildfire of investment—but projects offering tangible solutions often sustain that momentum, transforming initial hype into lasting relevance.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, the development team behind Ondo Finance says it’s collaborating with World Liberty Financial (WLFI) as a means of bringing traditional finance to the world of blockchains. According to Ondo, WLFI is adding Ondo’s tokenized assets – such as the stablecoin Ondo US Dollar Yield ( USDY ) and the Ondo Short-Term US Treasuries Fund ( OUSG ) – into its network as treasury reserve assets. Furthermore, WLFI is planning on integrating USDY, OUSG and other tokenized securities from Ondo’s upcoming global markets into its network as a means of enabling seamless borrowing, lending, and margin trading for eligible customers. “Through this collaboration, World Liberty Financial plans to become a strategic collaborator in Ondo’s journey to scale Ondo Global Markets, a platform designed to enable the tokenization of traditional financial assets like stocks and bonds.” As stated by Donald Trump Jr., the “Web3 Ambassador” at WLFI, “Our collaboration with Ondo Finance marks a significant step forward in aligning traditional financial systems with blockchain innovation. By integrating Ondo’s tokenized assets, we’re providing our network with access to traditional financial assets and new yield opportunities.” Current data from blockchain intelligence firm Arkham shows that WLFI currently holds about $465,000 worth of ONDO. ONDO is trading for $1.37 at time of writing, a 1.6% increase during the last 24 hours.

See what he actually said,https://crypto.news/saylor-is-going-to-burn-his-private-keys-as-he-dies/,"On Feb. 9, 2025, Cointelegraph published a clip of a January interview with Strategy chair Michael Saylor on Fox. According to the caption, in the video, Saylor hints he is going to burn his BTC keys as he dies to ensure the coins will never be sold. Let’s see what Saylor said, is there a hint, and what is the purpose of burning the keys. Several media channels reposted the clip from Cointelegraph, with various headlines, from which one could conclude the Strategy exec is indeed going to pull his stashes into the grave as he dies. However, that’s not what he said in the clip. 🚨 FOX BUSINESS: Michael Saylor hints that after his death, his Bitcoin keys will be destroyed, ensuring his BTC is never sold—calling it a “pro rata contribution” to all Bitcoin holders. pic.twitter.com/RhGgfIuvlq — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) February 9, 2025 In the video, Saylor says that it would be good for someone who has a lot of bitcoins to burn the keys to make a “pro rata contribution” to all the BTC holders across the world “based on their contribution and their knowledge of Bitcoin.” The idea is simple – due to the deflationary nature of Bitcoin, as a large amount of BTC leaves the circulation forever, the remaining bitcoins get more valuable. It means that the rest of the BTC holders may get richer as a result of the move. In this regard, Saylor’s idea is similar to Donald Trump’s urge not to sell bitcoins and accumulate them strategically. Various proposals for Bitcoin reserves have a clause forbidding the sale of BTC for years in order to ensure market stability and consistent demand. Although Saylor is definitely a person who accumulated much BTC, the way he put his idea doesn’t oblige him to follow the script he described. He didn’t add a single word that could be seen as a hint that he himself is going to lock his bitcoins forever. Rather, he shared the idea with others. And yes, there is a chance that Saylor is considering doing something like this. However, Saylor can come up with another decision in the future. He concluded that he sees himself as a person who took Satoshi’s torch and continues to commercialize Bitcoin with corporations and governments. How good is this idea? At least, the idea correlates with the vision of Satoshi Nakamoto, who created Bitcoin scarcity on purpose. When Saylor speaks about how great Bitcoin is, he often emphasizes its scarcity as the prime driver of its price. During the PBD Podcast episode in 2024, he said that he could create more real estate in New York City, create more watches, create more gold (sic!), and any kind of commodity if he had enough time and money. But Bitcoin has an absolute cap which is 21 million, said Saylor. As the commodity price goes up, the producers are incentivized to produce more, which is not the case with Bitcoin. That’s why Bitcoin is a great store of value, according to Saylor. He claims that the American dollar will be de facto-backed by Bitcoin as soon as the government starts to invest in it. In Saylor’s opinion, this will make the dollar more powerful, not less, as some experts warn. The reason is the same–as long as the country owns a huge chunk of the world’s BTC, its national currency will be strong. Nevertheless, it’s worth noting that scarcity drives the value of Bitcoin as long as demand for BTC stays strong. Let’s say someone draws a self-portrait, creating an extremely scarce item. Will it be extremely valuable? Not necessarily. Bitcoin is driven by demand. The growing scarcity of the asset boosts the demand further, increasing the urge of multiple entities (including corporations and governments) to acquire some. Let’s say someone with 450,000 BTC (an approximate amount in Saylor’s control as of January 2025) dies before the 2028 Bitcoin halving. In the 2024–2028 cycle, 450 BTC is produced every day. So, removing 450k bitcoins from circulation in one day eliminates the result of almost three years of mining between 2024 and 2028 or nearly everything that will be mined between 2028 and 2033. Some even compare this probable case to halving. However, unlike halving, a whale burning the keys is a different case. First off, unlike halving, it decreases the amount in circulation and second, it doesn’t involve miners having to raise BTC prices to keep mining profitability. However, the BTC buyers will have to compete for much fewer remaining bitcoins, which is a good climate for price growth. Generally, it seems that Saylor is right about the possible effect of such a move. However, there are some factors that may play his “plan” around. The future of lost bitcoins As of February 2025, over three million of the 20 million bitcoins that are already mined are considered “lost” due to forgotten or lost keys, coins sent to wrong addresses, and other reasons. According to other estimations, there are over 6 million lost bitcoins out there. You might also like: Nearly one-third of Bitcoin’s circulating supply possibly lost: report Although so many lost coins make Bitcoin even scarcer, the fate of these coins is not that conclusive. The very concept of a 21 million hard cap is not something unchangeable. The same mechanism that is used to improve the Bitcoin network can change the total supply of bitcoins or remove it altogether. This possibly was mentioned in an educational video on Bitcoin released by BlackRock, a company that has the largest amount of BTC. This unorthodox fact was met with anger and disapproval from the community, however, it doesn’t change the very fact that the hard cap can be changed if enough miners see this idea favorably, for any reason. If the hard cap goes away or the total supply increases, the value of lost bitcoins may drop and Saylor’s vision turns out to be false. Another concern is quantum computers. Quantum computers are one of the concerning technologies that are expected to drastically change the game as soon as they enter the scope. Quantum computers will be able to recover all lost coins, including Satoshi's if he's no longer living. Saylor better come up with a better plan than burying his keys with him. — LiveLifeWellNC (@30flygirl1) February 9, 2025 Their computational abilities may be strong enough to break BTC wallets. The Bitcoin community is preparing to prevent this but the outcome is not known as of now. There is a possibility that “lost” bitcoins will be freed or stolen via quantum computers.

Wainwright & Co. analyst Mike Colonnese Crypto exchange Coinbase is expected to report Q4 revenue of $1.911 billion in the first quarter, Colonnese said in a research note. This would imply upside potential compared to the Street’s consensus estimate of $1.8 billion. Coinbase is also expected to earn $2.21 per share in the quarter which is also ahead of the Street’s $2.16 per share estimate. ‘Strong tailwinds’ Colonnese noted that “strong tailwinds” in the fourth quarter contributed to better than expected results. Bitcoin ( BTC ) crossed $90,000 for the first time in history after Donald Trump’s election victory “proved to be a shot in the arm for the crypto industry,” the analyst wrote. BTC rallied hard and hit a new all-time high of $106,000 in mid-December, highlighting strong investor demand. Ethereum ( ETH ) also posted strong gains during the 4th quarter, rising 28% q/q to $3,330.

Coinbase to benefit from ongoing momentum According to the analyst, Coinbase is positioned to benefit from ongoing momentum.

Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said about the filing, “assuming this is acknowledged by the SEC (I'd probably make that assumption right now but you never know),” an SEC decision would be required by the end of October.

The video features an AI-generated version of the 40-year-old Hollywood actress alongside over a dozen other popular Jewish A-listers appearing to oppose rapper Kanye West’s recent antisemitic outburst on X. Scarlett Johansson denounces AI misuse Johansson is shown wearing a white T-shirt with an image of a hand flipping its middle finger. West, now Ye, went on a rant against Jews last weekend and even started selling Swastika T-shirts on his website. “It has been brought to my attention by family members and friends that an AI-generated video featuring my likeness…has been circulating online and gaining traction,” Johansson told People on Wednesday. “I am a Jewish woman who has no tolerance for antisemitism or hate speech of any kind. But I also firmly believe that the potential for hate speech multiplied by AI is a far greater threat than any one person who takes accountability for it. We must call out the misuse of AI, no matter its messaging, or we risk losing a hold on reality.” The video clip – reportedly created by Israeli generative AI expert Ori Bejerano, also features 20 AI versions of stars including Adam Sandler, Mila Kunis, Drake, Jerry Seinfeld, Steven Spielberg, Mark Zuckerberg, Sacha Baron Cohen, Jack Black, Lenny Kravitz, Ben Stiller, and David Schwimmer. In the video, the stars are wearing white T-shirts with the middle finger flipped off and a Star of David in the middle of the hand with Kanye’s name below it. In the end, the video declares that “Enough is Enough” and urges viewers to “Join the Fight Against Antisemitism”. In her statement, Johansson lamented how she has been “a very public victim of artificial intelligence”. But she also warned that the “threat of AI affects each and every one of us.” “There is a 1000-foot wave coming regarding AI that several progressive countries, not including the United States, have responded to in a responsible manner,” she detailed. “I urge the US government to make the passing of legislation limiting AI use a top priority; it is a bipartisan issue that enormously affects the immediate future of humanity at large.” Johansson. Johansson also said it was worrisome to note that the US government is “paralyzed when it comes to passing legislation that protects all of its citizens against the imminent dangers of AI.” The star has been caught up in AI controversy before This is not the first time that the “Fly Me to the Moon” star has had to deal with AI stealing her likeness. In May 2024, she criticized OpenAI after it emerged that the ChatGPT voice, Sky, resembled Johansson’s. OpenAI said Sky’s voice was “not an imitation of Johansson” but went on to suspend the voice anyway. And in November 2023, Johansson threatened to sue a company that used her likeness to create an advert. “The video included images produced by Lisa AI. It has nothing to do with this person,” the company denied the allegations. While Johansson is the only star in the fake video to speak against the Kanye West sentiments, other stars have previously aired their concerns. For instance, over the weekend before his Super Bowl ad aired, “Friends” actor David Schwimmer begged Elon Musk to block Kanye from X. “We can’t stop a deranged bigot from spewing hate-filled, ignorant bile… but we CAN stop giving him a megaphone, Mr. Musk,” Schwimmer wrote on Instagram . “Kanye West has 32.7 million followers on your platform, X. That’s twice as many people than the number of Jews in existence. His sick hate speech results in REAL LIFE violence against Jews,” added Schwimmer. According to CNN , Kanye West deactivated his X account on Sunday. An organization that works to combat Jewish hate and misinformation across social media Tel Aviv Institute co-founder Hen Mazzig commented on the AI video. “Misusing AI is dangerous, no doubt,” Mazzig wrote on X . “But you know what’s even more dangerous? Unchecked antisemitic hate being platformed to millions every single day.” Cryptopolitan Academy: FREE Web3 Resume Cheat Sheet - Download Now",AI,EN,0,0,REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-12 23:29:37

With these low costs, Adobe aims to compete with other AI startups like OpenAI and integrate artificial intelligence into its creative software package. Generate Video is available in public beta, following a limited early access testing period last year. The beta tool can be accessed via the redesigned Firefly web app, alongside new image generation and translation capabilities and AI credit subscription tiers for creators. Adobe added some minor improvements since it was first teased in September . Adobe lowers AI video pricing to compete with industry giants On Wednesday, Adobe unveiled its latest software, which creates 5-second videos with artificial intelligence for only 50 cents per video. In an attempt to compete with giants like OpenAI and Runway, Adobe is offering separate AI-specific subscriptions for only $9.99 and $29.99. Ely Greenfield, chief technology officer of Adobe’s creative software business, noted that the affordable prices serve to increase adoption rates while staying competitive and that the math speaks for itself. We’re pricing it at a lower point right now for adoption. If you do the math and look what’s out there, we’re competitive in the marketplace. Ely Greenfield This move most likely resulted from the massive 25% drop in Adobe’s shares in 2024, when investors feared that AI startups might subdue the company. Since then, the company has been integrating generative AI features into its star applications, like Photoshop. The computer software company began launching tools powered by its generative AI Firefly Video Model at the end of 2024, starting with the Generative Extend tool in beta for Premiere Pro that can be used to extend the end or beginning of footage. Adobe integrates AI into creative tools to compete with Runway and OpenAI Adobe’s Generate Video tool rollout comes a few weeks after OpenAI launched its own text-to-video generator, Sora, to ChatGPT paid subscribers, allowing them to generate AI videos using prompts. Runway charges users 70 cents to $1.20 to generate a 5-second video using its newest AI model and has an unlimited plan for $95 per month. Adobe faces growing competition in the AI video market. In addition to Sora, Google is testing the second generation of its Veo AI video model, which, judging by early demo examples, looks more impressive than OpenAI’s model. ByteDance and Pika Labs have also recently announced new video-focused generative AI tools. Adobe seeks to stand out from the crowd by integrating AI into its existing tools and working towards better controls over its output. With the new subscriptions, users can generate AI videos, photos, and illustrations and use the credits for different audio features like transcription. The computer software company claims that users have generated photos and other media using Firefly AI more than 18 billion times since December, when the numbers read 16 billion. This new AI integration will generate high-definition videos as the company works towards higher-resolution models for professional production.

With new projects emerging, investors are constantly on the lookout for the next big breakout. Could Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) be the one? While the meme coin market remains dynamic, two other projects have been making waves. Book of Meme has seen a surge in trading activity, and TRUMP Meme Coin continues to gather momentum among traders. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, Book of Meme, and TRUMP Meme Coin. Earn 66% APY Staking Rewards with Arctic Pablo Coin – A Golden Opportunity Arctic Pablo Coin is among the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now, and for good reason. One standout feature that sets it apart is its lucrative 66% APY staking rewards during the presale. Unlike most meme coins that rely purely on speculative hype, Arctic Pablo Coin provides an actual utility—allowing investors to stake their tokens and earn substantial passive income even before the official launch. This staking opportunity isn’t just a minor bonus; it’s a game-changer for those looking to maximize their holdings. Imagine accumulating more APC while the project moves through its presale stages, potentially increasing your overall profit at launch. The staking rewards ensure that early adopters reap continuous benefits while the project gains traction. With a high-yield staking mechanism already in place, Arctic Pablo Coin positions itself as a top-tier investment in the meme coin space. But the excitement doesn’t stop here—its presale is already making headlines. Arctic Pablo Coin Enters Aqua Frost Phase – Get in Before the Price Surges Arctic Pablo Coin is among the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now, and this meme coin presale is setting the stage for one of the most explosive launches in recent history. The project has now entered Aqua Frost, the 10th phase, marking a crucial milestone in its journey toward the official launch. Currently, 1 APC is priced at just $0.000059, but that won’t last long. Early investors have the potential to experience a staggering 13,451.72% ROI from this stage to the launch price of $0.008. The numbers speak for themselves: over $1.1 million has already been raised, reflecting strong investor confidence. As Arctic Pablo Coin progresses through its presale stages, each phase brings a price increase, meaning those who delay might find themselves paying significantly more. The window for getting in at an entry-level price is closing fast. The buzz surrounding Aqua Frost is undeniable. With such incredible ROI potential and the momentum building rapidly, Arctic Pablo Coin is drawing massive attention from both retail and whale investors alike. Book of Meme’s Surge: Price & Market Movement Book of Meme (BOME) continues to gain traction, making its presence felt in the meme coin space. Today, BOME is priced at $0.002031, with an astonishing $59,266,474 in 24-hour trading volume. This surge in trading activity highlights growing investor interest and confidence in the project. With meme coins proving to be volatile yet rewarding, Book of Meme is capturing attention as traders look for potential short-term and long-term gains. TRUMP Meme Coin Gathers Momentum TRUMP Meme Coin has been making headlines with increasing trading volume and investor engagement. The meme-inspired token has garnered significant attention, riding the wave of political and cultural trends that have driven its demand. The current price of the TRUMP Meme Coin is USD 0.000746, with a 24-hour trading volume of USD 1,901,237. Its unique branding and community-driven nature have solidified its place among the most talked-about meme coins today. As traders explore new opportunities, TRUMP Meme Coin remains an exciting project worth watching. Final Thoughts: Is Arctic Pablo Coin the Best Bet? Meme coins continue to evolve, offering diverse investment opportunities. Book of Meme has shown strong market activity, and TRUMP Meme Coin maintains its momentum among investors. However, Arctic Pablo Coin is among the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now and presents a highly lucrative presale with massive staking rewards and exceptional ROI potential. With its 66% APY staking rewards, the Aqua Frost presale phase, and the low current entry price of $0.000059, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as a top-tier contender in the meme coin space. As prices rise with each new phase, the best time to get in is now—before the window closes.

Market trends shift rapidly, prices fluctuate, and big names dominate headlines. What if the smartest investments lie in altcoins under $1, offering exponential growth before the masses catch on? JetBolt (JBOLT), VeChain (VET), Sei (SEI), and WallitIQ (WLTQ) are four promising altcoins still trading at bargain prices. Each holds potential, but one stands out above the rest. For investors looking to maximize returns, timing is everything. JetBolt (JBOLT): Early Hype, But Will It Last? Hyped as a futuristic DeFi solution, JetBolt (JBOLT) has gained traction among traders searching for innovative altcoins. Its rapid adoption and community-driven initiatives fuel speculation, but does it have the legs for long-term growth ? Crypto investors recognize the potential of getting in early, yet the lack of major exchange listings and an unproven track record leaves JetBolt (JBOLT) in uncertain waters. While it’s an exciting investment, the risk is high. Can it sustain momentum, or will early enthusiasm fizzle? VeChain (VET): A Veteran In The Game VeChain (VET) has cemented itself in the blockchain world. Known for its real-world applications in supply chain logistics, it has secured partnerships with major corporations. Investors seeking investment stability might find comfort in VeChain’s (VET) long-term roadmap, but does it still hold high-return potential? With a larger market cap and a more established ecosystem, this crypto asset offers security but lacks the explosive growth of emerging altcoins. VeChain (VET) may not be the best pick for investors chasing rapid multipliers. Sei (SEI): Speed And Scalability, But Competition Looms Sei (SEI) enters the scene as a high-speed blockchain promising efficiency and low fees. Crypto investors seeking performance-driven altcoins have taken notice, drawn by its scalable infrastructure and developer-friendly ecosystem. However, competition is fierce. Established blockchains already dominate this space, leaving Sei (SEI) fighting for adoption. While its potential is undeniable, true growth depends on whether it can differentiate itself enough to attract investor attention. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The Hidden Gem Set For A Breakout Among JetBolt (JBOLT), VeChain (VET), and Sei (SEI), one altcoin stands above the rest. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is not just another blockchain project. It is a game-changing investment opportunity . What makes this project a must-buy? Investors are drawn to its groundbreaking cashback rewards , allowing users to earn up to 12% cash back on transactions, unlike JetBolt (JBOLT), VeChain (VET), and Sei (SEI) offer. But that’s just the beginning. Investors gain passive income streams by staking WallitIQ (WLTQ), earning rewards while holding onto a high-growth asset. The upcoming MVP build of its Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App further amplifies its appeal. The SolidProof-audited platform prioritizes transparency, providing crypto investors custom alerts to manage volatile market movements. And here’s where things get urgent: the beta platform is launching soon. Waiting isn’t an option for first-time investors looking for an entry point into crypto, and the chance to secure WallitIQ (WLTQ) under $1 won’t last. Why WallitIQ (WLTQ) Is The Best Pick For First-Time Investors While JetBolt (JBOLT), VeChain (VET), and Sei (SEI) hold potential, WallitIQ (WLTQ) stands out as the ultimate investment opportunity. WallitIQ (WLTQ) isn’t just another altcoin—it’s an AI-powered financial disruptor designed for long-term gains. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) price won’t stay this low for long when mainstream adoption kicks in. For investors, the choice is clear: seize this moment to invest or miss out on life-changing gains. The Time To Act Is Now Altcoins under $1 are the golden ticket to exponential gains, but not all opportunities are created equal. JetBolt (JBOLT) may ride early hype, but its long-term success is uncertain. VeChain (VET) is a solid choice but lacks the parabolic growth of emerging cryptos. SEI (SEI) offers speed, but it faces stiff competition. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is different. This AI-powered financial powerhouse combines real-world utility with next-gen investment advantages, making it the best choice for first-time investors. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is still under $1, but not for long. Once the beta platform launches, prices will never be this low again. Don’t wait. Invest now and claim your stake before the real surge begins.

According to the Bitcoin ETF issuer, this Solana move will make the fund more accessible, improve transaction efficiency, and strengthen its commitment to blockchain-based investment products. Why This Matters Over time, Franklin Templeton has been strengthening its presence in the crypto space. For example, the fund, which maintains a stable $1 share price similar to a stablecoin, was introduced on Ethereum in November 2024. New chain unlocked. BENJI is now live on @solana !

Consequently, by integrating with Solana, a blockchain known for its speed and low fees, the firm intends to provide investors with a more efficient and cost-effective way to trade digital assets. The Bigger Picture Similarly, tokenization is becoming a major trend in the financial sector. Many top asset managers, including BlackRock and Fidelity, have adopted blockchain-based investment products, pointing to benefits such as faster transactions, lower costs, and increased transparency. Furthermore, industry reports indicate that the total value of tokenized U.S. Treasuries has reached $3.6 billion, showing the growing demand for blockchain-powered finance. What’s Next for Franklin Templeton? In another event, Franklin Templeton filed for a Solana-based ETF in Delaware , signaling further expansion into the crypto market. If the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves the filing, it could open up new investment opportunities. Investors can now access FOBXX through the Benji Investments app, where a BENJI token represents each share. Meanwhile, Franklin Templeton’s move comes as several firms file similar applications following President Donald Trump’s inauguration, which brought changes to the SEC, including the resignation of former Chair Gary Gensler. Additionally, the firm projected a significant shift for Bitcoin in December, predicting its transition from a speculative asset to a functional reserve as its underlying technologies become more integrated into global financial systems.

Achieving an astonishing 6,430% ROI, Web3Bay is quickly becoming a standout in the blockchain sector, signaling a seismic shift in investor preferences towards platforms offering more than just currency transactions. This dramatic return on investment highlights Web3Bay’s potential to redefine decentralized e-commerce, attracting a wide array of stakeholders looking to capitalize on its innovative transaction methods and robust technological framework. Here’s a closer look at why Web3Bay’s presale is outshining even the strongest competitors and what it means for the future of the digital marketplace. Web3Bay Presale: A Gateway to Exceptional Returns Web3Bay is quickly becoming a focal point in the decentralized e-commerce sector. Its presale is structured to reward early participants, with a total of 28 stages, each introducing incremental price increases. Currently, in Stage 4, the platform has already raised more than $1.1 million, selling over 295 million 3BAY tokens at $0.004562625 each. With a projected listing price of $0.1959, the expected ROI for early investors stands at an impressive 6,430%. This structured growth model ensures that those who invest early see the highest potential gains. Beyond its financial incentives, Web3Bay is designed to solve a major issue in online commerce—high transaction fees and lack of user control. Traditional e-commerce platforms like Amazon and eBay charge hefty commission fees on every transaction, cutting into sellers’ profits and increasing costs for buyers. Web3Bay eliminates these middlemen by enabling direct peer-to-peer transactions through blockchain technology. By reducing costs and enhancing transparency, it provides a fairer alternative to existing centralized marketplaces. A standout feature of Web3Bay is its governance model. Unlike centralized platforms, where corporate executives make all decisions, Web3Bay operates on a decentralized governance system where token holders have voting power. Users can propose and vote on platform policies, transaction fees, and new features, making it a truly user-driven marketplace. Additionally, Web3Bay supports multiple payment options, including stablecoins, making it easier for both crypto and non-crypto users to participate. Stablecoin integration ensures that buyers and sellers can transact without worrying about crypto price volatility, which has been a major barrier to widespread adoption. This hybrid payment system, combined with Web3Bay’s decentralized model, positions it as one of the most promising crypto projects to watch in 2025. VeChain: Enhancing Transparency and Security Amid Market Volatility VeChain (VET) has established itself as a leading blockchain platform focused on supply chain management and logistics. By leveraging blockchain technology, VeChain enhances product authentication, prevents fraud, and ensures transparency across industries like retail, healthcare, and luxury goods. As of the latest data, VET is trading at approximately $0.03285, with a 24-hour trading volume of $45,623,938. This represents a 0.55% price increase in the last 24 hours. Despite its innovative solutions, VeChain has faced market volatility, with its current price significantly lower than its all-time high of $0.28. However, strategic partnerships with major corporations like Walmart China and BMW continue to strengthen its credibility in the enterprise sector. As adoption of VeChain’s technology grows, long-term investors remain optimistic about its potential for price appreciation. Kaspa: Rapid Transactions Kaspa (KAS) is recognized for its ultra-fast transaction speeds and innovative proof-of-work consensus mechanism. Unlike traditional blockchains, Kaspa operates on a blockDAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) structure, allowing multiple blocks to be mined simultaneously. This approach improves network efficiency and scalability while maintaining high security standards. The current price of KAS is approximately $0.08735, with a 24-hour trading volume of $44,025,482. This reflects a 0.93% price increase in the last 24 hours. Over the past week, Kaspa has experienced a price decline of approximately 26.70%, indicating market volatility. However, continued network developments, increased adoption, and potential integrations with DeFi platforms could contribute to future price recoveries. With its emphasis on speed and security, Kaspa aims to address key challenges facing traditional blockchain networks. The Last Line: As Web3Bay’s presale progresses, offering a potential 6,430% ROI, it stands out as a compelling opportunity for investors seeking exposure to decentralized e-commerce innovations. VeChain’s real-world use cases in supply chain logistics and Kaspa’s scalable blockchain technology make them valuable assets for different segments of the market. With increasing adoption and development, all three projects present investment opportunities that cater to different objectives.

One project that has caught their attention is RCO Finance, an AI-powered investment ecosystem that eases participation in the financial sector. Read on to see why these investors believe RCO Finance could become the best crypto coin of 2025. Dogecoin and XRP Tops List of Biggest Losers in February Dogecoin and XRP dominated investor wishlists for the past three months as both tokens surged to 2-year highs in Q4 2024. Many investors expected this rally to continue, increasing their Dogecoin and XRP holdings. Unfortunately, things went very differently as both tokens slipped to a double-digit drop in early February. For Dogecoin, its value has fallen by 12.35% in the first week of February. XRP has also fallen by 14% in the same time, now trading at $2.45. With fears that bearish sentiment around Dogecoin and XRP will remain until the end of Q1 2025, investors are shifting their focus to alternative projects like RCO Finance, a new altcoin project that leverages AI and machine learning to streamline investments. RCO Finance: Creating AI-backed Tools for the Future of the Financial Sector RCO Finance (RCOF) is a platform that offers an innovative path to smarter, more responsive asset management, one that is accessible to amateur and seasoned investors. Central to the RCO Finance platform is the Robo Advisor—a cutting-edge system that continuously monitors market trends using real-time data from reputable sources like Bloomberg and Reuters. This AI-powered trading bot acts as your personal Wall Street broker, watching for market shifts that bring profit opportunities. When doing so, Robo Advisor takes into consideration your risk tolerance, investing goals, and market preference, crafting investment strategies tailored to your portfolio. This trading bot is particularly useful for new investors who don’t know how to get started in the financial landscape. For instance, picture Mr Carlos, a computer developer who wants to get started investing in the crypto sector. Instead of spending hours trying to read complex charts, they can rely on investment suggestions from Robo Advisor. RCO Finance’s trading bot can also rebalance your portfolio automatically, helping you to stay in the green zone while reducing losses from sudden market shifts. After leveraging artificial intelligence for streamlined investing, Robo Advisor lets investors trade access to a wide range of assets while enjoying up to a 1000x leverage. The platform allows you to trade over 120,000 assets including equities, stocks, bonds, ETFs, and tokenized real estate, allowing you to move from risky assets to more stable options all from the convenience of one trading bot. Picture an unexpected economic policy shift that rattles global markets, for instance, the early February 2025 market crash that was triggered by talks of a trade war between America and Canada. In such a scenario, Robo Advisor will quickly recalculate your risk exposure, diverting funds from volatile cryptocurrencies to more stable investments like high-grade corporate bonds. Whether you’re just beginning or are an experienced trader, this tool ensures your portfolio remains agile and well-protected. For traders looking to maximize short-term gains, RCO Finance offers leverage trading up to 1000x, amplifying both profit potential and risk. With this leverage, an investor with $200 can open a trading position of $200,000. Aside from high-leverage trading and access to diverse markets, RCO Finance offers yield-earning mechanisms that reward commitment to its ecosystem. Its staking program, offering up to 86% APY, provides an exceptional avenue for earning passive income. By locking up tokens in its staking program, investors help provide liquidity for trading pools. Additionally, investors can earn extra tokens just for keeping RCOF tokens in their wallets. The higher your token balance, the higher your trading fee discounts. RCO Finance users also enjoy a high level of security and privacy thanks to the absence of KYC policies. To further boost investor safety, RCO Finance uses smart contracts that have been rigorously audited by SolidProof, creating a secure environment where your financial data and assets are well-protected. RCO Finance Excites Investment Community with its Beta Launch The beta version of RCO Finance is now live, giving over 10,000 new users a chance to test out the Robo Advisor and witness firsthand the power of its Robo Advisor trading bot. In the meantime, Robo Advisor and the trading bot will keep undergoing tests and upgrades ahead of its forthcoming alpha release. Best Crypto Coin for 2025: RCO Finance Vs. Dogecoin Given its AI-driven trading solutions and high-yield staking options, RCO Finance has been compared to traditional crypto investments like Dogecoin. Additionally, RCO Finance’ ongoing ICO is offering the opportunity to join a rapidly expanding community with over 10,000 members and more than $12 million raised in the presale. RCOF tokens are now in stage 5 of their presale, trading at $0.100. With its expected increase to $0.130 by stage 6 and a future listing in the $0.4–$0.6 range, analysts say now might be the best time to join its ecosystem. Projections indicate that RCOF could achieve a 10,000x increase, meaning a $1,000 investment might grow to $150,000 by December. Don’t miss out on securing your place in this pioneering venture.

I'm Ben Schiller, CoinDesk’s Opinion and Features editor. In this issue: Can Based Rollups solve Ethereum’s problem? Lido goes modular Uniswap finally unveils Unichain Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade is coming Network news BASED ROLLUPS TO THE RESCUE: In recent years, Ethereum has embraced a layer-2 scaling roadmap—a plan that encouraged the development of third-party auxiliary networks called ""layer-2 rollups""—to help scale the base Ethereum ecosystem. Offloading activity to these upstart networks has helped bring down fees and improve speeds for end-users, but it has led to a massive, deeply fragmented ecosystem of layer 2s. But while layer-2 networks all post data back down to Ethereum, they often struggle to communicate directly with one another, meaning passing assets and data between them can become expensive and cumbersome. There's also the risk of centralized sequencers: reliance on company-controlled black boxes to pass transaction data between blockchain layers. As a result, some Ethereum developers are pushing rollup tech that takes a new approach to security and interoperability: “based rollups."" Based rollups differ from most existing rollups because they shift execution duties—such as processing transactions—back to Ethereum's layer-1 rather than handling them on a separate layer-2 network. When someone transacts on a layer-2 rollup, their transaction is processed through a component called a “sequencer.” The sequencer batches multiple transactions and submits them to Ethereum for settlement. While sequencers provide efficiency and generate revenue for rollup operators by strategically ordering transactions, they also introduce a single point of failure. Based rollups avoid this vulnerability by using Ethereum’s built-in sequencing—its massive community of validators—rather than a single centralized sequencer. Rollups like Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, zkSync, and Blast have quickly grown to support larger transaction volumes than Ethereum itself. According to L2Beat , there are currently 140 live layer-2 networks, but the experience of operating between them—passing assets and other data between networks—has become clunky. As Ethereum becomes bigger and layer-2 networks become more integral to its functioning, improving communication between layer-2s—in other words, improving ""composability""—has become more important than ever. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. LIDO GOES MODULAR: The developers behind Lido, the largest staking service on Ethereum, have proposed revamping the staking platform with modular ""vaults."" The new framework would introduce stVaults, a customizable component designed to help Lido accommodate institutions and more complex staking strategies. Lido currently allows investors to pool their ether (ETH) together and ""stake"" their crypto — locking up their tokens with the network, helping to secure it in exchange for interest. Lido pioneered liquid staking: users get a receipt on their deposits called Lido staked ETH (stETH) that they can trade at any time. With liquid staking on Lido, entering and exiting staking positions became as simple as buying and selling stETH tokens. Lido V3's stVaults are “modular smart contracts designed to meet the diverse and evolving needs of Ethereum participants,” according to a press release shared with CoinDesk. The upgrade would enable staking setups beyond cut-and-dry liquid staking. Specifically, stVaults will be able to help institutional stakers who want to personalize their staking setups, node operators who want to attract high-volume stakers, and asset managers who want to create new staking use cases. “What is important to understand with customizable infrastructure, is that you can in general build even more complex products,” said Konstantin Lomashuk, the founder of the Lido staking protocol. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. UNICHAIN FINALLY: Uniswap Labs, the primary developer behind one of the largest decentralized exchanges (DEX), Uniswap, shared Feb 13 that its long-awaited layer-2 network, Unichain, is now live. Powered by Optimism's OP stack, Unichain—like other layer-2s on Ethereum—offers faster and cheaper transactions compared to Ethereum's mainnet. Developers can deploy apps onto the network, which has been optimized specifically for decentralized finance (DeFi) and aims to serve as ""the home for liquidity across chains,"" according to Uniswap Labs. For Uniswap Labs, the benefit of launching a layer-2 is twofold: it will provide a better experience for users of Uniswap and similar platforms, and it will create a new revenue opportunity in the form of network fees. A representative for Uniswap Labs told CoinDesk that ""around 20%"" of the chain's revenue will go directly to the company. Unichain has been in testing since October 2024 and is classified by Uniswap Labs as a ""stage-1"" rollup, meaning it has elements of decentralization but retains some centrally-controlled safeguards at this early phase. The network is built on the OP Stack, a modular framework that lets developers build interoperable layer-2 chains based on Optimism’s optimistic rollup technology . Several well-known teams have come out with their own OP Stack-based layer-2’s, including Coinbase's ‘ Base ’, Kraken’s ‘ Ink ,’ World’s ‘ World chain ,’ and Sony’s ‘ Soneium .’ “We are anticipating a world of many, many different use cases, of which trading is a small subset,” Adams told CoinDesk in an interview. In collaboration with Ethereum research and development firm Flashbots, the Uniswap team said it has created a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) on Unichain, a secure area for more sensitive transactions and is meant to optimize the chain for DeFi by allowing for more advanced trades and faster transaction finality. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. PECTRA IN APRIL: Ethereum developers have officially set test dates for Pectra, the network's first upgrade in 11 months, putting it on track for a potential April release date. Pectra will contain an array of improvements — with a special focus on wallets and validators — but it comes at a period of heightened scrutiny for Ethereum, which has recently faced pressure from its community to refocus and catch up with competitors. Ethereum's core builders decided on Thursday during their bi-weekly ""All Core Developers"" call to begin testing Pectra on Feb. 26 on the Holesky testnet, with a follow-up test on the network's Sepolia testnet slated for Mar. 5. Should those tests succeed, the developers will reconvene on Mar. 6 to determine when to launch the upgrade officially. According to Tim Beiko, the protocol support lead at the Ethereum Foundation, developers expect the upgrade to hit mainnet in early April. Pectra — a portmanteau representing two separate upgrades, Prague and Electra — includes eight major improvements to the second-largest blockchain. Among the most-anticipated is EIP-7702, which is supposed to improve the user experience of crypto wallets. The Ethereum community has been facing an identity crisis over the last few weeks. Its native token, ether (ETH), is underperforming against other cryptocurrencies, and competitor networks like Solana have drawn attention and talent from the Ethereum ecosystem — the first-ever programmable blockchain and still the most trafficked. Amid the controversy — much of it directed at the Etheruem Foundation, which coordinates chain upgrades and is currently undergoing a major leadership shuffle — developers are hoping that Pectra will help put the network on steadier footing. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more.

Since early December, ADA has seen its price plummet by over 61%, with bears dominating the trend and bulls unable to reclaim momentum. Despite the challenging environment, Cardano has shown signs of recovery, experiencing a 15% breakout yesterday that has pushed the price to a critical level. Related Reading: Litecoin Approaches Daily Range Peak – Can LTC Break Multi-Year Highs? This breakout offers a glimmer of hope for investors, but ADA must hold its current level to confirm the possibility of a continuation. The market remains uncertain, and the coming days will be crucial in determining whether Cardano can sustain its recent gains. If momentum persists, analysts believe ADA could rally further, providing some much-needed optimism for holders. Top crypto analyst Ali Martinez weighed in on the situation, sharing a technical analysis that suggests Cardano is breaking out and has the potential for a move toward $0.83. Martinez emphasized that the next key challenge will be maintaining this momentum, as it could signal a reversal in the broader downtrend. For now, investors remain cautiously optimistic, watching closely to see if Cardano can sustain its upward trajectory. Cardano Could Start A Recovery Phase Cardano could be on the verge of a recovery rally as it finds strong demand at its current levels, with bears unable to push the price into lower demand zones. After months of sustained selling pressure, Cardano appears to be showing signs of strength. However, the path to recovery is not straightforward. Bulls must reclaim and hold key levels above the $0.85 mark to confirm the start of a sustained uptrend. Adding to the optimism, top analyst Ali Martinez shared a technical analysis on X that highlights a potential breakout for Cardano. According to Martinez, if current momentum holds, Cardano could make a move toward $0.83 in the coming days. This breakout represents an important opportunity for ADA to shift market sentiment and regain investor confidence. Despite the encouraging signs, the broader market remains shaky, with analysts calling for potential retracements as BTC and altcoins struggle to find direction. The entire crypto space seems to be battling uncertainty, which has weighed heavily on sentiment. However, there is hope that Bitcoin and altcoins, including Cardano, will begin a new recovery rally in the coming days. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Hold $97K? – 1-3 Month Holders’ Data Reveals Crucial BTC Demand For now, all eyes are on ADA’s ability to maintain its breakout and push through key resistance levels. The next few days will be critical in determining whether this recovery can gain traction or if further consolidation is needed before the next leg up. Investors are cautiously optimistic, waiting for Cardano to confirm its upward momentum and break free from its recent downtrend. Price Testing Crucial Supply Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.78 after an impressive 15% surge yesterday, signaling a potential shift in momentum. Despite this rally, ADA has faced resistance at the $0.85 level, unable to break through and reclaim critical liquidity levels above the $0.80 mark. The inability to push past this zone has raised questions about whether the recovery rally can sustain its momentum in the coming days. However, there is a silver lining for ADA bulls. The price has managed to climb above the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), which sits around $0.72. This is a crucial technical indicator that signals long-term strength and provides optimism for a potential continuation of the upward trend. Holding above the 200-day EMA could create a foundation for bulls to regain control and challenge higher levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Multi-Year Bullish Pattern – Expert Suggests The Next Move Will Be ‘The Real Deal’ The next key challenge for ADA is to hold above the current levels and build the momentum necessary to retest the $0.85 resistance. A breakout above this zone would confirm a short-term bullish trend and open the door for further gains. However, failure to hold above the 200-day EMA could invite renewed selling pressure, pushing the price back toward lower support zones. For now, ADA remains in a delicate position, with the next few days likely to define its short-term direction.

The fraudulent project, called $BARRON, quickly surged in market value before crashing within seconds. World Liberty Financial Co Founder X Account Hacked World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance project linked to the Trump family, has confirmed that its co founder Zach Witkoff X account has been breached and urged users to ignore the fraudulent posts. On Wednesday, Witkoff’s compromised X account was used to promote $BARRON, a Solana-based memecoin falsely linked to President Donald Trump’s youngest son, Barron Trump. The hacker claimed that Trump would soon confirm the token’s legitimacy. However, according to World Liberty Financial, “Zach Witkoff’s account was compromised. Please do not engage with any posts promoting this project,” the company posted on X. The coin briefly reached a market capitalization of $73 million in under ten minutes before suddenly plummeting by 99%. This rapid rise and collapse indicated a “rug pull,” a scam where creators artificially inflate a token’s value before dumping it for profit. Previous Trump-Themed Memecoin Scams World Liberty Financial, which is launching a macro strategy reserve for crypto , was founded in 2024 and launched its own cryptocurrency, WLFI, in October of the same year. Several members of the Trump family, including Barron Trump, are listed as part of the project’s team. The $BARRON incident follows a similar scam in January involving a memecoin named after Ivanka Trump. The former president’s daughter publicly distanced herself from the project and warned investors against fraudulent schemes using her likeness. Memecoins featuring the Trump family have gained traction since Donald Trump announced his own cryptocurrency, Official Trump, on Solana in January. Days later, Melania Trump launched Melania Meme, also on the Solana blockchain. Memecoin Scams and Growing Concerns The rise of celebrity-themed memecoins has raised concerns about misleading promotions and scams in the cryptocurrency market. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) commented on the growing trend, questioning how investors determine the legitimacy of such tokens. “How does this work? I share my dog’s name and picture, and then people create memecoins?” Zhao wrote on X. “How do you know which one is ‘official’? Or does that even matter?” According to experts, memecoins have gained popularity due to their viral nature and speculative appeal, but they also pose risks to investors. Many projects lack transparency, and sudden sell-offs, commonly known as “rug pulls,” can lead to significant financial losses. Despite these concerns, the US SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, in a February 11 interview, stated that most memecoins do not fall under the SEC’s current regulatory framework. “Many of the memecoins that are out there probably do not have a home in the SEC under our current set of regulations,” Peirce said.

For a coin that traded as low as $2,551.17 in the past 24 hours, it is now changing hands for $2,794.86, up 4.73% at the time of writing. The 21Shares Push for Ethereum ETF Staking The 19b-4 filing was filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Cboe BZX Exchange. Cboe argued to allow changes to the ETH ETP Amendment No 2 that will permit the staking. This filing makes 21Shares the first issuer to make a move for this product. “Based on discussions with the Sponsor, the Exchanges proposes to amend several portions of the Eth ETP Amendment No. 2, as amended, in order to allow the staking of the Ethereum held by the Trust,” Cboe noted in the filing Primarily, 21Shares wants to enhance the income accruable to the Ethereum it holds on behalf of its clients in the ETF. It said it would not stake the Ether with any of its affiliates but those of its custodians’. Despite the plans for the staking, the filing noted that it would keep sufficient liquidity to satisfy any redemptions. The impact of this offering on Ethereum price appears to be priced in by the market at the moment. Ethereum Price Selloff Fades With the current shift in the price of ETH, speculations of further breakout are now making the rounds in the market. Thus far in this bull cycle, Ethereum’s price has not moved above the $4,000 resistance level. With market bears swooping in recently, it even turned the $3,000 mark as a formidable resistance. This 21Shares update has helped break its bearish dormancy, aligning with an earlier ETH price analysis that signals a potential $10,000 play. While it remains unknown whether Ethereum will pare off the 13.06% 30-day loss recorded thus far, current sentiment points in that direction. Generally, the ETH/BTC ratio flipped to its lowest level, a trend that analysts hint might also contribute to its potential rebound moving forward. ETH Price and Coming Tailwinds The launch of Ethereum ETF by top asset managers has not significantly fueled a boost in price. At the time, the US SEC opposed staking on ETF, an offering that could have made more difference for the coin. However, under President Donald Trump, chances are that the improved regulations will see the SEC approve this proposal. While this marks a major tailwind for ETH, the coming Pectra upgrade might also serve as a complement for adoption and price in general.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Pentoshi tells his 854,200 followers on the social media platform X that the crypto market is not reacting to bad economic news, signaling that a possible bottom is in. “Now price not reacting to tariffs or negative news anymore while many, not all things, are at high timeframe supports. Not a bad sign for some relief.” He says several alts appear poised to undergo mean reversion moves after the market correction. In trading, mean reversion is the theory that prices will revert to their averages after an extreme move. First up, he says PENGU , the utility token for the non-fungible token (NFT) project Pudgy Penguins, may surge to $0.01658 and possibly higher. “PENGU mean reversion areas (probably will have a lot of resistance at the upper one if we get there to be honest). But the first one should be the first area of interest for now.” Source: Pentoshi/X PENGU is trading for $0.01 at time of writing, flat on the day. Next up, the trader says that automated staking service Lido DAO ( LDO ) is holding the key level of $1.54 as support and may soon bounce. “There’s a ton of charts that are essentially just retesting high timeframe supports. Several that look like this, in my opinion very clean invalidations across the board.” Source: Pentoshi/X LDO is trading for $1.59, down marginally on the day. Lastly, he says that IOTA , the native asset for a crypto project focused on the Internet of Things, may increase more than 21% its current value after flipping a key level into support on the daily chart. “IOTA another chart flipping its high timeframe support. Looking for a move up towards $0.27-$0.28 and a reclaim. These high timeframe historical areas are often great areas to get involved.” IOTA is trading for $0.23 at time of writing, flat on the day.

Currently, in Stage 4, the platform has already raised more than $1 million, selling over 295 million 3BAY tokens at $0.004562625 each. With a projected listing price of $0.1959, the expected ROI for early investors stands at an impressive 6,430%. This structured growth model ensures that those who invest early see the highest potential gains. Beyond financial incentives, Web3Bay is designed to address significant inefficiencies in online shopping. Traditional platforms impose excessive fees on merchants while limiting consumer options due to centralized decision-making. Web3Bay creates a decentralized shopping environment where transactions are settled directly between buyers and sellers, removing unnecessary overhead costs. One of Web3Bay’s standout features is its governance model. Instead of being dictated by a centralized entity, decisions regarding platform fees, policies, and updates are made collectively by token holders. This ensures that users retain control over the marketplace and can influence its future development. Additionally, Web3Bay incorporates multi-currency payments, including stablecoins, which provide price stability for transactions. This hybrid system bridges the gap between crypto and traditional payment systems, making Web3Bay accessible to a wider audience. DeXe: Decentralized Asset Management DeXe (DEXE) offers decentralized asset management solutions, enabling users to follow and invest in successful trading strategies without relinquishing control of their funds. As of the latest data, DEXE is trading at approximately $19.97, with a 24-hour trading volume of $50,000. The day’s range has seen a high of $22.58 and a low of $18.88. DeXe’s platform allows for transparent and efficient asset management, leveraging blockchain technology to ensure security and trust. The decentralized nature of the platform provides users with autonomy over their investments, a feature increasingly valued in the financial sector. Investors are observing DeXe’s growth and adoption rates to evaluate its potential in the evolving landscape of decentralized finance (DeFi). The platform’s unique approach to asset management could position it as a significant player in the DeFi space, especially as more traditional investors explore blockchain-based financial services. Render: Decentralized GPU Rendering Render (RNDR) is recognized for its decentralized GPU rendering services, providing a network that connects users looking to perform render jobs with GPU owners willing to rent their compute power. The current price of RNDR is approximately $4.24, with a 24-hour trading volume of $308 million. This represents a 3.2% increase in the last 24 hours. Render’s decentralized infrastructure allows creative professionals to access affordable, scalable rendering power without relying on centralized cloud providers. This model not only enhances efficiency but also democratizes access to high-performance computing for industries such as film production, gaming, and artificial intelligence. As demand for AI-driven applications and 3D rendering grows, Render is well-positioned to capitalize on these expanding markets. Strategic partnerships and integrations with industry-leading creative tools could further solidify its market presence in the coming years. Conclusion As Web3Bay’s presale progresses, offering a potential 6,430% ROI, it stands out as a compelling opportunity for investors seeking exposure to decentralized e-commerce innovations. Meanwhile, DeXe, and Render continue to expand their influence, addressing growing data privacy concerns, DeXe facilitating decentralized asset management, and Render optimizing distributed computing resources. Each of these projects presents a unique value proposition, catering to different segments of the market.

The surge comes as decentralized finance (DeFi) activity picks up, particularly on the Solana blockchain, boosting USDC adoption and demand. Over the past month, USDC added $10.2 billion to its market cap , significantly outpacing the $4.6 billion increase in Tether’s USDT, according to Artemis data. Despite the surge, USDT remains the dominant stablecoin, with a market capitalization of $142 billion. This milestone marks a full recovery for USDC after the 2023 US regional banking crisis, which temporarily caused the stablecoin to lose its peg to the US dollar. Circle had held part of its reserves in Silicon Valley Bank, which collapsed, leading to a temporary loss of confidence among investors. Meanwhile, Tether capitalized on the shift, surpassing its 2022 market cap peak by May 2023. Stablecoins, such as USDT and USDC, play a crucial role in crypto markets by providing liquidity and facilitating trading on exchanges. Their growing supply is often viewed as a key indicator of investor confidence and market strength. Recent data shows that stablecoin expansion, particularly in USDT and USDC, has accelerated in recent weeks, aligning with previous periods of strong Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoin rallies. While macroeconomic uncertainties persist, the rapid growth of stablecoins signals renewed investor interest and a potentially bullish outlook for the broader cryptocurrency market. Trump open to considering USDC for strategic reserves Meanwhile, the Trump administration is reportedly considering integrating cryptocurrencies such as XRP, Solana, and USDC into a national strategic reserve . According to a New York Post report, the Trump transition team is exploring the establishment of an “America-first strategic reserve”. However, some within the crypto sector worry that emphasizing alternative coins may dilute efforts to legitimize Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, which remains central to discussions of a strategic Bitcoin reserve.

While some observe from the sidelines, others are actively participating in three distinct sectors of the blockchain ecosystem. The Web3Bay presale has now crossed the $1.15 million mark, with nearly 300 million tokens sold across three completed stages. This achievement underscores the project’s growing appeal and positions early investors for substantial returns. The current price of 3BAY in Stage 4 is $0.004562625, a significant increase from the Stage 1 price of $0.003. This positions Stage 4 buyers for a potential 4200% gain upon launch at $0.1959, while those who participated in Stage 1 are looking at a potential return of 6430%. Simultaneously, XRP price faces significant challenges, and Dogecoin is making inroads in the NFT space. XRP Price Analysis: A Critical Juncture at $2.50 The XRP price currently hovers near the $2.50 support level, a crucial point that will likely determine its short-term direction. While the long-to-short ratio on Binance indicates a bullish sentiment among traders at 2.80, the XRP price has experienced a 6.5% decline in the last 24 hours. This price drop is accompanied by a substantial decrease in trading volume, which has fallen by 65%. This reduction in trading activity suggests a weakening of market participation, and if the XRP price fails to hold above $2.50, analysts suggest a potential further decline to $1.95, representing a 25% decrease. The XRP price’s ability to maintain this level is critical. If the XRP price breaks below this support, it could trigger further selling pressure. Conversely, if the XRP price manages to hold, it may signal a potential rebound. The XRP price remains a focal point for many traders. The XRP price’s future hinges on its ability to navigate this critical support level. Dogecoin’s NFT Market: A New Era for Digital Art Dogecoin, initially conceived as a lighthearted internet phenomenon, has now become a significant player in the NFT market. Its appeal stems from its lower transaction fees compared to other cryptocurrencies. This cost-effectiveness makes Dogecoin an attractive platform for artists to sell their digital creations without incurring significant expenses. Beyond affordability, Dogecoin’s blockchain technology provides each NFT with a unique, verifiable digital signature, ensuring authenticity and security for both creators and collectors. This feature has contributed to the growth of the Dogecoin NFT market, establishing it as a viable platform for digital artists to exercise control over their work and earnings. The success of Dogecoin in the NFT space demonstrates its evolution beyond its meme-coin origins. Web3Bay’s Million-Dollar Presale: A Gateway to Future Rewards Web3Bay has rapidly gained traction, demonstrating the appetite for its unique approach to e-commerce. The platform has successfully raised over $1.15 million in its presale, selling about 300 million 3BAY tokens, a testament to the project’s strong initial appeal. The ongoing Stage 4 presale, priced at $0.004562625 per token, presents a limited-time opportunity for potential investors seeking to capitalize on early adoption. This stage represents a crucial entry point before the price potentially increases in subsequent rounds. The Web3Bay presale numbers speak for themselves, demonstrating investor confidence in the project’s vision and potential for disruption. Web3Bay offers more than just investment potential; it aims to transform the e-commerce experience by creating a more inclusive and rewarding ecosystem for all participants. This focus on community and utility sets it apart from many other projects in the crypto space. Users earn 3BAY tokens through purchases and platform engagement, unlocking discounts, passive income opportunities, and governance rights. This empowers users to actively participate in shaping the future of Web3Bay, giving them a voice in the platform’s development and direction. This decentralized governance model fosters a sense of ownership and shared purpose among the community. Sellers also benefit from reduced transaction fees enabled by blockchain technology, enhancing profitability and efficiency. This streamlined approach to commerce lowers barriers to entry and promotes greater participation. The dual benefits of high ROI potential and practical utility make Web3Bay a compelling proposition for both individual users and businesses. Summing Up The rapid pace of the cryptocurrency market underscores the importance of timely action. While the XRP price faces challenges and Dogecoin expands its influence in the NFT space, Web3Bay’s presale success highlights the potential for substantial returns for early participants. With each presale stage, the entry point rises, and the potential for maximum gains diminishes. The Web3Bay presale represents an opportunity to participate in a platform with both high ROI potential and real-world utility.

You’re not alone. Recent reports indicate a significant slowdown in the Bitcoin network, with average Bitcoin confirmation times reaching an unprecedented 19 minutes. This alarming development, reported by Cointelegraph on X, has sparked concern and curiosity within the crypto community. Let’s dive into what’s causing these Bitcoin transaction delays and what it means for you. Why Are Bitcoin Confirmation Times Skyrocketing? Several factors contribute to the current surge in Bitcoin confirmation times . It’s a perfect storm of network dynamics, highlighting both the strengths and limitations of the Bitcoin blockchain. Here’s a breakdown: Network Congestion: Think of the Bitcoin network as a digital highway. When more transactions are submitted than the network can handle efficiently, traffic jams occur. This network congestion is a primary driver of longer confirmation times. Increased user activity, perhaps due to market volatility or new adoption waves, can quickly clog the network. Block Size Limits: Bitcoin’s blockchain operates with a block size limit of roughly 1MB. This constraint, designed for security and decentralization, means that only a limited number of transactions can be included in each block mined approximately every 10 minutes. When transaction volume exceeds block capacity, a backlog forms, leading to delays. Fee Dynamics: In Bitcoin, users attach fees to their transactions to incentivize miners to prioritize them. Transactions with higher fees are generally processed faster. When network congestion is high, users often need to increase their fees to ensure timely confirmation. However, this creates a competitive fee market, potentially pricing out users with lower fee tolerance and further contributing to overall delays. Understanding Bitcoin Transaction Delays: A Closer Look To truly grasp the impact of these delays, let’s break down what Bitcoin confirmation times mean and why they matter: Aspect Description Impact of Increased Confirmation Times Confirmation Time The time it takes for a Bitcoin transaction to be included in a block and considered verified by the network. Longer wait times for transactions to finalize. Network Throughput The number of transactions the Bitcoin network can process per second. Reduced throughput means the network struggles to keep up with demand, leading to backlogs. User Experience The overall ease and speed of using Bitcoin for transactions. Frustration for users expecting quick and efficient transactions, especially in time-sensitive situations like point-of-sale purchases. Fee Market The competitive environment where users bid transaction fees to get their transactions processed faster. Higher fees become necessary for faster confirmations, increasing the cost of using Bitcoin, particularly during peak congestion. What Does This Mean for Crypto Users? The record-high Bitcoin confirmation times present both challenges and opportunities for crypto users: Challenges: Slower Transactions: The most immediate impact is the increased wait time for transactions to be confirmed. This can be inconvenient for everyday use cases, especially when speed is crucial. Higher Fees: To expedite transactions during congestion, users may need to pay higher fees, making Bitcoin potentially less cost-effective for smaller transactions. Uncertainty: Longer confirmation times can introduce uncertainty, particularly in volatile markets where timely execution of trades is important. Opportunities & Actionable Insights: Layer-2 Solutions: This situation highlights the importance of Layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network, which offer faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions. Exploring and adopting these solutions can mitigate the impact of mainnet congestion. Fee Awareness: Understanding Bitcoin fee dynamics becomes crucial. Using fee estimators and adjusting fees based on network conditions can help optimize transaction speed and cost. Patience and Planning: For less time-sensitive transactions, patience is key. Planning transactions ahead and avoiding peak congestion times can help reduce delays. Consider Alternatives (Strategically): In situations where extremely fast and low-cost transactions are paramount, users might temporarily consider other cryptocurrencies with faster confirmation times and lower fees, while still holding Bitcoin for its store of value properties. Are There Solutions to Bitcoin Network Congestion? Addressing network congestion and improving crypto transaction speed on Bitcoin is an ongoing discussion within the community. Potential solutions and improvements include: Block Size Increase (Controversial): Increasing the block size limit could theoretically allow more transactions per block. However, this is a contentious topic with potential implications for decentralization and node operation. Segregated Witness (SegWit): Already implemented, SegWit optimized block space and increased transaction capacity to some extent. Further adoption and optimization can still contribute. Taproot Upgrade: This recent upgrade enhances Bitcoin’s scalability and privacy, potentially contributing to more efficient transaction processing in the long run. Layer-2 Scaling Solutions (Lightning Network): Continued development and adoption of the Lightning Network and other Layer-2 solutions are crucial for offloading transaction volume from the main Bitcoin blockchain and enabling faster, cheaper transactions. Conclusion: Navigating Bitcoin’s Evolving Landscape The surge in Bitcoin confirmation times to a record 19 minutes serves as a stark reminder of the challenges and trade-offs inherent in decentralized, permissionless blockchains. While these delays can be frustrating, they also underscore the importance of ongoing innovation and adaptation within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Understanding the causes behind these Bitcoin transaction delays , exploring Layer-2 solutions, and practicing fee awareness are crucial steps for users to navigate this evolving landscape effectively. As Bitcoin continues to mature, addressing scalability and improving crypto transaction speed will remain paramount for its widespread adoption and usability.

40259567,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=128240,1739412145,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Surprising Ethereum (ETH) Analysis: 4 Reasons Why a Price Rebound is Imminent,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-eth-price-rebound-analysis/,"Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been navigating a complex market landscape recently. Despite facing headwinds like increased token supply and a dip in staking ratios, a recent analysis from CryptoQuant paints a surprisingly optimistic picture. Could ETH be significantly undervalued, poised for a dramatic price rebound? Let’s delve into the insightful analysis that suggests just that, uncovering the key factors that could trigger a bullish resurgence for Ethereum. If you’re watching the crypto markets closely, especially Ethereum’s movements, this analysis reveals potential opportunities you won’t want to miss. Is Ethereum Truly Undervalued at Current Prices? According to CryptoQuant’s analysis, a primary indicator of Ethereum’s potential lies in comparing its market price to its realized price. The realized price essentially represents the average price at which all ETH tokens were last moved on the blockchain. Currently, ETH’s realized price sits around $2,200, significantly lower than its market price hovering around $2,600. This discrepancy is a powerful signal. It suggests that, on average, ETH holders are currently sitting on unrealized profits. Historically, when market prices are substantially above realized prices, it often indicates that an asset is undervalued . Think of it like this: the ‘fair value’ based on past transactions is lower than what the market is currently valuing ETH at. This gap can be a strong foundation for future price appreciation. To illustrate, consider a scenario outside of crypto. Imagine a house in your neighborhood. If similar houses recently sold for an average of $300,000 (realized price), but the current market value of comparable houses is around $350,000 (market price), the house could be considered undervalued and ripe for further price increases as the market catches up to its intrinsic value. This analogy helps understand the fundamental concept of Ethereum being undervalued based on realized price analysis. Why is Growing ‘Permanent Owner’ ETH Holdings a Bullish Sign? Another compelling factor supporting a potential price rebound for Ethereum is the increasing amount of ETH held by ‘permanent owners.’ These are long-term holders who are less likely to sell their ETH during short-term price fluctuations. Think of them as the bedrock of the Ethereum market, providing stability and reducing sell-side pressure. The growth in holdings by these permanent owners is significant because it signals a strong belief in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition. As more ETH gets locked away in these long-term wallets, the circulating supply effectively decreases. This scarcity, coupled with consistent or increasing demand, can create a powerful upward pressure on price. It’s basic supply and demand economics at play. Here’s a breakdown of why this trend is beneficial: Reduced Volatility: Permanent holders are less prone to panic selling during market dips, thus dampening price volatility. Supply Squeeze: As more ETH is held long-term, the available supply for trading reduces, potentially driving prices up. Stronger Market Foundation: A larger base of long-term holders indicates a more mature and confident market. Imagine a company with a large portion of its shares held by institutional investors with a long-term outlook. This scenario is often viewed positively by the market because it suggests confidence in the company’s future and reduces the likelihood of drastic price swings. Similarly, the growth of permanent ETH owners acts as a strong foundation for future Ethereum price rebound . Decreased Futures Market Selling Pressure: A Shift in Sentiment? The futures market provides valuable insights into market sentiment. CryptoQuant’s analysis points to a notable decrease in selling pressure within the Ethereum futures market. This is a significant shift and a potential indicator of strengthening bullish momentum. In futures trading, ‘selling pressure’ is often reflected in metrics like negative funding rates or a high number of short positions. A decrease in this pressure suggests that traders are becoming less bearish (or more bullish) on Ethereum’s future price. This can be driven by various factors, including: Profit Taking on Shorts: Traders who were previously shorting ETH might be closing their positions, reducing sell pressure. Increased Long Positions: A decrease in selling pressure could also mean more traders are opening long positions, betting on a price rebound . Shifting Market Sentiment: Overall market sentiment towards Ethereum might be turning more positive, encouraging buying rather than selling in the futures market. This shift in the futures market is like observing the weather vane changing direction. It suggests a potential change in the prevailing winds of market sentiment, hinting at a possible upward trajectory for Ethereum. When combined with other positive indicators, decreased selling pressure in futures markets strengthens the case for an impending ETH price rebound . Institutional Investors Accumulating ETH: The Smart Money is Moving In? Perhaps one of the most compelling reasons for optimism is the increasing accumulation of ETH by major institutional investors. CryptoQuant highlights BlackRock and Cumberland as key examples of institutions that have been actively increasing their Ethereum holdings during recent price dips. Institutional investment is often considered a strong validation signal in the crypto market. These entities typically conduct thorough due diligence and have a longer-term investment horizon. When giants like BlackRock and Cumberland increase their ETH holdings, it suggests a strong belief in Ethereum’s future potential and its ability to deliver substantial returns. Why is institutional investment so crucial for an Ethereum price rebound ? Benefit of Institutional Investment Explanation Large Capital Inflows Institutions bring significant capital into the market, driving up demand and potentially prices. Increased Legitimacy Institutional participation enhances the legitimacy and maturity of the crypto market, attracting further investment. Long-Term Perspective Institutions often have a longer-term investment horizon, providing stability and reducing short-term volatility. Positive Market Signal Institutional buying activity is often interpreted as a positive signal by the broader market, encouraging retail and other investors to follow suit. The fact that major players like BlackRock and Cumberland are accumulating ETH during market dips is a powerful vote of confidence. It suggests that these institutions see the current prices as attractive entry points and are positioning themselves for potential future gains. This institutional investment is a crucial pillar supporting the thesis of an upcoming ETH price rebound . Navigating Sideways Movement and Macroeconomic Factors While the analysis points to strong underlying bullish factors for Ethereum, it’s important to acknowledge the potential for sideways price movement in the short term. Macroeconomic conditions, such as inflation, interest rate hikes, and global economic uncertainty, can exert downward pressure on all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Therefore, while the fundamental indicators suggest a strong potential for an Ethereum price rebound , external macroeconomic factors could lead to continued volatility and sideways price action in the immediate future. Investors should be prepared for potential market fluctuations and exercise caution while remaining optimistic about the longer-term prospects for ETH. Conclusion: Is Ethereum Primed for a Powerful Rebound? The CryptoQuant analysis presents a compelling case for Ethereum being significantly undervalued and poised for a price rebound . The combination of a lower realized price, increasing permanent owner holdings, decreased futures market selling pressure, and strong institutional accumulation paints a bullish picture. While macroeconomic headwinds might introduce short-term volatility, the underlying fundamentals suggest that Ethereum has strong potential for upward trajectory in the near future. For investors looking at the crypto market, particularly Ethereum, these factors offer a glimmer of hope and a potential opportunity to capitalize on what appears to be an undervalued asset. Keep a close watch on these indicators, and you might just witness the surprising Ethereum price rebound unfold.

The investment bank’s Q4 2024 filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) show an explosive 2,000% jump in their Ethereum ETF holdings , catapulting their investment from $22 million to a substantial $476 million. This bold step by a traditional finance heavyweight like Goldman Sachs is being widely interpreted as a powerful signal of growing institutional confidence in Ethereum and the broader digital asset space. Why the Massive Surge in Goldman Sachs’s Spot ETH ETF Holdings? The sheer scale of Goldman Sachs’s investment – a twenty-fold increase in a single quarter – is grabbing headlines and prompting crucial questions. What’s behind this dramatic pivot towards spot ETH ETF products? Several factors are likely at play, reflecting a confluence of market trends and strategic considerations: Increasing Institutional Acceptance of Crypto: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier in 2024 by the SEC paved the way for greater institutional involvement in crypto. This regulatory milestone has legitimized digital assets in the eyes of many traditional finance players, making investments in Ethereum ETF products like ETHA, FETH, and ETHE more palatable and compliant. Ethereum’s Growing Maturity and Use Cases: Ethereum has solidified its position as the leading smart contract platform, underpinning a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Its ongoing evolution and the anticipation surrounding upgrades like the Dencun upgrade further enhance its investment appeal. Institutions are increasingly recognizing Ethereum’s long-term potential beyond just a store of value. Client Demand for Crypto Exposure: Goldman Sachs, catering to high-net-worth individuals and institutional clients, is likely responding to growing client demand for exposure to the cryptocurrency market. Spot Ethereum ETF s offer a regulated and relatively straightforward way for these clients to gain access to ETH without the complexities of direct digital asset ownership and custody. Strategic Diversification: In a volatile global economic landscape, institutions are constantly seeking diversification to optimize portfolio returns and manage risk. Cryptocurrencies, with their low correlation to traditional assets, can serve as valuable diversifiers. Goldman Sachs’s increased ETH ETF holdings could be part of a broader strategy to diversify its asset allocation and capitalize on the potential upside of the crypto market. Breaking Down the Investment: ETHA, FETH, and ETHE According to the Cointelegraph report, citing the 13F filing, Goldman Sachs strategically allocated its $476 million across three prominent spot Ethereum ETF offerings: ETF Product Issuer Ticker Investment Amount (Approx.) BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust BlackRock ETHA ~$235 million (estimated half of total) Fidelity Ethereum Fund Fidelity FETH ~$235 million (estimated half of total) Grayscale Ethereum Trust Grayscale ETHE ~$6.3 million The even split between BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH suggests a balanced approach, potentially aiming for diversification across ETF providers or reflecting different client preferences. The smaller allocation to Grayscale’s ETHE, which is a converted Ethereum Trust rather than a newly launched ETF, could be due to various factors such as management fees, liquidity, or investment strategy. What Does This Mean for the Future of Spot ETH ETFs and Institutional Crypto Investment? Goldman Sachs’s substantial investment serves as a powerful validation of institutional crypto investment in general, and spot Ethereum ETFs specifically. Here’s why this development is particularly significant: Increased Market Confidence: When a Wall Street titan like Goldman Sachs makes such a bold move, it sends a strong signal to the broader market. It can alleviate concerns among other institutions and high-net-worth investors who might have been hesitant to enter the crypto space. This influx of institutional capital can contribute to greater market stability and maturity. Potential Price Impact on Ethereum: Increased demand from institutional investors can exert upward pressure on the price of Ethereum. As more institutions allocate capital to spot ETH ETF products, the underlying ETH holdings of these ETFs need to be acquired, potentially driving up ETH prices. This bullish scenario could attract further investment and fuel a positive feedback loop. Broader Adoption of Crypto ETFs: Goldman Sachs’s move could encourage other major financial institutions to increase or initiate their own allocations to spot crypto ETFs, both Bitcoin and Ethereum. This broader adoption would further mainstream crypto investments and make them more accessible to a wider range of investors. Evolution of Crypto as an Asset Class: Institutional investments like this reinforce the narrative that cryptocurrencies are evolving from a niche asset class to a mainstream component of diversified investment portfolios. As regulatory frameworks become clearer and institutional infrastructure develops further, we can expect to see even greater participation from traditional finance in the crypto market. Navigating the Evolving Landscape of Ethereum and Crypto Investments While the news of Goldman Sachs’s ETH ETF holdings surge is undoubtedly positive, it’s crucial to approach crypto investments with a balanced perspective. The cryptocurrency market remains inherently volatile, and regulatory landscapes are still evolving. Here are some key considerations for investors: Due Diligence is Paramount: Whether investing in spot Ethereum ETF s or directly in ETH, thorough research is essential. Understand the risks involved, the specific ETF products, their fees, and the underlying assets. Risk Management and Diversification: Crypto investments should be part of a well-diversified portfolio, not the sole focus. Determine your risk tolerance and allocate capital accordingly. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Stay Informed About Regulatory Developments: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is constantly changing. Keep abreast of updates from the SEC and other regulatory bodies, as these developments can significantly impact the market. Long-Term Perspective: Institutional investments often signal a long-term outlook. While short-term price fluctuations are inevitable, focus on the long-term potential of Ethereum and the underlying technology. Conclusion: A Bullish Signal for Ethereum and the Crypto Market Goldman Sachs’s 2000% surge in spot Ethereum ETF holdings is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a resounding endorsement of Ethereum’s growing prominence and the increasing institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies. This massive investment signals a potential shift in the crypto landscape, paving the way for greater mainstream adoption, increased market maturity, and potentially significant price appreciation for Ethereum and other digital assets. As traditional finance giants like Goldman Sachs embrace crypto, the future for this innovative asset class looks increasingly bright.

40259635,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=128177,1739412224,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Strategy Warning: Small Firms Risk Becoming ‘Zombie Companies’ – Shocking Analyst Prediction,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-strategy-small-firms-risk/,"In a surprising turn of events, small businesses are increasingly diving into the world of cryptocurrency, specifically adopting a Bitcoin acquisition strategy pioneered by larger entities like Michael Saylor’s Strategy. This bold move, while potentially lucrative, is raising eyebrows and sparking serious concerns among financial analysts. Is this a revolutionary step towards modernizing corporate finance, or a reckless gamble that could lead to financial ruin? Let’s delve into this intriguing trend and uncover the potential pitfalls. Why are Small Firms Embracing the Bitcoin Strategy for Corporate Treasury? Inspired by the pioneering approach of companies like Strategy, a growing number of small firms are allocating a portion of their corporate treasury to Bitcoin. Data from Coinkite reveals that 78 companies globally are now holding Bitcoin as part of their reserves. But what’s driving this surge in adoption? Here are a few key reasons: Diversification Beyond Traditional Assets: In an era of economic uncertainty, businesses are looking to diversify beyond traditional assets like cash and bonds. Bitcoin, with its uncorrelated nature to traditional markets, offers an alternative avenue for diversification. Inflation Hedge: With inflation on the rise globally, many view Bitcoin as a hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Its limited supply and decentralized nature are seen as attractive qualities in inflationary environments. Boosting Share Value and Investor Appeal: In the crypto-enthusiastic market, holding Bitcoin can be perceived as innovative and forward-thinking, potentially attracting investors and boosting share prices, especially for publicly listed small firms. Future-Proofing Finances: Some businesses believe that embracing digital assets like Bitcoin is a way to future-proof their finances and position themselves at the forefront of technological advancements in finance. The Shadow Side: Risk of ‘Zombie Company’ Status and Bitcoin Holdings While the allure of Bitcoin is undeniable, analysts like Mark Palmer from Benchmark are raising critical concerns. Palmer warns that for small firms, adopting a Bitcoin strategy for their corporate treasury could be a perilous path, potentially leading to the dreaded “zombie company” status. But what exactly are the risks? Increased Financial Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price volatility. Holding a significant portion of treasury in such a volatile asset exposes small firms to substantial financial risks. A sharp downturn in Bitcoin’s price could severely impact their balance sheets. Distraction from Core Business: Managing Bitcoin holdings, understanding market fluctuations, and dealing with crypto-related regulations can divert management’s attention and resources away from the core business operations of small firms. Liquidity Concerns: While Bitcoin is liquid, converting large amounts back to fiat currency quickly, especially during market downturns, might not always be seamless and could incur slippage costs. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Small firms holding Bitcoin face uncertainty regarding future regulations and compliance requirements, which could add complexity and costs. Sign of Underlying Business Weakness?: Palmer’s warning highlights a crucial point: firms with less robust business models might be more inclined to adopt risky strategies like Bitcoin acquisition in a desperate attempt to boost their appeal or stock price. This can be a red flag indicating underlying financial weaknesses. Examples of Firms and Their Bitcoin Corporate Treasury Journey While Coinkite’s data points to 78 companies, specific examples of small firms embracing Bitcoin as corporate treasury are still emerging. It’s important to note that the trend is relatively nascent, and many firms may be hesitant to publicly disclose their Bitcoin holdings due to competitive reasons or regulatory uncertainties. However, the increasing number of companies tracked by Coinkite signals a growing, albeit potentially risky, trend. As the market matures, we are likely to see more case studies emerge, both success stories and cautionary tales. Navigating the Risks: Actionable Insights for Small Firms Considering a Bitcoin Strategy If your small firm is considering dipping its toes into the Bitcoin waters, proceed with caution. Here are some actionable insights to consider to mitigate the risk: Conduct Thorough Due Diligence: Before allocating any capital to Bitcoin, conduct extensive research and understand the intricacies of the cryptocurrency market, including its volatility and regulatory landscape. Define a Clear Strategy and Risk Tolerance: Establish a well-defined Bitcoin strategy with clear objectives, allocation percentages, and risk management protocols. Determine your firm’s risk tolerance and ensure the Bitcoin strategy aligns with it. Start Small and Scale Gradually: Don’t jump in headfirst. Begin with a small allocation to Bitcoin and gradually scale up as you gain experience and confidence, and as your understanding of the market deepens. Seek Expert Advice: Consult with financial advisors and crypto experts to get tailored guidance on implementing a Bitcoin strategy that is appropriate for your firm’s specific circumstances and risk profile. Monitor and Re-evaluate Regularly: The cryptocurrency market is dynamic. Continuously monitor your Bitcoin investments, re-evaluate your strategy regularly, and be prepared to adapt to market changes and evolving regulations. Transparency and Communication: If your firm is publicly listed, ensure transparent communication with investors about your Bitcoin strategy and the associated risks. Will Bitcoin Lead to a Wave of ‘Zombie Companies’? The question remains: will the Bitcoin strategy adopted by small firms truly lead to a surge in “zombie companies”? While the risk is certainly real, it’s not a foregone conclusion. The outcome will depend on various factors, including: Bitcoin Market Performance: Sustained growth in the Bitcoin market could validate the strategy for some firms, while a prolonged bear market could expose vulnerabilities. Risk Management by Firms: How effectively small firms manage the risks associated with Bitcoin holdings will be crucial. Prudent risk management can mitigate the chances of falling into “zombie company” territory. Broader Economic Conditions: The overall economic climate and the performance of traditional markets will also play a role. A strong economy could provide a buffer, while a recession could exacerbate the risks. Ultimately, the adoption of Bitcoin as corporate treasury by small firms is a high-stakes gamble. While the potential rewards are enticing, the risks are equally significant. Firms must tread carefully, conduct thorough due diligence, and prioritize sound risk management to avoid the dreaded “zombie company” fate. The analyst’s warning serves as a crucial reminder of the potential downsides of this emerging trend.

Understanding market sentiment is crucial, and one powerful tool in your arsenal is the Bitcoin long-short ratio. This metric offers a glimpse into the collective positioning of traders in the perpetual futures market, helping you gauge whether the majority are leaning bullish or bearish on Bitcoin. Let’s dive into the latest 24-hour Bitcoin long-short ratio data and decode what it means for you. Decoding the 24-Hour BTC Futures Long-Short Ratio For the past 24 hours, the overall Bitcoin long-short ratio across major cryptocurrency exchanges paints a picture of near equilibrium. Here’s the snapshot: Total: Long 49.46%; Short 50.54% This data suggests a very slight bearish sentiment prevails across the entire tracked market, with short positions marginally outweighing long positions. However, to get a more granular view, let’s examine the top exchanges individually. Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio Breakdown by Exchange Analyzing individual exchanges provides deeper insights into where traders are placing their bets. Here’s a look at the Bitcoin long-short ratio on three leading platforms: Binance: Long 49.71%; Short 50.29% Bybit: Long 48.89%; Short 51.11% Bitget: Long 50.54%; Short 49.46% As you can see, the ratios are remarkably close across these top exchanges. Binance and Bybit show a slightly higher inclination towards short positions, while Bitget leans marginally towards long positions. The differences, however, are minimal, reinforcing the overall picture of a market in relative balance regarding BTC futures . Why is the Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio Important for Crypto Traders? Understanding the Bitcoin long-short ratio offers several benefits for crypto traders: Gauge Market Sentiment: The ratio acts as a sentiment indicator. A significantly higher long ratio might suggest excessive bullishness (potential market top), while a high short ratio could indicate extreme fear (potential bottom). Identify Potential Reversals: Extreme long or short ratios can sometimes precede market reversals. For example, if everyone is long, there might be fewer buyers left to push prices higher, increasing the likelihood of a correction. Confirmation Tool: Use the ratio to confirm signals from other technical indicators or fundamental analysis. If your analysis suggests a bullish move, and the long ratio is also increasing, it can add conviction to your trade. Risk Management: Understanding the prevailing sentiment can help you manage risk. Knowing if the market is heavily leaning in one direction can inform your position sizing and stop-loss placement. Navigating Perpetual Futures with Long-Short Ratios Perpetual futures are derivative contracts that, unlike traditional futures, do not have an expiry date. This makes them popular for traders who want to hold positions for longer durations or engage in strategies like hedging. The Bitcoin long-short ratio is particularly relevant for perpetual futures because it reflects the ongoing sentiment and positioning in these contracts. Here’s how to effectively use the Bitcoin long-short ratio when trading perpetual futures: Monitor Trends: Track the ratio over time. A consistent increase in the long ratio could signal growing bullishness, while a rising short ratio might indicate increasing bearishness. Compare Across Exchanges: Look for discrepancies in ratios across different exchanges. Significant variations could highlight localized sentiment or potential arbitrage opportunities. Combine with Other Data: Don’t rely solely on the long-short ratio. Use it in conjunction with price action, volume analysis, open interest, and other on-chain metrics for a comprehensive market view. Challenges in Interpreting Crypto Market Sentiment While the Bitcoin long-short ratio is a valuable tool, it’s important to acknowledge its limitations: Exchange Specific Data: The reported ratios are usually specific to individual exchanges. The total ratio is an aggregation, but it might not represent the entire global market perfectly. Lagging Indicator: Like many sentiment indicators, the long-short ratio is somewhat lagging. It reflects past positioning and might not predict immediate future price movements. Manipulation Potential: In less regulated markets, there’s always a potential for manipulation. Large players could potentially influence the ratio to create misleading signals, although this is less likely on major, reputable exchanges. Context is Key: The interpretation of the ratio depends heavily on market context. A 60% long ratio in a bull market might be normal, but the same ratio in a bear market could be considered excessively bullish and risky. Actionable Insights for Bitcoin Trading So, what actionable insights can we derive from the current Bitcoin long-short ratio data? Neutral Market Stance: The near 50/50 split suggests a market in indecision. Traders are not overwhelmingly bullish or bearish at this moment. Cautious Trading: In such balanced conditions, consider adopting a more cautious trading approach. Avoid over-leveraging and be prepared for potential volatility in either direction. Focus on Price Action: Pay close attention to price action and technical patterns. In a neutral sentiment environment, price movements might be more technically driven. Monitor for Shifts: Keep an eye on how the Bitcoin long-short ratio evolves over the coming hours and days. A significant shift towards either long or short could signal the beginning of a new trend. Conclusion: Staying Informed in the Crypto Landscape In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency trading, staying informed is paramount. The Bitcoin long-short ratio for BTC futures provides a valuable snapshot of market sentiment, helping you understand the collective positioning of traders. By monitoring this metric, along with other market indicators, you can enhance your trading strategy and navigate the exciting, yet challenging, crypto landscape with greater confidence. Remember to always conduct thorough research and consider your own risk tolerance before making any trading decisions. The current data suggests a balanced market, but vigilance and continuous analysis are key to success in crypto trading.

40259669,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=128282,1739412323,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Move: Toyota Finance Issues Corporate Bonds as Security Tokens in Japan,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/toyota-finance-security-tokens-japan/,"In a groundbreaking move that signals a significant shift in traditional finance, Toyota Financial Services (TFS), the financial powerhouse behind the globally recognized Toyota automotive brand, is diving headfirst into the world of blockchain technology. They are set to issue corporate bonds in the innovative form of security tokens . This exciting development, slated for March 3rd, is not just a solo venture; it’s a collaborative symphony of financial giants including Daiwa Securities, MUFG Bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation, and the blockchain platform Progmat. Let’s delve into what this means for the future of finance and why this is a game-changer you need to know about. What are Security Tokens and Why Toyota is Choosing Them? Security tokens are essentially digital representations of traditional financial securities, like stocks or bonds, but they live on a blockchain. Think of them as the next evolution of financial assets, bringing together the security of regulated securities with the efficiency and transparency of blockchain technology. But why are established giants like Toyota Financial Services choosing this route? Enhanced Efficiency and Speed: Blockchain technology promises faster settlement times and streamlined processes compared to traditional bond issuance. Imagine transactions settling in minutes rather than days! Increased Accessibility: Security tokens can potentially lower the barrier to entry for investors, allowing for fractional ownership and broader market participation. This could open up corporate bond investments to a wider range of investors. Improved Transparency: Every transaction on the blockchain is recorded and immutable, offering a higher level of transparency for both issuers and investors. This reduces information asymmetry and builds trust. Reduced Costs: By automating many manual processes involved in traditional bond issuance, security tokens can lead to significant cost savings for issuers like Toyota Finance. For Toyota Finance, a company synonymous with innovation and efficiency in the automotive industry, embracing security tokens for corporate bond issuance aligns perfectly with their ethos. It’s a bold step into the future of finance, showcasing their commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technology. The Power of Tokenization in Corporate Finance The process of converting rights to an asset into a digital token is known as tokenization . This isn’t just about creating digital versions of existing assets; it’s about unlocking new possibilities and efficiencies within the financial system. In the context of corporate bonds, tokenization offers a plethora of benefits: Benefit Description Impact on Corporate Bonds Fractional Ownership Tokens can be divided into smaller units, allowing multiple investors to own a fraction of a bond. Democratizes investment, enabling smaller investors to participate in corporate bond markets. 24/7 Trading Blockchain-based assets can be traded around the clock, unlike traditional markets with set hours. Increases liquidity and provides flexibility for global investors. Smart Contracts Automated contracts embedded in the blockchain can streamline processes like interest payments and maturity payouts. Reduces administrative overhead and ensures timely and accurate payments. Global Reach Security tokens can be accessible to investors worldwide, expanding the investor base for corporate bonds. Facilitates cross-border investments and diversifies funding sources. Toyota Finance’s foray into tokenization of corporate bonds is a testament to the transformative potential of this technology in reshaping corporate finance. It’s about making financial instruments more accessible, efficient, and globally connected. Blockchain: The Backbone of Security Token Issuance At the heart of this revolution lies blockchain technology. A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and immutable ledger that records transactions in blocks linked together chronologically. This technology provides the infrastructure for security tokens to operate securely and transparently. Key features of blockchain that make it ideal for security token issuance: Decentralization: No single entity controls the blockchain, reducing the risk of censorship or single points of failure. Immutability: Once a transaction is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring data integrity and trust. Transparency: Transaction records are publicly auditable (depending on the type of blockchain), enhancing transparency and accountability. Security: Cryptographic techniques secure the blockchain network, making it highly resistant to fraud and hacking. By leveraging blockchain , Toyota Finance and its partners are building a robust and secure foundation for their security token issuance, ensuring investor confidence and operational efficiency. Why Japan is Becoming a Hotspot for Security Tokens Japan is emerging as a progressive hub for blockchain innovation and digital asset adoption, creating a fertile ground for security token initiatives like Toyota’s. Several factors contribute to Japan’s growing prominence in this space: Pro-regulatory Environment: The Japanese government has been proactive in establishing clear regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies and digital assets, providing legal clarity and fostering innovation. Tech-Savvy Population: Japan has a high level of technological adoption and a population comfortable with digital innovations, creating a receptive market for security tokens. Financial Innovation Focus: Japanese financial institutions are increasingly exploring and investing in fintech solutions, including blockchain and digital assets, to enhance their services and competitiveness. Strong Financial Infrastructure: Japan boasts a robust financial infrastructure and a deep pool of institutional investors, creating a supportive ecosystem for the growth of the security token market. Toyota Finance launching its security token corporate bonds in Japan is strategically significant, capitalizing on the country’s favorable regulatory landscape and vibrant fintech ecosystem. This move could inspire other Japanese corporations to explore security token offerings. The Collaborative Effort: Key Players Behind Toyota’s Security Token Bonds The success of Toyota Finance’s security token issuance hinges on the collaborative expertise of several key players: Toyota Financial Services (TFS): As the issuer, TFS is taking the pioneering step to tokenize its corporate bonds, demonstrating leadership in financial innovation. Daiwa Securities: A leading Japanese securities firm, Daiwa Securities brings its expertise in traditional bond markets and regulatory compliance to the security token offering. MUFG Bank & Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation: These banking giants provide crucial banking and trust services, ensuring the seamless integration of security tokens within the existing financial infrastructure. Progmat: As a blockchain platform provider, Progmat offers the technological backbone for issuing and managing security tokens, ensuring a secure and efficient platform. This collaborative approach highlights the importance of partnerships between traditional financial institutions and blockchain technology providers to drive the adoption of security tokens in mainstream finance. Looking Ahead: The Future of Corporate Bonds and Security Tokens Toyota Financial Services’ venture into security token corporate bonds is more than just a single issuance; it’s a potential catalyst for wider adoption of security tokens in the corporate bond market globally. While challenges remain, such as regulatory harmonization across jurisdictions and educating investors about this new asset class, the benefits are undeniable. Potential Future Developments: Increased Institutional Adoption: As regulatory clarity improves and success stories like Toyota’s emerge, more institutional investors are likely to allocate capital to security tokens. Expansion to Other Asset Classes: The tokenization framework proven with corporate bonds could extend to other asset classes, such as real estate, private equity, and commodities. Development of Secondary Markets: Robust secondary markets for security tokens will be crucial for liquidity and price discovery, further enhancing their attractiveness to investors. Integration with DeFi: The intersection of security tokens and decentralized finance (DeFi) could unlock new possibilities for yield generation and innovative financial products. Conclusion: A Bold Step into the Tokenized Future Toyota Financial Services’ issuance of corporate bonds as security tokens is a revolutionary move that underscores the growing convergence of traditional finance and blockchain technology. By embracing tokenization and leveraging the power of blockchain , Toyota Finance is not just issuing bonds; they are paving the way for a more efficient, transparent, and accessible financial future. This development in Japan signals a pivotal moment for the security tokens market and the broader adoption of digital assets in corporate finance.

Navigating CPI-Driven Crypto Volatility for Epic Rebound,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-cpi-crypto-volatility-rebound/,"Get ready for a rollercoaster ride in the crypto market! Bitcoin (BTC), the king of cryptocurrencies, is bracing for potential turbulence as the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report looms large. Market analysts are predicting increased crypto volatility , and for savvy investors, understanding these potential swings is key to navigating the market successfully. Let’s dive into what experts are saying and how you can prepare for what might come next. Why is the CPI Report Triggering Bitcoin Price Volatility? The upcoming release of the U.S. CPI report is sending ripples through the financial markets, and the cryptocurrency sector is no exception. Why? Because the CPI is a crucial indicator of inflation. Here’s a breakdown: Inflation Gauge: The CPI measures the average change in prices consumers pay for a basket of goods and services over time. It’s a primary way to track inflation. Federal Reserve Response: Higher-than-expected inflation figures can prompt the Federal Reserve (the Fed) to take action, often by raising interest rates to cool down the economy. Market Sensitivity: Cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin price , are sensitive to macroeconomic factors. Interest rate hikes can impact investor sentiment, often leading to shifts in investment strategies and potentially causing market downturns. Uncertainty Breeds Volatility: Anticipation surrounding the CPI report, especially if there’s uncertainty about the figures, naturally leads to increased crypto volatility as traders react to potential scenarios. According to Yann Allemann and Jan Happel, the co-founders of Glassnode and prominent voices on X (formerly Twitter) under the handle Negentropic, we should anticipate exactly this: heightened market volatility. They foresee inflation data potentially exceeding expectations, which could inject significant uncertainty into the market. This anticipation is already contributing to the current market sentiment. Decoding the Bitcoin Price Dip and Rebound Scenario Negentropic’s analysis suggests a specific scenario for Bitcoin price action in response to the CPI report. Let’s break down their prediction: Current Bitcoin Stance: Bitcoin is currently hovering around the $95,000 mark. Potential Dip Zone: They anticipate a possible, albeit brief, dip in Bitcoin price to the $92,000–$94,000 range. This dip is expected as the market absorbs liquidity, meaning there might be a temporary decrease in buying pressure. Bullish Reversal Opportunity: Crucially, this dip is viewed as a potential setup for a BTC rebound . If the predicted scenario unfolds, it could pave the way for a bullish reversal. Key Resistance Levels: The analysts highlight the $97,000–$98,500 zone as a critical level for Bitcoin to reclaim. Overcoming this resistance is seen as essential for a sustained upward movement. $100,000 Target in Sight: Successfully breaching the $97,000–$98,500 range could reignite bullish momentum, potentially setting the stage for Bitcoin to target the coveted $100,000 milestone. Actionable Insights: Navigating Crypto Volatility and Potential Rebound So, how can you, as a crypto enthusiast or investor, navigate this potentially volatile period and position yourself for a potential BTC rebound ? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on the CPI report release and subsequent market reactions. Reputable crypto news sources and analytical platforms will provide real-time updates and expert commentary. Manage Risk: Crypto volatility is inherent in the market. Avoid over-leveraging and ensure your portfolio allocation aligns with your risk tolerance. Consider diversifying your crypto holdings. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For long-term investors, DCA can be a prudent strategy during periods of volatility. Instead of trying to time the market bottom, DCA involves investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of price fluctuations. This can smooth out your entry price over time. Prepare for Opportunities: If the predicted dip to the $92,000–$94,000 range materializes, it could present a buying opportunity for those who believe in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. However, always conduct thorough research and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Monitor Key Levels: Pay close attention to the $97,000–$98,500 resistance zone. A decisive break above this level could signal the start of a more significant bullish move towards $100,000 and beyond. Bitcoin analysis is crucial: Utilize technical analysis tools and on-chain metrics to gain a deeper understanding of market trends and potential price movements. Platforms like Glassnode (co-founded by the analysts mentioned) offer valuable data and insights.

The Road Ahead: Riding the Waves of Crypto Volatility The cryptocurrency market, and Bitcoin price specifically, is known for its dynamic nature. The upcoming CPI report is just one factor that can introduce periods of crypto volatility . Understanding these potential market swings, staying informed, and having a well-thought-out strategy are crucial for navigating the crypto landscape successfully. While short-term dips can be unnerving, they can also present opportunities for those prepared to act strategically. The potential for a BTC rebound after a CPI-driven dip is a scenario that many market participants are watching closely. Whether this prediction materializes or not, the key takeaway is to remain adaptable and informed in the ever-evolving world of crypto.

40259671,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=128296,1739412394,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Critical Bitcoin Price Test: Can BTC Conquer the $97.2K Resistance?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-resistance-analysis/,"Bitcoin (BTC), the king of cryptocurrencies, is currently navigating a crucial juncture in its price journey. Data from IntoTheBlock reveals a significant hurdle: a robust resistance level looming large at $97,200. This isn’t just an arbitrary number; it represents the average purchase price for a substantial 1.57 million BTC held by approximately 1.6 million addresses. What does this mean for Bitcoin’s next move? Let’s dive into this fascinating crypto market analysis. Decoding the Bitcoin Price Resistance at $97.2K So, why is $97,200 such a critical level for Bitcoin right now? It all boils down to basic market psychology. Imagine you bought Bitcoin at an average of $97,200. The price then dropped, putting you in the red. As the price climbs back up towards your purchase price, you’re likely thinking about breaking even. This is the scenario for a large number of Bitcoin holders right now. IntoTheBlock’s data highlights this perfectly. A massive 1.57 million BTC is held by addresses that bought in around this price point. These holders, currently underwater on their investment, represent potential selling pressure. As Bitcoin approaches $97,200, many of these holders might decide to sell to recoup their initial investment or minimize losses. This influx of sell orders creates significant resistance, making it harder for Bitcoin to push through and reach new highs. Why is This Bitcoin Resistance Level So Strong? The strength of this resistance isn’t just about individual sellers; it’s a confluence of factors: Psychological Breakeven Point: As mentioned, for many holders, $97,200 is their breakeven point. Human psychology often dictates that people are more inclined to sell at breakeven to avoid further losses or simply to exit a losing position with their capital intact. Large Volume of BTC: The sheer volume of BTC involved – 1.57 million – is substantial. This isn’t a small pocket of holders; it’s a significant portion of the Bitcoin supply. When such a large group is potentially looking to sell, it naturally creates strong downward pressure. Market Dynamics: Resistance levels are self-fulfilling prophecies to some extent. Traders and algorithms identify these levels and often place sell orders around them, anticipating a price rejection. This further reinforces the resistance. [img src=”image-placeholder.jpg” alt=”Bitcoin Price Resistance at $97.2K”] Crypto Market Analysis: Beyond the $97.2K Hurdle Understanding this Bitcoin resistance level is crucial for broader crypto market analysis. Bitcoin’s price action often sets the tone for the entire cryptocurrency market. If Bitcoin struggles to break through this resistance, it could lead to: Market Consolidation: A prolonged period of price consolidation around the $97,200 level, as bulls and bears battle for control. Potential Pullback: If selling pressure intensifies, Bitcoin could experience a pullback, potentially testing lower support levels. Altcoin Impact: Bitcoin’s struggles could negatively impact altcoins, as the broader market sentiment might turn cautious. However, if Bitcoin successfully breaks through this resistance, it could signal a strong bullish continuation, potentially paving the way for new all-time highs. The crypto market is notoriously volatile, and anything can happen, but understanding these key resistance levels provides valuable insights. BTC Price Prediction: Breakout or Breakdown? Predicting the future of Bitcoin price with certainty is impossible, but we can analyze the potential scenarios based on this resistance level: Scenario Probability Market Impact Key Indicators to Watch Bullish Breakout (BTC breaks above $97.2K decisively) Medium Positive. Potential for significant upward momentum, altcoin rally. Strong buying volume, positive news flow, breaking through resistance with conviction. Rejection at Resistance (BTC fails to break $97.2K) Medium Negative to Neutral. Potential for price consolidation or pullback, cautious market sentiment. Increased selling volume near $97.2K, failure to sustain prices above this level. Prolonged Consolidation (BTC trades sideways around $97.2K) Low to Medium Neutral. Market indecision, potential for sideways trading in the short term. Balanced buying and selling volume, lack of clear directional momentum. Ultimately, the direction of Bitcoin’s price will depend on a multitude of factors, including overall market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and institutional adoption. However, the $97.2K resistance level is undoubtedly a significant point of contention right now. The Role of Bitcoin Holders at $97.2K The behavior of Bitcoin holders around this $97.2K price point is critical. Are they going to succumb to selling pressure, or will they hold strong and allow Bitcoin to break through? Here’s what to consider about these Bitcoin holders: Profit-Taking vs. Holding Strong: Some holders may see reaching their breakeven point as an opportunity to take profit, especially given the volatility of the crypto market. Others, particularly long-term holders, might see this as a temporary hurdle and remain confident in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Market Sentiment Influence: The actions of these holders will significantly influence market sentiment. If they collectively decide to sell, it could create a negative feedback loop, further pushing the price down. Conversely, if they hold, it strengthens the base for a potential breakout. Broader Market Context: Their decisions are also likely influenced by the broader market context. Positive news and overall bullish sentiment might encourage them to hold, while negative news or market uncertainty could trigger selling. Conclusion: Navigating the $97.2K Bitcoin Crossroads Bitcoin’s journey to new heights faces a significant test at the $97.2K resistance level. The data from IntoTheBlock clearly highlights the potential selling pressure from a large cohort of holders looking to break even. Whether Bitcoin can overcome this hurdle will depend on a complex interplay of market dynamics, holder behavior, and broader economic factors. For investors and traders, closely monitoring Bitcoin’s price action around $97.2K and observing market reactions will be crucial in the coming days and weeks. This critical juncture could very well determine the short-term trajectory of Bitcoin and the wider crypto market.

The often volatile and unpredictable cryptocurrency market is showing signs of maturity, with a noticeable change in investor behavior. Forget the fleeting frenzy of meme coins – smart money is now flowing towards the foundational pillars of the crypto world: Bitcoin and robust layer-1 networks . Let’s dive into this exciting development and understand what it means for the future of crypto investments. What’s Driving Crypto Investors Away from Meme Coins? According to recent insights from on-chain analytics platform Santiment, the crypto community is experiencing a significant pivot. Investors are increasingly turning their attention away from the high-risk, high-reward game of meme coins and refocusing on assets perceived as more stable and fundamentally sound. This trend is clearly highlighted by the declining interest in once-popular meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe. But what’s causing this change of heart? Meme Coin Mania is Cooling Down: The initial hype and novelty surrounding meme coins, often driven by social media trends and celebrity endorsements, are naturally waning. Investors are realizing that quick riches are rarely sustainable, and the inherent volatility of meme coins presents significant risks. Search for Real Utility: As the crypto market matures, investors are becoming more discerning. They are seeking projects that offer tangible utility, solve real-world problems, and demonstrate long-term growth potential. This naturally leads them towards assets like Bitcoin and layer-1 networks that underpin the entire crypto ecosystem. Market Correction and Risk Aversion: Market corrections and economic uncertainties often drive investors towards safer havens. In the crypto space, while still volatile compared to traditional assets, Bitcoin and established layer-1 networks are generally considered less risky than highly speculative meme coins. The Allure of Bitcoin and Layer-1 Networks: Why the Strategic Shift? So, why are crypto investors gravitating towards Bitcoin and layer-1 networks ? It boils down to a quest for substance and sustainable growth. These assets offer a compelling alternative to the meme coin frenzy, grounded in technology, utility, and broader market adoption. Bitcoin: The Digital Gold Standard Bitcoin , the original cryptocurrency, remains the king for a reason. Its benefits are well-documented and continue to attract investors: Store of Value: Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a digital store of value, similar to gold, offering a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Its scarcity (limited to 21 million coins) is a key driver of this perception. Market Dominance and Liquidity: Bitcoin boasts the highest market capitalization and liquidity in the crypto market. This makes it a relatively safer and more accessible entry point for institutional and retail investors alike. Established Infrastructure: After over a decade, Bitcoin has a well-established infrastructure, including exchanges, wallets, and custody solutions, making it easier and safer to buy, hold, and transact with. Layer-1 Networks: The Foundation of the Crypto Ecosystem Layer-1 networks , such as Ethereum, Solana, Toncoin, and Cardano, are the foundational blockchains that support the entire decentralized ecosystem. They are the platforms upon which decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi protocols, and NFTs are built. Their appeal to crypto investors stems from: Utility and Innovation: These networks are constantly evolving and innovating, driving real-world use cases through smart contracts, scalability solutions, and diverse applications. Ethereum, for instance, is the backbone of DeFi and NFTs, while Solana is known for its speed and low transaction fees. Growth Potential: As the demand for decentralized applications and services grows, the value of these layer-1 networks is expected to increase. They are essential infrastructure, and their native tokens often appreciate as their ecosystems expand. Staking and Yield Opportunities: Many layer-1 networks offer staking mechanisms, allowing holders to earn passive income by participating in network security and validation. This provides an additional incentive for long-term holding. Examples of Layer-1 Networks Gaining Investor Attention Let’s take a closer look at some of the layer-1 networks attracting significant investor interest: Layer-1 Network Key Features Why Investors are Interested Ethereum (ETH) Smart contracts, largest dApp ecosystem, DeFi and NFT leader Dominant platform, massive developer community, continuous upgrades (like the Merge) Solana (SOL) High speed, low fees, scalable, growing DeFi and NFT ecosystem Efficient and cost-effective transactions, attracting projects seeking performance Cardano (ADA) Research-driven, focus on security and sustainability, strong community Rigorous development process, long-term vision, emphasis on scalability and interoperability Toncoin (TON) Fast transactions, Telegram integration, user-friendly, growing ecosystem Seamless integration with Telegram’s massive user base, potential for widespread adoption Is This a Healthier Market Cycle?

Recent analysis suggests Bitcoin, the bellwether cryptocurrency, is at a critical juncture. A prominent market analyst is sounding the alarm, indicating that a significant Bitcoin sell-off could be on the horizon if a key support level crumbles. Let’s dive into the details and understand what this means for your crypto portfolio. Decoding the Bitcoin Price Analysis: What’s the Current Market Sentiment? According to Adam, a macro researcher from Greeks.live, the prevailing market sentiment is leaning towards bearish. This observation, shared on X (formerly Twitter), highlights a crucial shift in trader behavior. Instead of bullish optimism, we’re seeing traders actively closing their long positions. But what exactly does this mean? Closing Long Positions: In simple terms, traders who had bet on Bitcoin’s price going up (long positions) are now exiting these positions. This suggests a lack of confidence in immediate upward price movement and potentially anticipates a price decrease. Weak Price Trends: This bearish sentiment is further fueled by weak price trends. Bitcoin hasn’t been showing strong upward momentum, leading traders to believe that the price might stagnate or decline further. Overall Market Uncertainty: The combination of these factors contributes to an overall sense of uncertainty and caution within the crypto market. This bearish outlook forms the backdrop for the analyst’s crucial warning regarding a critical Bitcoin support level. The Critical Bitcoin Support Level: $92K–$94K – A Line in the Sand? Adam points to a key support level around $95,000 that has been tested recently. However, the truly critical zone lies slightly lower, between $92,000 and $94,000. Why is this range so important, and what could happen if it breaks? Why is the $92K–$94K Zone a Potential Trigger for a Bitcoin Sell-Off? Support levels in trading act as floors, areas where buying interest is expected to outweigh selling pressure, preventing further price declines. However, if a support level is decisively broken, it signals a shift in market dynamics. In the context of this Bitcoin sell-off warning, here’s what a break below $92K–$94K could signify: Triggering Stop-Loss Orders: Many traders place stop-loss orders just below key support levels to limit potential losses. If Bitcoin’s price falls below $94K and then $92K, these stop-loss orders could be triggered, automatically initiating sell orders. Increased Selling Pressure: As stop-loss orders execute, they add to the existing selling pressure. This can create a snowball effect, leading to a rapid and potentially massive sell-off as more and more traders rush to exit their positions. Psychological Impact: Breaking a significant support level can also have a negative psychological impact on the market. It can reinforce bearish sentiment, leading to further selling based on fear and panic. Therefore, the $92,000–$94,000 zone isn’t just another price point; it’s a potential tipping point that could exacerbate selling pressure and lead to a significant downward move for Bitcoin. Hope on the Horizon? Examining Potential Rebound Factors in the Crypto Market Despite the bearish warnings, the analysis isn’t entirely devoid of hope. Adam also highlights a potentially bullish counterpoint: significant buy orders lurking just below the surface. What are these buy orders, and could they prevent a Bitcoin sell-off ? Large Buy Orders: A Safety Net or a False Dawn? The report mentions substantial buy orders totaling around 900 BTC positioned between current price levels and $98,000. This is a noteworthy observation because: Demand at Lower Prices: These buy orders indicate that there is still significant demand for Bitcoin at lower price levels. Large investors or institutions might be looking to accumulate Bitcoin if the price dips. Potential for a Rapid Rebound: If these buy orders are strong enough, they could absorb selling pressure and potentially trigger a rapid rebound. Imagine a scenario where the price dips slightly, triggers some stop-losses, but then encounters a wall of buying demand – this could lead to a sharp reversal. Low Volume and Volatility Context: The current market conditions, characterized by low volume and volatility (around 45-48%), are also important. In a low-volume environment, large buy orders can have a more pronounced impact on price movement. However, it’s crucial to remember that the presence of buy orders doesn’t guarantee a rebound. Market dynamics are complex, and several factors can influence the ultimate price direction. The CPI Release and Options Activity: What’s Next for the Crypto Market? Adding another layer of complexity to the current situation is the upcoming release of the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI). This economic data release is a closely watched indicator of inflation and can significantly impact financial markets, including the crypto market . How does the CPI and options activity factor into the Bitcoin outlook? CPI Release: A Potential Catalyst for Volatility The CPI release can act as a catalyst for increased volatility in the crypto market. Here’s why: Inflation Expectations: The CPI data provides insights into inflation trends. Higher-than-expected inflation could lead to expectations of more aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, which can be negative for risk assets like Bitcoin. Market Reaction: The market’s reaction to the CPI data is often swift and significant. Depending on whether the data is perceived as positive or negative, we could see sharp price swings in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Options Positioning: The analyst notes that options activity suggests traders are adjusting their positions ahead of the CPI release. This implies that traders are anticipating potential volatility and are positioning themselves to profit from or hedge against price fluctuations. Therefore, the CPI release is a key event to watch in the coming days. It could either exacerbate bearish sentiment or provide a catalyst for a potential rebound, depending on the data and market interpretation. Navigating the Volatile Bitcoin Landscape: Key Takeaways and Actionable Insights The current Bitcoin price analysis paints a picture of uncertainty and potential volatility. While a Bitcoin sell-off remains a possibility if the $92K–$94K support breaks, there are also factors that could support a rebound. So, what are the key takeaways and actionable insights for crypto enthusiasts and investors? Key Observation Potential Implication Actionable Insight Bearish market sentiment and closing of long positions Increased risk of downward price pressure Exercise caution, consider risk management strategies like setting stop-loss orders. Critical support zone at $92K–$94K Break below could trigger a significant sell-off Closely monitor price action around this level. Be prepared for potential volatility. Large buy orders between current levels and $98K Potential for a rebound if support holds or dip is shallow Don’t rule out the possibility of a positive price reversal. Look for signs of buying strength. Upcoming CPI release Increased market volatility expected Stay informed about economic data releases. Be prepared for potential price swings and adjust trading strategies accordingly. In conclusion, the Bitcoin market is at a fascinating crossroads. The analyst’s warning of a potential massive sell-off if the crucial support breaks is a serious consideration. However, the presence of significant buy orders and the upcoming CPI release introduce elements of uncertainty and potential for both downside and upside volatility. Navigating this landscape requires vigilance, informed decision-making, and a robust risk management strategy.

The ever-optimistic Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Investment Management, has dropped another bombshell Bitcoin price prediction that’s sending ripples through the financial world. If you thought previous forecasts were ambitious, prepare to have your mind blown. Wood now envisions Bitcoin potentially hitting a staggering $1.5 million by 2030. Let’s dive deep into this explosive forecast and explore what it means for the future of digital gold. Cathie Wood’s Jaw-Dropping $1.5 Million Bitcoin Price Prediction In a recent video update on Ark Investment’s official YouTube channel, Cathie Wood reiterated her bullish stance on Bitcoin, not just as a digital asset, but as a burgeoning Bitcoin institutional adoption story. She boldly stated that Bitcoin could skyrocket to $1.5 million by the end of the decade. This isn’t just a casual guess; it’s a projection rooted in Ark Invest’s research and conviction in Bitcoin’s evolving role in the global financial landscape. For those who follow Wood’s pronouncements, this isn’t entirely new territory. Back in December 2023, in an interview with CNBC, she already hinted at this possibility. At the time, her base case was a Bitcoin price prediction of over $600,000 before 2030, but she also laid out a more optimistic scenario – the very $1.5 million figure that’s now capturing headlines. Here’s a quick recap of Cathie Wood’s evolving Bitcoin 2030 price targets: Date Prediction Source December 2023 Base Case: $600,000+ by 2030 CNBC Interview Present Optimistic Case: $1.5 Million by 2030 Ark Investment YouTube Channel So, what’s fueling this incredible optimism? Let’s break down the key factors driving Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest Bitcoin thesis. The Power of Institutional Adoption for Bitcoin’s Price Surge The core of Wood’s argument rests on the accelerating Bitcoin institutional adoption . She emphasizes that Bitcoin is no longer a fringe asset class but is rapidly maturing into a mainstream component of institutional portfolios. This shift is crucial because institutional investors bring in significantly larger capital flows compared to retail investors alone. Imagine pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and major corporations allocating even a small percentage of their vast assets to Bitcoin – the impact on demand and price would be substantial. Here’s why institutional interest is a game-changer: Increased Legitimacy: Institutional involvement validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset, reducing perceived risk and attracting even more institutions. Larger Capital Inflows: Institutions manage trillions of dollars. Even a small allocation can inject billions into the Bitcoin market, driving up prices. Long-Term Investment Horizon: Institutions often have longer investment horizons, reducing short-term volatility and creating a more stable and mature market. Diversification Benefits: Bitcoin offers diversification benefits due to its low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds, making it attractive for portfolio diversification strategies. Wood highlights that while a $1.5 million Bitcoin price prediction might sound outlandish, the probability of it materializing has actually increased. This is largely due to the growing acceptance and integration of Bitcoin into the traditional financial system. Bitcoin as an Institutional Asset Class: Benefits and Challenges The journey of Bitcoin to becoming a fully recognized Bitcoin institutional adoption asset class is not without its hurdles. Let’s examine both the compelling benefits and the potential challenges: Benefits of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption: Inflation Hedge: In an era of potential inflationary pressures, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a store of value and a hedge against inflation, similar to gold but with digital advantages. Diversification: As mentioned earlier, Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional markets offers valuable diversification benefits, reducing overall portfolio risk. Potential for High Returns: The upside potential of Bitcoin, as highlighted by Wood’s Bitcoin price prediction , offers the prospect of significant returns, attractive in a low-yield environment. Decentralization and Security: Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and robust cryptography offer security and censorship resistance, appealing to institutions seeking assets outside traditional financial systems. Challenges of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption: Volatility: Bitcoin remains a volatile asset, which can be a concern for risk-averse institutions. However, as the market matures and institutional participation grows, volatility is expected to decrease over time. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Clarity and consistent regulations are crucial for widespread institutional adoption. Custody and Security Concerns: Institutions require robust and secure custody solutions for managing large Bitcoin holdings. The development of institutional-grade custody services is essential. Environmental Concerns: Bitcoin’s energy consumption has been a point of criticism. However, efforts are underway to transition towards more sustainable mining practices, and institutions are increasingly focusing on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors. Is a $1.5 Million Bitcoin Price Prediction Realistic by 2030? The million-dollar question (or rather, the $1.5 million question!) is: can Bitcoin 2030 really reach this price target? While no one has a crystal ball, let’s consider some factors that could contribute to or hinder this ambitious forecast. Factors Supporting a $1.5 Million Bitcoin Price: Continued Institutional Adoption: If institutional adoption accelerates as Wood predicts, the demand-side pressure could be immense. Limited Supply: Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins creates inherent scarcity. As demand increases and supply remains fixed, prices are likely to rise. Halving Events: Bitcoin’s halving events, which reduce the reward for mining new blocks, further constrain supply over time, historically leading to price surges. Global Economic Uncertainty: In times of economic uncertainty, geopolitical instability, or currency devaluation, Bitcoin’s safe-haven appeal could strengthen. Technological Advancements: Improvements in Bitcoin’s scalability, security, and usability could further drive adoption and value. Potential Headwinds for Bitcoin Price Growth: Regulatory Crackdowns: Aggressive regulatory actions or outright bans in major economies could significantly impact Bitcoin’s price. Black Swan Events: Unforeseen global events or economic crises could trigger market-wide sell-offs, including Bitcoin. Competition from Other Cryptocurrencies: The emergence of compelling alternative cryptocurrencies could potentially divert some capital away from Bitcoin. Technological Failures: While unlikely, any major technological flaw discovered in Bitcoin’s protocol could erode trust and value. What Does This Mean for Investors? Actionable Insights on Bitcoin Investment Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest Bitcoin projection, while bold, underscores the potential long-term growth trajectory of Bitcoin. For investors, this raises some crucial questions and actionable insights: Consider Bitcoin as a Long-Term Investment: Wood’s Bitcoin 2030 forecast is a long-term outlook. If you believe in the institutional adoption narrative, consider Bitcoin as a part of a diversified long-term investment portfolio. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Given Bitcoin’s volatility, dollar-cost averaging – investing a fixed amount regularly – can be a prudent strategy to mitigate risk and capitalize on long-term growth. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): While Wood’s analysis is insightful, always conduct your own thorough research before making any investment decisions. Understand the risks and rewards involved in Bitcoin. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments, technological advancements, and institutional adoption trends in the cryptocurrency space. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose, and ensure Bitcoin aligns with your overall risk tolerance and investment goals. Conclusion: The Explosive Potential of Bitcoin Cathie Wood’s jaw-dropping Bitcoin price prediction of $1.5 million by 2030 is undoubtedly audacious, but it’s grounded in a compelling narrative of increasing Bitcoin institutional adoption and Bitcoin’s evolving role as a significant asset class. Whether this exact target is reached remains to be seen, but Wood’s forecast highlights the immense potential that many see in Bitcoin’s future. As the digital asset landscape continues to mature and institutions further embrace cryptocurrencies, the journey of Bitcoin is likely to be anything but boring. Keep watching this space – the crypto revolution is far from over, and the most exciting chapters might still be ahead.

Expert Reveals Crypto Sentiment Divide and Bitcoin Price Surge Potential,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-sentiment-alt-season-bitcoin/,"Is the crypto market sending mixed signals? Absolutely. While headlines often focus on price swings, a fascinating divergence is unfolding beneath the surface. Leading crypto expert Matt Hougan, CIO of Bitwise, has highlighted a striking split in crypto sentiment : Institutional investors are charging in with bullish conviction, while retail investors are showing historic levels of pessimism. Could this unusual dynamic be the secret signal for the next big alt season ? Let’s dive into this intriguing market scenario. Decoding the Crypto Sentiment Divide: Bullish Institutions vs. Cautious Retail The cryptocurrency market is rarely monolithic. Currently, it’s displaying a stark contrast in investor behavior. On one side, we have institutional investors , the big players with deep pockets, demonstrating unwavering optimism. On the other, retail investors , the everyday crypto enthusiasts, are exhibiting caution, even pessimism. This divergence isn’t just interesting; it could be a key indicator of future market movements. Institutional Investors: Riding the Bullish Wave Let’s break down why institutions are so bullish: Record ETF Inflows: Crypto ETFs, particularly Bitcoin ETFs, are seeing unprecedented inflows of capital. This signifies strong institutional demand and a willingness to allocate significant funds to crypto assets. Growing Institutional Adoption: Major corporations, traditional financial institutions, and even sovereign wealth funds are increasingly exploring and investing in cryptocurrencies. This broad adoption validates crypto as a legitimate asset class. Long-Term Vision: Institutions often operate with a longer investment horizon. They are less swayed by short-term volatility and more focused on the long-term potential of blockchain technology and digital assets. Retail Investors: Navigating Altcoin Underperformance In contrast, retail sentiment is lagging. Why the caution? Altcoin Underperformance: While Bitcoin has shown resilience and even growth, many altcoins have struggled. This underperformance can erode retail investor confidence, who often gravitate towards altcoins for higher potential gains (and losses). Market Fatigue: After periods of market volatility and uncertainty, retail investors can experience fatigue and become risk-averse. The perceived lack of immediate, substantial gains in altcoins can contribute to this pessimism. Focus on Bitcoin Dominance: Bitcoin’s strong performance often overshadows the altcoin market. When Bitcoin dominates, it can create a perception that altcoins are less attractive or riskier investments. The Alt Season Opportunity: Is Pessimism the Perfect Setup? Here’s where things get interesting. Matt Hougan suggests that this very pessimism amongst retail investors, coupled with strong institutional demand, could be the perfect breeding ground for an alt season . Why? Contrarian Indicator: Often, the best investment opportunities arise when sentiment is low. When everyone is bearish, it can signal that the market is oversold and ripe for a reversal. Pent-Up Demand: Retail investors may be sitting on the sidelines, but their interest in altcoins hasn’t vanished. If market conditions improve and positive catalysts emerge, this pent-up demand could fuel a significant altcoin rally. Market Fundamentals Strengthening: Hougan points out that market fundamentals are indeed strengthening. Increased adoption, technological advancements, and growing use cases are laying a solid foundation for future growth in the broader crypto market, including altcoins. Bitcoin Price: The Catalyst for Altcoin Rally? Bitcoin price plays a crucial role in the altcoin narrative. Hougan believes that Bitcoin’s supply-demand dynamics are exceptionally strong, potentially driving its price to new all-time highs. How does this relate to altcoins? Bitcoin as the Market Leader: Bitcoin often acts as the bellwether for the crypto market. A strong Bitcoin performance can boost overall market confidence and investor sentiment, creating a more favorable environment for altcoins. Capital Rotation: Historically, after Bitcoin experiences a significant rally, profits often rotate into altcoins. Investors may seek higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities in altcoins once Bitcoin has established a strong uptrend. Increased Liquidity: A rising Bitcoin price can inject more liquidity into the entire crypto market. This increased liquidity can benefit altcoins, making it easier for them to rally. Navigating the Potential Alt Season: Actionable Insights So, how can you position yourself to potentially benefit from a future alt season? Stay Informed on Crypto Sentiment: Keep an eye on market sentiment indicators, both institutional and retail. Divergences can signal emerging opportunities. Research Promising Altcoins: Don’t just chase hype. Focus on altcoins with strong fundamentals, innovative technology, and real-world use cases. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your crypto portfolio across different asset classes, including Bitcoin and select altcoins. Manage Risk Wisely: Altcoins are inherently more volatile than Bitcoin. Invest only what you can afford to lose and use risk management strategies like stop-loss orders. Patience is Key: Alt seasons don’t happen overnight. Be prepared to hold your altcoin investments for the medium to long term to realize their potential. Conclusion: Is the Crypto Market Primed for an Exciting Turnaround? The current crypto landscape presents a fascinating paradox. While retail crypto sentiment may be subdued due to recent altcoin performance, the underlying strength of institutional investors and the bullish outlook on Bitcoin price suggest a compelling narrative. Matt Hougan’s analysis points towards a potential alt season brewing beneath the surface of market pessimism. By understanding these dynamics and acting strategically, investors can position themselves to potentially capitalize on the next wave of crypto market growth. The secret signal might just be the sentiment divide itself – a contrarian indicator whispering of opportunity amidst the caution.

Why is it possible?,https://crypto.news/armstrong-says-billions-of-people-will-use-bitcoin-by-2030/,"Commenting on an X post about the high speed of crypto adoption, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said that several billion people will be using Bitcoin by 2030. Armstrong was commenting on a post that shares the statistics from the recent BlackRock study. It says that crypto hit the 300 million users landmark in just 12 years. Allegedly, it is 43% quicker than a mobile phone adoption and 20% quicker than an Internet adoption. It really depends what you count as the official start year – for Bitcoin, Internet, and mobile phones – to make this comparison. But regardless, this is directionally correct. Bitcoin adoption should get to several billion people by 2030 at current rates. https://t.co/JEU8P7YmLP — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) February 10, 2025 Reposting this post, Armstrong added that the estimation may vary depending on what we see as the starting day of the Internet or mobile phone adoption, but he agrees with the overall direction of the BlackRock findings. Coinbase CEO concluded that by 2030, several billion people will be using Bitcoin. You might also like: Crypto adoption beats mobile phones by 43% and Internet by 20%, reports BlackRock BlackRock study According to a BlackRock study released in January 2025, Bitcoin experienced rapid adoption, quickly attracting the attention of both individual and institutional investors. The study stresses the increasing relevance of Bitcoin in times when the general public loses trust in traditional financial institutions. More than that, the study outlines the global trend aimed at making digital money easier for the masses. The study suggests it took 21 years for mobile phones to reach the 300 million users mark. The count begins with 1972, when the first cellular mobile phone was used. The same amount of users was reached by the Internet in 15 years, starting with 1983, the official year of the Internet creation. On top of the questionability of the dates chosen as the starting dates for the Internet and mobile phone adoption expressed by Brian Armstrong, some people question the methodology used to count the number of Bitcoin users. What counts as a user in this? I think it might be the number of addresses, but keep in mind that many of these haven't been touched in years. Also, one person can have more than one address. In fact, because of Bitcoin's poor privacy, many people create a new address every… pic.twitter.com/imYux7SWIr — Victor (@VictorMoneroXMR) February 9, 2025 The study doesn’t reveal the source of the number of Bitcoin users and what are the criteria for someone to fit the ‘Bitcoin user’ definition. Other studies According to the Chainalysis article, in December 2018, of 460 million Bitcoin addresses, only 172 million addresses had economic relevancy . The article notes that 25 million addresses were associated with private holders, while the rest were the addresses of exchanges, dark web marketplaces, and other platforms. This data refers to the times when Bitcoin was ten years old. The number of addresses doesn’t represent the actual number of Bitcoin users or owners, as one person can have a potentially infinite amount of addresses. In contrast, the addresses used on exchanges may be used by several people simultaneously. The BiTBO findings show that only around 106 million people own Bitcoin as of 2025. It is not clear if BlackRock considers ex-owners to be Bitcoin users. According to the study, Bitcoin is used by a mere 500k people a day. For comparison, Visa processes over 700 million transactions daily. Although the Bitcoin network does substantially fewer transactions than traditional payment operators, it allegedly outperforms both Visa and MasterCard in terms of the combined daily value of operated transactions. Bitcoin sends approximately $46.4 billion per day, while Visa operates around $38.9 billion per day, and MasterCard transacts around $24.7 billion each day. Does Armstrong’s prediction look realistic? Comparing Bitcoin to cell phones in terms of adoption is pretty hard, considering that phones are getting increasingly cheaper while Bitcoin is getting more expensive. The modern-day services are designed for smartphone owners, while Bitcoin enthusiasts have to look for opportunities to buy, store, or spend crypto in spite of hurdles. At large, these differences can be attributed to the fact that Bitcoin is much younger than the first commercially available cell phone that hit the market in 1984. More than that, cellphones were never deemed ‘crime telephones’ or something like this, while Bitcoin is still seen as drug money or a tool for money laundering and corruption by some. Bitcoin is a tough war on the part of several governments, but that’s not something that mobile phones have gone through. It took around 30 years for cell phones to become ubiquitous. By 2014, the number of active cell phones had reached around 7 billion. By 2005, when mobile phones were on the market for 21 years, over 60% of adults in the U.S. owned them. In 2030, Bitcoin will be 21 years old, and it doesn’t seem that it will be as widespread as cell phones in 2005. It takes great effort from regulators and businesses around the world to make Bitcoin as simple and safe to use as mobile phones to make billions of people use it. El Salvador made a bold move by making Bitcoin a legal tender. Still, it retreated after a three-and-a-half-year experiment with data showing that most residents didn’t even try to use Bitcoins despite the fact that it was legal and encouraged by the government.

The Extension That Determines Where Price Goes Next",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-166000-target-in-play/,"Crypto analyst CryptoCon has reaffirmed that a Bitcoin price rally to the $166,000 target is still in play. The analyst further revealed what needs to happen for the flagship crypto to reach this ambitious price target. What Determines The Bitcoin Price Rally To $166,000 In an X post, CryptoCon stated that the Bitcoin price simply needs to mirror its last year’s move in order to reach the next rung on this hyper-accurate extension in March. His accompanying chart showed that the next rung is at the $166,000 price level. Meanwhile, Bitcoin recorded a significant price rally between January 2024 and March 2024, a historical move CryptoCon believes the flagship crypto needs to mirror to reach this target. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Not The End Of The Road As Analyst Shares Roadmap To $200,000 The analyst remarked that it might seem ridiculous, but he asserted that a run to this $166,000 target next month is not far-fetched. A few days ago, CryptoCoon predicted that the Bitcoin price could rally to $160,000 in the next thirty days, meaning it could hit this target by next month. These predictions undoubtedly provide some optimism, especially considering the downward pressure that the flagship crypto is currently facing. Meanwhile, CryptoCon also suggested that there was the possibility of the Bitcoin rally to $166,000 taking longer. However, he added that the cycle isn’t over, and this price target isn’t going anywhere, indicating that BTC will reach it in this bull market. Market experts like research firm Matrixport have also predicted that Bitcoin could rally to $160,000 this year. Meanwhile, asset manager Bitwise predicted that the Bitcoin price would rally to $200,000 this year. Standard Chartered also asserted that BTC reaching around $200,000 by year-end is achievable. State Of Things For BTC Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto provided some insights into the current Bitcoin price action. In an X post, he stated that BTC is still holding the higher timeframe support zone at $94,553. As long as BTC continues to hold this support zone, he expects some further consolidation around this area. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4th Wave Ends With Price Crash To $91,000, 5th Wave Shows $210,000 Is Coming The crypto analyst also drew attention to a potential PO3 that was forming for the Bitcoin price at these levels. He remarked that he would like to see a move below the lows at $94,100 and then reclaim and push to local supply right above the last local highs. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez also confirmed that the Bitcoin price is in a consolidation phase. He revealed that BTC’s accumulation trend score is zero, which signals a period of consolidation. The crypto analyst added that a shift in demand here could set the stage for the next big move. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $95,800, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Volatility is through the roof, leaving investors scrambling for something more stable—something that promises long-term growth instead of quick, risky speculation. But amidst the chaos, one name is shining through: Lightchain AI . Already making waves with a presale that’s raised over $15.3 million and a price of just $0.006, Lightchain AI is carving out its place as a game-changing alternative. With cutting-edge blockchain solutions built for sustainability and security, this project is proving there’s hope beyond the turmoil. Why Crypto Prices Are Crashing—And What It Means for Investors Cryptocurrency markets have recently experienced significant downturns, primarily due to geopolitical tensions and economic policy shifts. President Donald Trump’s announcement of substantial tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China has heightened market uncertainty, leading investors to retreat from riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, for instance, saw a decline of approximately 4.1%, trading around $95,400, while Ethereum dropped by 17% to $2,577. The overall market capitalization decreased from about $3.6 trillion to $3.1 trillion. This volatility underscores the sensitivity of digital assets to global economic developments. Investors should exercise caution, recognizing the inherent risks and ensuring their portfolios are diversified to mitigate potential losses during such turbulent periods. How Lightchain AI Provides Stability in a Volatile Market Lightchain AI stands apart from speculative assets by focusing on innovation and utility. Its AI-Powered Automated Scaling dynamically adjusts network resources to handle increased transaction loads, eliminating bottlenecks and improving overall blockchain performance. This gives it a significant edge over outdated systems that struggle under high demand. Another key feature is its Adaptive Smart Contracts, which introduce unparalleled flexibility by adjusting contract parameters based on real-time data. This not only enhances efficiency but also reduces the risk of security vulnerabilities , making it a more reliable solution for blockchain applications. Lightchain AI’s focus on scalability and adaptability positions it as a cutting-edge platform designed to meet the evolving demands of modern blockchain technology. tor Confidence Market Shift Is Happening—Are You Positioned for It? As crypto prices remain volatile, investors are turning to projects that promise sustainable growth and innovative technology. Lightchain AI stands out with its unique blockchain features designed for the future. Its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) introduces a dedicated layer for AI-specific tasks like model training and inference, fully integrated into the blockchain. Additionally, the groundbreaking Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism not only secures the network but also rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations. With impressive presale performance and cutting-edge functionality, Lightchain AI is emerging as one of the most promising alternatives in the crypto market.

While Ripple’s (XRP) global expansion continues to get attention, a larger development is occurring. WallitIQ (WLTQ) , a platform that is transforming blockchain-based financial solutions , is attracting the attention of major banks and institutional investors. Banks Bets Big On This AI Altcoin Over Ripple (XRP) In An Unseen Power Play. Ripple (XRP) has dominated the institutional blockchain adoption market for many years, capitalizing on the token’s effective cross-border payment solutions. Given that Ripple (XRP) is trading at $2.44, some predict its real breakout moment is imminent. Despite Ripple’s (XRP) rise, major banks are placing their attention elsewhere. WallitIQ (WLTQ), the new attention center, is quickly becoming the most promising AI cryptocurrency. Ripple (XRP) is benefiting from its banking alliances. Major banks, however, recognize the WallitIQ (WLTQ) AI altcoin potential to transform the sector and are supporting it. For instance, the AI altcoin is heavily ingrained in the platform’s AI-driven cryptocurrency system. This contrasts Ripple (XRP), which is mainly used for payments. In addition, many investors, including banks, understand the underlying influence of AI in the economy and how it spreads across the financial industry. These investors underpin WallitIQ (WLTQ) as a forerunner due to its technological capacity to incorporate AI-powered automation into cryptocurrency transactions. To this end, cryptocurrency transactions are becoming an attractive and long-term investment option for these investors. The AI Altcoin With Massive Financial Backing That’s Changing Everything Ripple (XRP) extends its reach across international payment systems, while WallitIQ (WLTQ) redefines how people interact with cryptocurrency assets. Its AI-powered cryptocurrency wallet management app is revolutionizing the market with its unrivaled automated transaction features, real-time market tracking, and smooth multi-wallet integration. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) app is designed to be user-friendly and efficient. It offers multiple wallet management, simulated transactions, and AI-powered insights on when to buy and sell assets. In addition, its interactive charts offer sophisticated analytical tools for well-informed investment decision-making. At the same time, CoinGecko’s live market data integration guarantees that investors can always access the most recent pricing information. With WallitIQ (WLTQ), trading becomes increasingly easy with quick cryptocurrency swaps that let customers trade assets for little money. Custom price notifications inform investors of significant market fluctuations, and scheduled cryptocurrency purchases allow investors to automate their purchases at predetermined periods. Furthermore, a smart contract audit by SolidProof helps identify security as a core feature of WallitIQ (WLTQ). Aside from the audit, the platform uses AI fraud detection to prevent suspicious activity. Above all, a significant milestone in the platform’s development is approaching with an anticipated beta platform launch . Investors are realizing that this AI altcoin is a fully fledged ecosystem with practical applications rather than just another cryptocurrency. The rapid growth of this AI altcoin has already exceeded experts’ estimates. Over 300 million tokens have been sold in a short period, raising more than $7 million. There is no doubt about the significant profit potential, given the token cap of 1 billion. Analysts who previously focused solely on Ripple’s (XRP) global growth are now highlighting the disruptive potential of this AI altcoin. Some even claim that its AI-driven system will surpass the innovations of Ripple’s (XRP) blockchain. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Will Become The Future Of AI Crypto Trading Major banks are turning their attention to WallitIQ (WLTQ) . This platform is poised to redefine the crypto sector as Ripple’s (XRP) worldwide expansion propels the AI altcoin to new heights. Selling at a presale price of $0.0420 , the next crypto breakthrough is already here, alongside the support of major banks. Similar to how Ripple (XRP) rose to fame, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is currently becoming the AI altcoin with the potential to be a competent rival. Before this opportunity becomes widely known, lock down your assets at $0.0420 and set yourself up for the kind of rewards that have the potential to change your financial future completely!

While major tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) , and Ethereum (ETH) have strong use cases, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL sets itself apart as the most exciting opportunity for exponential value creation. Here’s why this token is dominating the conversation. Why THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL Stands Out 1. Limited Supply Creates Scarcity With a total supply capped at 100 billion tokens, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL ensures scarcity that fuels long-term value. Unlike BTC and LTC, which have slower growth due to high circulation, this token’s deflationary model guarantees increasing demand. 2. Exclusive Availability Unlike UNI and DOT, which are available on multiple exchanges, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL is sold exclusively at magacoinofficial.com . This exclusivity gives early adopters an edge and keeps the token’s growth stable and controlled. >>>>> PRESALE SELLING OUT – CLICK HERE TO SECURE YOUR SPOT! > OVER $1.9 MILLION SOLD INSTANTLY – PRESALE SELLING OUT FAST! CLICK HERE NOW! 3. Unparalleled Growth Potential Analysts project that THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL could deliver returns of up to 2,000%, thanks to its early-stage momentum and community-driven development. While Bitcoin and Polkadot are well-established, they can’t match the rapid trajectory of this groundbreaking token. 4. Investor Demand at Record Levels Raising $1,000,000 within minutes of its presale launch, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL has proven its appeal. Investors recognize its potential to redefine the market, driving interest far beyond what UNI, BTC, or LTC have recently seen. How THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL Compares Uniswap (UNI): A strong DeFi platform but lacks the exclusivity and demand-driving scarcity of THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL . Polkadot (DOT): Reliable for interoperability but cannot match the early-stage explosive growth seen here. Bitcoin (BTC): A store of value, yet its market maturity limits growth opportunities compared to THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL . Litecoin (LTC): Known for efficiency, but it hasn’t captured the market excitement that this new token has.

Web3Bay’s presale is on fire, XRP price target predictions are hitting astronomical figures, and Ethereum is facing headwinds. Let’s dive into the details! Web3Bay has already raked in over $1.08 million in its presale, with over 275 million tokens flying off the virtual shelves. Early birds who snagged 3BAY at the initial $0.003 price are looking at a potential 6,430% return when it launches at $0.1959. Even now, in Stage 4, with tokens priced at $0.004562625, a 4,200% ROI is on the table for savvy investors. But the clock is ticking, this stage is expected to sell out very soon! XRP Price Target: A Moonshot to $13? XRP has shown remarkable resilience, holding steady at the $3 support level—a price point not seen in seven years. This has ignited excitement, with some analysts projecting a jaw-dropping $13 XRP price target. EGRAG Crypto, a well-known market analyst, points to XRP’s recent move above the Bull Market Support Band (BMSB) as a signal of significant strength. His XRP price target forecasts a range from $8 to $13, which translates to a 159% to 322% surge. While market conditions will play a role, the technical indicators paint a very bullish picture for XRP. Imagine the ripple effect if the XRP price target of $13 is reached! It would send shockwaves through the entire digital asset ecosystem. The potential for XRP to reach its $13 price target is a hot topic among investors right now. Ethereum Price Analysis: Navigating Choppy Waters While XRP is riding high, Ethereum faces some significant challenges. Recent Ethereum price analysis reveals increasing sell pressure. Exchange supply has risen from 15.39 million to 16.04 million ETH, suggesting potential sell-offs. Further adding to the concern, Ethereum ETFs have experienced substantial outflows of $141 million this week. This indicates a cautious, or even bearish, sentiment among some large investors. Despite these challenges, Ethereum maintains crucial support levels between $2,230 and $2,610. This range is supported by nearly 12 million wallets holding a substantial 62 million ETH. Analysts suggest this zone could provide some stability, but Ethereum’s near-term performance is heavily dependent on the overall market climate. Whether Ethereum can hold above its support levels and weather the storm remains to be seen. The Ethereum price analysis is something every investor should be paying attention to. Web3Bay: Putting Users in the Driver’s Seat Traditional e-commerce platforms operate under a centralized model, where a single entity controls all aspects of the business. They set the fees, manage user data, and make all the decisions. Web3Bay is turning this model on its head. By implementing a decentralized governance system, Web3Bay puts the power back into the hands of its users. Holding 3BAY tokens gives users a direct voice in the platform’s future. Community members can propose changes, vote on policies, and influence key decisions, from transaction fees to platform features. Once a majority of the tokens are in circulation, Web3Bay will transition into a fully decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), making governance entirely community-driven. Even Web3Bay itself won’t have control over the platform’s smart contracts after full decentralization. This eliminates the risk of sudden policy changes or arbitrary account bans. Instead, the marketplace will be shaped by the very people who use it. This revolutionary approach has attracted a massive community from across the digital asset space. The presale has been a resounding success, with over 275 million tokens sold and more than $1.08 million raised. Early investors who participated in Stage 1 at $0.003 per token are looking at a potential 6,430% ROI at launch. For those who missed Stage 1, there’s still a chance to grab a 4,200% ROI by purchasing 3BAY at the current $0.004562625 price during Stage 4. But don’t wait too long, this stage is expected to sell out quickly! The Web3Bay presale numbers speak for themselves. Key Takeaways The XRP price target is projected between $8 and $13. Achieving this would represent a 159% to 322% increase, potentially reshaping perceptions of XRP within the crypto community. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s price analysis has revealed some concerning trends, with exchange supply increasing and Ethereum ETFs experiencing significant outflows, indicating potential sell pressure. Despite these challenges, Ethereum has strong support levels that could provide stability. Beyond price predictions and market sentiment, the digital asset world is undergoing a major transformation with Web3Bay redefining ownership and control in e-commerce. Early 3BAY investors are poised for a 6,430% return at launch, and even current presale participants can see a 4,200% ROI if they jump in now. But with the presale heating up and nearing its end, time is of the essence!

SEC To Discuss ‘Settlements’ And Other Legal Matters Today appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The ripple effect in the XRP community is palpable as the SEC gears up for another closed-door meeting, scheduled for February 13, 2025. This marks the third consecutive weekly closed session under the Sunshine Act, and the excitement is building. Could this be the meeting where the SEC finally pulls the plug on its appeal against Ripple, leading to a significant rally? The stakes are high as XRP’s future may rest on the commission’s next steps. A withdrawal of the appeal could potentially trigger a surge, pushing XRP toward a new all-time high. At the same time, the market is awaiting greater legal clarity, as asset managers are keenly interested in XRP ETFs. Key Topics on the Agenda Institution and settlement of administrative proceedings; Institution and settlement of injunctive actions; Resolution of litigation claims; and Other matters relating to examinations and enforcement proceedings. In particular, the meeting will address the institution and settlement of injunctive actions, administrative proceedings, and the resolution of litigation claims—subjects closely tied to the ongoing SEC vs. Ripple case. Experts are speculating that an official move toward resolving the SEC vs. Ripple case could set off a massive rally within the broader crypto space. The potential end of this legal battle could also pave the way for a Ripple IPO and open up other market opportunities, possibly leading to a more favorable tax environment for XRP holders. While the immediate focus is on the SEC’s next moves, many are looking beyond the Ripple case to the broader regulatory landscape. The SEC’s establishment of a new task force to clarify crypto rules under the Trump Administration has led to optimism that clearer regulations are on the horizon.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-13 03:07:27

The bill makes New Mexico join other states that are also working to establish Bitcoin Reserves for their respective treasury departments. New Mexico has introduced Senate Bill 275 (SB 275), also known as the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act. Senator Anthony Thornton introduced the bill proposing a 5% allocation of New Mexico’s public funds into Bitcoin. New Mexico begins exploring Bitcoin through its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act Another state making moves! 🚀 New Mexico joins the Bitcoin reserve race—who's next? — Giannis Andreou (@gandreou007) February 12, 2025 The 5% of funds will be drawn from various state funds, including the grant permanent fund, severance tax permanent fund, tobacco settlement permanent fund, and other state funds that the state investment council deems appropriate. New Mexico has joined other U.S. states in the race to Bitcoin reserves. In November 2024, Pennsylvania proposed a bill centered around the creation and establishment of a Bitcoin reserve becoming among the first states to pursue BTC reserves. The Pennsylvania Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act would allow the state’s treasury to hold Bitcoin in its reserves once passed into law. The act proposed that the state seclude 10% of its general fund, investment fund, and rainy day fund into the digital asset. The state’s Rainy Day Fund totals $7 billion, and the General Fund holds over $9.7 billion making the proposed investment significant and substantial. In December 2024, the head of the Florida Blockchain Business Association (FBBA), Samuel Armes, announced that Florida could join the Bitcoin reserve bandwagon by the first quarter of 2025. According to Armes, the Speaker of the Florida House Danny Perez, and Senate President Ben Albritton are supportive of Bitcoin, and with Governor Ron DeSantis also a proponent, Florida is well-positioned to adopt a Bitcoin reserve. Armes proposed leveraging Florida’s $185.7B pension fund by allocating a small percentage to Bitcoin to hedge against inflation. Armes also explained that Florida had already invested in Bitcoin and other crypto assets through its pension fund. Texas, Ohio, and Alabama are considering Bitcoin reserves Texas also joined the race in December 2024 during its 89th legislative session, where the State introduced Senate Bill 778, proposing a Bitcoin reserve secluded from the state’s general revenue fund. The legislation would allow Texas to hold Bitcoin as an asset and appropriate funds for further BTC purchases. Residents would also be able to donate Bitcoin to the reserve. Ohio and Alabama also joined the bandwagon with Bitcoin reserve proposals. In December 2024, Ohio State Representative Derek Merrin introduced a proposal dubbed the Ohio Bitcoin Reserve Act, which would establish a state Bitcoin fund. Alabama state auditor Andrew Sorrell suggested that the state initiate a strategic Bitcoin reserve. On 10th January, North Dakota legislators and a New Hampshire state representative introduced proposals allowing individual states to invest in Bitcoin. New Hampshire state representative Keith Ammon’s proposal did not mention Bitcoin explicitly but set high market value requirements that only make BTC eligible for the state’s investments. North Dakota legislators’ proposal suggested the state seclude a portion of its funds to digital assets. Massachusetts, Utah, and Arizona make their first strides toward Bitcoin Reserves On Jan. 18, Massachusetts state senator Peter Durant and five Republican senators in Wyoming introduced bills calling for the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the two states. Massachusetts’ proposal suggested a 10% allocation to Bitcoin from its rainy-day fund, while Wyoming proposed allocating only 3% of the public funds to BTC. Other states like Utah, Arizona, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, and Montana also made their first strides toward establishing independent Bitcoin reserves. Iowa has introduced a new Bitcoin reserve bill, HF 246, which would permit the investment of up to 5% of public funds in digital assets with a market cap of $750 billion or more. The U.S. states follow the federal government’s move to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the U.S. Treasury. The discussion has gained momentum at the federal level after the White House’s AI and crypto policy lead, David Sacks, confirmed that reviewing Bitcoin as a potential strategic reserve asset is a priority for the administration’s digital assets working group.

The first major resistance is near the $2,780 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,800 or $2,820. A clear move above the $2,820 resistance might send the price toward the $2,920 resistance. An upside break above the $2,920 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,000 resistance zone or even $3,050 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,780 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,675 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,550 swing low to the $2,794 high. The first major support sits near the $2,640 zone. A clear move below the $2,640 support might push the price toward the $2,600 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,550 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,440.

The crypto market is heating up, and new meme coins are making waves. Investors are searching for the next Shiba Inu or Dogecoin, but one project is standing out from the rest— BTFD Coin (BTFD) . With an insane 100% bonus in Stage 14, a live Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, and a massive 90% APY staking reward, BTFD is turning heads and stacking up serious momentum. Meanwhile, Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW) is gaining attention with its charitable donation to animal welfare, reinforcing its community-driven mission. Mog Coin (MOG) is also making headlines as it maintains strong trading volume after a high-flying December. With meme coin hype reaching new heights, this might be your last chance to get in early before prices skyrocket. Let’s dive into why BTFD Coin is the top new meme coin to join this week , and how MEW and MOG are also stirring up the market. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Most Hyped Presale of 2025 Ever wish you could go back in time and buy Dogecoin before it blew up? Well, this might be your second chance. BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a movement. The presale is flying through the stages, and Stage 14 is now live with an eye-popping 100% bonus when investors use the LAUNCH100 promo code . What makes BTFD stand out? First, its P2E game went fully live on January 1, 2025, letting players earn rewards while gaming. Imagine earning real crypto just by playing—BTFD is turning that into reality. The staking platform is already paying out 90% APY, and the referral program lets top players earn 10% in extra rewards. If that wasn’t enough, the presale is skipping ahead, and all unsold tokens from Stage 13 are getting burned. That means fewer tokens in circulation, stronger demand, and a tighter supply—a perfect storm for future price pumps. How to Claim the 100% Bonus on BTFD Want to double your coins instantly? Here’s what to do: Go to BTFD’s presale page Connect your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.) Enter the promo code LAUNCH100 before making a purchase Buy your BTFD and watch your coins double instantly The bonus only lasts during Stage 14, so time is running out. Presale Numbers That Are Blowing Minds BTFD’s presale started at $0.000004 and is now priced at $0.00016 in Stage 14. Here’s why people are scrambling to invest: Over $6 million raised More than 69 billion BTFD coins sold Over 10,600 Bulls holding BTFD ROI is set for 275% without a bonus and 550% with the LAUNCH100 code To put that into perspective, a $3,500 investment today at the current price of $0.00016 will get you 21,875,000 BTFD coins. But with the LAUNCH100 bonus, that doubles to 43,750,000 BTFD coins. When BTFD hits its listing price of $0.0006, that same investment could be worth $26,250, locking in a massive 650% gain. BTFD’s Play-to-Earn Game – The Future of Meme Coins The BTFD P2E game isn’t just a side feature—it’s a game-changer. Players can level up, unlock rewards, and cash out their in-game earnings in real BTFD tokens . Unlike other meme coins that rely on hype alone, BTFD actually has utility, making it a solid investment rather than just a speculative gamble. This game isn’t in beta anymore—it’s fully live, and early players are already stacking up rewards. If Axie Infinity taught us anything, a successful P2E game can take a crypto project to the moon. Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW) – Charity and Community in One MEW is proving that meme coins can have heart. In January 2025, the project donated $10,000 to the Pasadena Humane Organization to help animals affected by the California wildfires​. This move isn’t just good PR—it reinforces the idea that MEW is a community-driven project with real-world impact. Launched in March 2024 on the Solana blockchain, MEW quickly gained traction as a top cat-themed memecoin. At its peak, its market cap topped $1 billion, and while the price has pulled back, it remains one of the most active meme coins on Solana. MEW’s biggest win was its listing on the Revolut app, making it accessible to over 45 million users worldwide. With its strong branding and engaged community, MEW continues to hold its own in the meme coin space. Mog Coin (MOG) – A Silent Giant in the Meme Coin World MOG may not be as loud as BTFD, but it’s still making moves. After hitting an all-time high in December 2024, the token remains a major player with a market cap of $343 million​. The big reason for MOG’s strong performance? Its Coinbase listing in late 2024, which opened it up to millions of new investors. Since then, its trading volume has remained strong, showing that investors still have faith in its potential. While MOG isn’t making major headlines, it remains one of the most actively traded meme coins, proving that strong fundamentals can keep a project relevant even after its initial hype fades. The BTFD Referral Program – Earn 10% in Extra BTFD Another way to stack even more BTFD coins is by referring friends. Here’s how it works: Share your unique referral code If someone buys at least $50 in BTFD, they get a 10% bonus You earn 10% on their purchase if you rank in the top 20 referrers With the presale flying through stages, getting in early means more people will be buying after you, increasing your potential rewards. Conclusion – BTFD Is the Best Bet Right Now With the meme coin market exploding, there are plenty of options out there. But based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands out as the top new meme coin to join this week. Its 100% presale bonus, booming P2E game, and staking rewards make it a must-watch. MEW’s charity move and MOG’s strong trading volume are impressive, but BTFD is where the real action is right now. The clock is ticking. Join the BTFD presale now and claim your 100% bonus before Stage 14 ends. Find Out More: Website: https://www.btfd.io/ X/Twitter: https://x.com/BTFD_COIN Telegram: https://t.me/btfd_coin FAQs 1.

This request, filed through a Form 19b-4, aims to enable staking for the Ethereum held by the ETF trust. If approved, it would become the first ETF in the U.S. to incorporate staking. The SEC has previously approved several Ethereum ETFs, such as the 21Shares Ethereum ETF, alongside other high-profile offerings from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity. However, most of these approvals excluded staking due to regulatory concerns. The filing said, “Based on discussions with the Sponsor, the Exchanges proposes to amend several portions of the Eth ETP Amendment No. 2, as amended, in order to allow the staking of the Ethereum held by the Trust.” What Does This Mean for Ethereum? Staking is an important feature for Ethereum, as it allows holders to earn passive rewards for helping secure the network. However, staking hasn’t been part of the Ethereum ETF offerings so far, as the SEC had previously raised concerns about whether staking could be considered a security. This was part of broader regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies, which saw SEC Chairman Gary Gensler labeling various crypto-related activities, including staking and stablecoins, as potential securities. However, this approach is now shifting, and many expect that the SEC will greenlight staking in 2025. This rule change request could pave the way for more crypto-related ETFs to incorporate staking, creating new opportunities for investors to earn rewards on their holdings. As a result, Ethereum ETFs could attract capital, as passive staking rewards become a compelling benefit for investors. The ETF Race Heats Up The SEC’s approval of the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF with staking could set a precedent, with other crypto firms looking to follow suit. The Cboe BZX Exchange has been very active in the ETF space, having also filed proposals for other assets like XRP.",News|Crypto news|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ETH|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-13 03:49:21

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. SHIB and DOGE traders are jumping into this under-the-radar crypto before its surge. Discover why smart money is making their move now. Table of Contents Why SHIB and DOGE traders are exploring new opportunities RCO Finance: The AI crypto set for a major surge Conclusion The meme coin sector has always stunned the crypto market with its ability to produce staggering gains, as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) have done over the years. DOGE and SHIB, which are the two biggest memecoins by market cap, used to rule the market. But now they are stuck, with prices dropping by over 28% and 25% in the last month, respectively. This sloping transition has pushed traders to seek alternatives, with their attention turning to RCO Finance (RCOF), an AI altcoin changing how investors interact with crypto. Offering AI-powered investment tools, real-world integration, and early-stage pricing, RCOF is an attractive project. Why SHIB and DOGE traders are exploring new opportunities In their prime, Shiba Inu and Dogecoin undoubtedly made headlines; however, their declining performance and overreliance on speculative hype rather than intrinsic value for growth has made them less appealing to long-term investors. Despite their past successes, Shiba Inu and Dogecoin are struggling to maintain upward momentum. SHIB experienced a steady decline since the last quarter of 2024, falling from $0.000033 to $0.000016, a 51.52% drop. Similarly, DOGE fell from $0.4835 to now trade at $0.2546, a 47.34% drop. This downturn comes from their overreliance on speculative hype and celebrity endorsements to drive growth. While Shiba Inu has attempted to expand its ecosystem with the Shibarium network and metaverse initiatives, these developments have yet to drive sustained demand. Similarly, Dogecoin’s potential for mainstream payment adoption has not materialized at the scale investors had hoped. You might also like: Ethereum lags behind Bitcoin but is expected to reach $14K, boosting RCOF to new high RCO Finance: The AI crypto set for a major surge RCOF is a technological movement, integrating AI-powered investment tools and real-world asset integration to create an ecosystem whose value proposition goes beyond what Dogecoin and Shiba Inu offer. Driving RCOF’s innovation is its robo-advisor, a tool that uses AI machine learning to analyze market and user data to create personalized investment plans. It analyses users’ financial goals, risk tolerance, investment timelines, and more to create custom strategies that are best suited to investment needs. If users want quick gains and are open to taking on more risk, it can recommend high-reward but higher-risk assets. If users are more conservative and prefer low to mid-risk investments, it can suggest more stable lower-risk assets to invest in. This customization ensures all users benefit despite their experience level. This tool also uses predictive analytics to provide real-time investment insights that help users make data-backed decisions, remove indecision and optimize outcomes. For instance, let’s say users wanted to invest in XRP before its ETF approval, but the news of its regulatory struggles is putting them off. Instead of relying on gut instincts, traders can use the robo-advisor for clear, data-driven recommendations based on current market conditions, historical patterns, and global financial indicators. If XRP shows signs of weakness, it can suggest reducing exposure; if bullish trends emerge, it advises increasing the position. This clarity minimizes hesitation and maximizes profitability. One of RCO Finance’s most creative features is its ability to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs), such as stocks, ETFs, and commodities. Including RWAs opens up previously inaccessible markets to retail investors, enabling them to build diversified portfolios all from one platform. It also enables users to buy RWAs directly using cryptocurrency, avoiding the need for crypto-to-fiat currency conversion. In the crypto industry, trust is crucial, so RCO Finance underwent a thorough SolidProof audit. This accreditation shows the platform adheres to the highest safety and reliability standards, making it a trustworthy investment. Privacy-conscious investors will appreciate this crypto’s KYC-free ecosystem, which eliminates demanding identity verification processes while remaining compliant. RCO Finance guarantees speedier onboarding, more anonymity, and worldwide accessibility, attracting more users. This altcoin recently unveiled its beta platform, allowing users to get hands-on experience with its features before the official launch. This is a rare opportunity, given very few DeFi platforms release a beta version during their presale stage. With over 10k active users already on the platform, its popularity is growing. Since this is just the beta version, users can expect more improvements the closer the project gets to the launch. Try out the beta platform here . Conclusion Just like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, RCOF offers unmatched potential. Plus, RCOF’s utility-focused approach ensures its gains are sustainable. Powered by its AI-driven ecosystem, advanced tools, and practical utility, this crypto is poised to surge. Priced at $0.10 during the presale, it is the perfect entry point. To learn more about RCOF, visit the RCO Finance presale and join the community.

Bulls are in trouble as the price remains trapped under key supply levels, leaving investors concerned about Ethereum’s short-term future. Many who expected a bullish year for the second-largest cryptocurrency are now questioning their outlook after last week’s massive selling pressure took ETH from $3,150 to $2,150 in less than two days. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Hold $97K? – 1-3 Month Holders’ Data Reveals Crucial BTC Demand The recent price action has amplified fear and uncertainty among retail investors, with many continuing to sell amid the market turbulence. However, on-chain metrics tell a different story, signaling growing confidence from larger players. Key data shared by top crypto analyst Ali Martinez reveals that whales have accumulated over 600,000 Ethereum in the past week, even as retail investors remain cautious. This divergence highlights a critical trend in the market—retail investors appear scared and reactive, while big players are quietly buying up ETH at discounted prices. As the market grapples with indecision and volatility, this accumulation by whales could set the stage for a significant shift in momentum. If bulls manage to reclaim the $2,800 and $3,000 levels, Ethereum may begin a recovery rally. For now, all eyes are on whether the divergence will lead to a turning point in ETH’s price action. Ethereum Investors Are Divided: Retail Fears Vs. Whales Trust Ethereum remains in a challenging position after last week’s dramatic sell-off, which saw the price drop from $3,150 to $2,150 in less than 48 hours. Despite a strong recovery back into the $2,700 range, ETH has struggled to reclaim key supply levels, leaving many investors cautious. The price remains trapped below crucial resistance at $2,800, with bulls needing to push above the $3,000 mark to shift the bearish trend and regain market confidence. Key metrics shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez reveal a promising trend amidst the uncertainty. Whales have accumulated over 600,000 Ethereum in the past week, signaling strong buying activity from big players. This accumulation trend is a stark contrast to the cautious behavior of retail investors, many of whom continue to sell amid fear and uncertainty. The divergence between whale accumulation and retail selling suggests that large investors remain optimistic about Ethereum’s long-term prospects, even as short-term price action remains shaky.

A breakout above $3,000, which aligns with the 200-day moving average, could mark a significant turning point for ETH, sparking a rally toward higher price levels. Until then, ETH remains in a critical phase as it navigates between bearish pressure and the potential for recovery. ETH Price Action: Key Levels To Reclaim Ethereum is currently trading at $2,620, attempting to reclaim the $2,700 mark as it battles against key supply levels. Bulls are under pressure to break through resistance at $2,800 and $3,000, as reclaiming these levels would signify a reversal of the daily downtrend that has persisted since late December. The $3,000 mark holds particular significance, as it aligns with the 200-day moving average, a widely watched indicator that signals long-term strength when prices hold above it. A successful push above the $3,000 level could ignite a strong rally, with Ethereum targeting higher price levels quickly. Such a move would restore confidence in the market and signal a potential bullish trend for ETH, which has struggled to regain its footing following last week’s dramatic sell-off. Related Reading: Cardano Is Showing Signs Of A Potential Rebound As Key Indicator Flashes A Buy Signal – Analyst However, if Ethereum fails to hold above the $2,600 mark, the outlook becomes bearish. A breakdown below this level could open the door to further declines, with ETH potentially testing lower demand zones in the coming days. The market remains at a critical juncture, and Ethereum’s ability to reclaim and hold key levels will determine its short-term direction as investors closely monitor the next moves.

This achievement, particularly at Stage 4 with a price of $0.004562625, begs the question: how does Web3Bay’s approach compare to established players like Cardano and Tron, and what does this mean for the future of blockchain technology? This article offers a provocative look at these projects, examining their growth, investor returns, and market impact. The Web3Bay presale, with its impressive $1.15 million raised, signals a strong appetite for its vision. Web3Bay: Disrupting E-commerce with Decentralization – $1.15M & Counting Web3Bay’s presale has been nothing short of explosive, exceeding $1.15 million and moving over 300 million tokens. Currently in Stage 4 at $0.004562625, the project’s traction raises eyebrows and opens up a discussion about the future of online shopping. What’s the secret sauce? Web3Bay’s decentralized marketplace model directly challenges the established order of e-commerce giants. By cutting out the middleman, it aims to eliminate hefty fees and return control to sellers. This, coupled with the acceptance of both cryptocurrency and traditional payment methods, positions Web3Bay to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3 commerce, casting a wide net for users. The Web3Bay presale, with its impressive figures, has certainly stirred the pot. The project’s structured presale, with its tiered pricing across 28 stages, has also played a crucial role. Early birds get the worm (and lower prices), creating a sense of urgency and driving demand as later stages see price increases. This strategy has incentivized early adoption and built a community of invested stakeholders. The Web3Bay presale numbers speak for themselves, don’t they? Beyond the hype, Web3Bay offers a compelling value proposition for investors. The 3BAY token isn’t just a speculative asset; it’s a utility token that unlocks discounts, voting rights, and staking opportunities. This focus on utility within a growing ecosystem differentiates Web3Bay from projects built on pure speculation. Web3Bay, with its $1.15 million presale raise, has definitely caught the attention of the crypto world. Cardano: A Layered Approach to Scalability Cardano, conceived in 2015 and launched in 2017 by former Ethereum contributors, has carved its own niche in the blockchain space. Its layered architecture, separating ADA transactions from smart contracts, is designed to enhance scalability and flexibility. The Ouroboros proof-of-stake consensus mechanism underpins its operations, prioritizing energy efficiency and security. Cardano’s initial coin offering (ICO) raised over $60 million, primarily from Japanese investors, setting the stage for its growth. Cardano’s market capitalization has seen substantial increases over the years, reaching $77 billion by May 2021. As of January 31, 2025, ADA is trading at around $0.96, reflecting a modest increase. Tron: Scaling the Entertainment Industry Tron, launched in 2017 by Justin Sun, focuses on decentralizing the entertainment and digital content industry. Its delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism enables high throughput and scalability. The TRX cryptocurrency powers the Tron network, facilitating transactions and smart contracts. TRX experienced rapid price appreciation after its launch, reaching an all-time high of $0.30 in January 2018. In 2024, Tron continued its growth, with market capitalization and revenue showing significant increases. The Final Verdict: Which Project Will Deliver Tangible Value? In the cryptocurrency world, success hinges on utility, adoption, and a clear vision. Cardano and Tron have demonstrated growth by focusing on scalability and digital content, attracting significant investor interest. However, Web3Bay’s rapid presale, with its $1.15 million raise and its unique approach to decentralized e-commerce set it apart. Its structured token sale and real-world application offer a practical solution that could drive sustained demand. The key question isn’t simply which project will grow, but which will deliver the most tangible value. Web3Bay’s strategy of merging blockchain with everyday commerce makes it a project to watch. Web3Bay’s $1.15 million presale is a strong indicator of investor confidence.

40262925,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=128326,1739419243,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Why a Surge in the Solana Price Will Push This Altcoin to Massive Gains,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/why-a-surge-in-the-solana-price-will-push-this-altcoin-to-massive-gains/,"The Solana price is making waves again, climbing steadily and drawing renewed investor interest. But here’s the bigger story; when Solana surges, it often sparks rallies across the broader crypto market. And one AI altcoin, RCOF , is set to benefit the most. With cutting-edge technology and skyrocketing demand, this hidden gem could see explosive gains as SOL leads the charge. Let’s break down why this is the perfect moment to get in before the price soars. The Solana Price Surge Is Reshaping the Crypto Market The Solana price has been showing strong bullish signals, capturing the attention of investors. After hitting $290 in January, it briefly retraced to $200 in early February. Despite this dip, the uptrend remains intact, with technical indicators pointing toward another major breakout. Analysts predict that if Solana price breaks past the key $245 level, it could trigger a wave of liquidations, forcing short sellers to cover their positions. This buying pressure could catapult Solana toward its next target of $565. Market trends suggest that a rising Solana price often fuels gains in other altcoins. When SOL experiences a breakout, investor sentiment improves across the crypto market, leading to capital flowing into promising projects. And with the Solana price regaining momentum, now is the time to identify the next big winner. RCOF is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this momentum. Unlike most altcoins, it isn’t just benefiting from the hype. It’s offering cutting-edge AI-driven financial tools that set it apart. This AI-Powered Crypto Is Set to Ride the Wave RCOF is a revolutionary AI-powered financial platform that’s changing the way people invest. At its core is the Robo Advisor, an AI-driven tool that gives real-time entry and exit signals, helping traders make informed decisions. It pulls data from top financial sources like Bloomberg and Reuters, analyzes trends, and delivers actionable insights with unmatched precision. The market moves fast, and by the time most traders hear about a hot token, the opportunity is gone. But with the Robo Advisor, you get early alerts on trending altcoins before they explode. Say, for instance, you had access to early signals on the TRUMP token before it launched. With the right timing, your $500 investment could have turned into $50,000. The AI doesn’t just help with entry points, it also spots downturns, allowing you to sell before a crash. Unlike human investors who get caught up in emotions, AI is purely data-driven. Beyond trading, RCOF brings personalized investment strategies tailored to your financial goals. Whether you’re a conservative investor or a high-risk trader, the AI adapts, optimizing your portfolio without you needing to micromanage it. And it’s only getting better. RCOF’s AI monitoring facilities ensure that the Robo Advisor continuously improves, learning from market data to enhance its accuracy over time. This means that as the market evolves, your investment strategy does too. But RCOF isn’t just about AI; it’s a full-fledged financial ecosystem. With its KYC-free platform, investors can trade freely without identity restrictions. The upcoming debit card integration will allow users to spend crypto like cash, and you can diversify into over 120,000 investment options, from stocks and ETFs to real estate and bonds. Presale Demand Skyrockets as Investors Rush In RCOF has launched a Beta Platform , giving investors a real taste of its AI-driven ecosystem before the token even hits major exchanges. With over 10,000 users actively testing its features, the project is proving its potential in real time. And this is just the beginning. The Alpha phase, currently in internal testing, will introduce even more powerful trading tools, making RCOF’s ecosystem even stronger. With this level of progress, it’s no surprise that the presale is gaining serious momentum. Currently in Stage 5, RCOF tokens are priced at $0.10, but the next stage will jump to $0.13, marking a 30% increase in Q1 alone. Investors who get in now are locking in instant gains, and those who wait risk paying more for the same opportunity. RCOF has already raised over $12 million, and demand is soaring. A simple $1,000 investment today will be worth $1,300 by the next stage—but that’s just the beginning. Upon listing, analysts predict that $1,000 will be worth over $400,000 or more. And safety is a non-issue. RCOF has been audited by SolidProof , a leading blockchain security firm. The audit confirmed zero vulnerabilities, making it one of the safest investments in the space. As Solana price climbs, investors are looking for the next big winner, and RCOF’s presale is shaping up to be the perfect early entry before it skyrockets on major exchanges. Solana’s Rally Is Big, but This Altcoin’s Growth Could Be Bigger The Solana price momentum has been undeniable, breaking through key resistance levels, and investors are seeing solid returns. But for those looking to maximize their gains, RCOF presents a far more explosive opportunity. Because it’s still in presale, RCOF offers the greatest upside. Early investors are already sitting on gains, and those entering before the next price increase stand to make even more. But this window won’t stay open for long. The smart money is getting in now.

The price must clear the $2.50 and $2.52 levels to start a fresh increase in the near term. XRP price started a decent upward move from the $2.320 zone. The price is now trading above $2.420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.380 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start a fresh increase if it clears the $2.50 resistance zone. XRP Price Holds Support XRP price managed to stay above the $2.32 support and avoided more losses, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . A base was formed, and the price started a decent upward move above the $2.35 and $2.40 levels. The price surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.5241 swing high to the $2.3353 low. The current price action is positive, and the price is now trading near the $2.50 resistance zone. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.380 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $2.420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.480 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.5241 swing high to the $2.3353 low. The first major resistance is near the $2.50 level. The next resistance is $2.520. A clear move above the $2.520 resistance might send the price toward the $2.60 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.650 resistance or even $2.720 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.80. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.50 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.420 level. The next major support is near the $2.380 level and the trend line. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.380 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.320 support. The next major support sits near the $2.20 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.420 and $2.380.

While the session falls under the Sunshine Act, meaning discussions remain private, speculation is rife about its potential implications for Ripple and the wider digital asset sector. With XRP’s price movements closely tied to regulatory developments, any sign of a settlement or withdrawal of the SEC’s appeal against Ripple could trigger significant market reactions. The SEC’s handling of this case will also set a precedent for future enforcement actions in the crypto industry, influencing the regulatory landscape and asset managers’ interest in XRP-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The broader crypto market is also watching closely, as any major legal shift could impact investor sentiment across multiple digital assets. At the time of writing, XRP price was up over 3% to trade at $2.48. Ripple lawsuit in focus The SEC’s agenda includes administrative proceedings, litigation claims, and injunctive actions—all directly tied to the Ripple case. The lawsuit, which began in December 2020, accused Ripple of conducting an unregistered securities offering through its sale of XRP. Recent court rulings have favoured Ripple, including a decision that secondary XRP sales are not securities transactions. However, the SEC remains firm in its appeal, keeping uncertainty alive. A resolution today could signal de-escalation, providing much-needed legal clarity to Ripple and the broader crypto market. Investors and analysts anticipate that a decision could provide insights into how the regulator plans to handle other crypto-related enforcement actions in the future. XRP price reaction Traders are closely monitoring the SEC’s decision, as a positive outcome could lead to a price surge. Historically, regulatory clarity has driven crypto rallies, and a settlement could eliminate a major hurdle for Ripple’s expansion. Additionally, legal certainty could revive discussions on a Ripple initial public offering (IPO), a move previously hinted at by CEO Brad Garlinghouse. An IPO would attract institutional investors and solidify Ripple’s position in the fintech sector, potentially expanding its role in cross-border payments and digital asset adoption. A settlement could also open doors for XRP-focused ETFs, as asset managers await regulatory approval to launch investment products. If approved, these ETFs could drive further institutional adoption of XRP, making it a more accessible asset for traditional investors looking for exposure to digital currencies. Regulatory shift ahead? The SEC’s approach to Ripple will influence broader regulatory discussions. The commission is under pressure to provide clearer guidelines on digital assets, especially as global markets, including the UK, UAE, and Singapore, implement structured policies for crypto firms. A shift in regulatory strategy, particularly under the new Trump administration’s financial task force, could signal a more crypto-friendly stance. Meanwhile, a continued enforcement-heavy approach could push innovation offshore, weakening the US’s competitiveness in digital assets. The ongoing legal battle has already contributed to uncertainty, leading some blockchain firms to relocate operations to jurisdictions with more favorable regulations.

Bitcoin Has Significant Resistance At Price Levels Just Ahead In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has discussed how BTC support and resistance levels are looking from an on-chain perspective right now. In on-chain analysis, the potential of any price level to act as support or resistance lies in the amount of supply that was last transferred or purchased at it. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm, that shows the supply distribution of the cryptocurrency at price levels near the current spot Bitcoin value. In the graph, the size of the dot correlates to the amount of BTC that the investors bought in the corresponding price range. It would appear that the $96,400 to $98,400 range currently has a particularly large dot associated with it, which implies these levels host the cost basis of a significant number of holders. More specifically, around 1.6 million addresses last acquired a total of 1.57 million BTC inside the range. Since Bitcoin is trading under these levels at the moment, all of these investors would be underwater. Related Reading: Dogecoin Mania No More: Memecoin Interest Plunging On Social Media Holders in loss can be desperate to recoup their investment, so selling from them can sometimes occur as soon as the price of the cryptocurrency rises back to its cost basis. Naturally, such selling is of no relevance to the asset when just a few investors participate in it, but when the price is retesting a range holding the acquisition level of a significant number of addresses, a reaction large enough may be produced to influence the asset’s value. The $96,400 to $98,400 range is clearly quite large, so it’s possible that it could be the reason why Bitcoin has been unable to find any bullish breaks during the past week. Just like how supply blocks above the spot price can end up acting as a source of resistance for the asset, those below can be a point of support. This happens because investors who were once in profit may believe that the price would go up again in the near future so they could decide to double down on their bet, taking advantage of the ‘dip’. Currently, $93,400 to $96,200 is the strongest support wall that BTC has out of the nearby ranges. However, it contains a lower amount of supply than the aforementioned resistance block, meaning that its effect should be weaker.

It now remains to be seen whether Bitcoin can surpass the resistance, or if it would find itself retesting one of these weaker support levels. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $96,000, down around 2% in the last 24 hours.

By 2028, LINK could reach a maximum price of $102.75. In 2031, Chainlink will range between $256.84 to $319.36. Chainlink (LINK) emerged as a prominent player in the cryptocurrency market. It provides a decentralized oracle network that connects smart contracts with real-world data. As the adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi), and blockchain technology continues to grow, Chainlink’s innovative solutions have attracted significant attention from investors, and developers alike. Chainlink continues to expand its reach, and utility across the blockchain ecosystem, showcasing its robust integration capabilities. Recent updates highlight 14 new integrations of 5 Chainlink services across 10 different blockchain platforms, including prominent names like Arbitrum, Avalanche, and Ethereum. These integrations enhance Chainlink’s network and solidify its position as a critical player in decentralized applications’ interoperability and functionality. Understanding Chainlink’s potential price movements involves analyzing market trends, technological advancements, partnerships, and overall market sentiment. This chainlink price history prediction aims to provide insights into its future performance by examining technical analysis, and fundamental aspects that could influence its value.

LINK has stabilized near the key level of $20.0. Chainlink price analysis on February 13th shows LINK is trading around $19.056, showing bearish pressure after failing to hold above $20. The price briefly peaked near $19.30 but faced selling pressure, leading to a decline. If LINK fails to hold the $19 support level, it may drop toward $18.50 or even $16, a key psychological level. Resistance remains near $19.50, and a break above this level could push the price back toward $20. The market trend remains weak, with sellers controlling momentum. A further drop below $19 could confirm increased bearish dominance. If buying volume increases, LINK may attempt to stabilize, but a sustained recovery requires breaking past $20. Traders should watch for any signs of reversal or continued downside movement. Chainlink daily chart analysis: LINK trades near key support at $19 The Chainlink (LINK) daily chart shows significant price volatility as the cryptocurrency trades near the key support levels. The Bollinger Bands indicate a widening range, suggesting increased market volatility. Currently, LINK is hovering near the lower band at $19.84, which could act as immediate support. Chainlink daily chart analysis: LINK trades near key support at $19 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 37.60, signaling that LINK is approaching oversold territory. This level suggests potential buying interest if the selling pressure eases. However, the RSI has not yet reversed upward, indicating bearish momentum still dominates. Key resistance lies at the midline of the Bollinger Bands, around $23.77. A sustained move above this level could indicate a reversal toward $27.70, the upper band. Conversely, failure to hold the $19 support may push LINK toward the previous intraday low of $16. LINK 4-hour chart analysis: Struggles near $19 amid bearish pressure Chainlink price analysis on the 4-hour chart reveals LINK is facing resistance near $19.30. The price has been attempting to recover from recent lows but remains below key moving averages, indicating continued bearish pressure. The 50-EMA at $18.835 is acting as immediate support, while the 100-EMA at $20.389 and the 200-EMA at $21.387 serve as major resistance levels. A breakout above $19.30 could push LINK toward $20.00, while rejection may lead to further downside, with $18.50 and $17.30 as key support zones. LINK 4-hour chart analysis: Struggles near $19 amid bearish pressure The MACD indicator shows a weak bullish crossover, with the MACD line slightly above the signal line at 0.062. However, the histogram remains near zero, signaling weak momentum. If buying volume increases, LINK could gain strength and attempt to reclaim $20.00.

Chainlink’s historic price sentiment Chainlink price history Chainlink launched at around $0.20, staying mostly under $1 throughout 2018, with moderate market cap growth. In 2019, LINK saw substantial growth, reaching $1 in May and peaking around $3 by year-end, driven by its utility in providing reliable data feeds for smart contracts. 2020 marked a breakout year as LINK surged from $2 to $20 by August, fueled by DeFi demand. In 2021, it reached an all-time high of around $52 in May but dropped to $22 by mid-year due to market volatility. In 2022, LINK ranged between $15 and $25 amid broader market corrections. In 2023, it further declined, stabilizing in the $6 to $13 range as investor sentiment cooled. Starting 2024 at $15, LINK briefly spiked to $18 in February before falling to $12 by April. The coin’s price has fluctuated throughout 2024, peaking near $15 in May, dropping to around $10 by August, and stabilizing between $10 and $12.28 in October. In November, LINK is trading within the range of $10.68 to $11.94. In December, LINK maintained a range of $18.43 to $30.94. In January 2025, Chainlink peaked at $22.9 but lost momentum towards the end of the month, leading to a trading range of $19.20- $21.00 in February.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,LINK|TRADING|ALTCOIN|ICO|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|SHIB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-13 05:00:40

SOL price is consolidating and might aim for a fresh move above the $200 resistance zone. SOL price started a fresh decline below the $205 and $200 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $200 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $198 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if the bulls clear the $200 zone. Solana Price Faces Hurdles Solana price struggled to clear the $210 resistance and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL declined below the $202 and $200 support levels. It even dived below the $192 level. The recent low was formed at $188 before the price started a recovery wave. There was a move above the $190 and $192 levels. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $209 swing high to the $188 swing low. However, the bears are active below the $200 level. They protected the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $209 swing high to the $188 swing low. Solana is now trading above $200 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $198 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $198 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. The next major resistance is near the $200 level. The main resistance could be $202. A successful close above the $202 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $210. Any more gains might send the price toward the $220 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $200 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $194 zone. The first major support is near the $188 level. A break below the $188 level might send the price toward the $180 zone. If there is a close below the $180 support, the price could decline toward the $175 support in the near term.

The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index has jumped 13% since January 17, the last full trading day before Trump took office, making it the best-performing index among 92 global benchmarks. The broader Hang Seng Index follows closely at 12%, according to Bloomberg data . Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies have plummeted (with Bitcoin even touching $94k at one point), the US dollar has weakened, and the S&P 500 remains stagnant. The unexpected rally in Chinese equities comes despite Trump’s promises to crack down on China. His 10% tariffs on Chinese imports, imposed within his first month, are far below the 60% or more he threatened during his campaign. Investors betting on China’s downfall are now reconsidering as the country’s tech sector gains ground and money managers slowly change their strategies. Chinese AI breakthrough fuels stock surge Chinese tech stocks are leading the market. Alibaba, Lenovo, and BYD have each surged over 33%, Bloomberg reported. On Wednesday, Alibaba jumped 8% after reports claimed the company is working with Apple to bring AI features to China. A key driver behind the surge is DeepSeek, the Chinese AI startup that stunned the global tech industry last month by unveiling an AI model rivaling US tech giants at a fraction of the cost. This of course triggered a reassessment of China’s role in AI development. Investors who once dismissed China’s tech industry as “uninvestable” are now piling in. Hedge funds are taking notice. A Goldman Sachs trader note released last week said that hedge funds bought more Chinese shares than at any time in the past four months. The Hang Seng China gauge closed at its highest level since October. As investor confidence rises, CATL, a major Tesla battery supplier, just filed for a $5 billion listing in Hong Kong, and if approved, it would be a game-changer for the city’s IPO market, which has struggled through a dry spell in deal-making. Trump ramps up tariffs, Modi braces for impact Meanwhile as he promised last week, Trump is moving ahead with his reciprocal tariff plan. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Wednesday that the announcement could come before Trump meets Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday. “I do believe it will come before the prime minister’s visit tomorrow,” she said. Trump’s tariff plan targets any country that imposes import duties on the US “Very simply, it’s if they charge us, we charge them,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, as reported by NBC News. The tariffs are now a key part of his economic strategy. House Speaker Mike Johnson told Reuters that Trump may grant exemptions for pharmaceutical and auto industries, but the broader plan is moving ahead. Trump first imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico, then had to pause them for 30 days after both countries agreed to crack down on illegal border crossings and drug trafficking. On Monday, he signed an order imposing 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Modi, who is visiting Washington, D.C., is trying to avoid a trade war. Reuters, citing government officials, reported that Modi is preparing to cut India’s tariffs across multiple sectors ahead of his meeting with Trump. While in Washington, Modi is set to meet Elon Musk, head of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E). According to a CNBC report , their discussion will focus on expanding Starlink and Tesla operations in India. Wall Street’s volatility eases a bit Despite low volatility levels on Wall Street, demand for options that hedge against tail risks—low probability but high-impact events—has spiked. Many investors are still hoping that Trump will boost corporate profits, but they’re not taking any chances. “If you’re a money manager, do you shift your entire portfolio on the back of one headline? You can’t, because you don’t know if the headline is going to last. So what do you do? You use options,” said Mandy Xu, head of derivatives market intelligence at Cboe Global Markets. She added, “People are nervous and reaching for tail hedges.” The rush for protection has sent option prices surging toward record highs, even though the VIX (Wall Street’s “fear index”) remains below its long-term average, Cboe data shows. Investors are betting heavily on put options that will pay out if the S&P 500, which has risen 3% since late 2024, suddenly tanks. Retail traders are driving most of this demand, Xu said, while hedge funds, pension funds, and asset managers are leaning toward VIX call options instead. But retail investors are also gambling on riskier short-term trades. On Jan. 31st, the same day Trump threatened tariffs, a record-breaking 2.4 million “zero-day” options contracts tied to the S&P 500 were traded—contracts that expire within a day if target prices aren’t hit.

The company is aiming to unify GPT-series and o-series models. OpenAI seems to be taking this approach due to the fact that its offerings have already become too complex, and and the company wants to “return to magic unified intelligence.” He also added that ChatGPT’s free trier will receive unlimited chat access to GPT-5. However, free users will only have access to the standard intelligence setting, which is subject to abuse thresholds. As expected, Plus subscribers will get access to higher-level intelligence, and Pro subscribers will be able to run GPT-5 “at an even higher level of intelligence.” These upcoming models will include features like deep research, search, canvas, voice, and more.

The controversy that broke out on X has sparked a debate about data ownership and ethics within the Web3 and decentralized finance (DeFi) space. DefiLlama is the largest DeFi data analytics platform, providing real-time data across various DeFi protocols. It has proven to be an essential tool for investors and researchers who need reliable metrics in DeFi. Artemis used DeFiLlama’s data without attribution In a tweet that went viral on crypto twitter, @0xngmi said, “i found out that one of our competitors, a vc-backed data site, was using our data without attribution.” Uploaded screenshots by @0xngmi show charts, which both have the source as “Artemis.” @0xngmi explained in the tweet that they had noticed that the competitor’s data was exactly the same as what was in DeFiLlama’s DB, and in a bid to confirm this, they uploaded random numbers into the database of a dead protocol, and “Then those same artificial numbers appeared on their site, on a chart that had ‘Source: Artemis’.” In response to the tweet by @0xngmi, Crystal Tai (@crystaltaixyz), an engineer at Artemis, claims that the attribution issue stemmed from a bug and that Artemis had accurately referenced DefiLlama in other places. hey @0xngmi thanks for flagging this to us apologies, this is a bug in our attribution system we've attributed to defillama in other places but missed a few cases we'll work to get this fixed asap pic.twitter.com/kuT1pncEco — Crystal Tai (@crystaltaixyz) February 12, 2025 Following this, Artemis posted a statement from its X page confirming that it sources certain metrics for certain assets from DeFiLlama. However, the team missed attributing some due to oversight. “We want to clarify that we source some metrics for certain assets from Defillama and have always aimed to properly attribute this data. We had missed attributing fees for a few assets – this was an oversight, which we’ve now corrected.” Open-source projects are vulnerable to data misuse DefiLlama , which is widely known for its comprehensive analytics, has become an essential tool for investors and analysts who need reliable metrics on decentralized platforms. The data it produces gives it a competitive advantage. However, when another company like Artemis, a competitor that also provides real-time data and financial information services on digital assets, fails to acknowledge its use of such data, it strikes at the core of trust and collaborative ethics in the decentralized space. The DeFi and crypto space thrives on decentralization and transparency. So, ethical data handling and use are paramount. Critics of the open-source model have used the rift between both data analytic platforms to revive their argument about how predatory competitors can use data without proper attribution. However, Artemis insists this is only an oversight issue and without malicious intent, saying, “We value data transparency and proper attribution, and have verified all other sources are correctly credited.” Cryptopolitan Academy: FREE Web3 Resume Cheat Sheet - Download Now",News|Artemis|Defillama,EN,0,0,ZRX|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-13 05:50:19

The OCC oversees and regulates national banks that are part of the Federal Reserve System. Meanwhile, Franklin Templeton expanded its OnChain US Government Money Fund (FOBXX) to Solana due to the blockchain’s growing institutional adoption. New York Lawmakers Consider Crypto Task Force New York state Senator James Sanders Jr introduced a new bill proposing the creation of a cryptocurrency task force to investigate the current state of digital assets in the state. The New York State Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Study Act was introduced on Feb. 12, and it aims to establish a 17-member task force to analyze the impact of cryptocurrencies, their adoption, and their effects on tax receipts at both the state and local levels. (Source: The New York State Senate ) According to the bill’s description, the task force will assess the number of digital currencies being traded, the number of cryptocurrency exchanges operating in New York, and the broader implications of crypto on the state's financial ecosystem. Additionally, the task force identified key priorities like the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining, energy consumption, and how New York’s regulatory framework compares to other jurisdictions. If the bill is enacted, task force members will be appointed within 90 days and will be expected to deliver a comprehensive report on their findings before Dec. 15 of 2027. This report will include recommendations for legislative and regulatory measures that could enhance transparency, security, and consumer protection while also addressing the long-term effects of crypto adoption. Currently, the bill is still under committee review and has to undergo floor debates and votes in both the New York Senate and Assembly before it can be signed into law by the governor. New York has long been regarded as a major hub for the crypto industry, yet its regulatory landscape has faced a lot of criticism. The BitLicense program was introduced in 2015, and it requires crypto businesses to get approval from the New York Department of Financial Services to operate in the state. However, industry players and even pro-crypto New York City Mayor Eric Adams argued that the framework is overly restrictive because of its high licensing costs and stringent compliance requirements. Across the United States, interest in cryptocurrency legislation is growing. In fact, more than 20 states are actively considering new bills related to digital assets. Arizona and Utah have already advanced legislation beyond the House committee level. States considering crypto (Source: Bitcoin Reserve Monitor ) Asset manager VanEck suggested that if all proposed state-level crypto bills were to pass, it could generate an estimated $23 billion in additional demand for Bitcoin. Meanwhile, institutional adoption of Bitcoin is also rising as over 100 public entities, including governments and private companies, are accumulating Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. Trump Nominates Former Crypto Executive to Lead OCC Meanwhile, former crypto firm executive Jonathan Gould was nominated by US President Donald Trump to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which is the country’s bank regulator. The White House submitted Gould’s nomination to the Senate on Feb. 11, and if confirmed, he will serve a five-year term as Comptroller of the Currency. (Source: Congress.gov ) Gould previously served as the OCC’s senior deputy comptroller and chief counsel from late 2018 to mid-2021 during Trump’s first administration. Before that, he was a director at BlackRock from 2014 to 2018. More recently, he worked as the chief legal officer of blockchain infrastructure firm Bitfury and is currently a partner at the law firm Jones Day . The OCC oversees and regulates national banks that are part of the Federal Reserve System, including major institutions like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. Overall, it ensures the safety and stability of the US banking system. Kristin Smith , CEO of the Blockchain Association, welcomed Gould’s nomination by stating that he is an excellent choice for the role and has the experience necessary to effectively lead the agency. Avichal Garg , co-founder of investment firm Electric Capital, called the nomination a positive development for fintech and crypto companies due to the fact that Gould supports fair banking access for crypto firms and is opposed to what the industry calls Operation Chokepoint 2.0. This term refers to claims that the Biden administration wanted to cut off crypto firms from banking services. Gould previously shared his concerns about regulatory actions stifling banks’ willingness to engage with crypto businesses. In March of 2023, during a House Financial Services Digital Assets Subcommittee hearing, he warned that certain regulatory measures could have a chilling effect on banks' ability to work with digital asset entities. His nomination comes as Trump administration officials are reportedly exploring whether to merge the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) with the Treasury Department or consolidate its regulatory role with the OCC, according to The Wall Street Journal. This nomination is also part of a broader trend of Trump selecting people with crypto industry ties for key financial regulatory positions. Brian Quintenz , head of policy for Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto division, was also recently nominated to chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). If confirmed, he is expected to advocate for the CFTC to take the lead in crypto regulation over the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Another important nomination is John Hurley , who was tapped to serve as the Treasury’s undersecretary for terrorism and financial crimes. Hurley reportedly invested in Bitcoin, and is expected to focus on anti-money laundering enforcement and stablecoin oversight. Franklin Templeton Launches FOBXX on Solana Franklin Templeton, a leading US-based financial services company, announced the launch of its OnChain US Government Money Fund (FOBXX) on Solana. The fund was originally launched in 2021, and FOBXX primarily invests in US government securities, cash, and fully collateralized repurchase agreements, offering minimal credit risk. As of Jan. 31 of 2025, the fund managed $512 million in assets, with a seven-day effective yield of 4.2%. A Franklin Templeton representative shared that the decision to expand to Solana aligns with the blockchain’s growing institutional adoption. The fund is already available on multiple networks, including Ethereum and Avalanche, as well as layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum, Base, Polygon, and Aptos. It is recognized as the first US mutual fund to use blockchain for record-keeping and transaction processing, with each BENJI token representing one share in the fund. The launch of FOBXX on Solana happened after the recent debut of another tokenized institutional investment fund, the Apollo Diversified Credit Securitize Fund, on the same blockchain. Franklin Templeton has been actively expanding its presence in the digital asset sector, and even launched Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in early 2024. It is also currently seeking approval from the SEC for a Crypto Index ETF. In addition to expanding its tokenized asset offerings, Franklin Templeton has been increasing its involvement with Solana as well. On Feb. 10, the firm registered a trust in Delaware linked to a Solana ETF. However, there are still some regulatory hurdles that need to be overcome as lawsuits continue to challenge whether SOL should be classified as an unregistered security.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-13 05:55:53

Recent data from ARK Invest highlights Bitcoin’s aggregate cost basis reaching a record $40,980, underscoring growing investor confidence and a potential long-term support level. At the same time, projections for Bitcoin’s future price remain optimistic, with ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood reaffirming the firm’s $1.5 million bull case, driven by increasing institutional exposure. While short-term volatility persists amid economic data releases and geopolitical tensions, analysts point to key indicators—such as the 200-week moving average and Bitcoin’s dwindling exchange reserves—as signs of resilience and potential future growth. Bitcoin’s Path to $1.5 Million Gains Momentum as Institutional Interest Grows The possibility of Bitcoin reaching $1.5 million per coin is becoming increasingly realistic, according to ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood. With institutional investors steadily increasing their exposure to digital assets, Bitcoin’s bullish trajectory remains strong despite short-term market fluctuations. Bitcoin (BTC) has faced resistance near the psychological $100,000 level since Feb. 4, following global economic tensions fueled by new import tariffs imposed by the United States and China. This geopolitical uncertainty momentarily dampened investor sentiment, but long-term projections for Bitcoin remain overwhelmingly positive. Cathie Wood, a well-known advocate for Bitcoin’s long-term value, reaffirmed ARK Invest’s bullish outlook in a video released on Feb. 11. “Many people know us for our [Bitcoin] bull case, $1.5 million,” Wood stated . “We actually think the odds have gone up that our bull case will be the right number because of what is becoming the institutionalization of this new asset class.” As institutional adoption accelerates, more large-scale investors are considering Bitcoin as a core portfolio asset. Wood emphasized that Bitcoin’s return and risk profile are vastly different from traditional asset classes, making it an attractive hedge against economic instability. Institutional investors have played a crucial role in Bitcoin’s journey toward mainstream acceptance. With the rise of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), traditional financial entities now have easier access to Bitcoin investments, leading to significant inflows of capital. Publicly traded companies such as Tesla and MicroStrategy have already incorporated Bitcoin into their balance sheets, and more institutions are expected to follow suit. The continued rise of Bitcoin ETFs further supports this narrative, with institutions leveraging these financial instruments to gain exposure to digital assets without directly holding Bitcoin. Institutional demand is a key driver of long-term price appreciation, as these investors typically have a lower turnover rate than retail traders, leading to reduced volatility and sustained price appreciation. The increased allocation of Bitcoin in institutional portfolios is likely to act as a catalyst for further upward movement in the market. ARK Invest’s latest report, Big Ideas 2025, outlines a compelling case for Bitcoin’s trajectory toward the $1.5 million mark by the end of the decade. According to the report, Bitcoin would need to maintain an average compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 58% over the next five years to reach this ambitious target. While this represents the firm’s most optimistic scenario, ARK Invest also provided a base case projection of $710,000 per BTC by 2030, assuming a 40% CAGR. In the bear case, even a more conservative growth rate of 21% would see Bitcoin reaching $300,000 by the decade’s end. Despite the long-term optimism, Bitcoin faces short-term hurdles, with analysts pointing to the $100,000 resistance level as a critical psychological and technical barrier. Iliya Kalchev, a market analyst at Nexo, highlighted that Bitcoin’s next move depends on whether it can decisively break above this level. “A failure to breach could lead to short-term selling pressure toward $95,000, while a successful move might push prices toward the next resistance at approximately $106,500,” Kalchev noted. Bitcoin’s Supply Shock Could Fuel Further Growth Another factor contributing to Bitcoin’s long-term price potential is its decreasing supply on crypto exchanges. According to data from CryptoQuant, only 2.5 million BTC remain available for trading on centralized exchanges. This supply crunch, coupled with increasing institutional demand, could lead to a classic supply shock scenario, where strong buyer interest and limited availability drive prices upward. Historically, Bitcoin’s price has seen substantial growth during periods of declining exchange reserves. As more investors move their Bitcoin to cold storage or long-term holdings, the available circulating supply diminishes, intensifying the scarcity effect and putting upward pressure on prices. While short-term market fluctuations and macroeconomic uncertainties may continue to impact Bitcoin’s price action, the long-term outlook remains overwhelmingly bullish. With institutional adoption gaining momentum and Bitcoin’s supply dwindling, ARK Invest’s prediction of $1.5 million per coin by 2030 is increasingly plausible. Cathie Wood and ARK Invest have consistently emphasized that Bitcoin represents more than just a speculative asset—it is evolving into a core component of institutional investment strategies. If current adoption trends persist, Bitcoin’s role as a global store of value may become firmly cemented, reinforcing its potential to reach unprecedented price levels in the years ahead. Bitcoin’s Aggregate Cost Basis Hits Record High as Market Matures In related news, Bitcoin’s aggregate cost basis—a fundamental metric assessing the original value of all Bitcoin holdings—reached an all-time high of $40,980 at the end of 2024, according to ARK Invest’s Big Ideas 2025 report . Over the past year, Bitcoin’s cost basis surged by 86%, reaching a total value of $811.7 billion. Some analysts interpret this metric as an indication of Bitcoin’s fair long-term value, potentially forming a strong support level during future bear markets. Notably, Adam Back, co-founder of Blockstream, has suggested that Bitcoin’s “floor price” has surpassed the $40,000 threshold, highlighting its growing resilience in the face of market fluctuations. Key market indicators suggest that Bitcoin’s floor price is approaching $44,000. A significant factor in this assessment is the 200-week moving average, a widely used technical indicator that smooths daily volatility to gauge long-term market trends. On Feb. 11, the 200-week moving average climbed to $43,983, with Bitcoin trading above $95,740, according to CoinGlass data. The 200-week moving average surpassed the critical $40,000 psychological mark on Oct. 18, 2024, reinforcing the notion that Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory remains bullish. Adam Back emphasized the significance of this indicator, calling it Bitcoin’s “up-only” price benchmark and a reliable measure of the asset’s historical floor. Macroeconomic Data May Influence Bitcoin’s Near-Term Price Despite its strong long-term outlook, Bitcoin remains sensitive to short-term macroeconomic trends. Investors are closely monitoring upcoming economic data, including the United States Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for January, set to be released on Feb. 12. Inflation readings and central bank policies could influence Bitcoin’s near-term price movements by shaping investor sentiment. According to Iliya Kalchev, a market analyst at Nexo, an unexpectedly high CPI reading could shift investor focus toward potential rate hikes, leading to short-term price volatility. In addition to US inflation data, upcoming economic reports from Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom will provide further insight into global market conditions, which could also impact Bitcoin’s trajectory. Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience above the $95,000 mark despite recent market turbulence. On Feb. 9, Bitcoin endured one of its most significant intraday sell-offs since 2022—comparable to the aftermath of Three Arrows Capital’s collapse. This selling event was largely driven by escalating trade tensions between the United States, China, and other major economies, raising investor concerns about potential economic disruptions. While geopolitical and macroeconomic factors continue to influence short-term price movements, Bitcoin’s increasing aggregate cost basis suggests strong long-term conviction among investors. As institutional adoption continues to grow and Bitcoin solidifies its position as a global store of value, analysts remain optimistic about its future price trajectory.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|ASIA,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-13 06:00:00

A Close Look at Realized Price and Institutional Activity,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/is-ethereum-undervalued-a-close-look-at-realized-price-and-institutional-activity/,"Ethereum price action amid the broader crypto market bearish sentiment over recent weeks hasn’t been any different from the performance recorded in the past months. Over this period, Ethereum’s price has struggled to gain significant upward momentum, remaining in a prolonged consolidation phase. Amid this, a recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor MAC_D has shed light on Ethereum’s current state and factors that may influence its future price trajectory. The analysis notes that Ethereum’s “ultrasound money” narrative—an idea tied to its post-Merge deflationary tokenomics—has faced challenges. Total supply has reached record highs, and the staking ratio has decreased by 1% since November. However, despite these supply-side hurdles, several demand-side factors suggest Ethereum might be positioned for long-term growth. Related Reading: Ethereum Outflows On Derivative Exchanges Hit Record Lows: What It Means for ETH Undervaluation, Holder Behavior, and Institutional Interest One other key insight from the analysis is that Ethereum appears undervalued based on its realized price. The realized price reflects the average acquisition cost of ETH holdings across all wallets, currently sitting at approximately $2,200. With the current market price around $2,600, the analyst calculates a market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio slightly above 1, indicating that ETH remains undervalued relative to historical norms. This level could act as a strong support base, potentially limiting further downside. Another factor supporting Ethereum’s potential upside is the behavior of long-term holders. The analysis highlights an increasing number of addresses that accumulate Ethereum without selling, akin to Bitcoin’s “permanent holders.” Although some larger investors have sold during recent downturns, their positions have been absorbed by these long-term holders, helping stabilize the market. This trend suggests that Ethereum’s investor base is maturing, with a growing segment committed to holding the asset through market volatility. Ethereum: A Major Rebound On The Horizon? Furthermore, the analyst points out that selling pressure in the futures market has eased. Data shows a notable reduction in market price trading volume on the sell side since Ethereum’s price near $4,000 in November last year. This decline in selling activity, even as prices fell, signals a relative influx of buying power, which could set the stage for a recovery if market conditions improve. Institutional participation is another encouraging factor. Major players, including BlackRock, Cumberland, and other prominent firms, have reportedly accumulated substantial amounts of ETH during the recent downturn. For example, BlackRock is said to have purchased over 100,000 ETH, valued at more than $270 million. Such significant institutional inflows not only boost demand but also lend credibility to Ethereum’s long-term investment thesis. Despite these positive indicators, the analysis acknowledges lingering challenges. The increase in total supply and the slight dip in the staking ratio could weigh on sentiment, particularly if macroeconomic conditions remain uncertain. Related Reading: Analyst Says You’ll Regret Not Buying Ethereum At These Prices, Here’s Where It’s Headed Moreover, Ethereum’s price movement may remain constrained in the short term as the broader market digests ongoing economic shifts. However, the combination of undervaluation, strong long-term holder participation, reduced selling pressure, and institutional accumulation paints a more optimistic medium- to long-term outlook. While Ethereum may continue to trade sideways in the near term, the factors outlined in the analysis suggest that it could be well-positioned for growth once broader market conditions stabilize.

The 19b-4 filed by the Cboe BZX Exchange is for a product called the “21Shares Core Ethereum ETF”, which was previously named ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF. Its purpose is to allow staking of the ETF’s Ethereum holdings. “I believe this is the first ETF to file with the SEC and request the ability to permit staking,” said Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart. “The final deadline for this filing will be somewhere around the end of October,” he added.

Staking rewards would be treated as income for the fund, which will use trusted staking providers. There are key differences from “Staking-as-a-Service.” The ETF will only stake ETH held by the Trust itself, it will not pool with other entities’ ETH, will not advertise staking services or promise specific returns, and will not subsidize slashing risks. “Not staking the Trust’s Ether would amount to waiving the Trust’s right to free additional Ether, an act analogous to an equity ETP refusing dividends from the companies it holds,” it explained. “Allowing the Trust to stake its Ether would benefit investors and help the Trust to better track the returns associated with holding Ether.” In January, the SEC announced a new crypto task force dedicated to developing regulations for the space led by the pro-crypto Commissioner Hester Peirce , who had earlier hinted that staked ETH ETFs would be approved under the new administration. Ethereum prices gained 8% over the past 12 hours following the news, hitting an intraday high of $2,790 from a low of $2,565, according to CoinGecko. The asset retreated slightly during the Thursday morning Asian trading session to $2,720 at the time of writing. However, ETH remains bearish, having lost 26% from its 2025 high of $3,700 in early January, and no recent news or bullish fundamentals have been able to change that trend. ETH ETF Latest Institutional investors also seem to be getting cold feet on ETH as US spot ETFs saw their second outflow day of the month on Wednesday. $41 million left the products, with Grayscale (ETHE) shedding $30 million, while Fidelity (FETH) lost almost $11 million. BlackRock’s ETHA fund saw zero flows for the day. Nevertheless, it was also recently reported that Goldman Sachs had increased its ETH exposure and held almost $500 million in Ethereum ETFs, split equally between BlackRock and Fidelity.

In a recent filling submitted as a Form 19b-4, Cboe BZX has requested SEC approval for the Ethereum ( ETH ) held within the fund to be staked. This is first time an ETF in the U.S. has proposed staking. If approved, this would allow investors to earn rewards by staking their ether, which is something not currently possible in Ethereum ETFs. Staking involves locking up ETH to help secure the Ethereum network while earning passive income in the process. Staking could open up new opportunities for investors to earn extra returns compared to just holding ETH ETFs. Cboe BZX plans to use a “point-and-click” method for staking, meaning the ETH won’t be moved, lowering the risk of theft during the staking process. You might also like: Ethereum ETFs added 16% of their lifetime inflows in one week—is a breakout coming? Despite being certified last year, the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF did not allow for staking. The SEC has been hesitant to allow staking in ETFs because of worries that it would violate securities laws. However, leadership changes within the SEC have renewed investors’ confidence that the regulator might finally consider staking in ETF products. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has been advocating for regulatory changes that would allow Ethereum ETFs to include staking. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart expressed optimism about the filing’s chances, saying he believes it will likely be approved.

As of now, ETH price has recorded a gain of 5.5% and trading around $2728 . This surge has stirred excitement among crypto users questioning the reason behind the surge. Cboe files for 21Shares Ethereum ETF One big reason for Ethereum’s price surge is a new ETF proposal. Recently Cboe BZX Exchange has filed a request with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow staking for the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF. If approved, this would let Ethereum holdings earn rewards while staying secure with the custodian. This staking method reduces security risks and could attract more institutional investors. Since the SEC has up to 240 days to decide. Whale Accumulating ETH Massively Ethereum is also getting a boost from large whales. Recent on-chain data shows that over 600,000 ETH was bought by whales last week alone. This suggests that major whales are positioning themselves ahead of a potential price breakout. Whales have bought over 600,000 #Ethereum $ETH in the past week! pic.twitter.com/y736DxlGSP — Ali (@ali_charts) February 12, 2025 When whales buy in large amounts and move their holdings off exchanges, it reduces the available supply. This can create buying pressure, pushing the price higher. Ethereum L2 Growing Adoption Another key factor supporting Ethereum’s rise is the growing adoption of Layer 2 solutions. Recently, Tether announced it will use Ethereum’s Arbitrum network to support a new cross-chain system. This move strengthens Ethereum’s position as a leading blockchain for financial applications. With lower transaction costs and faster processing, more companies may start using Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions, boosting its value. Ethereum Eye For $3000 Looking at Ethereum’s price charts, analysts see strong potential for further gains. ETH has been trading within a key range since early 2024, holding support near $2,200 while facing resistance around $4,100. For Ethereum to continue its upward trend, it needs to break above the $2,817 to $3,000 range . If ETH secures support at this level, it could set the stage for a rally toward $4,000. However, technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic Oscillator suggest that bearish momentum still exists, meaning traders should remain cautious.",News,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-13 06:07:06

The price is now eyeing to break the $2.50 mark and is now bouncing from an important support zone. However, according to analyst Josh of Crypto World, there are significant resistance levels above, which could limit its movement in the short term. he primary support for XRP lies between $2.25 and $2.30. As long as the price stays above this range, there’s potential for the price to hold steady or recover. On the upside, XRP faces resistance between $2.58 and $2.73, with an additional resistance point around $2.53 based on recent highs. Short-Term Outlook: Range-Bound Movement The price of XRP had been showing a bullish divergence, but this signal has recently been invalidated, reducing confidence in a strong upward move. Despite this, XRP is still holding above its support zone, which means there is a possibility for price stability in the near term. Given the current support and resistance levels, XRP is likely to remain within a sideways price range over the next few days, unless a breakout above resistance or a breakdown below support occurs. Bearish Divergence and Market Sentiment On larger timeframes, such as the daily and 3-day charts, there is still a larger bearish divergence present, which could indicate further downside risk. However, the strong support currently in place should prevent a significant drop in the short term, at least for now. Bitcoin’s Influence on XRP XRP’s price often mirrors the trend of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin moves sideways, XRP is likely to follow suit.

This volatility in the last 24 hours has triggered a strong $75 million in BTC liquidations. Market analysts are closely watching whether there’s enough bullish momentum to pull BTC above $97,530 or not. Bitcoin Price Faces a Make-or-Break Situation Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez has identified $97,530 as a critical resistance level for Bitcoin (BTC) in its current market trajectory. Martinez also cautioned that support below $92,110 is notably weak, highlighting a significant gap between $90,000 and $70,000. This analysis suggests that if Bitcoin were to fall below the $92,110 level, it could face accelerated downward momentum due to the lack of strong support in the $20,000 range as shown in the below image. Source: Ali charts Crypto analyst Rekt Capital has shared a similar opinion noting that Bitcoin price is once again nearing the pivotal light blue resistance level (in the below image) at $97,700. For the cryptocurrency to confirm its bullish trajectory, it must secure a daily close above this level or perform a successful retest. A breakthrough at this key resistance point could pave the way for continued upward momentum. Source: Rekt Capital As of press time, the BTC price is trading 1.06% up at $96,753 with its daily trading volume up 32% to more than $48 billion. The Coinglass data shows that the 24-hour liquidations have surged to $76 million of which over $40 million is in long liquidation. The surge in US CPI for January led to major market turbulence on Wednesday. Bitcoin Retail Wallets on the Decline Blockchain analytics firm Santiment added that although top altcoins like Ethereum, and XRP, have seen their networks growing with the addition of new wallets, the same is not the case for Bitcoin. Blockchain analytics firm Santiment has observed a decline in retail participation in cryptocurrency markets, attributing the drop to fears of further price declines across the sector. Historically, such retreats by small traders have signaled potential positive outcomes for mid- to long-term Bitcoin price performance. According to Santiment, large holders, including whales and sharks, often take advantage of these periods of fear, accumulating assets at discounted prices. Source: Santiment BTC Whale Accumulation Is Surging On the other hand, the Bitcoin whale accumulation has been on the rise recently. Whale activity in Bitcoin’s spot market has surged to a multi-year high, as indicated by a steady rise in the Exchange Whale Ratio since late 2024. While market momentum has recently cooled, historical trends suggest that reduced whale deposits on exchanges often precede Bitcoin rallies. This development could hint at a potential shift in market dynamics, with investors closely watching for signs of renewed upward momentum for Bitcoin price. Source: CryptoQuant On the other hand, the discussions around Bitcoin strategic reserves persist even today. VanEck’s Head of Digital Assets, Matthew Sigel, forecasts that proposed Bitcoin reserve bill s could inject $23 billion in buying pressure, potentially leading to the purchase of 247,000 BTC if implemented.

Boasting enormous social-media traction and armies of meme-loving investors, both aim to outdo each other through quick pumps and spirited branding. Yet the market also whispers about a PayFi alt that might overshadow comedic tokens. Many now believe Remittix (RTX) could leap 50x by July if adoption accelerates. Below, we explore how the DOGE vs PEPE showdown reflects a broader meme coin rivalry, and why a cross-border solution might soon outshine even the most viral memes. DOGE vs PEPE Showdown Intensifies Although Dogecoin pioneered meme-based crypto, PEPE exploded onto the scene last year, generating swift gains for early backers. Aggregator data shows Dogecoin’s daily volume hovering in the billions, yet its price can swing wildly if celebrity interest dips. Pepe soared hundreds of percent in days, then retraced when whales sold out or social-media chatter faded. Critics claim both tokens rely heavily on influencer pushes, lacking deeper financial use. Meanwhile, analysts eye 2025 for decisive momentum: will DOGE’s brand loyalty prevail, or can PEPE maintain fresh mania? The market’s short attention span means each meme coin must consistently deliver hype to stay afloat. Remittix Synergy Could Upend Meme Dominance While memes battle for online clout, Remittix addresses a multi-trillion-dollar remittance market, already attracting $11.7 million in presale funds. Instead of comedic marketing, Remittix (RTX) promises cheaper cross-border payments. Think of a teacher in Southeast Asia paid in crypto: with Remittix, she can convert digital funds into local cash at minimal cost, bypassing expensive wire services. Liquidity locks for three years plus contract renouncement post-presale aim to reduce rug-pull fears. Skeptics note that success hinges on forging partnerships and building user-friendly apps, but bridging finance resonates more deeply than meme-driven antics. If Remittix nails compliance and straightforward interfaces, a 50x leap by July might not be far-fetched. Those intrigued by real utility can explore Remittix before tokens run out. Meme Coin Rivalry Meets PayFi Reality In this meme coin rivalry, DOGE and PEPE thrive on comedic appeal, yet aggregator data reveals a pattern: massive gains often fade unless new hype arrives. Remittix (RTX), by contrast, stands to grow through daily usage. Bills, rent, or cross-border remittances could all become easier if families tap RTX to convert crypto into local currency in minutes. That real-world edge may prove more sustainable than waiting on a tweet from a famous personality. Of course, meme coins still attract thrill-seekers craving explosive short-term returns. Yet as adoption matters more in a maturing market, practical solutions might overshadow even the wildest memes. Could Remittix Eclipse DOGE And PEPE? While DOGE and PEPE continue to dominate memes, some watchers suspect their longevity depends on repeated social-media pushes. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) aims to solve tangible money-transfer headaches, which may yield stronger, longer-lasting growth. The DOGE vs PEPE showdown remains entertaining, yet stable user adoption can be elusive without utility. Remittix may flourish as PayFi tokens gain traction among freelancers, migrant workers, and small businesses looking to escape wire transfer fees. Analysts believe a 50x by July is plausible if Remittix meets regulatory needs and mainstream partnerships. If comedic memes hold less appeal than bridging real finances, head to Remittix before presale tokens vanish. Whether DOGE or PEPE can maintain the meme crown for 2025 remains uncertain. One thing’s clear: everyday problems often trump novelty, paving the way for altcoins offering actual solutions to emerge as the true winners in a rapidly evolving crypto arena.

Recently, both the SEC and Binance requested a Washington, D.C. federal judge to pause the ongoing enforcement action for two months. This pause is seen as part of the agency’s effort to develop a clearer framework through its newly formed crypto task force. As part of this process, the SEC may reconsider its entire approach to crypto regulation, potentially influencing the ongoing Ripple case. The Ripple Case in Context: A Pause Amidst Regulatory Uncertainty The ongoing litigation involving Ripple has become emblematic of the larger questions surrounding the SEC’s jurisdiction over cryptocurrencies. John Reed Stark, a former SEC official, has analyzed the potential impact of the SEC’s shift in enforcement strategy, suggesting that Ripple and similar cases could be stalled or resolved with favorable outcomes for the defendants. Stark predicts a disruption in the SEC’s crypto enforcement efforts, with a shift towards pausing ongoing litigation and reconsidering how digital assets are classified under U.S. securities laws. Ripple, which has been embroiled in a legal battle with the SEC over the classification of its XRP token, is particularly affected by the SEC’s reconsideration of its crypto enforcement strategy. The SEC’s initial position was that XRP, as a cryptocurrency, should be treated as a security. Stark’s View on the Future of Crypto Regulation While Stark recognizes the regulatory vacuum in crypto space, he has also been outspoken about the dangers he believes cryptocurrencies pose. He critiques the crypto industry’s propensity for fraud, manipulation, and systemic risks, particularly citing the connection between crypto assets and criminal activities like ransomware and human trafficking. Criticizing the agency, he wrote, “The Stark reality is that shutting down the SEC’s crypto-enforcement program will make matters a lot worse not only for investors but for everyone everywhere. The crypto-contagion will spread like a plague and infect all aspects of global securities markets — including those who have nothing to do with, and want nothing to do with, digital assets.”",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|BNB|EXCHANGE|XRP|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-13 07:07:26

The company is engaging with Indian regulators to ensure compliance as the government reconsiders its stance on crypto policies. Coinbase in Talks with Indian Authorities According to TechCrunch , Coinbase is in talks with Indian authorities, including the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), which monitors financial transactions. The company is focused on meeting regulatory requirements and is optimistic about its return. A Coinbase spokesperson stated, “We are excited about the opportunities in India and are committed to complying with local regulations.” Coinbase’s renewed interest in India comes as part of its larger global expansion plans. Recently, its Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, joined the board of the U.S.-India Business Council (USIBC), strengthening ties between the two countries in the financial sector. India’s Changing Crypto Policies This decision came after the company stopped allowing new users in India in June 2023. India has strict rules for digital assets, even though their use is growing. Coinbase had initially entered India in April 2022, launching support for the Unified Payments Interface (UPI). However, the service was suspended just three days later after India’s National Payments Corporation refused to acknowledge Coinbase’s operations. Despite India’s strict regulations, crypto adoption continues to grow. The government imposed a 30% tax on crypto income and a 1% tax on each transaction in 2022, discouraging many investors. However, with policy adjustments happening worldwide, India may take a softer approach to crypto regulations in the future. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Binance Lawsuit Paused, Former SEC Official Says Ripple Lawsuit Could Be ‘Fully Withdrawn’ , Binance Takes the Lead In India Coinbase’s stronger rival, Binance the world’s largest crypto exchange successfully resumed operations in India in August 2023 after addressing compliance issues.

The additions include Michael Turner, former president of Oxford Properties and global head of real estate at OMERS, one of Canada's largest pension funds, alongside Jaime Leverton, ex-CEO of Hut 8 Mining (HUT), and Doug Mouton, a data center development veteran from Microsoft and Meta, the company said in a release on Thursday . The appointments come as Riot considers repurposing its mining infrastructure, particularly its Corsicana Facility in Texas, for AI workloads, and has tapped investment banks Evercore and Northland Capital Markets to assist with this transition. Riot’s move follows a broader industry trend as miners seek new revenue streams amid rising energy costs and lower mining rewards after the recent Bitcoin halving.

As a result of this move, ETH has formed a key support level at $2,680 that could provide the last buying opportunity before a new ATH. Ethereum price analysis forecasts a bullish reversal that could set up a new all-time high of $5,200 next. Realized Ethereum Price Bands Forecast Next ETH Target is $5,200 Based on CryptoQuant data , the realized Ethereum price bands showcase key support and resistance levels. The realized price metric tracks the price at which each ETH was last transacted . For ETH, the realized price hovers around $2,263, which was tagged on February 3 after a massive crypto market correction. The upper realized price band is 2.3 standard deviations, and the lower is 0.5 standard deviations. The chart shows that most Ethereum cycle tops and bottoms have occurred close to the upper and lower realized price bands, respectively. The upper realized Ethereum price band stands at $5,206, which is the next target for ETH bulls. Realized Ethereum Price Bands Considering the recent recovery and stabilization around $2,600 and Wednesday’s 5.21% rally, the momentum seems to be picking up, indicating that ETH is ready for a reversal. Ethereum Price Analysis: Key Levels to Watch Ethereum price prediction notes several key hurdles that investors need to watch. The next key but minor hurdles include the previous month and previous week VWAPs at $2,683 and $3,306, respectively. If Ethereum manages to flip this key hurdle into a support level, it could lead to a retest of $4,000, the next critical psychological level, where investors can consider booking profits . With such a bullish Ethereum price forecast, investors can expect ETH to not only revisit ATH of $4,868 but also set up a new one at $5,200 . ETH/USDT 3-day chart While realized price bands forecast the next ATH target and Ethereum price analysis backs up this claim, lets’s take a look at other on-chain metrics that support a reversal for ETH in the coming months. ETH Network Growth in an Uptrend Despite the recent market corrections , the 30-day averages of the Network Growth and Daily Active Addresses are on an uptrend . The Network Growth metric tracks the number of new addresses joining the Ethereum network, signaling capital inflow. The daily active address spike signals investors’ interest in ETH at the current levels. Both on-chain metrics are painting a bullish picture for Ethereum price reversal. ETH Network Growth and Daily Active Addresses 1-Year ETH Holders At Loss The 365-day MVRV tracks the average profit/loss of investors who purchased ETH over a year ago. Currently, this indicator hovers around -14%, indicating the average loss of these holders. The last time the MVRV dropped into this level was in Q3, 2024, which sparked a bottom formation and restarted the uptrend that pushed the Ethereum price close to $4,000 in the next four months. ETH 365-day MVRV Whales Bought Ethereum (ETH) on Recent Dips Tying the above three indicators together is the whale transaction count indicator. The chart below contains two metrics: one that tracks transfers worth $100K or more and the other for more than $1 million. A spike in ETH whale transaction count after a rally suggests profit-taking and could lead to top formation and correction . On the other hand, if the ETH price crashes and this indicator spikes, it denotes accumulation. As seen below, the July 2024 spike in whale transfer marked a top formation, leading to a steep correction. On the other hand, the uptick in early August 2024 formed a bottom, sparking a minor bounce and eventually a rally toward $4,000. The February 3 crash led to a spike in whale transfers worth more than $100K and $1M, signaling a massive accumulation spree . All these signs point to one thing – a renewed interest in Ethereum and a potential reversal that leads to a price rally to new highs. Whale Transaction Count To conclude, Ethereum price seems primed for a bullish reversal as indicated by the 365-day MVRV, growth in daily active addresses and network growth. The 5.2% gain on Wednesday is just the start of this uptrend, with a target of $5,200, as indicated by the realized price bands metric.

According to a recent Bloomberg report , Waller stated that stablecoins have the potential to expand the reach of the U.S. dollar on an international scale. However, the scale and utility of stablecoins will depend on a clear set of regulations. In a conference in San Francisco, Waller said the stablecoin market requires a regulatory framework that encompasses stablecoin risks “directly, fully, and narrowly” before financial institutions will be able to issue them. “This framework should allow both non-banks and banks to issue regulated stablecoins and should consider the effects of regulation on the payments landscape,” said Waller. Stablecoins are digital currencies known for their steady value because they are typically pegged to fiat currencies, most commonly the U.S. dollar or Treasury bills. Two of the largest stablecoins by market cap, USDT ( USDT ) and USDC ( USDC ), are both pegged to the U.S. dollar. You might also like: Stablecoin transaction value in 2024 surpasses Visa and Mastercard Waller’s remarks echo those of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in February last year. Powell expressed wholehearted support for the creation of a stablecoin framework in a meeting with the House Financial Services Committee, reiterating the Fed’s commitment to developing stablecoins and Central Bank Digital Currencies in the U.S. More recently, Rep. Maxine Waters, the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, introduced a proposal for stabelcoin oversight involving the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Reserve. Earlier this month, Republican Chair of the House Financial Services Committee, French Hill, had submitted a draft bill for stablecoin regulation, co-sponsored by Rep. Bryan Steil. In contrast to Water’s proposal, Hill’s bill grants stablecoin oversight to the OCC instead of the Federal Reserve. This means that both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have introduced stablecoin regulations under the Trump administration. Read more: Rep.

Right now, Brett (BRETT) is seeing a 10.8% increase in trading volume, signaling renewed interest in the Base Chain meme coin. Floki Inu (FLOKI) remains one of the most recognized meme coins, continuing to attract investors. But one coin is making the biggest waves—BTFD Coin (BTFD). With a powerful Bulls Squad backing it, a presale surpassing $6 million, and a projected moonshot to $0.006, BTFD Coin is quickly positioning itself as one of the top new meme coins to invest in this month . The hype is real, and early investors are lining up to secure a spot before this opportunity disappears. BTFD Coin’s Bulls Squad Eyes a 3,650% Moonshot Something big is happening in the BTFD Coin ecosystem. This isn’t just another meme token—it’s a movement powered by the Bulls Squad, a growing army of crypto believers looking to take BTFD straight to the top. The presale has already raised over $6 million, and more than 69 billion tokens have been sold. With just a few stages left before the final presale closes, the FOMO is reaching new heights. The hype around BTFD Coin’s projected $0.006 price isn’t just speculation. Analysts are backing this number, and the math speaks for itself. Right now, investors can buy at just $0.00016, which means massive gains are on the table. Let’s break it down: if an investor puts $15,000 into BTFD Coin at Stage 14, they’d get 93,750,000 tokens. At the listing price of $0.0006, that investment becomes $56,250. But if BTFD hits the projected moonshot price of $0.006, that $15,000 investment turns into a mind-blowing $562,500—a 3,650% ROI that could be life-changing. Getting into BTFD Coin is straightforward. Investors just need to set up a wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT, and connect it to the presale page . With the LAUNCH100 bonus code, every purchase during Stage 14 is doubled, giving investors even more potential gains. The Bulls Squad isn’t just about numbers—it’s about momentum. This community is made up of traders, crypto enthusiasts, and early believers who see the potential of BTFD Coin and are ready to run with the bulls. With a P2E game, staking rewards of 90% APY, and exclusive benefits for early adopters, BTFD Coin is shaping up to be one of the top new meme coins to invest in this month.

Tied to one of crypto’s most beloved cultural icons, Brett has solidified its position in the rapidly expanding Base Chain ecosystem. As more projects launch on Base, Brett’s exposure and potential for growth increase. Despite recent market shifts, Brett has seen a 10.8% surge in trading volume, indicating renewed investor interest. The meme coin’s connection to the ever-growing Base Chain community could set the stage for further expansion. With its mascot status and strong community backing, Brett is making a name for itself among the top new meme coins to invest in this month. Floki Inu’s Meme Status Keeps It in the Spotlight Floki Inu (FLOKI) continues to hold a special place in the meme coin market. Named after Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu, Floki has built a community-driven ecosystem that thrives on viral marketing and meme culture. With a 7% drop in the last 24 hours, FLOKI is still holding strong as one of the most widely recognized meme coins in crypto. Its longstanding reputation and passionate community continue to push its presence forward. As meme coins evolve, Floki remains a key player in the space, consistently attracting traders and investors looking for potential gains. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin, Brett, and Floki Inu are some of the top new meme coins to invest in this month. Each project has a strong community, high market activity, and solid potential for future growth. But BTFD Coin is leading the charge, with over $6M raised, a 3,650% potential ROI , and an engaged Bulls Squad fueling its momentum.

While Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate the DeFi space and Ripple (XRP) solidifies its position in cross-border payments, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL has proven to be the standout investment. With $1.9 million raised in minutes during its presale, it has cemented its position as the ultimate opportunity of 2025. Why THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL Is the Next Big Opportunity 1.

Deflationary Tokenomics With a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL creates scarcity that directly drives value. Its deflationary model offers early investors significant advantages, surpassing the gradual inflationary nature of tokens like APT and INJ. 3. Exclusive Availability Unlike BTC and ETH, which are traded on virtually every platform, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL is exclusively available at MAGACOINOFFICIAL. This exclusivity creates a controlled market environment, driving demand and making it an excellent choice for early adopters. How It Compares to Other Top Cryptos Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin may have hit $100K, but its market is mature, making THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL a stronger choice for exponential returns. Ethereum (ETH): A leader in smart contracts, ETH offers stability, but it lacks the exclusivity and early-stage growth of THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL. Aptos (APT): Aptos focuses on scalability but hasn’t captured the same market excitement as this token. Injective Protocol (INJ): INJ excels in DeFi but cannot compete with the overwhelming momentum of THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL. Seize the Opportunity Now Bitcoin’s success paved the way for standout cryptos like THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL to dominate the market. With limited supply, overwhelming demand, and exclusive availability, it’s the ultimate choice for investors seeking the next big win.

Currently trading at $2.45, up 0.92% from the previous day, XRP has demonstrated resilience amid fluctuating market conditions. Many analysts are confident that the digital asset will enjoy bullish momentum in 2025, and we consulted ChatGPT to see how high the asset can climb. ChatGPT provided an estimated price range for XRP in 2025, suggesting that the token could trade between $3 and $10 depending on several key factors. Bullish Scenario: XRP Reaches $7 to $10 According to ChatGPT, a bullish outlook for XRP would require a combination of favorable regulatory developments, increased adoption, and a strong market cycle. ChatGPT outlined the following factors that could push the digital asset toward the $7 to $10 range: Regulatory Clarity: “If Ripple secures more favorable legal outcomes against the SEC, institutional investors may flood in.” Experts have outlined a potential timeline for the dismissal of the Ripple lawsuit, and this positive resolution could enhance investor confidence and increase demand. Adoption Growth: Increased integration of XRP in banking and remittance services could also strengthen its market position, driving higher demand and increasing its price. Bitcoin’s Market Influence: Historically, altcoins have benefited from Bitcoin-led market uptrends, and a strong performance from Bitcoin could positively impact XRP’s trajectory. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Neutral Scenario: Trading Between $3 and $6 In a neutral market environment, the cryptocurrency may experience steady growth without significant price surges, potentially peaking around $6. ChatGPT identified the following factors for this scenario: Steady Expansion: While Ripple could continue forming strategic partnerships , a potential absence of breakthroughs may limit the digital asset’s growth. Market Stability: If cryptocurrency markets remain strong but do not experience extreme bullish momentum, the asset could see gradual appreciation rather than a sharp increase. Bearish Scenario: Falling Below $3 Regulatory uncertainty or a broader market downturn could drive a bearish outcome. This could keep XRP below $3. ChatGPT highlighted the primary risks: Regulatory Setbacks: “If legal troubles persist, investors might hesitate.” Any unfavorable ruling in Ripple’s legal disputes could negatively impact investor sentiment. Crypto Market Downturn: A significant decline in overall cryptocurrency markets could drag the asset’s price down, similar to previous bear markets. Can XRP Surpass Its All-Time High? XRP hit an all-time high of $3.84 in 2018. According to ChatGPT, the digital asset has the potential to break past this level, but hitting double digits would require major adoption and a strong bull market. Well-respected experts have set the $10 target , and under the right circumstances, XRP could reach this lofty target.

According to Martinez, 119,400 BTC were accumulated by whales at $97,800, and therefore this level could act as critical resistance for Bitcoin. At the time of writing, it is trading at $97,530. Speaking about Ethereum, the analyst said that investors “seem to be worried” that the Ethereum price has not been able to break $3,000. He added that a move above this level could bring back the lost confidence. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Announces to List Two New Altcoins Regarding Cardano, Ali Martinez stated in his statement that the ADA price may be performing a slow version of the price action it performed between 2020 and 2021.

President Donald Trump got a $10 million settlement out of his lawsuit against X for deplatforming him. Meanwhile, a judge found that Musk’s unofficial $97.4 billion bid for OpenAI contradicts his lawsuit against the $157 billion AI company. The motive behind Elon Musk’s OpenAI lawsuit is now being called into question at the same time that the X social media company he acquired from Jack Dorsey is expected to pay out a $10 million settlement to his close pal, President Donald Trump. Elon Musk inherited the Trump lawsuit Elon Musk’s social media platform, X, will pay President Trump $10 million to settle a lawsuit filed after the social media platform banned him following his involvement in the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. The lawsuit was filed against X while Jack Dorsey was still CEO. After Elon Musk purchased X, he reinstated Trump’s account and began developing a relationship with the president, spending $250 million on his re-election campaign. However, his status as “first buddy” did not stop Trump’s legal team from going ahead with the suit, although they did consider abandoning it. The $10 million settlement will mark the second time a social media platform has paid President Trump millions after the 2021 siege of the Capitol. In January, Meta lost a similar lawsuit to President Trump and had to pay $25 million to settle. The lawsuit came because Facebook suspended Trump’s account. President Trump’s attorneys are expected to pursue a similar settlement with Google over its decision to ban the president from YouTube after the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Judge rules in favor of Altman vs. Musk In a court filing on February 12, 2025, OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, emphasized that Elon Musk’s offer to buy the company undermines his lawsuit’s claim that OpenAI’s assets should not be “transferred away” for “private gain.” Elon Musk’s problems began after he made an all-cash bid to buy OpenAI from Sam Altman. He made an unsolicited offer of $97.4 billion to acquire the company. Sam Altman has leveraged that bid to point out the contradiction in Elon’s lawsuit. Musk’s lawsuit has been questioned before by a hearing judge, Judge Gonzalez Rogers, who remarked that it was a “stretch” for Musk to assert he would suffer irreparable harm without judicial intervention to halt OpenAI’s corporate restructuring. Musk’s lawsuit requests an immediate court order to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit model, alleging that such a move deviates from the organization’s original non-profit mission. However, OpenAI’s legal team is now arguing that Musk’s proposal to buy the company is inconsistent with his stated concerns. This suggests that his legal actions against OpenAI may just be an attempt to disrupt a competitor rather than uphold the company’s foundational principles, as he claims.

The company first planned to use this money to buy more Bitcoin but later decided to use it for bond repayments. This move helps Metaplanet manage its funds better, reduce foreign exchange risks, and still keep Bitcoin as an important part of its financial strategy. Despite the change, Metaplanet’s stock price has jumped 64% this year, showing strong market confidence in its Bitcoin-focused approach. https://twitter.com/Metaplanet_JP/status/1889840829893841327 Building Asia’s Largest Bitcoin Holdings Metaplanet started buying Bitcoin in April 2024 and has already collected 1,762 BTC, spending $137 million. The company believes Bitcoin is valuable because it has a limited supply and isn’t controlled by any government. By 2026, Metaplanet plans to increase its holdings to 21,000 BTC , aiming to become the biggest Bitcoin holder in Asia. Their growing Bitcoin reserves have also attracted more investors, with their shareholder count increasing by 500% to 50,000 in 2024. https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1889516114905842141 Backed by MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor Metaplanet’s strategy has caught the attention of Strategy’s executive chairman michael saylor michael saylor Michael J.

BlackRock’s Multi-Million Investment in BTC and ETH , Is This a Winning Formula? Strategy has started this trend and have successfully borrowed money to buy Bitcoin , and Metaplanet seems to be following the same playbook. Strategy doubled its stock price in five years with this approach, proving that Bitcoin can be a strong financial asset. Since Japan has low interest rates, Metaplanet can borrow money cheaply to keep adding more Bitcoin to its reserves. The companies are cashing on these recent dips to add more BTC on low rates. Bitcoin is currently trading at $96,226, with a market cap of $1.90 trillion. As the U.S. considers holding Bitcoin as part of its financial reserves , more companies might copy Metaplanet’s strategy. However, Bitcoin’s price can be unpredictable, and its limited supply could make future purchases harder. If Metaplanet manages its risks well, it could become Asia’s leading Bitcoin-holding company. But if the market turns against them, this bold move could also backfire. Only time will tell if this is a genius financial play or a high-risk gamble. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

An Istanbul court has sentenced Mehmet Aydin, the creator of Çiftlik Bank (“Farm Bank”), to 45,376 years in prison for embezzling large sums of money from hundreds of thousands of people. The game was inspired by Farmville and allowed users to “invest” in virtual livestock in order to supposedly earn a return on real-world agricultural assets in Turkey. After scamming over 350,000 domestic Turkish investors and another 150,000 foreigners, authorities seized the company’s assets and arrested several executives, while Aydin fled to Uruguay, where he was on the run for years. Aydin was eventually spotted in Uruguay driving a Ferrari, triggering a manhunt before he ultimately agreed to turn himself into the Turkish embassy in Sao Paolo, Brazil. The Daily Sabah reports that at a hearing, Aydin claimed complete innocence and that the seizure of his assets prevented him from compensating the victims. “I did not intend to defraud anyone; I had no intention of committing fraud… I did not make any false statements to the plaintiffs. I seek acquittal.” The man’s brother, Fatih Aydin, while also charged by authorities, claimed that he was not involved in the scheme at all. “I am not a member of any organization. Most of the defendants do not know me, and I do not know them. I request acquittal.” It is estimated that Farm Bank wrongfully profited at least 1.1 billion Turkish lira, or about $131 million.

Notably, BTC was already trending downward due to escalating geopolitical tensions following Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on all aluminum and steel imports. Bitcoin Slumps Amid Surprising Inflation Data The latest US inflation data came in higher than anticipated, triggering declines in both equity and cryptocurrency markets. Instead of the expected 0.3% increase, the CPI rose by 0.5% in January, compared to December’s 0.4% reading. Related Reading: Bitcoin Withstands DeepSeek Dip And FOMC Volatility – How Close Is A New ATH? On a year-over-year (YoY) basis, inflation climbed 3%, exceeding forecasts of a 2.9% increase. For those unfamiliar, the CPI measures the average change in prices consumers pay for goods and services over time and is a key indicator of inflation. Meanwhile, Core CPI – which excludes food and energy costs – rose by 0.4% in January, surpassing the expected 0.3% gain. YoY, Core CPI climbed 3.3%, higher than the forecasted 3.1%. As a result, US stocks followed the crypto market downturn, with stock index futures falling roughly 1% after the report. On the other hand, the 10-year Treasury yield jumped 10 basis points to 4.63%, while the Dollar Index (DXY) strengthened by 0.5%. Could There Be More Downside Ahead? Following the CPI release, markets are now pricing in fewer or possibly no interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve for the remainder of 2025. In an X post, financial journalist Walter Bloomberg noted: Capital Economics’ Paul Ashworth thinks a cut this year looks increasingly unlikely. “With tariffs likely to keep core PCE inflation close to, or above, 3% this year now, the Fed will stand pat for at least the next 12 months.” Treasury yields jumped on the inflation data and are holding on to their gains, with the 10-year at 4.651%, on path for its highest close since mid-January. A reduced likelihood of rate cuts poses additional downside risk for risk-on assets like BTC. Further compounding this uncertainty, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testified before Congress yesterday, emphasizing that central bank rate cuts remain unlikely in the foreseeable future. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Steady Amid NASDAQ Decline, Analyst Calls It ‘Extremely Bullish’ Crypto analyst HurryNFT shared insights on BTC’s price movement following the CPI data release. The analyst noted that while inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target, Trump is pushing for rate cuts to stimulate the economy. The ongoing friction between the Federal Reserve and Trump could increase market volatility, potentially pushing BTC further down to $92,000. Additionally, the recent US employment report did little to support Bitcoin’s price. On the contrary, however, a recent CryptoQuant report posits that BTC may surge to anywhere between $145,000 to $249,000 under the Trump administration. At press time, BTC trades at $95,240, up 0.8% in the past 24 hours.

The advisory panel under Trump’s presidency remains poised to offer updates on governmental spending cuts with this endeavor, further streamlining federal operations. Meanwhile, the Tesla & SpaceX lead revealed what the panel eyes for its future initiatives, further echoing a buzz nationwide. Elon Musk’s DOGE Official Website Goes Live: Here’s All According to an official X post by the Department of Government Efficiency on February 13, the official website ‘doge.gov’ is now live. This portal will offer the public vital updates on governmental spending cuts, the functioning of agency employees, and the panel’s role in streamlining federal operations. As per Elon Musk, “Details of cost savings” are to be posted on this site. Further, the Tesla & SpaceX lead also revealed that he aims to spend the next 4 months working in the panel, primarily to slash $2 trillion from the budget. Source: Elon Musk, X What To Expect? In light of this development, FOX Biz correspondent Charles Gasparino revealed on X that once the advisory department’s goals are met, the anticipation is that ‘inflation will be dropping to 2%.’ Notably, CoinGape reported that the latest U.S. CPI inflation data for January came in hotter than expected at a 3% basis YoY. Given that the newly launched government panel achieves what it plans, the broader risk assets market sentiment could substantially benefit. Further, the imminent developments for the advisory panel are that it aims to launch an ‘overall savings scorecard’ and a ‘description for the amount of each cost reduction’ by February 14. Altogether, these recent developments have echoed a buzz across the American landscape, whilst crypto market participants keenly eye Dogecoin. Elon Musk’s governmental advisory panel under Trump’s presidency has garnered significant attention to the dog-themed meme coin in light of a similar name. Also, the market hype is attributable to the American entrepreneur’s previous backing and influence over the token. Dogecoin Under The Spotlight Amid Recent Advancements At the time of reporting, Dogecoin’s price witnessed an uptick of over 4%, exchanging hands at $0.2579. The coin’s intraday low and high were $0.2489 and $0.267, respectively. Intriguingly, the current rising trajectory falls in line with the broader crypto market’s bullish trend . Further, the recent Elon Musk DOGE-related advancement has added a layer of intrigue surrounding the coin’s future movements. Notably, crypto market analyst ‘VipRoseTr’ conveyed optimism on the meme coin amid current developments, revealing that the price is rebounding from the Fibonacci support zone, signaling a potential bullish reversal. This projection indicates that a massive upside price movement is incoming, with the upcoming targets for the token being $0.4993, $0.5740, and $0.6543, given the price sustains a bullish movement. However, traders and investors continue to trade cautiously, given the meme coin sector’s turbulent nature.

The investment round was led by gumi Cryptos Capital, with participation from well-known venture firms like Spartan, No Limit Holdings, YZi Labs, and OKX Ventures. The funds will be used to improve Blum’s trading bot and Memepad platform, strengthening its position in the TON ecosystem , where it aims to become a leading multichain platform. Since its launch in July 2024, Blum has gained significant traction, attracting over 32 million members in its Telegram community. The project’s success is largely due to its shift from a ""tap-to-earn"" model to a ""trade-to-earn"" approach, which has encouraged long-term engagement. Blum has recorded 2.2 million unique wallets with the highest on-chain activity, making it a key player in decentralized trading. One of Blum’s standout features is its trading bot, which has already surpassed 1 million users, making it the largest of its kind on Telegram. The team is now working on expanding its capabilities with multichain support. Additionally, the Memepad platform, which enables users to create meme coins, is leading The Open Network (TON) and ranks second globally with $200 million in trading volume. So far, users have created 200,000 tokens, with 380 listed on decentralized exchanges. Investors saw several reasons to support Blum: its high user engagement, its successful shift to a sustainable earnings model, and its potential to dominate the TON ecosystem, which currently lacks a major DEX. The funding will help Blum accelerate feature rollouts, ensuring a seamless trading experience. Blum’s funding round also included backing from The Open Platform (TOP) and Binance Labs, highlighting the strong industry confidence in its vision. CEO and Co-Founder Gleb Kostarev emphasized that securing capital was not just about money but about selecting the right partners to enhance the platform’s growth. The decline of ""tap-to-earn"" projects, such as Hamster Kombat and Notcoin, has shown the difficulty of maintaining user interest solely through incentives like airdrops. Interest in this model has dropped by 80% from June to December 2024, according to Google Trends. Blum has adapted by focusing on AI-powered trading, ensuring users remain engaged with advanced features rather than temporary rewards. CMO & Co-Founder Vlad Smerkis reinforced the company’s commitment to building a trading app that caters to both traders and the community. Blum is taking a careful, step-by-step approach to feature development, including multichain trading, an AI-enhanced Memepad, and futures trading. With strong investor support, the team is confident in its ability to bring these innovations to life at an accelerated pace.",,EN,0,0,TRADING|TON|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-13 07:40:24

Despite being exposed as a scam, the token’s price has remained stable, showing the crypto market’s ongoing risk from fraudulent schemes. Political meme coin scams are spreading fast, with scammers taking advantage of inexperienced investors and well-known figures to push their projects. Hackers hijacked Witkoff’s X account to advertise a fraudulent coin linked to Barron Trump. The post was removed swiftly, yet BARRON’s price didn’t drop . The rise of political meme coins has led to an increase in scams across the crypto world. Since Donald Trump introduced his TRUMP token, the sector has taken a troubling turn. In just his first week as president, scammers reportedly stole $857 million using the TRUMP token. Today, the same pattern emerged when Witkoff’s account was hacked to promote the fake BARRON meme coin. “Account was hacked. Thanks to X and James Musk [Elon’s cousin] for acting fast. You guys are great!” Witkoff later posted. Of course, the meme coin had no connection to Barron Trump. Similarly, Trump’s daughter had to distance herself from an IVANKA meme coin , yet that scam still made a profit. Even after Witkoff’s warning and the post's removal, the BARRON token’s price held steady, showing that fraudulent meme coins continue to attract traders. Political-themed scams are becoming more aggressive, and even high-profile figures like Vitalik Buterin feel powerless to stop them. The crypto community is seeing an alarming rise in fake meme coins linked to politicians, fueled by speculation and new investors willing to take risks. BARRON’s price remains strong despite being fake. The trend of fraudulent meme coins isn’t slowing down. In January, scammers falsely linked an XRP wallet to the US Treasury, though it’s unclear how much money they gained. More recently, the X accounts of two former world leaders—a Brazilian President and a Malaysian Prime Minister —were hacked to promote fake tokens, generating over $1 million. With meme coin speculation becoming more like gambling, the crypto space should prepare for even more scams like BARRON. A survey showed that 40% of TRUMP investors were completely new to crypto, and scammers are taking full advantage of this wave of inexperienced traders. Even though many traders know these tokens are fake, they still gamble on them, hoping for quick profits. This growing trend is starting to damage the credibility of the industry.",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TRADING|REGULATION|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-13 07:42:51

In a surprising turn, prosecutors weakened their own case by overestimating claims and discrediting a key witness. The two have agreed to forfeit assets and assist in reimbursing victims, though their sentencing remains uncertain. HashFlare was once seen as a respected cloud mining business, but things unraveled in 2022 when Potapenko and Turõgin were arrested for defrauding investors of $575 million. Following a long legal battle, they pleaded guilty today. ""As Ivan admitted, their business did mine crypto, but not as much as promised. Sometimes, instead of real mining profits, they repaid users with crypto bought from the market. However, no customer has suffered actual harm,"" their defense lawyer stated. While they accepted guilt, they tried to emphasize that the damage was limited. HashFlare lured users with the promise of mining cryptocurrency from home, but it never had enough resources to deliver. Instead, customer funds were used to buy assets, which were falsely presented as mining earnings. According to the FBI , this fraudulent scheme ran from 2015 to 2018, when HashFlare invoked a clause allowing it to shut down after 28 days of unprofitability. The bulk of user funds went to their own enrichment. However, in their guilty plea, the founders expressed regret and a willingness to pay back victims. They agreed to surrender frozen assets, including luxury cars and real estate, and to provide customer data to aid reimbursement. Despite this, their guilty plea might not be enough to significantly reduce their sentence. The prosecution made major mistakes in its handling of the case. The Department of Justice (DoJ) initially accused them of moving $95 million in crypto after their arrest, arguing that this showed they had lied to pretrial services and couldn’t be trusted. However, federal prosecutors' key witness lost credibility, weakening the case. One of the most serious missteps was an overstatement of damages by $225 million . This led to rushed negotiations to salvage some form of justice. Ultimately, the two executives pleaded guilty to a single charge while nearly 20 others were dropped. Their final sentence is still unknown, but the situation could have been far worse for them.",,EN,0,0,MINING|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-13 07:45:23

Despite Trump’s recent crypto-friendly actions , this deal was not about supporting the industry but securing Fogel’s release. Vinnik, tied to a massive money laundering case, is expected to remain in Russian custody. Vinnik has faced years of legal trouble since his arrest in 2017. He launched BTC-e, an early crypto exchange, in 2011, but the platform was shut down amid serious allegations of money laundering and other crimes. Now, according to the New York Post , Trump has sent Vinnik back to Russia in exchange for Fogel. “We now know what Russia received in this deal. Accused Russian money launderer Alexander Vinnik is being released from US custody in exchange for Marc Fogel,” CNN’s Zachary Cohen reported. The swap allows Fogel, who was sentenced to 14 years in Russia for carrying marijuana, to return to the US. Vinnik’s legal battles have stretched across multiple countries. After his 2017 arrest in Greece, he was extradited to France and later sent to the US in 2022. While facing previous money laundering charges, new allegations surfaced in 2024, leading to a guilty plea . The White House defended the deal, stating, “We view this as a very fair trade. We are not exchanging the Merchant of Death for a basketball player.” Officials confirmed that Vinnik remains in US custody in northern California, awaiting his transfer to Russia . While this exchange may seem like part of Trump’s broader support for crypto figures , it’s not the same as his recent pardon of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht. Ulbricht was freed after over a decade in prison, a decision widely celebrated in the crypto space. However, Vinnik’s case is different. The Russian government has been pushing for his extradition since at least 2018. Reports suggest that he admitted to Russian law enforcement that he was involved in a cyber fraud case linked to BTC-e, with damages totaling $14.6 million. Even though he may prefer being in Russia, Vinnik is unlikely to gain full freedom. The US government’s priority was Fogel’s release , not helping Vinnik. Fogel has already returned home, visited the White House , and publicly thanked Trump. Meanwhile, Vinnik remains in custody, awaiting his transfer to Russia.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-13 07:47:18

Between February 1 and 5 alone, the market plummeted by over 5.62%. Importantly, it has not yet recovered from the aforementioned correction. In the last seven days, the BTC price has dropped by almost 1.9%. Renowned technical and on-chain analyst Ali Martinez suggests that if the Bitcoin price falls below $92,110, it could slip sharply to $70,000. Currently, the price of Bitcoin stands at $96,037.47 . Bitcoin’s Key Resistance at $97,530 Between February 4 and 5, the Bitcoin market declined sharply from $101,333.27 to $96,607.94. Since February 6, the market has remained inside the range of $97,896.66 and $95,791.74. Ali notes that there exists a strong resistance in the BTC market at the range of $97,530. It is sensible to assume that if the market breaks above this range, it could experience a strong bullish momentum. The most important resistance level for #Bitcoin $BTC is at $97,530. However, support below $92,110 is weak, as there’s a gap between $90,000 and $70,000. pic.twitter.com/yW575BOBKk — Ali (@ali_charts) February 13, 2025 Bitcoin’s Weak Support Below $92,110 It was on January 9 that Bitcoin touched its lowest yearly closing price of $92,569.92. Notably, at a point on February 3, the market slipped to a low of $91,238.24. Ali opines that there exists a weak support in the market at around $92,110. This implies that it is less strength for the market to resist a serious selling pressure at this level. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bullish Sign for Crypto? BlackRock’s Multi-Million Investment in BTC and ETH , Bitcoin’s Dangerous Price Gap Between $90K and $70K Importantly, Ali warns that there is a serious price gap between $90,000 and $70,000. This means that if the BTC price falls below the $90,000 range, it could drop swiftly to $70,000. Notably, at a point on January 13, the Bitcoin market touched as low as $89,305,15. On that day, buyers managed to push the price to around $94,545.97 by the time of market closing. In conclusion, Bitcoin’s current price levels are critical. A break above $97,530 could lead to strong gains, but falling below $92,110 may cause a sharp drop. The gap between $90,000 and $70,000 adds further risk. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

If these bills pass, they would require $23 billion in Bitcoin purchases, creating significant demand. This could also lead to state pension funds investing in BTC , further increasing pressure on supply. With Bitcoin already approaching a supply shock , even a few successful bills could send prices soaring. Since President Trump first pledged to create a national Bitcoin Reserve, several states have taken steps to build their own. Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck , analyzed these proposals, highlighting their potential impact. “We reviewed 20 state-level Bitcoin reserve bills. If enacted, they could lead to 247,000 BTC in purchases, worth $23 billion. This figure doesn’t include pension fund investments, which could add even more demand,” Sigel stated. Although Trump ordered the creation of a federal crypto stockpile, it hasn’t fully delivered on his campaign promise. Meanwhile, individual states are making progress. Utah’s Bitcoin Reserve bill has passed its first committee, while Oklahoma and Arizona have reached the same stage. North Carolina also advanced its proposal today, moving it to the Committee for Commerce and Economic Development. If these Bitcoin Reserve bills become law, the impact on BTC’s price could be massive. States would be legally required to buy Bitcoin, adding a wave of demand. This doesn’t even account for pension funds, which in some cases could become tied to these reserves. Beyond state governments, a flood of consumer interest could follow. If multiple states are mandated to hold Bitcoin, everyday investors might jump in, fearing they’ll miss out. With Bitcoin already nearing a supply crisis, these proposals could act as a detonator for an even bigger price surge. Right now, Bitcoin’s supply struggles to meet rising demand , and 20 state-level reserves could add enormous pressure. While it's unclear how many of these bills will ultimately pass, even a handful could significantly shift the market. A federal Bitcoin Reserve, if created, would be a game-changer that could reshape the crypto landscape entirely.",,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-13 07:49:51

From regulatory victories to growing interest from institutional investors, XRP’s journey to a potential $15 target comes from big developments like Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin launch. Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) is stepping up to potentially solve Bitcoin’s long-standing issues with its Layer-2 technology. Let’s check out the details. In-Depth Analysis of XRP’s Technical Trends and Market Drivers – Can It Reach $15 in 2025? XRP is currently trading at around $2.40, marking a 1.8% jump in the past 24 hours. Its market cap is sitting at a hefty $137.4 billion, which makes it the third-largest cryptocurrency out there. Over the past week, XRP has climbed 15.8%, contributing to a massive 322.9% surge over the last year. Daily trading volume is impressive too, with about $3.46 billion changing hands in the last 24 hours. The all-time high for XRP was $3.40 back in January 2018, so its current price is still about 30% below that peak. With 57.41 billion XRP tokens circulating and a total supply of nearly 100 billion, there’s plenty of it in play. The RSI is currently at 54, which puts XRP in the neutral zone. Ripple Labs recently got the green light from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to launch its RLUSD stablecoin. This approval has given XRP a serious boost, with its price surging by over 23% in just a few days. More asset management firms are starting to take an interest in XRP. WisdomTree, for example, has rolled out a new XRP exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe. It’s physically backed and comes with a super-low management fee of 0.50%—the lowest in Europe for this kind of product. This move gives investors an easy and affordable way to get in on the action with XRP. Now, let’s talk about the predictions. The XRP Avengers believe XRP could hit $15 by the end of January 2025 and draw parallels to its explosive rise back in March 2017. Armando Pantoja says XRP will climb to $2.89 soon, then break past $3. He identifies key resistance levels at $3.50 and $4, with the potential to surge to $8 and even $10. He credits this outlook to a balanced RSI, whales buying during price dips, and growing utility from the RLUSD stablecoin launch. On a more conservative side, AltcoinMarksman expects XRP to touch $3 in January 2025, with price swings between $3.50 and $5. They predict a peak of $5 to $7 during the next bull run. PlutoChain’s ($PLUTO) Layer-2 Technology Could Bridge Bitcoin with DeFi and NFTs PlutoChain ($PLUTO) offers a new, robust approach to some of Bitcoin’s biggest hurdles. Slow transactions, congestion, and high fees often leave users frustrated. PlutoChain could address these issues with a hybrid Layer-2 network that works alongside Bitcoin’s blockchain. This design could help reduce traffic, cut costs, and improve scalability. Another one of Bitcoin’s hurdles is that its 10-minute block time can’t match the speed of Ethereum or Solana. PlutoChain’s Layer-2 tech, however, could slash transaction times to just 2 seconds on its own chain. This breakthrough wouldn’t just make Bitcoin faster—it would open the door to smart contracts while keeping its rock-solid security intact. With this upgrade, Bitcoin could shift from being a store of value to a more dynamic platform. PlutoChain also supports Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which could enable Ethereum-based projects to integrate with Bitcoin. This compatibility could spark a new wave of DeFi, NFTs, and even AI applications within Bitcoin’s ecosystem. Tests have already shown promise, with the network handling 43,200 transactions a day without a hitch. To guarantee top-notch security, PlutoChain has already undergone audits from SolidProof, QuillAudits, and Assure DeFi. Regular checks and stress tests make sure the system stays reliable and meets global standards. The PlutoChain core contributors put its community first. Users play a key role in shaping the network by proposing ideas on Discord for upgrades, partnerships, and new features. Final Words With predictions ranging from conservative estimates to ambitious goals, XRP remains one of the most talked-about assets in the crypto space. Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) might show us how blockchain technology can advance and offer a glimpse of a more scalable, versatile future for Bitcoin. With the mainnet launch, PlutoChain could be an interesting project to watch in the next couple of weeks. ——————— This article is purely informational and should not be interpreted as financial advice.

Yesterday, the X account of Eric Semler, the president of the giant company Semler Scientific listed on Nasdaq, was hacked, while today, the X account of one of the names close to Donald Trump was hacked. At this point, the X account of Zach Witkoff, co-founder of the Trump-backed DeFi project World Liberty Financial, was hacked. The hacker hacked Zach Witkoff’s X account and then introduced a fake memecoin called BARRON, which was related to Trump’s youngest son, Barron Trump. The hacker went on to claim that Trump would soon verify the legitimacy of the token. The fake memecoin called BARRON rose rapidly after this fake post, but its collapse was also very fast. While the hacking incident was confirmed by the WLFI X account, the team told users to ignore the fake posts. “Zach Witkoff's account was compromised and a fake Barron's meme was shared.

In a new video, Pizzino tells his 348,000 YouTube subscribers that the “probabilities of a crash continue to increase” for Bitcoin and other crypto assets. According to Pizzino, one of the bearish signals he has observed is a falling interest in Bitcoin. “Some more things that I’m seeing in regard to the probabilities of a crash increasing here are the interests through Google Trends. So less people are searching for Bitcoin and crypto… …the volumes are now down to 24 [out of a maximum 100] for Bitcoin and 12 for crypto.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube On the wider crypto market, the widely followed analyst says that one of the signals suggesting bearishness is the daily exchange volume, the value of all cryptocurrency trades executed on centralized exchanges within a 24-hour period, which is on a downtrend. “We haven’t broken down from the $50 billion [of daily exchange volume], we haven’t got back to the previous lows of $30 billion but we’re not back at those highs of $130, $120 billion either. So we’re in this sort of middle period but you can clearly see the trends are down – lower highs, lower lows… …so essentially I’m seeing more weakness in this particular [daily exchange volume] chart because there haven’t been higher highs continuing to form with the exchange volume.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube For Bitcoin to change the momentum to a bullish one, Pizzino says, “I would need to see Bitcoin’s price break above this top – that’s on the 3rd of February, that big dump and pump day, and the top there was $102,600… so for a round number, call it $103,000. And I want to see the pump get above there and sustain above that level, above $103,000. So some closes, another day’s price action above there, some closes. It can dip down intra-day but at the end of the day I want to see the closes above those levels.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube Bitcoin is trading at $96,220 at time of writing. ?

Notably, with a potential XRP ETF approval, the Ripple price may head toward a new ATH shortly. Will the approval of the XRP ETF by the SEC push its price toward a new ATH this year? Moreover, investors are curious with questions like “Will XRP price ever recover?” In this article, we at CoinPedia have uncovered the market sentiments and possible short-term Ripple Price Analysis just for you! Ripple Price On The Verge Of A Major Breakout? Amid increased market volatility, the XRP price has jumped ~2% in 24 hours with a trading volume of $5.446 billion, a change of +14.61%. Despite recording a correction of 3.57% over the last 30 days, the XRP coin price has soared 17.14% this year, suggesting a long-term bullish action. TradingView: XRP/USDT The Simple Moving Average (SMA) is on the path of recording a bullish convergence in the daily time frame. This highlights an increase in the positive influence of altcoin on the cryptocurrency market. Furthermore, the MACD indicator records a constant decline in the red histogram with its averages witnessing a high possibility of a positive crossover in the upcoming time. This suggests that the XRP price may continue gaining value this week. Will Ripple Price Hit $3 This Week? Suppose, the bullish sentiment sustains, in that case, the XRP coin price could surpass its immediate resistance of $2.5 and head toward its $3 mark. Maintaining the price above that level could push the price of XRP token beyond $3.5 in the coming time. Conversely, if the Ripple price faces rejection at its resistance level of $2.5, this could result in it dropping toward its low of $2.25.

Six men have been charged in connection with the crime after allegedly stealing $15 million in cryptocurrency, including Zehuan Wei, Fan Zhang, Huajing Yan, Shengnan Jiang, Shiqiang Lian, and Ye Cao, a Chicago Tribune story citing recently unsealed FBI records reported on Feb. 12. According to the FBI, the kidnapping took place in a Chicago townhouse when one of the suspects knocked on the door, pretending to have damaged the victim’s garage door. When the victim answered, armed men forced their way inside and took the family and their nanny at gunpoint. The victims were taken in a van to an Airbnb in Forest Park, where they were held for a night before being moved to another house. The kidnappers demanded ransom payments in Bitcoin, Ether, and other cryptocurrencies, threatening to kill them if they refused. The kidnappers also gained access to the victims’ crypto accounts and made transactions themselves. One of the victims was hit on the head with a gun, though he later believed it might have been fake. He also managed to contact his father through WeChat, alerting him to the situation. After five days in captivity, the kidnappers released the victims on Nov. 1. Of the $15 million stolen, authorities later determined that $9 million remains unaccounted for.

Security cameras at the Forest Park Airbnb captured the kidnappers arriving in a white van and making phone calls. Investigators matched this footage to the suspects using U.S. Customs and Border Protection records and state-issued driver’s licenses. At least two victims were able to identify some of the suspects in a photo lineup. Wei was the first suspect to be apprehended. U.S. Customs and Border Protection arrested him on Jan. 17 while he attempted to re-enter the country from Mexico at the Otay Mesa border crossing in California. The FBI later determined that Jiang and Yan had boarded a flight from Tijuana, Mexico, to Beijing on Jan. 19, followed by Lian the next day. Authorities believe some of the remaining suspects fled to China after Wei’s arrest. On Dec. 13, all six men were formally charged with kidnapping. Recent crypto kidnappings As cryptocurrencies become mainstream, they are also becoming prime targets for crime. Last month, David Balland, the co-founder of cryptocurrency hardware wallet manufacturer Ledger, was kidnapped and held for ransom. In November, Dean Skurka, CEO of WonderFi, was abducted in Toronto and was released after a $1 million ransom was paid. According to reports, the suspects believed the victim held a significant amount of Bitcoin, which, however, was not the case.

However, historical data reveals that most of these face a sell-off right after that, continuing for weeks or even months. This trend is clearly visible in three meme coins: Pudgy Penguin (PENGU), Animecoin (ANIME), and Berachain (BERA). These coins witnessed an initial influx of gains but have plummeted more than 60%. Let’s look at their performance. PENGU, ANIME, & BERA Altcoins Dropped 60% Post Launch A renowned crypto analyst, FFV, has an interesting finding about new crypto tokens’ performance. According to FFV’s X post , people quickly move on from altcoins that lack significant value, as has happened with the PENGU, ANIME, and BERA. The analyst reveals that since the airdrop for Pudgy Penguin and the other two tokens were placed, their price has declined by at least 60%, showcasing a troubling trend. All these trending meme coins had different launch timelines but the same result. The price of PENGU dropped 70% since the airdrop, the price of ANIME dropped 80% from launch, and the price of BERA dropped 60% from its peak. The biggest challenge with crypto airdrops is that people quickly move on from assets that lack an incentive model. Most investors sell their airdropped tokens immediately after receiving them, resulting in price crashes. How Are These Crypto Tokens Performing Today? Ever since the recent crypto market crash in January, the majority of digital assets have struggled. This includes the Bitcoin price wreck and continued consolidation, which has stagnated the recovery for the rest of the crypto tokens as well. Although BERA, ANIME, and PENGU are struggling with the larger picture, their performance has improved today. According to the CoinMarketCap data, BERA is new to the market and trades at $5.491 after an 8% surge in the last 24 hours. Also, its market capitalization and trading volume are at $653.54M and $368.47M, respectively. However, despite the rising value, BERA’s price is 60% down from its ATH of $14.99, set just a week ago. Pudgy Penguin token also witnessed increased investor interest. It is trading at $0.01076 after an 11% surge today. The demand is clearly visible, as the trading volume has surged 98% to $166.01M due to its listing on the Coinbase exchange. The increased visibility and investor interest could fuel its recovery, overcoming the 81% drop it faced from its prime of $0.05738, set two months ago. Lastly, the ANIME token price surged 4% today after facing a complete downtrend for a month. Although its peak is $0.1861, it has declined 82% from that, currently trading at $0.02754. The broader recovery in the meme coin sector has favored this surge. Interestingly, the meme-themed cryptocurrency category has been struggling for an entire month. Today, the category witnessed a 5% surge in market capitalization to $72.67 billion, hinting at the possibility of recoveries for these aforementioned altcoins. Should You Buy These Crashing Altcoins? It is important to analyze which crypto tokens to buy amid the volatile crypto market. However, what’s more important is the price you buy. Notably, buying the dip is a standard norm in the industry, where traders buy where prices are down. However, a few other factors, like market sentiments, token utility, and upcoming updates, are important, as meme coins usually thrive on hype. Among these three altcoins, PUDGY’s hype is thriving amid the Coinbase listing. Meanwhile, the two lack any fundamental hyped factors. More importantly, BERA is facing post-airdrop consolidation and controversy around the Berachain airdrop, so the future remains uncertain. Traders should lead the activities cautiously and build proper trading strategies before buying these tokens. Key Things To Remember No cryptocurrency is entirely safe from the market’s volatility. As a result, the value of these crypto changes, but the recovery may decide their future. Some analysts consider a dip a buying opportunity, but traders should consider many other factors before randomly buying a token. Pudgy Penguin, Berachain, and Animecoin altcoins were thriving with gains at one point but have declined 60% past then. Amid these, PENGU is still gaining attention, hinting at the possibility of better recovery, but the other two struggle with post-launch volatility.

The days of getting rich by simply buying a few BTC or ETH and holding may be behind us. However, there’s still a way in—by investing in promising low-cost altcoins with high growth potential. In this article, we explore four affordable yet promising crypto coins—Hedera (HBAR0, XRP, Sui (SUI), and Rexas Finance (RXS)—analyzing their market performance and potential to deliver 10x or more gains by 2025. 4 Crypto Coins to Own Under $10 That Could Make You a Millionaire in 2025 Here are cryptocurrencies that are trading under $10 that could deliver exponential returns by 2025. 1. Hedera (HBAR): Enterprise Blockchain Powerhouse Hedera Hashgraph is a crypto coin that could make millionaires in 2025. HBAR has been undergoing a commendable rise, with its value increasing by 182.24% in the last year. This growth is driven by heightened interest from institutions and strategic alliances, like the Nairobi Securities Exchange becoming part of the Hedera Council to investigate tokenization. The platform’s commitment to enterprise adoption and its recent Project Hiero launch for decentralized open-source development further cement its long-term potential. Despite trading at just $0.22, HBAR’s ability to support high-speed, secure, and low-cost transactions makes it a strong candidate for substantial appreciation, with projections suggesting it could climb toward the $1.50 mark or higher by end of 2025. Hedera (HBAR) price chart 2. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Crypto Coin Carrying the Future of Asset Tokenization Rexas Finance (RXS) is also rising among new cryptocurrencies that could make you rich in 2025. RXS has captured significant investor interest, raising over $44.8 million in its presale and selling more than 444 million tokens. The project’s innovative approach to asset tokenization—transforming real estate and commodities into accessible digital assets—has positioned it as a game-changer in decentralized finance. With its exchange launch set for June 19, anticipation is growing around the ability of the RWA token to attract further liquidity and investor participation. Its deflationary tokenomics add to its appeal, making it an ideal long-term investment. Currently priced at just $0.20, market forecasts suggest that RXS could reach between $15 and $25 by 2025, offering one of the most lucrative opportunities among affordable early-stage cryptocurrencies . Rexas finance tokenomics 3. XRP: The Cross-Border Payment Leader XRP is also rising among the crypto that could make you rich in 2025 . This crypto coin has experienced a notable trajectory, soaring by 360.34% over the last year, primarily driven by growing institutional interest and progress in regulations. XRP is broadening its global acceptance through partnerships, including its alliance with Unicâmbio to facilitate quicker and more effective cross-border transactions between Brazil and Portugal. Additionally, the growing anticipation of an XRP ETF, alongside Ripple’s strategic engagement with the CFTC, has provided a strong bullish sentiment. Currently priced at $2.43, many analysts foresee its value reaching between $5 and $7 by 2025, especially as regulatory clarity further strengthens its position in the financial sector. 4. Sui (SUI): Blockchain Innovation in Action Emerging among the best cryptos to buy to become millionaires in 2025, Sui has been rapidly gaining traction, with its daily transaction volume surpassing the combined totals of Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Optimism. This surge in network activity reflects growing developer interest and strong user engagement in the crypto coin, particularly within the DeFi and NFT spaces. The blockchain’s collaboration with 3DOS to tokenize 3D designs as NFTs, along with its integration into Grayscale’s Sui Trust, underscores its versatility and potential for mass adoption. With a price of $3.55 and 98.33% gain over the past year, Sui is well-positioned to see continued growth. Analysts believe its rapidly expanding ecosystem and strong community could drive its price significantly higher in the coming years. Sui (SUI) price chart Final Thoughts While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain dominant, their high prices make it difficult for new investors to accumulate enough for life-changing gains. Hedera, XRP, Sui, and Rexas Finance offer strong potential under $10, providing an opportunity for investors seeking the next big crypto success story. The strong market performance of these assets—ranging from enterprise blockchain adoption and institutional backing to rapid ecosystem growth—suggests they have the potential to generate significant returns by 2025. As always, thorough research and risk assessment are crucial before making investment decisions.

Implements BoLD Protocol for Permissionless Validation,https://coingape.com/brandtalk/pulse/arbitrum-bets-big-on-decentralization-implements-bold-protocol-for-permissionless-validation/,"The Offchain Labs-founded Arbitrum, on 12 Feb, announced the launch of Bounded Liquidity Delay (BoLD) protocol for its Arbitrum ecosystem, the de-centralised Ethereum Layer-2 solution. The operational launch on the Arbitrum One and Nova Chains comes as a major upgrade to the Arbitrum’s Layer 2 infrastructure which is Offchain Labs’ main Ethereum L2 network for DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. Designed with Ethereum Compatibility, Arbitrum enhances its scalability by improving the speed and reducing the costs of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Using Optimistic Rollups, Arbitrum processes transactions in batches off-chain and then posts summaries to the Ethereum mainnet, reducing congestion on it. The implementation of BoLD protocol on Arbitrum network, from Wednesday. replaces the earlier system of allowlisted by Off-chain Labs that allowed only a limited set of validators to participate in fraud-prood verification. Now BoLD will aim at making validation permissionless and more secure, allowing anyone to become a validator and contribute to Arbitrum’s security. Today, BoLD delivers permissionless validation, making the Arbitrum ecosystem more secure and more decentralized than ever. Anyone can defend Arbitrum. Stage 2 soon. pic.twitter.com/y6y1WDTSwc — Arbitrum (@arbitrum) February 12, 2025 Glancing at Arbitrum’s Complex Mechanism The layer 2 solutions such as Arbitrum though significantly work towards reducing the cost of transactions on Ethereum but are prone to denial-of-service attacks with fraud-proof mechanisms. For security and efficiency reasons, optimistic rollups used by Arbitrum require permissioned validators, posing delayed completion of transactions. Users have to wait for 7 days before transactions are finalized on Ethereum – the timeframe which can sometimes go beyond and indefinite. This makes inefficient use of capital as users have to wait before accessing their funds, making slower withdrawals. Furthermore, in case of fraudulent transactions, validators must possess financial incentives to report such instance as submitting fraud proofs comes with expensive computation. Certain censorship risks also remain as the centralized sequencer can anytime censor transactions without valid reasons. Can BoLD make it simple? The complexity and challenges of optimistic rollups utilised by notable Layer 2 scaling solutions such as Arbitrum itself, with other notables including Boba Network and Optimism, can be improvised with the launch of BoLD by Offchain. Granting permissionless validators, BoLD transforms the fraud-proof system by providing the time-bound dispute resolution mechanism. In simple words, BoLD will enable the following: Moving with permissionless validation, anyone can verify transactions and challenge fraud making the Arbitrum ecosystem more decentralized. The time-bound dispute resolution mechanism will aim to resolve any dispute within 12 days on Arbitrum chains – relieving validators of the challenging wait of long days. To get rid of the fraudulent claims, BoLD requires validators and challenges to put a financial stake before submitting claims. With BoLD, a single honest validator will be able to successfully defend against any number of malicious actors, with challenges resolved in parallel rather than sequentially. It also introduces Censorship Timeout, implying, if an L2 sequencer is offline/censoring, the force inclusion window automatically reduces. It also creates a strong economic incentive against malicious behavior by confiscating the bonds from failed attackers and using them to reimburse honest validators. For making efficient use of validator resources, it uses multi-level refinement wheneever a dispute arises by procedding through – block level → big-step → one-step verification. For validators, running a BoLD validator requires no special hardware. Thus, as Arbitrum looks forward to launching BoLD’s stage-2 as well in near future, the coming up of BoLD protocol moves Arbitrum and Layer 2 scaling solutions closure to the ultimate vision of Ethereum – transparency and Decentralisatiom.

Speaking at the When Shift Happens podcast, Grossman explained that Galaxy Digital founder and CEO Mike Novogratz and Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse collectively gave MoonPay loans worth $160 million during the weekend that U.S. President Donald Trump launched TRUMP. What Happened? Trump released his meme coin on the Solana network three days before his inauguration as the new president of the United States. On Friday, January 17, TRUMP went live, and the crypto community went berserk. Capital was flooding into the token, and its market cap grew by billions within hours. According to Grossman, the TRUMP team directed the token to Moonshot, a self-custodial wallet that uses MoonPay to convert fiat to crypto. Because the exchange has exclusive rails to the wallet, there was an explosive surge in trading volume on the platform by the morning of January 18. Unfortunately for MoonPay, the liquidity needed to ensure TRUMP transactions were successful was locked up in the leading asset management firm BlackRock in a manner similar to traditional finance (TradFi) entities. So, MoonPay’s reserves were declining speedily, while the team had no access to the exchange’s capital because it was a weekend. Worse still, they could not access the capital by Monday, January 20, because it was deemed a public holiday due to Trump’s inauguration. In the heat of the moment, Grossman reached out to Galaxy’s Novogratz, explaining that Moonpay needed at least $100 million in USD Coin (USDC) to sustain liquidity for the TRUMP boom. After reaching out to BlackRock’s executives to confirm that MoonPay had enough capital like Grossman claimed, Novogratz provided the funds needed about an hour before midnight on January 18. Moonpay Gains 750K New Users Interestingly, Galaxy Digital’s executives asked MoonPay co-founder and CEO Ivan Soto-Wright to pledge his entire net worth for the loan, and he did so without hesitation. Soto-Wright also liquidated his personal bitcoins (BTC) to keep MoonPay’s liquidity running until the loan was secured. By the morning of January 19, Moonpay needed another $60 million because the TRUMP mania had gotten even crazier. Coupled with the surge in TRUMP trading volume, U.S. First Lady Melania Trump launched her meme coin, Official Melania Meme (MELANIA), which was also booming . Soto-Wright contacted Garlinghouse, and the Ripple CEO agreed to wire the money through Galaxy Digital. Grossman further disclosed that MoonPay repaid the loans before the evening of January 21 and that the company gained 750,000 new users during the TRUMP and MELANIA boom.

Notably, the cryptocurrency enjoyed a bullish movement against the backdrop of crypto exchange behemoth Binance’s enhanced trade offerings. In turn, market watchers speculate whether the token, also known to be the evolved version of the Litentry Network, could sustain a bullish movement ahead. Heima Coin Bullish Amid Binance’s Enhanced Trade Offerings In an official Binance announcement dated February 13, the crypto exchange giant revealed that it is adding Heima coin to the ‘Earn, Buy Crypto, Convert, Margin & Futures’ trading platforms. As per the announcement, flexible products for the coin will be available on ‘Simple Earn’ starting today at 08:00 UTC. Starting February 14, users can purchase the asset using any of the payment options available on the platform’s ‘ Auto-Invest’ division. Further, users can also buy via VISA, MasterCard, Google Pay, Apple Pay, Revolut, and their account balances on the ‘Buy Crypto’ page within one hour of the spot listing. Also, the platform’s colossal user base can trade the coin against BTC, USDT, and any other tokens on ‘Convert’ at zero fees within one hour of the spot listing. Binance Margin will add the HEI coin as a new borrowable asset on cross and isolated margin, as well as the HEI/USDT and HEI/USDC pairs today at 11:00 UTC. Lastly, the crypto exchange revealed that it will also launch a USD-Margined perpetual contract for the asset with up to 75x leverage today at 09:00 UTC. Altogether, the enhanced trade offering by one of the top crypto exchanges significantly enhances market exposure, paving the way for money inflow into the token’s ecosystem. As a result, the coin’s price shot up phenomenally amid the announcement. HEI Price Skyshots 70% Heima coin’s price surged by a whopping 70% as of press time, trading at $1.23. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were $0.7291 and $1.36, respectively. The current bullish trajectory primarily mirrors soaring market optimism amid new listings on one of the leading crypto exchanges. Further, the recent crypto market recovery appears to have bolstered the price surge. Intriguingly, traders also appear to be positive on the recent development, as indicated by a 14414.65% uptick in the intraday trading volume to $64.27 million. The current dynamics indicate that the coin is seeing heightened market interest, paving the way for further bullish movement. Litentry Network (LIT) Rebranding Saga Meanwhile, it’s also noteworthy that the coin witnessed a rebranding saga as this year kicked off. Notably, the Heima (HEI) coin is a rebranded version of the Litentry Network (LIT), per an announcement as of January 2025. The rebranding reflects the project’s evolution from a decentralized identity to a chain abstraction entity.

Community is Growing – Join the Mission Now! The Ascent of XRP: Can Ripple's Currency Revolutionize Money Transfers? XRP, Ripple's digital currency, is designed to streamline and reduce the cost of money transfers. Operating on a decentralized network, it supports both fiat and cryptocurrencies with speed. Ripple's platform can process up to 1,500 transactions each second, making it appealing for financial services. XRP's price has experienced fluctuations. It peaked at $3.84 in January 2018. Legal issues with the SEC caused declines, but a favorable court decision in August 2024 boosted the price by 26%, restoring investor confidence. In 2025, XRP is gaining momentum. Its collaborations with banks highlight its increasing use. Ripple’s quick and affordable transactions are attractive in today’s digital environment. Despite previous hurdles, XRP appears promising in the current market cycle. Experts have mixed predictions for XRP's future. Some foresee it reaching $6 by 2030, driven by adoption and partnerships, while others are more cautious. These forecasts hinge on market dynamics and Ripple's expansion. Price predictions are challenging, but XRP's journey suggests potential. Its technology addresses real financial needs. As Ripple continues to innovate, XRP could play a vital role in digital transactions. Observing its progress might uncover investment openings. Cardano's Emergence: Could ADA Be the Blockchain's Future? Since its 2017 launch, Cardano has positioned itself as a blockchain platform akin to Ethereum. It employs a proof-of-stake method, which is more environmentally friendly than older systems like Bitcoin's proof-of-work. This allows Cardano to maintain security and speed without excessive energy use. Its distinctive approach is built on peer-reviewed research, aspiring to be a leading platform for decentralized applications. ADA is the token facilitating various transactions within the Cardano ecosystem. In recent years, Cardano has demonstrated remarkable progress. In 2021, ADA reached a record high of $3.10. Many anticipate that with forthcoming technological advancements and market trends, ADA might surpass its previous peak. Analysts project that by 2025, ADA could reach values like $5.66 or even higher, based on technical indicators and market factors. Looking forward, some experts maintain optimistic outlooks for ADA by 2030. Projections suggest that ADA might trade between $4.15 and $10.32. These figures are based on analyses of market trends and blockchain technology growth. It's crucial to note that these are estimates, and actual future prices may differ. Cardano's technology continues to advance. Its focus on sustainability and scalability attracts developers and users alike. As more individuals seek efficient and eco-friendly blockchain solutions, Cardano stands out as a strong competitor in the market. In this market cycle, Cardano offers an intriguing opportunity. Its past achievements and potential for future growth make it a cryptocurrency worth monitoring. As blockchain technology becomes more integrated into various industries, ADA's role could become increasingly significant. Solana: Leading the Blockchain Speed Race – Will SOL Climb Higher? Since its inception in 2020 by Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana has rapidly emerged as a prominent figure in the blockchain world. Engineered to resolve scalability challenges, it can handle over 50,000 transactions per second. This speed and efficiency have drawn developers and users seeking a swifter, more cost-effective platform. At the core of Solana's achievement is its groundbreaking technology. It integrates proof-of-history with proof-of-stake to achieve high throughput and low latency. This unique strategy facilitates quick processing times and minimal fees, making it appealing for decentralized applications and services. Since its launch, Solana's native token, SOL, has experienced significant price swings. From mid-2021 to 2024, SOL witnessed substantial growth, hitting new highs. Its performance outshone many other cryptocurrencies during this period, reflecting strong investor interest and faith in its technology. In the 2025 market cycle, Solana continues to capture attention. Its speed, scalability, and expanding ecosystem make it an attractive option for both developers and investors. While the crypto market remains unpredictable, Solana's strengths position it well to face challenges and potential competition. Looking ahead, Solana's innovative features and growing adoption suggest a promising future. Its capacity to address key blockchain challenges may support continued growth and significance in the industry. As always, staying informed is vital in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. Conclusion Currently, XRP, ADA, and SOL show limited potential for rapid gains. These coins might not deliver the quick growth investors are seeking. Agent A.I. presents a fresh opportunity. This new memecoin, inspired by PEPE, aims to capture attention with humor and substantial upside potential. The presale is ongoing, offering early buyers a significant discount. It's a chance to join a community-driven mission that could lead to considerable rewards.

While analysts predict that the price could experience a major increase if the BTC reserve is implemented, VanEck announced that BTC purchases could go up to $23 billion if the reserves in the US states are approved. VanEck research director Matthew Sigel said that they examined 20 state-level Bitcoin reserve bills as part of their research and found that if they were passed, US states could purchase a total of approximately 247,000 BTC. Sigel stated that the analysis did not include possible BTC purchases by state pension funds, and that if they also purchased BTC, the demand and price would increase even more. “We analyzed Bitcoin reserve bills at the 20-state level. If these become law, a purchase of $23 billion, equivalent to 247 thousand BTC, could occur. This amount is independent of state pension fund allocations, and if they also invest, demand is likely to increase. Given the lack of detail (many of these states are ‘ineligible’ and their sizes are unknown), this $23 billion estimate remains potentially conservative.” As is known, US President Donald Trump tasked a group with developing a federal regulatory framework for digital assets, including stablecoins, and researching a “strategic national digital asset stock.” At this point, it was stated that Trump was considering including different cryptocurrencies such as XRP, Solana and USDC in the US national reserve, apart from Bitcoin. *This is not investment advice.

Is This Bullish For XRP?,https://timestabloid.com/donald-trump-jr-follows-ripple-on-x-is-this-bullish-for-xrp/,"A recent tweet by Tech, Finance, and Sports Enthusiast, Mr. Morgan, has sparked discussions in the cryptocurrency community. Morgan’s post shows that Donald Trump Jr. has followed Ripple’s official X account, leading to speculation about how this could benefit XRP. The tweet, accompanied by an inquisitive emoji and a rocket symbol, implies that something significant could be on the horizon. Donald Trump Jr. just followed Ripple X account… Something big coming? #XRP pic.twitter.com/j9oWs8XJHW — Mr. Morgan (@Mr_Morgan777) February 13, 2025 The Context: XRP’s Potential in Global Finance The renewed interest in XRP, particularly from figures with political and financial influence, has drawn attention to its role in international banking. A Times Tabloid report from last year covered a discussion involving prominent crypto influencer Ben Armstrong, who explained XRP’s unique advantages to Donald Trump Jr. Armstrong emphasized XRP’s efficiency in cross-border payments compared to traditional financial systems like SWIFT. He pointed out that while SWIFT is widely used for international bank transfers, it primarily serves as a messaging system rather than a mechanism for direct value transfer. This results in processing times that can range from five to seven days. In contrast, Armstrong described XRP as a “network of value,” capable of carrying transaction information and the actual asset in transit. This allows for near-instantaneous settlement, with transactions completed within 30 seconds. The discussion underscored XRP’s mission to enhance global financial systems by significantly reducing settlement times and increasing efficiency. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Linking Trump Jr.’s Action to XRP’s Broader Narrative Donald Trump Jr.’s recent decision to follow Ripple’s X account has led to questions about whether he is taking a deeper interest in XRP’s capabilities. The timing of this action has fueled speculation about potential discussions or developments involving XRP in political and financial circles. One X user, Rod, questioned whether Trump Jr. had followed the account recently, to which Mr. Morgan responded , “Just a couple of days ago, he wasn’t following.” This suggests that the move was recent and intentional, adding to the intrigue. Possible Implications While it remains uncertain whether Trump Jr.’s follow indicates a formal interest or an upcoming announcement, the event aligns with growing institutional and mainstream discussions surrounding XRP . Given its potential role in transforming global finance, XRP continues to attract attention from investors, financial institutions, and now, possibly, political figures.

The broader crypto market has shown signs of recovery, with Bitcoin surging past $97k and Dogecoin price rallying over 5% on Thursday. Optimism is growing among traders as the DOGE community eagerly awaits CZ’s long-anticipated official dog reveal, which could impact sentiment. Is Dogecoin Price Set to Surge As Community Awaits CZ’s Official Dog Reveal? Dogecoin price is gaining attention as the crypto community speculates on a potential memecoin linked to Changpeng Zhao’s (CZ) pet dog. The former Binance CEO recently hinted at revealing his dog, sparking discussions about a new wave of dog-themed cryptocurrencies. CZ’s market impact has received extensive industry documentation. His previous reference to standard tokens caused a tremendous market response which resulted in the token value skyrocketing hundreds of times during a short time span. This has led many to believe that a similar effect could happen if CZ backs a dog-based memecoin. The BNB Chain has already seen multiple unofficial dog-themed tokens emerge in response to CZ’s recent comments. If he formally endorses one, it could drive a new meme coin surge, benefiting Floki, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and similar coins. With memecoins historically following hype cycles, CZ’s involvement could reignite a fresh bull run for dog meme coins. Can DOGE Price Rally 165% to $1.30? The latest DOGE value is hovering above $0.25, showing signs of a potential bullish reversal. Dogecoin is forming a Power of 3 setup, a technical pattern that combines accumulation, manipulation, and distribution phases. This setup suggests the asset establishes a strong base before an upward expansion. The accumulation phase typically sees price consolidation near a key support, in this case, the 200-day SMA, where DOGE recently bounced. The manipulation phase often involves a liquidity sweep, shaking out weak hands before a rally. If this setup holds, the final distribution phase will begin once a critical resistance flips into support, triggering a strong uptrend. For DOGE to confirm this breakout, it must flip the $0.35680 resistance level into support, marking the beginning of a bullish distribution phase. Key resistance levels to watch on the way up include $0.48434 and $0.70664, which align with Fibonacci extensions. If the bullish momentum continues, the Dogecoin price prediction could see an upsurge of approximately 165% from the current price, targeting $1.30212 as its next major milestone. However, failure to reclaim these resistances could result in price rejection and consolidation around support zones like $0.2. As the Dogecoin community anticipates CZ’s dog reveal, the DOGE price outlook remains bullish. If key resistances flip into support, a breakout could trigger a 165% rally. If the crypto market recovers, BTC rallies above $100k could ignite the rally. However, failure to sustain momentum may lead to extended consolidation near crucial support levels.

To this point, between Jan and Feb of this year, the market cap of these tokens dipped from a sizable $116 billion to $67 billion, representing a loss of nearly $50 billion (or approximately 30% of the industry’s value). Memecoin industry’s performance over the past 30-days (source: CMC) This sharp decline followed what many considered the peak of meme coin enthusiasm, catalyzed by the meteoric rise of Official Trump (TRUMP) earlier this year. The Trump-endorsed cryptocurrency surged to an impressive $72 per token almost overnight following its debut, capturing widespread attention and driving speculative interest across the meme coin sector. That said, market data from February has painted a rather sobering picture, with TRUMP now trading at just $15.34 — marking a decline of over 12% over the past week — with other prominent memecoins also reflecting similar downward trends. Performance of the top memecoins in the market over the past week For instance, market leaders like Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE), Bonk (BONK) and FLOKI have all experienced dips ranging between 5% and 8.5% over the aforementioned time period, once again bringing scrutiny to the fundamental utility and intrinsic value of these currencies. RWA market musters traction As capital has continued to exit the memecoin sector, it appears as though investors are increasingly turning their attention (as well as their money) to the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization sector, with industry experts projecting the sector to reach a valuation of $50 billion before the end of 2025. Infact, the ecosystem has already demonstrated impressive growth, achieving a 32% annual growth rate in 2024, its highest increase over the previous 12 months. Amidst this upsurge, several projects have continued to come to the fore. For instance, Tezos has made immense strides within this space, thanks, in large part, to its groundbreaking platform, Fraktion. Following a successful €1.1 million seed funding round backed by notable investors including Cabrit Capital and the Tezos Foundation, the project is actively democratizing access to high-value assets. Additionally, Tezos has also made waves in the commodity tokenization sector with the launch of Uranium.io , the world’s first blockchain-based uranium trading platform, developed in partnership with Curzon Uranium and Archax. Similarly, Singularity Finance (SFI) too has established itself as a transformative force in the RWA space — combining AI with tokenization principles — through its recent collaboration with Cicada to launch a $1 million fund. Moreover, its recent launch of the $SFI token, resulting from the merger between SingularityDAO and Cogito Finance, has created a comprehensive ecosystem that serves multiple functions, including gas chain token operations, node staking, and participation in an advanced index vault system. If that wasn’t enough, SFI’s partnership with Functionland (under the Crestal brand) has further strengthened its position in the market, helping create a platform for institutions and individuals seeking to leverage the convergence of AI and blockchain technology in RWA management. Lastly, Ondo Finance has emerged as a force in this market, thanks to the launch of its Ondo Global Markets (Ondo GM) platform which brings trad-fi assets onto the blockchain, offering tokenized versions of stocks, bonds, and ETFs. More notably, their announcement of Ondo Chain, a dedicated layer-1 blockchain for institutional RWA tokenization, has attracted an impressive roster of institutional partners. As per reports, the platform’s development is being guided by industry giants including BlackRock, PayPal, Morgan Stanley, Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree, and Google Cloud, among others. This institutional backing, combined with additional support from ABN Amro, Aon, and McKinsey, has positioned Ondo Chain as a major player in the institutional adoption of RWAs. Furthermore, the platform’s focus on creating a “strategic reserve” with its native token ($ONDO) has demonstrated its commitment to building a sustainable and liquid ecosystem for tokenized traditional assets. A multi trillion-dollar opportunity is in the offing The future of RWA tokenization appears remarkably promising, with a recent report projecting the sector to experience a more than 50-fold increase by 2030 , potentially surpassing the $10 trillion mark. This extraordinary forecast reflects the increasing recognition of tokenization as a transformative force within the trad-fi arena, offering enhanced liquidity, accessibility, and transparency to previously illiquid assets.

User growth is a critical metric for Reddit, and analysts worry because most of its business relies on advertising. In fact, prior to the company going public in March, it stated in a filing that “substantially” all of its revenue comes from advertising. A small tweak with a significant repercussion Towards the end of 2024, Google made a small change to its algorithm that subsequently reduced traffic and caused Reddit’s user growth to fall below Q4 expectations. The company revealed this on Wednesday, and hours later, its stock dropped by more than 15%. Reddit recorded $428 million in revenue for the fourth quarter, which is a positive result in a vacuum since it shows a 71% year-over-year increase from 2023. About 92% of the fourth-quarter revenue was generated from advertising, while the rest came from Reddit’s “other revenue” segment, which includes content licensing deals. The segment comprises its conversation placement ads that allow brands to advertise directly into discussion threads within interest-based communities known as subreddits. It reportedly contributed $144.7 million in 2024. Steve Huffman, the firm’s CEO, confirmed on an earnings call that people have become more accustomed to using search engines like Google to access the Q&A forum. So, when Google tweaked its search algorithm, it affected the traffic that would have normally been directed to the site. Huffman is not worried about it, however, and has said that the volatility did not impact revenue. “We feel very good about the pace that we’re on from Q1,” Huffman said, noting that the volatility is not a new experience with Google, and it affected others too. How Reddit plans to use AI to maintain an edge According to Huffman, during the earnings call, the algorithm change primarily impacted “logged-out users,” referring to people visiting the Q&A forum without accounts. Meanwhile, logged-in user numbers grew by 27% in 2024. The CEO also said the number of Google search queries with the “Reddit” tag increased, which suggests that more users are gravitating towards the platform for answers. The company has been working hard to attract and convert visitors into permanent users. It has stopped forcing searchers to download the Reddit app and has started showing all public posts, even if the searcher is logged out. More importantly, the Huffman-led company is expanding its AI strategy to include building tools such as Reddit Answers, an AI-powered search tool that generates answers based on input from users on the platform. Hoffman believes this is the solution to gain more loyal users. It is one of the latest AI-related moves and partnerships Reddit has made in the past year. The company also revealed a content licensing deal with Google and OpenAI, which would allow the creators of Gemini and ChatGPT to train their models with user data. The exact amount those deals brought in for Reddit revenue-wise is currently unclear. However, Google reportedly paid $60 million per annum for its licensing deal. While Reddit’s stock fluctuated frequently in the past year, there is little doubt the company has become more valuable. It had its IPO in March at $46 and is up 32% this year. The stock ( RDDT ) is now priced at $216.47, with a market capitalization of $37.53 billion, reflecting a decrease of 3.35% over the last week. The company’s next earnings report will be on May 13, 2025.

This statistic presupposes the existence of many good content creators, but what do the great ones have in common? Creators with unique voices stand out in this crowded landscape. Their voices reflect their values and personality and are consistent across all of their content. Creators with inimitable voices find their work universally recognizable, and audiences are likelier to engage with the content they produce. A growing trend: Rewarding the best Velar, a decentralized exchange protocol building the user interface to access the Bitcoin blockchain, has embraced a growing trend associated with content creation: rewarding the best. Its Content Creator Yield Program is the flagship program that rewards content creation in a way that is not unlike yield farming. The program uses a raffle entry system to distribute 50,000 $VELAR a week among five contributors, the total coming to 200,000 $VELAR per month. The system converts their engagement into weekly rewards. Under the new initiative, content creators—including bloggers, tweet authors, podcasters, video producers, and more—will earn points for their contributions. The point rewards help choose the weekly raffle winners. Velar recognizes the importance of rewarding content creators and aims to bring financial and education infrastructure together under the scope of its program. Quality above all else According to Peter Watson, Chief Marketing Officer at Velar, the Creator Program rewards the creators who only contribute to the Bitcoin ecosystem because they believe in its mission. The sole requirement to receive $VELAR is producing high-quality educational content in Bitcoin DeFi. Blogs, videos, tweets, and podcasts qualify. The points-based raffle system determines the winners, who will get the rewards transferred to their wallets within 48 hours. The Content Creator Yield Program aims to establish a sustainable compensation model for Bitcoin DeFi educators, diverging from conventional yield farming opportunities that tend to affect liquidity providers (LPs) exclusively. Under Velar’s system, all educational contributions towards sustainable growth have equal value, prioritizing the Velar ecosystem and community-driven growth of DeFi education. The program maintains quality standards by implementing a thorough verification process. It also features weekly resets for new opportunities for smaller or less experienced creators and considers engagement value instead of mere post volume. More information about the initiative is available at velar.com/velarcreatorprogram. The path forward for creators post-AI Generative AI tools can help with drafting, brainstorming, and more, but losing the human touch is one thing content creators can’t afford to do. Content consumers can tell the difference between real human content and something ChatGPT generated, and they tend to be unforgiving. Making an emotional connection is going to be crucial in 2025 and beyond, especially considering the massive volume of lifeless AI creations on the internet. Creators who make their content emotionally driven and unmistakably human will continue to stand out. Content marketers are prioritizing user-first, human-centered content to succeed in a landscape driven by evolving SERPs and AI overviews.

His remarks come a week after the central bank lowered the rates to 4.5%, while also forecasting a much lesser economic growth rate in the fiscal year 2025. Speaking to Reuters on Wednesday, Pill acknowledged that inflation is gradually declining toward the BoE’s 2% target, but warned that price pressures could be a hindrance in achieving it. He said that taking an aggressive rate-cutting approach will add to Britain’s already sluggish economic growth. “We are able to remove some of the restriction we imposed because of the successful, but not yet complete, process of disinflation,” Pill reckoned. Inflation remains above target According to data from Trading Economics, the UK’s annual inflation rate unexpectedly dipped to 2.5% in Dec. The central bank now expects inflation to rise to 3.7% later this year – before gradually dropping to the 2% goal by late 2027. Last week, the BoE maintained its “gradual” approach to rate cuts. Some policymakers are pushing to add the word “cautious” due to concerns about weak productivity fueling inflation. Others on the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) preferred the term “careful,” which was ultimately included in the bank’s guidance on borrowing costs. Economist Pill took his forever position that easing policy should be approached cautiously. Previously he voted against the BoE’s first rate cut last August. “ I would expect we’re going to cut Bank Rate further. But the pace at which you can do it is less, ” he said. “ And I think that’s what’s being indicated by the words ‘cautious and gradual’, as opposed to ‘gradual and careful’. “ Seven members of the MPC supported last week’s quarter-point rate cut, but two dissented, arguing for a larger half-point reduction to address weak demand. They attributed the stagnation in output for much of 2024 to a slump in consumer and business activity. UK economy sees modest growth amid weak forecasts Last week, the BoE slashed its 2025 growth forecast in half to 0.75%, putting more pressure on Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves. Reports from the BBC earlier today show that the UK economy may have recorded slight growth in the final three months of 2024. But analysts warn that the outlook remains bleak, especially with new business taxes set to take effect in April. Data from Capital Economics showed that business investment dropped by 3.2% between October and December. This coincided with a decline in employment and flat consumer spending. The only sources of growth came from increased government spending and public-sector consumption. “In short, October’s Budget decisions contributed to rising public sector activity [but] contributed to falling private sector activity,” said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. Still, monthly data released yesterday showed that the UK economy expanded by 0.4% in December, outperforming weak figures from earlier in the quarter. Rachel Reeves responded to the economic data with a pledge to revamp Britain’s economic landscape. “ For too long, politicians have accepted an economy that has failed working people. I won’t ,” Reeves said. Citing 14 years of stagnant living standards, she vowed to accelerate reforms under the government’s “Plan for Change,” promising to boost infrastructure spending and remove barriers for businesses seeking growth. “ We are taking on the blockers to get Britain building again, investing in our roads, rail and energy infrastructure, and removing the barriers that get in the way of businesses who want to expand, ” she concluded.

TRUMP’s rally sparked optimism for another bull run, with analysts predicting a potential short-term surge to the $35-$40 range. Outperforming the Leaders The meme coin sector has rebounded in the last 24 hours, with its total market capitalization climbing above $78 billion. The biggest tokens of that type – Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE) – have charted some mild gains, while others have stolen the show with much more impressive increases. Some of the examples include Popcat (POPCAT) and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU). The former’s price has exploded by around 25%, while PENGU is up by approximately 10% for the day. Perhaps the most likely reason fueling their resurgence is Coinbase’s decision to add support for the assets on the Solana network. The US-based crypto exchange explained that trading “will begin on or after 9 AM PT on 13 February 2025 if liquidity conditions are met .” “Once sufficient supply of this asset is established, trading on our POPCAT-USD and PENGU-USD trading pairs will launch in phases,” it added. Another meme coin that has witnessed a significant pump in the last 24 hours is Official Trump (TRUMP). Its valuation has soared by over 10% following an announcement by Upbit. The leading South Korean crypto exchange allowed users to deal with the following trading pairs: TRUMP/KRW, TRUMP/BTC, and TRUMP/USDT. Thus, it became the latest to embrace the meme coin launched by US President Donald Trump. Other behemoths that previously embraced the asset include Binance and Coinbase. This happened shortly after TRUMP’s launch last month and could be among the main reasons behind its initial bull run. Recall that its price skyrocketed above $70 mere days after launch, while its market cap reached a whopping $14.5 billion. Over the following weeks, TRUMP has experienced a serious downfall, with its capitalization currently standing at less than $3.5 billion. Is TRUMP Ready for Another Bull Run? Numerous industry participants noted the latest revival of the meme coin and, contrary to its downtrend in the past weeks , outlined optimistic predictions . The X user Crypto Bull claimed that reversal has started, envisioning a pump to the $35-$40 range in the short term. AMCrypto also weighed in, assuming that TRUMP has entered its “capitulation phase.” They believe that most people who previously entered the ecosystem currently sit on unrealized losses, and “a lot of panic selling is happening.” “If I’m confident on 2 memes this cycle, TRUMP is definitely one of them,” the analyst concluded.

Analysts remain bullish as Ripple’s native crypto shows signs of breaking key resistance levels. Amid talks of a US XRP Reserve, market experts predict significant price movements ahead. But can the crypto sustain its momentum and reach new highs despite the recent stagnant performance? Let’s find out here. Analyst Predicts XRP Price To Hit $15, Here’s Why Top crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed out that the XRP price may have broken out of a symmetrical triangle pattern. According to him, this breakout sets the stage for a potential rally toward $15. Sharing insights on X, he suggested that this technical formation indicates strong upside potential. Considering that, if the bullish trend holds, XRP could be gearing up for a major move. However, sustaining this momentum is crucial for a breakout confirmation. Source: Ali Martinez, X Key XRP Price Levels To Watch For Future Movements Another analyst, EGRAG CRYPTO, outlined critical resistance and support levels for XRP’s price trajectory. He stated that as long as XRP remains within a “yellow” horizontal channel (as mentioned in the chart below), market fluctuations are just noise. He stated the following conditions that might help investors navigate the future path of Ripple’s native asset: A close below $2.30 signals a bearish outlook. Breaking past $2.60 confirms a bullish trend. A move above $2.85 strengthens the rally. Surpassing $3.11 could push XRP toward new all-time highs, likely to $4. These levels are crucial in determining whether XRP can sustain its upward momentum and challenge previous record highs. Source: EGRAG CRYPTO, X US XRP Reserve Speculations Fuel Optimism Rumors about an XRP Strategic Reserve have been circulating, adding to market enthusiasm. Though there is no official confirmation, speculation has driven investor sentiment. Some traders believe this initiative could enhance liquidity and support long-term price growth. If such a reserve materializes, it could further strengthen XRP’s position in the crypto space. However, investors remain cautious as they await concrete developments. So, here are some of the key developments that are hinting towards a potential US XRP Reserve ahead. Developments Hinting At Ripple & US Administration Collaboration Speculations surrounding the US XRP Reserve have been gaining momentum, fueled by a series of events and connections between Ripple and President Donald Trump. The XRP price has historically been sensitive to developments related to Ripple’s relationships with US regulators and policymakers. One key factor contributing to the speculation is Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s reported meetings with Trump. These meetings, which took place before and after Trump’s re-election, have sparked rumors about potential collaborations in the near future. In addition, Garlinghouse’s attendance at the Crypto Ball and his donation of $5 million in XRP to Trump’s inauguration has further fueled speculation. Other developments include Donald Trump Jr. following Ripple on social media. On the other hand, rumors about Garlinghouse’s appointment to Trump’s crypto council advisory board, have also contributed to the buzz surrounding XRP. While these events have generated significant interest and speculation, it remains to be seen whether they will translate into an XRP price rally. Market analysts will be closely watching for any further developments or announcements that could impact the cryptocurrency’s value. Source: gen A, X Ripple’s Support Of TRUMP Coin Sparks Discussion In a recent development, Ripple has backed President Donald Trump’s official memecoin, TRUMP, through its support to MoonPay. This move has sparked speculation about the strong collaboration between the blockchain firm and the US administration in the near future. Ripple reportedly helped MoonPay manage the overwhelming demand for the TRUMP token. The token’s market capitalization skyrocketed from $200 million to over $10 billion within 48 hours after launch, with trading volumes exceeding $20 billion over a two-day period, causing a liquidity crisis. However, following a thorough vetting process that included a personal asset pledge from MoonPay’s CEO Ivan Soto-Wright, Garlinghouse approved the additional funding. Notably, commenting on the development, Ripple CTO David Schwartz said “So I guess this is public now.” Can XRP Price Hit $15? XRP price delivered gains of 1.5% and traded at $2.44 after touching a 24-hour low of $2.25. The token’s Relative Strength Index stood at 40, indicating possibilities of further gains ahead for the crypto. Besides, XRP Futures’ Open Interest rose 1% to $3.5 billion during the writing, reflecting the bullish sentiment hovering in the market. XRP Price However, while analysts are optimistic, XRP price’s journey to $15 depends on various factors. Market conditions, regulatory developments, and overall crypto trends will influence its trajectory. If the crypto sustains key price levels and breaks resistance, a major rally could be on the horizon. In addition, the positive regulatory developments in the market could further boost the price ahead. For context, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has recently lauded the recent pick of Brian Quintenz as the new CFTC Chair. Considering all these aspects, it appears that the crypto is poised for a strong rally ahead. However, given the recent volatility, investors should exercise due diligence while putting their bets into the market.

Buy orders for TRUMP will be restricted to around five minutes after the crypto exchange begins trading support. While all types of orders, with the exception of limit orders, will be restricted for approximately one hour after trading support starts. Not only that, sell order prices are capped at a minimum of 10% less than the previous day’s closing price. TRUMP exploded into the markets on the weekend before President Trump’s inauguration, reaching beyond $10 billion in market cap during its first few hours of trading. However, many early traders have dumped the token, dragging the price down from $39.63 to as low as $4.29 on Jan. 18. The meme coin has since rebounded, but its market cap is still far below its initial peak. You might also like: Trump meme coin price forms a bullish pattern; can it rise 56%?

Table of Contents BitLemons: Transforming the $450b casino market AVAX’s technical breakdown QUBIC’s bridge solutions Conclusion The cryptocurrency market continues to show divergent trends, with established players facing headwinds while new innovative projects gain momentum. BitLemons (BLEM) has captured significant attention after raising $1 million in its private seed round, emerging as a GambleFi rising star. BitLemons: Transforming the $450b casino market BitLemons is making waves in the GambleFi sector with its approach to decentralized gaming. The platform’s tokenomics model allocates 30% of Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) to strengthen the ecosystem – with 15% dedicated to token buyback and burn mechanisms, while another 15% rewards stakers through sustainable yield generation. The fully operational crypto casino platform has already demonstrated real revenue generation, addressing key trust and transparency issues in the traditional gaming industry through blockchain technology. With an entry price point of $0.01 in the presale phase, early investors are positioning themselves to potentially benefit from the platform’s expansion into the $450 billion traditional casino market. You might also like: MEOW, TAO falter while BitLemons emerges as the rising force in gaming AVAX’s technical breakdown Avalanche has experienced significant selling pressure, recording a 4.13% decline over the past week despite growing Subnet adoption. Trading at $25.59, AVAX faces strong resistance around the $26.80 level, where previous recovery attempts have been rejected. The token’s market cap has contracted to $10.54b, though trading volume shows a healthy 40.513% increase to $468.78m, suggesting active market participation. QUBIC’s bridge solutions QUBIC has demonstrated remarkable resilience, posting a modest 1.27% gain over the past week. Currently trading at $0.0517, the token has established support around the $0.0178 level after experiencing increased volatility. The project’s focus on bridging solutions for Avalanche subnets has attracted attention, with daily volume reaching $5.15m. Conclusion As traditional gaming tokens face market uncertainty, BitLemons presents an alternative case with its revenue-driven model and deflationary mechanics. The combination of real casino operations, transparent tokenomics, and a low entry price point positions BLEM as a potential market leader in the expanding GambleFi sector.

Trading below the $100,000 mark for days now, the cryptocurrency seems to be grappling with a lack of upward momentum. Market participants seem to be questioning the forces holding back a more pronounced rally. Amid this challenging backdrop, some on-chain metrics and market indicators are beginning to offer potential insights into what might come next. Related Reading: Bitcoin OTC Balances Decline, Raising Market Supply Questions Bitcoin’s Taker Buy-Sell Ratio Indicates Potential Shift ShayanBTC, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, has offered an analysis centered on the taker buy-sell ratio. His insights suggest that a key metric in the futures market could signal a potential turn in Bitcoin’s momentum. The taker buy-sell ratio measures whether buyers or sellers are more aggressively placing market orders. When this metric trends above 1.0, it typically indicates stronger buying pressure, while a value below 1.0 suggests that sellers are dominating. According to Shayan, recent shifts in this ratio could have significant implications. In his latest post titled “Bitcoin Taker Buy-Sell Ratio Reversal: A Bullish Signal for Market Momentum?” Shayan highlighted a reversal in the metric’s 14-day moving average. Following a prolonged decline, the ratio has now begun to rise. “This shift suggests that buyers are regaining strength and could soon take control of the futures market,” he explained. If this upward trend continues, breaking past the critical 1.0 threshold, it could indicate that buying pressure is finally outpacing selling, potentially setting the stage for a renewed bullish rally. Whale Activity and Spot Exchange Trends Meanwhile, another significant factor in Bitcoin current market is the activity of Bitcoin whales. Grizzly, another CryptoQuant analyst, highlights that the Exchange Whale Ratio has reached a multi-year high. This metric measures the proportion of the top 10 inflows to spot exchanges relative to total inflows, and its recent upward trajectory highlights increased activity among large-scale investors. Historically, a decline in whale deposits on spot exchanges has often preceded a bullish Bitcoin rally. The reasoning is that when these major holders reduce their asset inflows, it can indicate diminished selling pressure. With the Exchange Whale Ratio remaining elevated, it is worth closely monitoring for any signs of a reversal. If whales begin withdrawing rather than depositing large amounts of Bitcoin, it could set the stage for broader market recovery and renewed confidence among smaller investors.

At its core, the AI meme coin uses an ecosystem that thrives on decentralization and innovation. Its Meme DAO guarantees that every holder has a voice in shaping the activities and the future of FloppyPepe (FPPE), be it deciding on partnerships, marketing strategies, or viral campaigns.

While the project thrives on Ethereum, the roadmap is to bridge Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Solana. This expansion will make the AI meme coin more accessible, bringing in a larger audience and increasing liquidity within the crypto market.

In fact, the Ripple price fell nearly 5% in the past week. The SOL price also saw the same price movement in that time. Nevertheless, market analysts like CryptoSensei and Ufo Calls have made bold price predictions for these crypto coins. One project is set to shatter records in this environment: DTX Exchange (DTX) . This presale star, now in phase eight, has already surged 700%. As it disrupts the entire online trading space with its hybrid trading platform, experts remain bullish on its long-term growth. They forecast a potential 5x price pump for DTX in 2025. DTX Exchange (DTX) Takes Off for 700% in Ongoing Crypto ICO Event While Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL) are showing some volatility right now, DTX Exchange (DTX) is getting a lot of positive attention. This presale star has already exploded 700% in terms of value. And it’s just the beginning. With a Tier-1 CEX listing on the horizon and a recent CoinMarketCap listing, DTX is poised for even greater gains as millions of new eyes could be set upon it. Hype was already strong as DTX Exchange recently launched its hybrid trading platform, which combines the best of CEX and DEX into one. On it, traders access 120,000+ assets with up to 1000x leverage and complete privacy thanks to no sign-up KYC checks. Some of these assets include stocks, FX and crypto coins. As a result, over 600,000 users have already been onboarded. The DTX token is a big part of this project’s ecosystem. Those who hold this crypto coin will get governance voting rights and reduced trading fees. Currently, one DTX costs just $0.16, but this price will jump to $0.20 after a Tier-1 crypto exchange like Uniswap lists it soon. This 25% growth makes DTX one of the altcoins to watch this year. CryptoSensei: The Price of Ripple (XRP) May Skyrocket to $10,000 Ripple (XRP) is one of the best cryptos but it has been on a downtrend recently. CoinMarketCap shows that the Ripple price fell from around $2.50 to nearly $2.40 in the past week alone. In other words, nearly a 5% drop in just a few short days. However, market expert CryptoSensei remains bullish on Ripple (XRP). In a recent X post, he said that the Ripple price has the potential to soar to $10,000. He based this prediction on the fact that its circulating supply is limited and because of its utility. Although this bullish statement has turned some heads, many traders are still cautious. Since the Ripple price has surged over 350% on the YTD chart, its highest upswings may have passed. Thus, traders are looking at DTX instead. Solana (SOL) Looks Ready To See a New Price Pump, Analyst Predicts Like the Ripple price movement, Solana (SOL) also shows some volatility. In the past seven days, its value has dropped around 5% as per CoinMarketCap. During that time, the SOL price fluctuated between $200 and nearly $195. But the community is still watching Solana (SOL), thanks to bullish statements from analysts like Ufo Calls. According to his X post, this crypto coin looks ready to go higher now. He predicts a potential SOL price pump to $290 soon. This Solana price prediction has made some headlines. However, many investors are focusing on DTX instead. Since the DTX VulcanX blockchain testnet showcased 200K TPS while SOL’s peak was 65K, its adoption could be way faster. Can DTX Exchange (DTX) Soar Much Faster Than Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL)? Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL) could start showing green price charts soon. However, DTX Exchange (DTX) has some advantages. For instance, DTX will have a smaller market cap. Because of this, the DTX price could soar much faster than the Ripple and the SOL price with less money. Because of this, experts predict a potential 5x surge for this crypto coin in 2025.

BNB, HYPE, and SUI have emerged as the biggest gainers from the larger-cap alts today, while ETH failed at $2,700 following positive news. BTC Recovers The primary cryptocurrency went through a full-on rollercoaster at the start of the previous week, with multiple $10,000 moves in both directions. It settled in the following days in a tighter range between $96,000 and $98,000, aside from a brief spike toward $100,000 on Friday. The subsequent rejection, though, pushed it south to the lower bound of the range, where it spent most of the weekend as well. The business week began with a price pump toward $98,000 but was halted once again. More volatility was expected yesterday following the release of the US CPI numbers. Once they went live and were higher than the general expectations, BTC slipped by two grand within minutes to $94,000. However, the asset bounced off immediately and added four grand by the Thursday morning Asian trading session. It was stopped once again there and now sits just inches above $96,000. Its market capitalization has remained at just over $1.9 trillion, while its dominance over the alts has taken a big hit and is down to 57.6%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView BNB Back Above $700 Ethereum jumped high this morning after CBOE filed for a spot staked ETH ETF on behalf of 21Shares. However, it quickly lost most of the gains and is now below $2,700 once again. XRP, DOGE, ADA, LINK, AVAX, and XLM are also slightly in the green on a daily scale. BNB has jumped the most, adding 9.5% of value and trading above $700 now. SUI and HYPE followed suit, with 8% gains, which have pushed them to $3.5 and $25, respectively. Some meme coins have posted impressive increases over the past day as well. Nevertheless, the total crypto market cap has remained still at just over $3.3 trillion on CG.

Despite the current market swings in Bitcoin Price , Pal remained calm, recalling it as a reflection of past cycles where similar corrections happened before explosive growth. He pointed out that Bitcoin’s pullbacks are natural, with historical patterns showing sharp declines before major rallies. He estimates a 70% probability that the current correction is over and foresees Bitcoin breaking free from its past price patterns. While Bitcoin remains a key player, Pal notes that altcoins with strong communities may experience remarkable growth. Analyzing the market and raising the bar for altcoins, he made a bold prediction that the biggest altcoin season in history is just two weeks away. Here’s why? Bitcoin Stalls Below $100K: What It Means for Investors Bitcoin’s price has been hovering below $100,000 , frustrating investors who expected it to climb higher. Despite hitting a new ATH of $109K over the past month, analysts caution that extended consolidation could push prices lower to the $94,200 support level. Having said that, much of Bitcoin’s movement is tied to investor sentiment regarding the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. The January CPI report has influenced rate-cut expectations, with Jerome Powell signaling no rush to lower rates due to economic strength. Yet, Pal argues that macroeconomic liquidity is the key catalyst for a market-wide surge. Once liquidity increases, the crypto market , including altcoins, will see a boom. Altcoins to Turn the Market However, he backs his stance of altcoin surge with key economic indicators signaling a bull rally ahead, with rising new orders and the ISM index crossing 50—a key level indicating expansion. Historically, Bitcoin jumps when ISM surpasses this threshold, suggesting that crypto is entering an acceleration phase rather than nearing its peak. Pal believes this cycle will extend until late 2025 or even 2026, giving enough time for altcoins to outperform. The ‘Banana Zone’ Is Coming Pal describes the upcoming market phase as the ‘Banana Zone’—a period of rapid altcoin growth. While some expect immediate rallies, he emphasizes that patience is key, as altcoins tend to surge once liquidity fully kicks in. With just two weeks left before this liquidity shift materializes, Pal sees this as a pivotal moment before altcoins go parabolic. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Binance Tokens Explode-Pancakeswap (CAKE) & BinanceCoin (BNB) Surge Heavily, Is FLOKI the Next One to Rise? , Pal reassures investors that the current market conditions mirror previous cycles. With global liquidity set to increase and Bitcoin poised for its next leg up, the real excitement lies ahead. The countdown to the biggest altcoin season in history has begun, and the next two weeks could mark the turning point for explosive gains. On the flip side, Miles Deutscher believes altcoins are in a tricky spot—not in a full altseason, but not in a strong Bitcoin-led market either. He says he would go all-in on altcoins if Bitcoin dominance rises further, officially entering “Bitcoin Season.” However, in the coming weeks, it will be interesting to see whether Bitcoin regains its dominance or if altcoins continue to lead the charge. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

On February 13, Riot Platforms announced that it is actively pursuing potential partnerships within the AI and HPC sectors. The company is intensifying evaluations for AI and HPC applications at its Corsicana Facility in Navarro County, Texas. Riot’s CEO Jason Les emphasized the strategic importance of this shift, stating, “We are excited to continue to advance our AI/HPC evaluation process as we seek to maximize value for our entire portfolio of assets.” Bitcoin Miners Turn to AI Amid Transaction Decline Notably, Riot has restructured its board of directors to advance this initiative by appointing three new members: Jaime Leverton, CEO of Hut 8 Mining; Doug Mouton, a former senior engineer at Meta; and Michael Turner, a real estate investment expert. Riot Platforms Announces Changes to Its Board of Directors and Provides Update on Formal Evaluation of AI/HPC Uses. Jaime Leverton, Doug Mouton and Michael Turner to Join the Board and Bring Directly Applicable AI/HPC Conversion, Data Center and Real Estate Experience. Retains… — Riot Platforms, Inc. (@RiotPlatforms) February 13, 2025 Executive Chairman Benjamin Yi highlighted the significance of these additions, stating, “Jaime, Doug, and Michael bring complementary expertise to the Board that will be immediately applicable as we continue to assess how best to maximize the value of our unique assets.” However, Riot acknowledged that its existing assets may not be suitable for AI or HPC conversion, and securing financially favorable partnerships remains challenging. Despite these uncertainties, the company sees significant potential in diversifying its business model beyond Bitcoin mining. Riot’s strategic pivot comes at a time when Bitcoin network activity has significantly slowed, reducing transaction fees and overall mining profitability. According to data from The Block , Bitcoin transactions are currently at their lowest levels in a year, prompting mining firms to seek alternative revenue streams. Source: The Block Several Bitcoin mining companies have already begun repurposing their high-powered computing infrastructure for AI applications. For instance, Hut 8 Mining reported that AI and HPC services contributed nearly 8% of its total revenues in the first three quarters of 2024. Riot has taken a similar approach by engaging financial advisors Evercore and Northland Capital to explore AI/HPC opportunities at its Corsicana Facility. The company previously hired Altman Solon, a leading data center consultancy, to assess the potential value of its power assets for AI and HPC applications. Since announcing its evaluation process, Riot has received increased inbound interest from multiple potential partners, indicating a strong market demand for AI-focused infrastructure. Challenges and Opportunities Amid Market Volatility Despite the optimism, Riot faces hurdles in transitioning from Bitcoin mining to AI and HPC services. The company has acknowledged that its power assets cannot be efficiently converted to AI applications. Moreover, Riot must determine the financial feasibility of such a transition and ensure that any new partnerships align with shareholder interests. Additionally, Riot is entering an increasingly competitive market dominated by established AI cloud providers. Unlike traditional mining, AI and HPC services require computational power and significant expertise in AI model training and data center optimization. Notably, this decline in profit does not seem to be affecting solo miners. A report from February 11 shows that a solo Bitcoin miner achieved the rare feat of mining an entire Bitcoin block on January 30, 2025 , earning a $300,000 reward. The miner reportedly secured the block independently using a BitAXE miner, a low-cost home mining device. Some speculate they used CKPOOL, a mining pool designed for solo miners. While solo mining allows individuals to keep the entire block reward, the increasing difficulty of Bitcoin’s network makes such achievements rare, even for companies with higher resources.

Today, the Financial Services Commission, the top financial regulator of the country, has officially declared its decision to permit institutional investors to trade crypto in stages. Charities and Universities Allowed to Sell Crypto: What about South Korean Crypto Exchanges? Last month itself, the regulator hinted that it would revamp its crypto trading policy in favour of institutional players. Then, only retail traders were allowed to participate in crypto trading. As per FSC’s statement , charities and universities will be able to sell their crypto holdings received as donations from the second quarter of the year onwards. The statement hints that the South Korean regulator is also planning to permit the country’s crypto exchanges to exchange their crypto assets for cash to cover their operating costs. Notably, the statement mentions that the regulator will establish a common sales guideline for operators to ensure they don’t act against the interest of their users. Interestingly, late last year, the regulator gave permission to the country’s law enforcement agencies to sell cryptos seized from illicit activities. South Korean Political Landscape: Is It Favourable to Cryptos? South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol is a pro-crypto leader. During his election campaign, he promised to introduce policies necessary to develop the local cryptocurrency industry. People Power Party, the most prominent political organisation in the country, also supports the cryptocurrency sector. It even calls for the introduction of spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds.

HTX delists $PI, halts PI/USDT trading",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/what-wrong-pi-network-htx-delists-pi-token/,"Crypto exchange HTX has officially delisted the Pi Network token ($PI), halting trading services for the PI/USDT pair as of 08:00 UTC today. Affected users will have their PI holdings converted into USDT at a fixed rate of 1:61.28, based on the final halt price of PI. According to the exchange’s official blog, once the conversion is completed, an additional announcement will be issued. HTX also stated that it will reconsider listing PI once the Pi Network successfully launches its mainnet. Until then, trading services for the token on HTX remain unavailable. HTX has delisted $PI and ceased the trading services for the PI/USDT trading pair from 08:00 (UTC) today and will convert affected users' $PI holdings to $USDT . Additionally, HTX will soon support the mainnet launch of Pi Network (PI). 🔗 https://t.co/SooXfQsKdw pic.twitter.com/KKwbAz16tx — HTX (@HTX_Global) February 13, 2025 Pi Network is set to transition from its “Enclosed Network” phase to the Open Network period of Mainnet on February 20, 2025, at 08:00 UTC. The platform has reportedly surpassed 10.14 million mainnet migrations, exceeding its initial goal of 10 million, following recent updates introduced in its development roadmap. Crypto exchanges move to list PI Since the start of the Mainnet Phase 3 in December 2021, Pi Network has operated under what developers coined as an “enclosed environment with restricted external connectivity.” The project developers insist that this period allowed users, known as “Pioneers,” to complete Know Your Customer (KYC) verifications, migrate their holdings and engage with early applications within the Pi ecosystem. Pi has been in development since 2019, and the six-year wait has prompted critics, including some news publications to say it seems “fraudulent.” Until recently, the development team had not issued any information on when its mainnet will launch, which gave naysayers even more reason to doubt the project. The network now claims to have over 19 million identity-verified Pioneers, positioning itself as an ecosystem with real-world cryptocurrency applications. Despite the queries and the “inconsistent” updates from the platform’s developers, some exchanges like OKX and Bitget, announced they will list PI on spot trading markets. The former is already accepting deposits, while the latter, much like HTX, will list the token after the mainnet launch. Exchanges are also offering IOU-based trading for PI tokens. These IOU tokens function as placeholders, allowing users to trade anticipated assets before their official issuance. Following OKX’s listing announcement, PI’s IOU price surged nearly 80% in a day to trade at $86, but quickly retreated back to the $60 price level, according to CoinGecko data . The token is currently priced at $61.7, reflecting a 53% increase over the past week, and a 23% downtick in the last 24 hours. Is PI a scam? Crypto enthusiasts on social media have been debating on the likelihood that Pi has been a “scam token” in the making, in part because of the numerous revisions made on its roadmap. The platform introduced a revised mining rewards model in March 2022, implementing an exponential decline formula aimed at balancing network growth, accessibility, longevity, and token scarcity. To further accelerate the transition to an open network, Pi Network enacted a grace period on July 1, 2024, which limited unverified Pi from migrating beyond a rolling six-month KYC window. This measure was designed to encourage faster KYC participation while ensuring only verified Pioneers could move their assets to the mainnet. Several successive extensions have seen the grace period now pushed to February 28, a week after the open mainnet will supposedly launch. Further concerns have emerged regarding KYC verification. This is rampant among Chinese traders. According to several reports, many users in China have encountered limited verification slots or systemic difficulties when attempting to complete the KYC process. With Pi Network ’s mainnet launch drawing nearer, some traders worry that even if they begin verification now, they may not be approved in time to participate in the upcoming market activity. This thing is taking too much time. Any idea how much tie it takes usually? pic.twitter.com/8E5wi3AXlg — XFusion 🇵🇰 (@XFusion_) February 13, 2025 Pi Network maintains that KYC verification is essential for both individual and business participants in its ecosystem to create a “safe Web3 space” where verified Pioneers can engage with external networks using their PI holdings.

40276253,https://timestabloid.com/?p=57156,1739447194,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Harvard Engineer Explains Why XRP Will Surpass Ethereum (ETH),https://timestabloid.com/harvard-engineer-explains-why-xrp-will-surpass-ethereum-eth/,"Austin King, a Harvard-educated computer engineer and co-founder of the Omni Foundation, has made waves with his latest forecast regarding the future standings of Ethereum (ETH) and XRP. Speaking on the Good Morning Crypto podcast , King suggested that XRP could surpass Ethereum in market capitalization. His reasoning stems from Ethereum’s ongoing struggles, which he believes may jeopardize its ability to retain its dominance in the cryptocurrency space. King, an experienced developer with expertise in Ethereum and XRP ecosystems, asserted that Ethereum faces structural issues that could hinder its growth. “Honestly, Ethereum is not in a good place,” King stated during the interview. He elaborated on the underlying concerns that have led him to question Ethereum’s sustainability, highlighting inflationary pressures and centralization as major roadblocks. Ethereum’s Challenges: Inflation and Centralization Ethereum has long been regarded as a pioneering force in the blockchain industry. Its transition to a deflationary model—where the supply of ETH gradually decreased due to the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP-1559)—was initially hailed as a significant achievement. However, King pointed out that this advantage has diminished over time. “Ethereum had the opportunity to be a true deflationary currency, which was incredibly exciting. But that’s not the case anymore,” he noted. The shift from deflation has been linked to the increasing reliance on Layer 2 scaling solutions. These off-chain networks were designed to alleviate congestion and reduce transaction costs on Ethereum’s mainnet. However, King argued that many of these Layer 2 solutions are not genuinely decentralized. In his view, most of them operate on a single node or server, undermining Ethereum’s core principle of decentralization. This shift has left King skeptical about Ethereum’s ability to maintain its status as a premier blockchain network. He claimed that rising inflation and slow development progress have fueled negative sentiment toward Ethereum among industry experts. Ethereum’s Market Performance: A Cause for Concern? Despite Bitcoin reaching new price highs, Ethereum has yet to reclaim its previous peak. Ethereum’s sluggish price movement suggests investors are cautious and uncertain As blockchain ecosystems evolve, competition has intensified, with assets like Solana (SOL) and XRP emerging as strong contenders. This lackluster performance is particularly concerning given Ethereum’s historical role as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. If Ethereum fails to regain momentum, King believes other networks with more efficient frameworks could take its position. XRP’s Competitive Edge King highlighted XRP as a key rival in the race for market dominance. Unlike Ethereum, XRP maintains a fixed supply of 100 billion tokens, which cannot increase. While Ripple periodically releases XRP into circulation—typically around 200 million tokens monthly—the overall structure remains predictable and controlled. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 More importantly, XRP has a well-defined use case: facilitating cross-border transactions and supporting tokenized assets. Its efficiency in processing payments and its growing adoption in financial institutions make it a viable alternative to Ethereum. Could XRP Surpass Ethereum? Currently, Ethereum holds a market capitalization of approximately $322 billion, while XRP lags at $140 billion. However, XRP’s recent performance suggests a potential shift. Over the past three months, XRP has surged by around 580%, outpacing Ethereum’s price movements. Should XRP experience another substantial rally—approximately 145% from its current valuation of $2.44—it could reach the $6 mark. At this level, XRP’s total market capitalization would exceed Ethereum’s current valuation, effectively flipping the rankings. The Future of Crypto Market Rankings While Ethereum continues to face headwinds, XRP’s structured supply and expanding use cases provide a strong foundation for growth. However, the competition does not end there. Other blockchain networks, such as Solana are in the race for a top spot in the crypto hierarchy. King’s perspective may not be universally accepted, but his insights highlight an important discussion within the crypto community. Whether Ethereum can address its challenges or whether XRP will overtake it remains to be seen. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to change, one thing is clear: the competition for the top spot is far from settled.

In a recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing , the company highlighted its progress in developing blockchain-based payment models and simplifying access to digital currencies. The payment giant stated that it continues to support blockchain ecosystems and digital assets while maintaining strict risk management and continuous monitoring of its crypto-related partners. Mastercard Expands Crypto Payments Through Industry Partnerships Mastercard has also collaborated with various industry players to enable crypto purchases and seamless card payments using digital assets. Beyond its advancements in blockchain, Mastercard reported $28.2 billion in net revenue for 2024, reflecting a 12% year-over-year increase. The company acknowledged that stablecoins and cryptocurrencies are growing as competitors in the payments sector, with digital assets offering greater efficiency, accessibility, and immutability. Stablecoins, in particular, have gained traction as regulatory discussions advance in the U.S. Lawmakers French Hill and Bryan Steil recently proposed a stablecoin regulatory framework , aiming to solidify the U.S. dollar’s dominance in global markets. Data from crypto exchange CEX.io revealed that stablecoin transfer volume in 2024 reached $27.6 trillion , surpassing Visa and Mastercard’s combined figures. Analysts attribute this rise to the increasing use of trading bots, which enhance market efficiency rather than inflating transaction volumes artificially. #TOKENIZATION : Mastercard tokenized its transactions Multinational payment services @Mastercard reported, it had tokenized 30% of its transactions in 2024. ""Through a principled approach we are focused on supporting #blockchain ecosystems & digital currencies” Mastercard stated. pic.twitter.com/3bawn00nnk — D K Junas (@Dkjunas02) February 13, 2025 As digital assets continue reshaping global finance, Mastercard’s embrace of tokenization and blockchain innovation signals a shift toward a more decentralized and crypto-integrated payment landscape. Last month, Mastercard unveiled the expansion of its innovative Crypto Credential solution to the UAE and Kazakhstan, marking its debut in the Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EEMEA) region. The solution aims to simplify cryptocurrency transactions by allowing users to send and receive digital assets through simple aliases instead of lengthy blockchain addresses. The Mastercard Crypto Credential solution builds on its initial launch in 2023 , which aimed to simplify cross-border and domestic digital asset transfers across various blockchain networks. In September 2024, Mastercard partnered with European crypto payments provider Mercuryo to launch a related product: a euro-denominated debit card enabling users to spend cryptocurrencies from non-custodial wallets at over 100 million merchants worldwide. Payment Firms Adopt Cryptocurrencies In April, Fintech giant Stripe announced its decision to once again allow customers to accept cryptocurrency payments after a six-year break. In 2014, Stripe dipped its toes into the world of cryptocurrency with tests involving Bitcoin, the pioneering digital currency. However, in 2018, the company decided to halt its support for Bitcoin due to its volatility and lack of suitability as a means of exchange. Aside from Stripe, other payment companies have also adopted stablecoins as a means of payment. More recently, Singapore-based payments company Triple-A announced plans to integrate PayPal’s stablecoin into its list of supported tokens for customer payments. As the first licensed crypto payments firm in Singapore, Triple-A aims to introduce support for PayPal’s stablecoin, PYUSD.

Following the excitement surrounding Wall Street Pepe (WEPE), analysts are now focusing on PEPETO, a project that aims to redefine the memecoin market. While WEPE has captured attention with its unique approach, the increasing momentum behind #PEPETO suggests it may become a dominant force. With a strategic roadmap, advanced technology, and community-driven incentives, PEPETO is setting the stage for what could be the next major trend in the crypto space. PEPETO’s Strategic Expansion As #WEPE navigates its path, #PEPETO is emerging with an ambitious vision. The project incorporates technology and optimization key elements missing in previous meme coin models. Its developers focus on sustainability by introducing staking, an advanced exchange, and a bridge for interoperability.

Unlike typical meme coins that thrive on hype, WEPE positions itself as a profit-driven ecosystem for traders. The project has raised $51 million in six weeks during its presale, showcasing strong investor demand. However, competing against projects like #PEPETO presents a significant challenge. While WEPE captures early excitement, its long-term success depends on offering sustained value rather than relying solely on market speculation. PEPETO’s Competitive Edge #PEPETO differentiates itself by addressing inefficiencies seen in past meme tokens. Unlike Pepe, which struggled with scalability and liquidity, #PEPETO optimizes its infrastructure to prevent price instability and market dumps. Its blockchain foundation ensures transparency and security, making it a more reliable investment. During its presale phase, PEPETO is set to list on five major exchanges, increasing accessibility and credibility. These listings help onboard new investors while ensuring liquidity from the outset. The project’s roadmap remains on track, reinforcing investor confidence and community engagement. How to Buy and Stake PEPETO Investors interested in $PEPETO can purchase and stake tokens through a simple three-step process: Set Up a Wallet – Download and install a compatible wallet such as Metamask. Fund the Wallet – Load ETH, USDT, or BNB to purchase $PEPETO. Buy and Stake – Connect the wallet, select a payment method, and choose the desired amount for purchase and staking. Staking $PEPETO offers up to 341% rewards, making early participation highly rewarding. The token distribution will occur at a fixed rate per ETH block over two years, providing long-term earning potential.

With nearly $1 billion in liquidations within 24 hours, fear has taken over as investors rush to cut losses. The sharp decline follows external economic factors, including inflation concerns and growing regulatory uncertainty. The recent drop in Bitcoin’s price was accelerated by the release of U.S. inflation data, which reported a 3% year-over-year increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for January. This triggered a retest of the $94,200 support level, adding fear in the market. Meanwhile, global financial markets have also been shaken by unexpected events, like China’s AI advancements disrupting the tech industry, adding another layer of uncertainty.

He points to widespread layoffs across industries as a key indicator of economic decline. According to him, the job market is shrinking not just in the U.S. but globally. He claims that the new U.S. president plans to eliminate 65,000 jobs, while major oil companies are cutting thousands of workers due to an economic slowdown. Even car manufacturing giants like Nissan in Japan and Volkswagen in Germany are laying off employees at an alarming rate. Not So Soft? However, Kiyosaki believes this is a sign of a worsening financial crisis, warning that the economy is in very bad shape and officials are not willing to admit it. Despite government reassurances of a “soft landing,” he insists that a deep recession or even a depression could be on the horizon. Kiyosaki believes this crash will be much worse than before, with a deeper impact and a tougher recovery. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Altcoin Season Countdown: Why the Next Two Weeks Could Be Game-Changing , Why Kiyosaki is Buying Bitcoin and Gold While Kiyosaki’s outlook on the economy is bearish, he remains confident in Bitcoin and gold as the best financial safeguards . He recently increased his holdings of both, stating that owning these assets is “smarter and safer than saving dollars.” He has long been critical of U.S. economic policy, calling the dollar “fake” due to the excessive money printing that began in 2020. Trillions of dollars have been pumped into the financial system, fueling inflation and destabilizing markets. Yet, amid the chaos, he sees a way forward. While many will struggle, those who prepare wisely could turn the crisis into an opportunity. In his view, Bitcoin, gold, and silver are the only true assets in this financial storm. He has also made it clear that if Bitcoin crashes further, he will see it as an opportunity to buy more at lower prices, as he believes that hard assets are the best hedge against a failing financial system. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Wednesday's outflows were the largest of the three, with $251 million, which saw BlackRock's iShares Trust (IBIT) register a $22.1 million outflow, with Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) registering the largest outflow of $102 million, according to Farside data . The outflows coincided with low volume in the ETFs, and Wednesday saw a total of just $2.58 billion in volume. IBIT registered less than $2 billion in volume, which put it as the tenth most traded U.S. ETF, according to Coinglass data . IBIT typically falls into the top 5 most traded ETFs when bitcoin surges or gains momentum. The lack of demand shown in the recent Goldman Sachs filing of the bitcoin ETFs shows the lackluster demand for new net long positions in these ETFs, which are primarily used as trading vehicles.

It has dropped by over 40% from the YTD high and is still pointing downwards. While Cardano price has crawled back this week, it also remains in a technical bear market. This article provides an ADA vs HBAR comparison and asses the one that will emerge victorious. Hedera Hashgraph Crypto analysts are largely bullish on the HBAR price, citing its numerous catalysts. The most notable one is that its governance comprises top blue-chip companies from around the world. Notable names are firms like ServiceNow, Tata Communications, Dell Technologies, and IBM. These partnerships mean that these firms will likely embrace its technology when building decentralized solutions. Further, Brian Brooks, a board member of Hedera Foundation, who served briefly as Binance’s CEO, was rumoured to be a contender for the SEC chair. While the SEC role went to Paul Atkins , there is a likelihood that he may get a role in the Trump administration. Another potential catalyst for the HBAR price is the fact that it may have a spot Hedera ETF. In a note in December, Eric Balchunas, the head ETF analyst at Bloomberg, predicted tha the HBAR ETF will be one of the first spot fund to be approved this year. HBAR ETF Forecast There are signs that Hedera is highly connected as its president, Kamal Youssefi, was one of US representatives at the World Economic Forum in January. His recognition is a sign that the network is recognized at a global scale. Cardano Cardano price also has numerous catalysts ahead. Grayscale recently applied for a spot ADA ETF , which will likely be approved later this year. Such a fund will likely lead to more demand from Wall Street investors. Cardano has more catalysts . For example, Charles Hoskinson has a VIP meeting on March 1, where a big announcement may be made. Traders anticipate that the VIP may be Elon Musk, who is considering moving US government data to the blockchain. Crypto enthusiasts have been pushing Musk to embrace Cardano in the US government , citing its 100% uptime and low transaction costs. Cardano has other potential catalysts, including the integration with BitcoinOS , and the upcoming Midnight scaling solution. HBAR Price Forecast The weekly chart shows that the HBAR price formed a slanted triple-bottom pattern whose neckline was at $0.1860 . This pattern is one of the most bullish reversal patterns in the market. Hedera has now retested the neckline at $0.1816. A break and retest is another popular sign of a bullish continuation. It has also formed a morning star candle that has a small body and upper and lower shadows. Hedera price remains above the 50-week moving average. Therefore, the coin may bounce back, and possibly retest the extreme overshoot point of the Murrey Math Lines at $0.3418, up by 55% from the current level. The bullish HBAR price forecast will become invalid if it drops below the support at $0.1860. HBAR Price Chart Summary: Cardano vs HBAR Cardano and Hedera are two popular layer-2 blockchains that may rebound strongly over time as they welcome more developers to the ecosystem. They both have a 100% uptime, are Made in the USA, and have ETF approval odds. Therefore, these tokens have a high chance of rebounding and generating value to investors.

Core PPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is expected to show underlying inflationary pressure, accelerating to 0.3% from 0% in December. From January last year, it's seen easing to 3.3%. Hotter-than-expected data could signal monetary policy remains too loose, potentially delaying or even eliminating Fed rate cuts this year, against President Trump's wishes. A more restrictive Fed is likely to be bearish for risk assets. On the other hand, softer inflation data could weaken the dollar and lower treasury yields while helping boost risk-assets. Following the CPI data markets were volatile. Treasury yields surged to 4.6% before retreating slightly. The Dollar Index (DXY) mirrored this movement, spiking to 108.5 before pulling back below 108. Despite the initial sell-off, major asset classes rebounded , with bitcoin ( BTC ), U.S. equities and gold finishing the session in the green. Also on the agenda, Coinbase (COIN) reports fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes. Following Robinhood's strong results , expectations are high, and a positive report could provide a boost to the cryptocurrency market. Stay Alert!

The altcoin is about to complete a cup-and-handle formation, a bullish signal. But while the ADA price is expected to go up, whales are showing interest in Ethereum (ETH) and a new DeFi coin called DTX Exchange . Currently, in the crypto ICO phase, its value has risen by 700%. The DeFi platform has onboarded over 6000k users and could be the dark horse of the year. Its price is expected to soar by 10x in the next few months. Analyst Forecasts Cardano (ADA) To Hit $2 Over the past few days, there has been a massive surge in positive interest for the Cardano coin. This positive trend comes after Grayscale filed the first Cardano ETF application. Analysts like AMCryptoAlex believe this positive momentum could push the ADA price to a new level. Presently, there is a potential cup and handle formation on the ADA price chart. The analyst says the ADA price has to break past the trendline at the $1.15 region. In the case of a breakout, AMCryptoAlex forecasts the ADA price could pump to $2 in the long term. Another analyst known as Lucky says the ADA price might pump to $1.8 in the next few days. Also, Kyren posted a bullish ADA price prediction. The expert says the value of the Cardano coin could pump to $4. In the meantime, the ADA price is trading along the $0.7 region. Its value has risen by 2.9% on the weekly level. Ethereum (ETH) Whales Accumulate 1M ETH Data from Santiment reveals there has been a massive offloading of 1 million Ethereum coins from exchanges in the past week. This massive withdrawal shows that there has been a fall in selling pressure, a move that could push the Ethereum price to a new peak. At the moment, the Ethereum price continues to trade below the $3k level. Price information from CoinMarketCap shows the Ethereum price has dropped by 4.7% and 17.7% on the weekly and monthly timeframes. Meanwhile, the Ethereum price downtrend is also reflected in the technical indicators. The relative strength index is below average which means that bulls are in charge. Nevertheless, the ongoing accumulation could push the Ethereum price to a new level soon. Donald Trump has even bought $5 million worth of ETH, with many suggesting that the Ethereum price will rise as a result. Ted forecasts the Ethereum price might rally to $10k before the end of the year. According to him, the altcoin is among the few that have a high-risk reward ratio. DTX Exchange (DTX) Hybrid Approach Leads To Presale Success DTX Exchange ( DTX) is making a great impact in the crypto trading sector with its unique trading platform that combines DeFi and CeFi. This approach has received a lot of attention during its presale stage. DTX Exchange has received more than $13.8 million and has more than 600,000 users. One of the significant aspects of DTX Exchange is that it offers multi-asset trading, and it offers access to more than 120,000 instruments. This wide range of products allows traders to invest in different types of assets at once, all in one place. Most notably, DTX Exchange is anonymously operated as it does not follow the KYC (Know Your Customer) policy. This appeals to private investors who prefer to keep their financial dealings private. It also provides up to 1000:1 leverage that enables the traders to increase their market exposure and possibly increase their profits.

People keep shitting on V and perhaps eventually he gets frustrated and provocatively and ironically lashes out with a preposterous statement — which is consistent with his sense of humor and attention to the absurd. Note that his mom and dad escaped communist Russia with him… — Joseph Lubin (@ethereumJoseph) February 13, 2025 His comments came in response to Buterin’s ironic tweet, which seemed to echo some of the ideas from his earlier long-read “degen communism,” which explored the concept of spreading wealth in decentralized systems. “I personally believe we are currently ushering in a new era that I think of as collective capitalism. It is indeed time to make capitalism great for the first time, as we have never really experienced capitalism on planet Earth.” Joseph Lubin Lubin also explained why Buterin made the statement, saying “people keep shitting” on Vitalik, which pushes him to “provocatively and ironically lash out with a preposterous statement” — something that fits his typical absurd humor. “Note that his mom and dad escaped communist Russia with him when he was a child. And his dad, Dima, fully trusts V’s judgement.” Joseph Lubin While Lubin didn’t dive into specifics on how “pure capitalism” could work, he emphasized that decentralization could help make it a reality.

He praised the city’s liberal housing laws, which have helped create a boom in apartment construction and lowered rent prices by over 10% since 2022.

The company reported $358 million in crypto transaction revenue in the quarter, the highest contribution from digital-asset trading to date, Wall Street bank JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report Wednesday. JPMorgan raised its price target for the stock to $45 from $39, while maintaining its neutral rating. Citi (C) raised its target to $60 from $45 and kept its neutral rating on the stock. Broker Bernstein more than doubled it price objective to $105 from $51 and kept an outperform rating on the shares. The stock jumped 13% to $63.20 in early trading Thursday following results, released after the market closed on Wednesdy. Robinhood said fourth-quarter revenue rose 115% from the previous year to $1.01 billion, beating Wall Street analysts' estimate of $945.8 million, according to FactSet data. Transaction-based earnings increased 200% year-on-year, mainly due to a 700% rise in cryptocurrency revenue. Crypto revenue normally contributes 10%-20% of total revenue, JPMorgan noted. The 46% jump in total cryptocurrency market cap in the period and the increase in Robinhood notional volumes, which were 393% higher quarter-on-quarter, fueled the revenue beat. The company has big plans for its crypto business. ""Management seeks to add more tokens, strengthen its wallet offering, add an order book with exchange routing functionality, integrate Bitstamp and explore tokenization longer-term,"" the report said. Robinhood has benefitted from favorable trends since the start of the year, with ""crypto market tailwinds and retail activity remaining strong,"" Citi said. If this positive backdrop is maintained, the shares are likely to see support, but investors should expect volatility. While the bank has become more positive on the company's fundamental outlook, it said it preferred to wait for a ""more reasonable entry point."" Bernstein reiterated that Robinhood was the best idea in the broker's global digital assets coverage. It said it expected continued momentum in the first quarter ""driven by crypto volatility and a sustained price cycle.""

Under the previous fee distribution model, Solana validators received only 50% of the network’s priority fees, as the remaining 50% were burned. However, when SIMD-0096 was proposed in May 2024, the authors argued that it did not fully align with validator incentives and encouraged side deals. For example, if a user wanted to prioritize their transaction, they could bribe a validator with a 75% priority fee under the previous model rather than pay a 100% priority fee, where the validator received only 50%. This created an imbalance between validator incentives and the overall health and security of the network.

Notably, the latest surge comes as the market participants eagerly await the upcoming Q4 earnings results from the firm, which would provide cues on its financial health. In addition, recent reports suggesting the crypto exchange is exploring re-entering the Indian market have further bolstered market sentiment. Coinbase Stock Soars 3% Ahead Q4 Earnings Results As the financial sector, let alone the crypto market participants, eagerly awaits Coinbase Q4 earnings results, COIN stock price recorded a surge of over 3% in the pre-market session today. As of writing, the COIN stock price was up 3.01% and exchanged hands at $282.68 after closing at $274.90 in the prior session. The $70.74 billion market cap firm saw a 52-week high and low of $349.75 and $137.13, respectively. On a YTD basis, the COIN stock price surged about 10% while rocketing more than 100% over the last 12 months. Meanwhile, this pre-market session surge today comes as the market expects the firm to report robust earnings results for the final quarter of the year. What To Expect From Coinbase’s Q4 Earnings? Coinbase stock price soares pre-market as the company is scheduled to report its earnings results after the Wall Street closing bell today. According to Wall Street estimates, the crypto exchange is expected to witness a surge of over 90% in its Q4 revenue and an over 100% jump in its earnings per share on a year-over-year basis. For context, Barrons has recently reported, citing FactSet data, that the leading crypto exchange is expected to report EPS of $2.11 in Q4 FY24, as compared to $1.04 in Q4 FY23. Simultaneously, the firm’s revenue is likely to come in at $1.84 billion, up from $954 million recorded in the last quarter of 2023 Plan To Re-Enter India The recent surge in Coinbase stock price also comes amid reports that the American crypto exchange is planning to re-enter the Indian market. TechCrunch reported , citing sources, that the exchange is engaging with Indian authorities, including the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), to secure necessary approvals. This move follows a tumultuous history in India, where the crypto exchange previously launched services in 2022 but was forced to suspend operations due to regulatory hurdles. With India’s growing web3 ecosystem, the exchange’s re-entry is expected to boost its international expansion efforts. The development has sent Coinbase’s stock price soaring, as investors bet on the company’s potential to tap into India’s vast market. Coinbase Stock Soars As SEC Lawsuit Deadline Approaches The latest advancement in the COIN stock price could be also due to the speculations of a potential pause in its legal battle against the US SEC. Notably, the Coinbase Vs SEC lawsuit centers on whether digital assets traded on the exchange qualify as securities. However, with the recent pause in the Binance Vs SEC lawsuit , investors are expecting a similar development for Coinbase. Notably, the US SEC is facing a deadline on February 14 to respond to the firm’s request to appeal a key ruling in the case. Meanwhile, the market anticipates a positive outcome this week in the case, as the US SEC is going through a major shift under Trump’s presidency. Having said that, such a move could further bolster the COIN stock’s appeal to investors, which in turn could further boost its price.

Crypto markets are renowned for their unpredictable peaks and troughs, such as prices skyrocketing overnight or plunging just as quickly. This leaves traders of all backgrounds—retail investors, hedge funds, and institutions—on edge. Amid this turbulence, pairs trading is a unique strategy for those seeking consistency without giving up the potential for meaningful returns. You might also like: Beyond Bitcoin: What to expect from tokenized assets in 2025 | Opinion At its core, pairs trading involves choosing two crypto assets that have a solid statistical relationship, then taking a long position in the underpriced asset while simultaneously shorting the overpriced one. Rather than banking on a hunch that one coin will go “to the moon,” pairs trading zeroes in on how two assets behave relative to each other. If they diverge too much from their historical pattern, the strategy aims to profit when they revert to it. This approach can generate returns whether markets surge or slump, making it appealing to both large-scale funds and individual investors. Meaningful connections between crypto pairs Not all price movements that look in sync are anchored. Many assets move together in bullish or bearish markets, only to break apart when conditions shift. That’s why robust data science—namely “cointegration” tests—provides a higher degree of certainty. Cointegration goes beyond superficial correlation to verify that two assets share a meaningful pull toward each other over time. By analyzing accurate, comprehensive data and running cointegration tests, traders gain confidence in identifying these deeper pair relationships. If the spread between two cointegrated assets drifts too far from its average, the strategy is to buy the underpriced one and short the overpriced one. Once the prices converge, the profit results from that realignment rather than a bet on the overall market trend. Avoiding guesswork Effective pairs trading depends on robust, high-quality data. Research should focus on crypto pairs trading and how it illustrates granular, reliable market information forms as the core of this approach. Whether it’s historical pricing for backtesting, real-time market feeds for spotting quick deviations, or on-chain metrics for deeper insight; dependable data is crucial for a variety of areas such as Cointegration Tests, Mean Revision and Z-Scores, and Risk Management. This data-driven foundation offers the transparency and rigor that large institutions look for while also giving newer market participants the clarity they need to trade with greater confidence. Volatility in crypto is here to stay, and different market participants all have reasons to embrace pairs trading. Market-neutral strategies, like pairs trading, can help diversify alpha sources and reduce large drawdowns when it comes to institutions and funds. Meanwhile, relative-value trades offer a more measured path, reducing the stress of one-way bets that sudden market crashes can derail. This is the ideal path for many everyday investors. Whether prices are tumbling or skyrocketing, the focus remains on identifying when two closely linked assets move too far apart and capitalizing on their eventual snapback. The transition from research to real-world trades Entering a pairs trade typically requires a trading venue that supports both long and short positions. Before committing capital, it’s best to backtest using reliable historical data to see how the strategy might have performed during different market cycles, whether in a prolonged bear market or a rapid bull run. Starting with smaller trades helps manage fees, slippage, and any surprises that might arise. The relationship between two coins can shift over time, so regular data checks are crucial. If the pair is no longer cointegrated, or if market fundamentals have changed drastically, it may be time to look for new opportunities. What are the next steps? As the crypto landscape matures, more traders and institutions are pivoting from pure speculation to data-driven strategies. Pairs trading fits this trend by offering a structured, market-neutral approach. It appeals to large-scale funds looking to hedge risk and to retail investors seeking a more stable path. By combining thorough data analysis, robust cointegration testing, and disciplined risk management, pairs trading can yield returns that aren’t solely tied to broad market swings. In a sector known for extreme volatility, having a measured plan that relies on verifiable data rather than guesswork can make all the difference. Crypto’s ups and downs may never vanish, but with the right data and the right strategy, they don’t have to stand in the way of achieving consistent growth. Pairs trading provides a pragmatic, research-backed way to trade digital assets—one that can benefit anyone looking for dependable returns in an ever-changing market.

The project has already raised $446,506 in its opening phase, attracting over 665 holders in a race to secure tokens at the current price of $0.01. Early participants stand to gain a guaranteed 600% profit when the token launches at $0.06, a figure locked in by the presale structure. Beyond this immediate upside, analysts tracking the project’s fundamentals predict MUTM could surge to $1 in 2025, a 100x return from today’s price. For investors navigating stagnant markets, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a chance to pivot into a high-growth opportunity backed by tangible DeFi utility. Mutuum Finance Core Features Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates as a decentralized lending protocol, enabling users to supply assets into liquidity pools or borrow against their holdings without selling. The platform’s dual-market system combines peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) models, offering flexibility for lenders and borrowers. Lenders earn variable interest rates tied to real-time demand, while borrowers access instant liquidity by collateralizing assets like ETH or USDT. By eliminating intermediaries through audited smart contracts, Mutuum Finance ensures transparency and security, addressing common pain points in traditional DeFi platforms. The project plans to launch an overcollateralized stablecoin, designed to maintain price stability through fully backed reserves. This feature positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to capitalize on the booming demand for reliable stablecoins in decentralized finance. Combined with a buy-and-distribute mechanism that uses platform fees to repurchase tokens for stakers, the ecosystem creates a self-sustaining cycle of demand and rewards. Presale Momentum Builds Rapidly Interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has skyrocketed since the presale opened, with Phase 1 already 41% filled. The $0.01 entry price is a time-sensitive opportunity, as each subsequent phase will incrementally increase the token cost until it reaches $0.06 at launch. Investors who secure MUTM now lock in a 6x return upon listing and also position themselves for exponential gains as the platform rolls out its features. Comparatively, bigger altcoins in the market like XRP and Cardano have struggled to break out of narrow trading ranges despite their established networks. XRP’s ongoing legal battles and ADA’s slow adoption in smart contract applications contrast sharply with Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) clear roadmap and immediate utility. While these older projects face scalability and regulatory hurdles, MUTM’s presale success and upcoming platform beta signal a project ready to deliver tangible results. The math behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale is straightforward yet irresistible. A $1,000 investment at the current $0.01 price buys 100,000 tokens. At launch, this stake balloons to $6,000, a $5,000 profit in weeks. Should MUTM hit the projected $1 by 2025, the same investment grows to $100,000. Few assets in any market offer this combination of short-term security and long-term upside. To further incentivize early participation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is running a $100,000 giveaway, distributing prizes to 10 lucky presale contributors. This initiative rewards the community and amplifies visibility ahead of the platform’s beta release. With exchange listings imminent, the window to buy at $0.01 is closing faster than anticipated. Why Delay Could Mean Missing Out For holders of legacy tokens like Cardano and XRP, diversifying into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a strategic hedge. While these tokens await uncertain catalysts, MUTM’s trajectory is backed by measurable milestones: a live beta platform at launch, a stablecoin rollout, and a tokenomics model designed for scarcity. Experts tracking these developments reiterate that the $1 target is conservative if user adoption meets projections.

Table of Contents Agent A.I.: Fusing AI solutions with viral hype Shiba Inu: From meme coin sensation to underachiever AI16Z: The Solana meme coin tribute shaking up crypto in 2025 Conclusion In today’s fast-moving crypto market, investors are witnessing a shift in momentum. While SHIB faces a decline, new opportunities arise with AGNT and AI16Z, showing potential for significant growth. Enthusiasts are turning their attention to these promising newcomers, hoping to capitalize on upward trends and maximize their returns. One project gaining traction is Mission Briefing: Agent A.I., which promises a unique blend of humor and profit. This community-driven initiative intrigues many with its strategic approach and engaging presale strategy. As the bull run surges, investors are eager to explore these emerging options and ride the wave of potential gains. Agent A.I.: Fusing AI solutions with viral hype The crypto market is buzzing with AI-powered projects, but not all of them deliver. Many slap “AI” on their branding without real tech to back it up. Agent A.I. is here to change that. This project doesn’t just ride the AI wave, it merges cutting-edge AI functionality with the viral appeal of meme coins, creating a powerhouse of utility, adaptability, and community-driven momentum. As AI-driven blockchain projects surge in popularity, Agent A.I. separates itself from the pack with real, scalable technology: Lightning-fast data processing: Analyzes massive datasets in milliseconds for smarter decision-making. Dynamic scalability: Matches top cloud platforms in processing power. Continuous learning: Evolves and adapts over time, refining its AI framework for better performance. Agent A.I. doesn’t just innovate, it exposes weak AI projects, proving that true AI functionality is more than just a marketing gimmick. Early backers of Agent A.I. get access to a multi-stage, community-driven presale with deep discounts: Stage 1 price: $0.0033 per AGNT Final presale price: $0.1515 per AGNT Early investor advantage: A massive 98% discount for those who buy in early. With 28 stages, the price will steadily climb, rewarding those who secure their AGNT before the next increase. With limited presale supply, a growing community, and real AI-backed potential, Agent A.I. is positioning itself as a top contender in the next wave of crypto innovation. Agent A.I. combines two of the most attractive elements in today’s crypto market: AI-driven innovation and meme coin virality. The project’s focus on real AI capabilities and community-driven growth positions it as a standout among new crypto launches. You might also like: XRP and Solana eye ETFs while Agent A.I. builds its future Shiba Inu: From meme coin sensation to underachiever Shiba Inu (SHIB) started in 2020 as a meme coin aiming to ride the hype of Dogecoin. Historically, SHIB experienced a meteoric rise in 2020 and 2021, followed by a significant drop. It stabilized between $0.00001 and $0.00002 but remained less volatile. Over the past years, SHIB has been building new projects like its own metaverse, games, and merchandise, setting the stage for potential growth. Long-term predictions suggest a positive outlook. Analysts anticipate SHIB could reach an average price of $0.0000326 by the end of 2025 and potentially $0.000169 by 2030. While these are optimistic forecasts, its overall performance is currently uninspiring. AI16Z: The Solana meme coin tribute shaking up crypto in 2025 AI16Z , a meme coin on the Solana blockchain, emerged in late 2024 as a playful nod to venture capitalist Marc Andreessen. After peaking, the coin’s price dipped but didn’t stay down for long. News of a proposed update to its Eliza AI operating system reignited interest. Between January 20 and 22, 2025, AI16Z’s price climbed from under $0.80 to about $1.25. This surge suggested that the coin might have more in store. With less than three months of history, long-term predictions are tough. In the short term, the upcoming Eliza AI update could boost AI16Z further. Some believe that if the update meets expectations, the coin’s value might rise. However, as a speculative meme coin, volatility is a given. Conclusion SHIB is losing momentum, showing less potential for short-term gains. Investors might want to look at new opportunities that fit with the current bull market. AGENT AI and AI16Z are promising options ready for significant growth. AGENT AI is a new meme coin inspired by PEPE’s success but aims to surpass it. With a limited presale offering big discounts and plans for AI-powered tools, it offers a chance for high returns. To learn more about Agent AI, visit the official website, Telegram , and Twitter .

This rally followed a controversial March report by Forbes, which dismissed XRP as a “zombie project” with limited utility. Despite the criticism, XRP’s market cap ballooned by over $120 billion, proving its resilience. Yet, as investors chase the next high-growth opportunity, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as a standout contender. Currently in the opening phase of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a structured decentralized lending platform and a clear path to a 50x return in 2025. Mutuum Finance’s presale has already raised $446,506.20 and attracted more than 665 investors. XRP’s Controversial Surge Eight months after Forbes branded Ripple (XRP) a “good-for-nothing” asset, the token silenced critics by climbing from $0.60 to $2.86. The publication’s claims of XRP’s lack of real-world use failed to deter investors, as trading volumes soared past $2 billion daily. Similar patterns emerged across other projects labeled “functional zombies,” with many seeing double-digit growth. While XRP’s rebound captured attention, its 5x return pales in comparison to the potential of newer DeFi entrants like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Industry experts now shift focus to presale tokens, where early participation often yields the highest rewards. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters the crypto market as a decentralized lending protocol designed for efficiency and transparency. The project’s opening presale phase has already drawn significant demand, selling tokens at $0.01 each, a price guaranteed to rise 600% to $0.06 at launch. Investors recognize this as a low-risk entry point, with nearly half a million dollars committed in days. Unlike speculative assets, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines immediate utility with a buy-and-distribute mechanism that stabilizes prices through strategic token burns and staking rewards. Early backers not only lock in instant gains but also position themselves for a projected 100x surge post-launch, as platform adoption accelerates. The Mechanics Behind Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) simplifies decentralized lending through two models: peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P). Suppliers deposit assets like USDT into liquidity pools, earning variable yields based on borrowing demand. A $10,000 deposit could generate $800 annually at an 8% APY, with rates adjusting dynamically. Borrowers, meanwhile, leverage crypto holdings as collateral, accessing liquidity without selling assets. For instance, locking 10 ETH allows users to borrow stablecoins while retaining ownership of their Ethereum. This dual approach ensures continuous platform activity, directly linking MUTM’s value to user engagement. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) introduces an overcollateralized stablecoin backed by on-chain reserves. This feature addresses volatility concerns common in DeFi, offering a reliable medium for transactions. Combined with audited smart contracts and a security-first token selection process, the platform minimizes risks while maximizing accessibility. Roadmap and Community Incentives Progressing swiftly through its development phases, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to launch a beta platform alongside its exchange listing. This operational product will feature real-time lending and borrowing, attracting users seeking immediate DeFi solutions. Additionally, a $100,000 giveaway incentivizes early participation, distributing rewards across 10 lucky holders who engage with the project’s social channels. As the presale advances, token prices will incrementally rise across 11 stages, culminating in the $0.06 launch price. Analysts stress that the current $0.01 valuation represents the lowest available price, with post-launch targets set at $1. Such projections hinge on Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s ability to convert presale momentum into sustained platform growth, a feat achievable through its built-in tokenomics. Every transaction fee contributes to buying pressure, as the protocol automatically purchases MUTM from the market and redistributes it to stakers. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) transcends the hype-driven cycles of meme coins by anchoring its value in tangible DeFi services. Early investors not only capitalize on a 6x return at launch but also secure a stake in a platform poised to disrupt decentralized lending. Delaying action risks missing the most lucrative entry window, with the opening presale phase rapidly selling out. Join the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale today and position your portfolio for the 50x gain in no time.

However, as investors hunt for the next big opportunity, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a promising candidate. Now in the first stage of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a well-organized decentralized lending system, projecting a 50x return by 2025. So far, the presale has accumulated $446,506.20 and drawn over 665 investors. The Controversial Rise of XRP Eight months after Forbes criticized Ripple (XRP) as a “worthless” asset, the token silenced naysayers by jumping from $0.60 to $2.86. Despite Forbes' assertion of XRP's lack of real-world application, investors were undeterred, pushing trading volumes beyond $2 billion daily. A similar trend was noticed among other projects dubbed “functional zombies,” with many experiencing significant growth. Although XRP's recovery caught the spotlight, its 5x increase is overshadowed by the potential of new DeFi players such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Industry insiders are now turning their attention to presale tokens, where early involvement often brings the greatest benefits. Momentum Building for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters the crypto scene with a decentralized lending protocol that prioritizes efficiency and transparency.

Investors see this as a low-risk opportunity, with nearly half a million dollars already invested in just a few days. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just another speculative asset; it offers immediate utility along with a buy-and-distribute system that stabilizes prices through strategic token burns and staking rewards. Early supporters not only secure quick profits but also position themselves for a predicted 100x increase after launch as platform use expands. Understanding the Inner Workings of Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) streamlines decentralized lending through two models: peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P). Asset suppliers deposit funds, such as USDT, into liquidity pools and earn variable yields influenced by borrowing demand. A $10,000 deposit could earn $800 a year at an 8% APY, with rates adjusting based on market conditions. Borrowers can use their crypto holdings as collateral, accessing funds without needing to sell their assets. For example, staking 10 ETH allows users to borrow stablecoins while retaining their Ethereum. This dual system ensures continuous activity on the platform, directly tying MUTM’s worth to user participation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also introduces an overcollateralized stablecoin backed by on-chain reserves, addressing common volatility issues in DeFi and offering a dependable medium for transactions. With audited smart contracts and a focus on security during token selection, the platform reduces risks while enhancing accessibility. Plans and Community Engagement Moving quickly through its development stages, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to release a beta platform alongside its exchange listing. This will include real-time lending and borrowing services, appealing to users seeking immediate DeFi solutions. Additionally, a $100,000 giveaway encourages early involvement, with rewards available to 10 lucky participants who interact with the project’s social media channels. As the presale continues, token prices will gradually increase over 11 stages, reaching a $0.06 launch price. Experts emphasize that the current $0.01 price is the lowest available, with post-launch targets set at $1. These projections are based on Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s potential to turn presale enthusiasm into long-term platform growth, a goal achievable through its built-in tokenomics. Each transaction fee adds to buying pressure, as the protocol automatically purchases MUTM from the market and distributes it to stakers. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) goes beyond the hype cycles of meme coins by anchoring its value in substantial DeFi services. Early investors not only enjoy a 6x return at launch but also gain a stake in a platform set to revolutionize decentralized lending. Delaying action could mean missing out on the most rewarding entry point, with the initial presale phase quickly selling out. Join the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale today and set up your portfolio for a 50x gain in no time.

Outlier Ventures is a global Web3 accelerator, Sandbox is an immersive metaverse platform, while Animoca Brands is a Web3 leader that leverages blockchain to deliver digital property rights to consumers around the world to help establish the open metaverse. The Web3 Alliance of Saudi Arabia ( WASA ) operates as a non-profit organization seeking to unite blockchain and digital innovation leaders to drive Web3 adoption in KSA in line with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030. The trio of projects aim to create a collaborative ecosystem to empower businesses and drive sustainable growth within the country. The alliance’s board consists of local stakeholders The alliance’s board is composed of industry leaders and experts based in Saudi Arabia, actively driving the Kingdom’s digital transformation. Supported by both international and local companies, the board members include Dr. Abeer Al Humaimeedy, Yasser Alobaidan, Omar Elassar, Dr. Majid Almansouri, Wajd Badawi, Billal Yamak, Vincent Li, Bandar Altunisi, Ali Alasiri, and Stephan Apel. All the named members are engaged in advancing innovation within the country. “The Web3 Alliance of Saudi Arabia represents a crucial step forward in realizing the Kingdom’s vision for a digital future,” said Billal Yamak. “By bringing together expertise from both local and international leaders in the blockchain space, we’re creating a powerful platform for innovation and growth.” In 2023, Outlier Ventures launched its Saudi Base Camp Program which it noted marked the beginning of a concerted focus on the MENA region to accelerate the local technology and Web3 landscape. In 2024, Animoca Brands and Saudi Arabian NEOM Investment Fund signed a strategic partnership that included $50 million convertible notes financing from NEOM into Animoca. The WASA alliance will focus on four key pillars As per the press release, the alliance will focus on four key pillars. The first is awareness and education through workshops, seminars, and conferences. Secondly, WASA will focus on the development of standards and best practices. Third on the list, it will support networking and collaboration opportunities. Finally, the alliance will lead research and development initiatives. WASA will serve as the primary advocate for Web3 technology in the region, working independently to promote innovation rather than individual companies or entities. The alliance’s governance structure includes a general assembly and an executive committee, ensuring transparent and effective leadership. According to a recent KPMG report entitled, “Beyond the Hype: Balancing Speed, Security, and Value,” which provided insights into the Kingdom’s digital transformation, interest in Web3 technologies is also growing, with 69% expressing enthusiasm for innovation.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/crypto-investor-says-100-xrp-price-will-happen-heres-why/,"A recent post by crypto investor 24HrsCrypto has sparked discussions within the XRP community and the broader cryptocurrency market. He asserted that XRP would reach $100, describing it as a logical and mathematical inevitability. According to him, the key to benefiting from this price increase is patience and intelligence—traits he believes cannot be purchased. I want to make one thing very clear. $100 XRP is happening 100% Do any others come out stating this? With a 100% guarantee? All you need is two things, patience and a brain. Both you can’t buy… so i hope you got blessed. Remember- LOGICALLY AND MATHEMATICALLY, XRP… — 𝟸𝟺𝙷𝚁𝚂𝙲𝚁𝚈𝙿𝚃𝙾 (@24hrscrypto1) February 12, 2025 His statement drew mixed reactions from XRP holders. While some share his confidence in XRP’s long-term potential, others, such as X user Desert Vibes-Cheryl, expressed concerns over the timeline. She highlighted that many investors have held XRP for four years and emphasized the importance of setting realistic expectations regarding when such a price increase might occur. Market Speculation and Differing Opinions While 24HrsCrypto is certain about XRP reaching $100, other industry experts have taken a more skeptical stance. A recent Times Tabloid report highlighted financial analyst Rajat Soni’s strong criticism of such optimistic price projections. Soni, who has over a decade of experience and is known for his advocacy of Bitcoin, dismissed predictions of XRP reaching $100—or even $1,000—as detached from market realities. Soni specifically argued that these price forecasts fail to account for fundamental market principles, particularly in terms of market capitalization. He explained that for XRP to reach $100 per coin, its total market cap would need to be approximately $10 trillion, a figure he considers far beyond what the current cryptocurrency market can sustain. He further pointed out that a price of $1,000 per XRP would result in a market cap of around $100 trillion, which he described as completely unrealistic. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This perspective contrasts sharply with 24HrsCrypto’s unwavering belief in XRP’s future price surge. The divergence in opinion highlights an ongoing debate within the crypto community about the feasibility of such high valuations and the market conditions required to support them. Uncertainty Over the Timeline While 24HrsCrypto is certain that XRP will reach $100, he did not state a specific timeline. This remains a major concern among investors, particularly those who have already held XRP for several years. Desert Vibes-Cheryl’s response reflects the sentiment of many holders who want clearer expectations regarding the timeframe. Historically, XRP reached its all-time high of $3.84 in early 2018. Achieving a price of $100 would require an unprecedented increase. Some believe this is possible through strategic adoption and favorable market conditions, while others, including Soni, argue that such valuations are unrealistic based on current data. The differing opinions underscore the uncertainty surrounding XRP’s future price movements, leaving investors to weigh optimism and market realities as they make their decisions.

The launch ends its six-month long testnet phase that began in August last year. Story aims to make IP a secure foundation that others can build on, provided decentralized ownership to the creators and embedding components of Artifical Intelligence (AI). In its mainnet launch video, it mentioned its vision of stopping the exploitation of IP by the growing development of AI. It is also worth noting that the kickoff of PIP Labs founded-Story protocol comes after it raised $140 million in total funding from a16z and Samsung Next. The centralised IP Market IP has come to rely almost exclusively on centralized intermediaries to coordinate ownership and value. The production and exchange of intelligence across all disciplines is taxed at the hands of a few unaccountable entities — ranging from social platforms to pharmaceutical companies — which has increased the transaction costs for intellectual property. Intellectual property is a $60+ trillion market, yet creators still face massive challenges with ownership, licensing, and monetization. Furthermore, with the accelerating development of AI, creative outputs of IP assets owners and creators have become mere scapegoats to train models without attribution and compensation. Creatives ideas of IP assets are being created and distributed at an unprecedented and unjust scale. In addition, the traditional system can no longer compete with the reality of artificial intelligence, in which ideas can be created and distributed at scale with vanishing marginal costs. Individuals find their creative output scraped to train models without attribution and compensation, and AI companies themselves cannot feasibly generate hundreds of millions of individual licensing agreements. There exists neither legibility nor liquidity in the marketplace of ideas. It is to solve these challenges that Story is aiming to provide solutions for. Can Story build a secure IP Market? Story as a Layer 1 blockchain and a peer-to-peer intellectual property network is intending to provide an open and programmable market for peer-to-peer intellectual property exchange. Any two willing individuals can trade, extend, and monetize their ideas directly on Story without interference from rent-seeking intermediaries. By using Story, owners will be able to embed programmable terms set by themselves within their intellectual property asset. This will allow their hard-created IP assets to get monetized and exchanged across any software application on the Story network, generating yield for its owner across the internet. It also aims to provide both the universal repository and the programmable market for intelligence needed to increase the intellectual output of humanity. Although Story focuses primarily on intellectual property, its flexible architecture enables the adoption of future cores that can expand far beyond IP-related applications. Homer, our Public Mainnet, is live. Welcome to a new era of ꧁IP꧂ Learn more ↴ pic.twitter.com/u3BkW5WJYj — Story (꧁IP꧂) (@StoryProtocol) February 13, 2025 Story’s $IP token Apart from its Public Mainnet launch, Story has also launched its $IP token with an initial supply of 1 billion. The $IP token is set to function as the network’s underlying medium of exchange. Using $IP to enable efficient transaction processing and fair resource allocation, creators and users can use it to make transparent fee payments whenever intellectual property assets are used, exchanged, or generate revenue. The token facilitates direct peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries, serving both as a utility and value exchange medium to strengthen the network’s economy. Also because Story uses PoS consensus, validators can stake IP as collateral to maintain network security. Validators process transactions and maintain blockchain integrity, receiving rewards denominated in IP based on their performance. This creates strong incentives for validators to operate honestly and efficiently since they have a direct stake in the network’s success, and cements $IP as the foundation of Story’s security.

According to a Bloomberg report , Sony sold 9.5 million PS5 units during the December quarter, a 15% increase from the previous year. Game software sales increased by 7%, and network services jumped nearly 30%, bringing PlayStation online subscribers to an all-time high of 129 million. Sony’s gaming outperforms its hardware sector. The company increased its annual revenue outlook by 10% to ¥1.08 trillion ($7 billion), surpassing market predictions. The Tokyo-based company’s gaming success stems from its significant investments in adding more titles to the PS5 library. According to Kazunori Ito, research director at Morningstar, “This should guarantee profit generation in the next fiscal year and the year after that.” The company has been focusing on acquiring IPs for the entertainment sector while the smartphone camera sensor business stays stagnant, challenged by ongoing market difficulties. Hiroki Totoki, Sony’s CEO, has directed the company to transform its gaming approach after leading the company’s efforts toward PC gaming accessories. The company made a mistake when it started developing live-service games, but Concord ‘s immediate failure led the company to change direction. Sony also recently made changes to its leading team. Hideaki Nishino was promoted to sole president of Sony Interactive Entertainment, and Hermen Hulst will manage the studio business group. PlayStation 5 Pro was an enhanced and high-end version of the PS5 console, upholding its market position. According to Totoki, the PS5 Pro led more than anticipated sales in the December quarter. Totoki added, “The strong games we have lined up will help build on the PS5’s current momentum into the next fiscal year”. Sony looks forward to forthcoming major video game releases such as Grand Theft Auto VI from Rockstar Games and Monster Hunter Wilds from Capcom.

While SHIB has exhibited great optimistic momentum, climbing over 6% in the previous month, XRP has skyrocketed over 500% in the past 90 days. By 2025, these tokens might make early investors millionaires, but a new competitor, Rexas Finance (RXS), is proving even faster growth and could yield life-changing riches far sooner. Currently priced at $0.20, RXS has outperformed XRP and SHIB with a staggering 575% increase in the past 90 days. Market analysts predict RXS will experience a breakout post-launch, soaring over 12,000% to $30. RXS Outperforms XRP and SHIB: A 575% Surge with More Growth Ahead From just $0.030 at stage 1 to $0.20 in stage 12, Rexas Finance (RXS) has shown an explosive increase in its presale. As demonstrated by this 575% rise, strong investor confidence helps RXS to be positioned as the next great success story in cryptocurrencies. As RXS gets ready for its exchange release at $0.25, it is expected to climb quickly, unlike XRP and SHIB, which have had slow price swings. Once RXS reaches significant exchanges, analysts predict it may rapidly surge to $30 in four months. The analogy is clear: although SHIB and XRP could see significant increases in 2025, RXS presents a unique chance to reach the millionaire level far earlier.

However, many altcoins, such as Rexas Finance , are well-positioned for immense growth. RXS is attracting strong interest, along with new coins such as Aptos and Bonk. Looking into the crystal ball, if we set aside $600 in these altcoins, we could amass millions by 2028 in time for retirement. RXS – Rexas Finance: The Hidden Gem of 2025 Rexas Finance (RXS) earns this designation due to its phenomenal potential as the hidden gem of 2025. Like many emerging coins, RXS is set to break into mainstream crypto. Its price sits below $0.5, and presales have already raised $44.3 million, with 441.9 million tokens already sold. However, the RXS breakout is beyond altitude. This project is more than just another altcoin, as it is an ecosystem focused on tokenizing real-world assets. Integrating to create real-world rocket launches. This makes it equally appealing to retail and institutional investors. RXS is now in Stage 12 of the presale, with a price of $0.20 per token, and will be listed at $0.25 when it’s done with the presale. This is set to launch on June 19th, 2025, and based on the way this project is growing, there is excellent potential for significant increases, giving early investors great returns on their investments. Concerning the presale achievements and high demand, Rexas Finance has the potential to explode in the upcoming years. The ability to tokenize real estate, create new crypto projects, and provide new solutions driven by AI gives an innovative use case with competitive potential in the crowded territory of crypto. Once RXS is available on the leading exchanges, its price could increase, allowing investors to multiply their investments by significant magnitudes. Aptos (APT) - the Unicorn of Blockchains Layer-1 At $7.85, Aptos Coin has become one of the top players. With a market cap of $4.5 billion, APT focuses on scalability, security, and ease of use. Aptos uses the Move programming language, which enables greater efficiency in smart contract deployment and aims to be superior to its counterparts in speed and low transaction costs. Aptos has not yet reached its full capacity; therefore, it is well-positioned to capture significant growth, considering that developers and enterprises have only started acknowledging its potential. The widening adoption of blockchain technology beyond finance can lead to a greater market cap and user base for Aptos. Most analysts' predictions expect potential growth of up to 50% in the next 12 months, and longer-term projections further suggest the price will move towards the range of 25 to 35 by the year 2028. Considering the strong development team, innovative technology, and growing child, which is expected to evolve, Aptos has a bright future. Currently, investing in Aptos at the rate of $7.85 has a high probability of increasing significantly over the years, making it a fine addition to any investor's crypto portfolio. Bonk (BONK) Coin – A Meme Coin, but Not Only a Meme Coin Bonk (BONK) is another meme coin making waves in the crypto world. With a price of $0.00002476 and a market cap of around $1.9 billion, Bonk might seem like a long shot. Nevertheless, its price has recently surged, causing quite a stir in the crypto world. With the rapid price growth comes a strong community of supporters, which fuels Bonk’s growth. As the coin's popularity rises, investors tend to buy in, which leads to an increase in the meme coin’s price. Bonk’s marketing strategy heavily relies on social media and influencers, so the coin is expected to have a high return for early investors. Although investing in meme coins is and will always be risky, Bonk endorses a strategic placement within the Solana network ecosystem, alongside supporting Solana’s capital ecosystem, allowing for great profit at lesser risk. Despite Bonk’s low price, early investors are anticipated to gain a huge return on investment. With widespread adoption, meme coins like Bonk could experience another surge, and those who buy in now could witness the peak of crypto in 2028 and gain substantial profits, provided the momentum is sustained. Rexas Finance (RXS) as the Best Investment Opportunity for 2025 Despite the commendable opportunities offered by both Aptos and Bonk, Rexas Finance remains the most attractive investment in 2025. The project's ability to tokenize real-world assets, provide a complete solution for launching new crypto projects, and apply AI-based market predictions puts it in a different league from everyone else in the crypto world. With the success of the presale for Rexas Finance, the high demand for the tokens, and the listing at $0.25, investors have a strong bull to look forward to. Since the token is offered at a lower price range of $0.20, this is a good opportunity to prepare for the next bull run. These investors, who are looking to put their feet up and relax by 2038, can look forward to further exponential growth of the value of RXS as the project expands. Rexas Finance additionally has a well-established plan for the future: launching Rexas Estate, Rexas Launchpad, and Rexas Treasury. These will provide further utility to the platform. This multi-level system of Rexas Launchpad to tokenize real estate and create and manage crypto projects puts Rexas Finance ahead of the competitors. It allows Rexas Finance to be at the forefront of the new era of cryptocurrency acceptance. Conclusion Buying Shiba Inu (SHIB) and the three Rexas Finance (RXS), Aptos (APT), and Bonk (BONK) altcoins outlined above could see an investment of $600 grow to millions by 2028. While all these tokens show incredible growth, Rexas Finance stands to benefit the most. Its core presale, listing, and innovative ecosystem build position RXS to give outstanding returns. For investors seeking to retire comfortably in a few years with an enormous portfolio built on stable assets, Rexas Finance makes a great bet, meaning it will provide a solid return in 2025 and beyond.

However, many altcoins, including Rexas Finance , are well-positioned for tremendous expansion. RXS is drawing significant attention, alongside emerging coins like Aptos and Bonk. If we consider investing $600 in these altcoins, there's a possibility of accumulating millions by the year 2028, just in time for retirement. RXS – Rexas Finance: The Undiscovered Gem of 2025 Rexas Finance (RXS) secures its title as the undiscovered gem of 2025 due to its exceptional potential. Similar to other budding coins, RXS is on the brink of breaking into the mainstream crypto market. Currently priced under $0.5, the presales have already garnered $44.3 million, with 441.9 million tokens sold. But the RXS phenomenon goes beyond price hikes. This project is more than just another altcoin; it's an ecosystem aimed at tokenizing real-world assets, even facilitating real-world rocket launches. This dual appeal attracts both retail and institutional investors. Currently, RXS is in Stage 12 of its presale at $0.20 per token and is set to be listed at $0.25 after the presale concludes. This launch, scheduled for June 19th, 2025, holds excellent potential for substantial gains, offering early investors promising returns. Given its presale success and the soaring demand, Rexas Finance is poised for a significant surge in the coming years. Its ability to tokenize real estate, foster new crypto ventures, and provide AI-driven solutions offers an innovative edge in the competitive crypto landscape. Once RXS hits major exchanges, its value could skyrocket, enabling investors to multiply their investments significantly. Aptos (APT) - The Rising Star of Layer-1 Blockchains Priced at $7.85, Aptos Coin has emerged as a major player. With a market cap of $4.5 billion, APT prioritizes scalability, security, and user-friendliness. Aptos employs the Move programming language, which enhances the efficiency of smart contract deployment and aims to outperform its peers with faster speeds and lower transaction costs. Although it hasn't reached its full potential yet, Aptos is on track for significant growth as developers and businesses start to recognize its capabilities. As blockchain technology extends beyond finance, Aptos stands to gain a larger market cap and user base. Analysts predict a possible 50% growth in the next 12 months, with long-term forecasts suggesting prices could range between 25 and 35 by 2028. Backed by a strong development team and cutting-edge technology, Aptos promises a bright future. Investing in Aptos at its current price of $7.85 could yield substantial returns over time, making it a valuable addition to any crypto portfolio. Bonk (BONK) Coin – More Than Just a Meme Coin Bonk (BONK) is making headlines as a meme coin in the crypto space. With a price of $0.00002476 and a market cap around $1.9 billion, Bonk might seem like a gamble. However, its recent price surge has caused quite a buzz. This rapid growth is backed by a strong community of supporters, which fuels Bonk's momentum. As the coin's popularity increases, more investors jump on board, driving the meme coin's value up. Bonk's marketing strategy heavily relies on social media and influencers, promising high returns for early investors. While investing in meme coins carries risks, Bonk's strategic alignment with the Solana network ecosystem and support for Solana's capital ecosystem offers opportunities for profit with reduced risks. Despite Bonk's low price, early investors are expected to achieve significant returns. With widespread adoption, meme coins like Bonk could experience another surge, and those investing now could reap significant profits by 2028, assuming the momentum continues. Rexas Finance (RXS) as the Premier Investment Choice for 2025 Although Aptos and Bonk offer exciting opportunities, Rexas Finance stands out as the top investment choice for 2025. The project's capability to tokenize real-world assets, deliver comprehensive solutions for launching new crypto projects, and utilize AI-based market forecasts sets it apart in the crypto industry. With the successful presale of Rexas Finance, strong demand for the tokens, and a $0.25 listing price, investors have much to anticipate. Offered at a lower entry price of $0.20, this presents an excellent opportunity to prepare for the upcoming bull market. Those investors looking to enjoy a comfortable retirement by 2038 can expect exponential growth in RXS's value as the project evolves. Rexas Finance has a robust future plan, including the launch of Rexas Estate, Rexas Launchpad, and Rexas Treasury, providing additional utility to the platform. This multilayered approach of Rexas Launchpad for tokenizing real estate and managing crypto projects puts Rexas Finance ahead of the competition, positioning it at the forefront of the new era of cryptocurrency adoption. Conclusion Investing in Shiba Inu (SHIB) alongside the three altcoins Rexas Finance (RXS), Aptos (APT), and Bonk (BONK) could potentially transform a $600 investment into millions by 2028. While each of these tokens demonstrates remarkable growth potential, Rexas Finance is particularly well-positioned to deliver exceptional returns. Its core presale, listing strategy, and cutting-edge ecosystem set RXS up for outstanding performance. For investors aiming to retire with a robust portfolio built on stable assets, Rexas Finance represents a promising choice, offering substantial returns in 2025 and beyond.

40278916,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=695538,1739453652,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Top Meme Coins to Invest In As Binance’s CZ Contemplates New Pet Coin,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/top-meme-coins-to-buy-as-binances-cz-contemplates-new-pet-coin/,"Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, the former CEO of Binance, has been goaded by some fans to launch a meme coin inspired by his own pet dog. The entire thing went down on X, where CZ was first asked whether he even has a pet dog. As every man and his dog look to launch meme coins of their own, we review some of the best to buy right now. Nobody Without a Meme Coin It seems the idea of a pet meme coin sparked CZ’s imagination, as he followed up by inquiring how meme coins work. Half an hour later, we had the crypto legend saying, ‘Will mull it over for a day or so, as usual for big decisions.’ Although the crypto market has its fair share of dog-themed meme coins ($DOGE, $SHIB, and $BONK) – all market leaders, by the way – one by CZ himself would likely also be a hot property. Binance’s former top dog harboring meme coin ambitions follows the launch of many other celebrity-endorsed coins. These include the Trump family coins, $TRUMP and $MELANIA, Iggy Azalea’s $MOTHER, and Andrew Tate’s $DADDY coin. In this article, we’ve handpicked 4 of the best meme coins set to explode 100x in this new meme coin bull run 1. BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) – Top Meme Coin for Bitcoin Bulls BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) is easily one of the best new cryptos to buy right now, offering the ideal low-cap investment opportunity for Bitcoin maximalists. Instead of simply standing on the sidelines and cheering on the OG cryptocurrency, you can become a $BTCBULL token holder and get a taste of the action. BTC Bull will reward token holders with free $BTC airdrops whenever Bitcoin reaches new milestones. By this, we mean price points, as in $150K, $200K, $250K, and so on – all the way up to $1M, which is BTC Bull’s ultimate goal for Bitcoin. What’s more, the project plans to burn a part of its total supply at similar intervals, i.e., when $BTC hits $125K, $175K, and $225K. Token burns boost demand and shoot the token’s price up, resulting in even more gains for early adopters. Those who buy in the presale stage can also benefit from the project’s 339% staking rewards. The $BTCBULL presale has raised a whopping $1.1M in less than 3 days from its launch, and it’s all set to make some big waves in the coming weeks. You can get 1 $BTCBULL for just $0.00236 before the price goes up in two days. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Meme Coin Breathing New Life Into Solana Launched towards the end of 2024, Solaxy ($SOLX) has just crossed the $20M mark in presale funding, making it one of the best crypto presales of 2025. The driving force behind Solaxy’s growth is its goal of creating the first-ever Layer 2 network for the Solana blockchain. Although Solana is the official home of meme coins and has seen an unprecedented surge in trading activity lately, there are several issues holding it back. These include network congestion, slow transactions, and limited scalability. Solaxy aims to tackle these issues by creating a new layer 2 network for Solana, with $SOLX as the central native currency. As a multi-chain token that bridges both Ethereum and Solana, Solaxy will reduce the workload on Solana to deliver a fast and frictionless experience. Moreover, it’ll reduce the overall costs involved in using Solana. No wonder why our Solaxy Price Predictions paint a bright future ahead. You can join the Solana revolution. Simply visit the $SOLX presale and buy your tokens for just $0.001634 each. If this is your first presale purchase, here’s a detailed guide on how to buy $SOLX . 3. Dogecoin ($DOGE) – OG Canine Meme Coin that Leads the Pack It’d be fair to assume Dogecoin’s success has had a role to play in inspiring new dog meme coin ideas like CZ’s. Inspired by an actual pet dog named Kabosu, $DOGE wasn’t just the first dog-themed crypto; it was, in fact, the first meme coin ever. Plus, with over 46,000% returns in the last 4-5 years, and a current market cap of some $39B , $DOGE is a testament to the power of meme coins to generate fun, hype, and mind-blowing returns. Although the OG doggo has been facing severe selling pressure recently, whales are taking full advantage of $DOGE’s discounted prices, having bought 100M $DOGE just a few days ago . Furthermore, analysts believe Dogecoin could be on the verge of a strong bullish wave, which could see the token surge past $2.43 . That would result in a nearly 10x return for those who get $DOGE now for just $0.256. 4. Shiba Inu ($SHIB) – The Other Dog Meme Coin Dominating the Market Shiba Inu might not have the same yields as its counterpart Dogecoin, but it’s still the second largest meme coin in the world, thanks to a market cap of nearly $10B . This Ethereum-based altcoin is often referred to as the ‘Dogecoin killer,’ seeing as it, too, features a dog (a Japanese breed of hunting dog, to be precise) as its mascot. It’s worth noting that $SHIB follows a deflationary model wherein the total token supply is regularly burned or decreased to maintain demand and volatility. Currently trading for just $0.00001623, $SHIB is showing signs of a potential breakout to the upside , which could result in a ginormous 250% surge in its price. Verdict As CZ considers the meme appeal of his dog and BTC Bull looks to join in the action, it seems animal-based tokens will remain some of the best cryptocurrency to invest in right now. Hype aside, it’s important to only invest an amount you’re comfortable losing because the crypto economy is pretty volatile. As always, none of the above is a substitute for financial advice, as we urge you to do your own research before investing.",Cryptocurrency Market News|News,EN,0,0,TRADING|DOGE|BTC|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-02-13 13:34:12

The appointments come as Bitcoin miners explore alternative revenue streams following the latest Bitcoin halving event that reduced mining rewards . The newly appointed directors—Jaime Leverton, Doug Mouton, and Michael Turner— bring experience that could be valuable if Riot decides to diversify its operations beyond Bitcoin mining. Leverton previously served as CEO of Hut 8 Mining Corp, where she played a key role in the company’s expansion into HPC through the acquisition of TeraGo’s data center business. Mouton, with a background in data center construction at Meta, currently sits on the advisory board of Fidelis New Energy, a firm specializing in zero-carbon power facilities. Meanwhile, Turner, the former president of Oxford Properties Group, is expected to contribute real asset investment and capital allocation expertise. Bitcoin Miners Eye AI and HPC for Future Growth The addition of these directors aligns with an industry-wide trend where Bitcoin miners are repositioning their operations to capitalize on AI-driven demand for computational power. The April Bitcoin halving saw mining rewards drop from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block, prompting firms to reassess their revenue models. A CoinShares report from October highlighted how mining companies are increasingly diversifying their income streams, with AI being a primary area of focus. Similarly, VanEck’s August report projected that publicly traded miners shifting 20% of their energy capacity to AI and HPC by 2027 could generate an additional $13.9 billion in profits over 13 years. Despite these projections, Riot remains cautious about making any immediate moves. The company stated that while AI and HPC conversion is being explored, there is no guarantee that existing assets are suitable, nor that any potential partnerships or financial benefits will materialize. Activist Investors Push for Change Riot’s strategic direction has been under increased scrutiny from investors, particularly D.E. Shaw, a prominent investment firm that has built an undisclosed stake in the company. Reports suggest that D.E. Shaw may push for operational changes, further increasing speculation about Riot’s future in AI and HPC. CEO Jason Les confirmed that Riot is actively evaluating its AI and HPC potential, but emphasized that any future decisions will be based on maximizing asset value.

The Producer Price Index (PPI) rose 0.4% in January versus economist forecasts for 0.3% and 0.2% in December. On a year-over-year basis, PPI was higher by 3.5% against estimates for 3.2% and 3.3% in December. Core PPI, which excludes food and energy components, rose 0.3% in January versus forecasts for 0.3% and 0% in December. Core PPI year-over-year was higher by 3.6% versus estimates for 3.3% and 3.7% in December.

Normally not too widely followed, today's PPI figures took on more import coming one day after markets were surprised by Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for January that came in far stronger than estimates. Testifying before Congress yesterday following the fast inflation report, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell admitted there's more work to be done on the inflation front. The PPI number took on even greater significance as Powell said he would be interested in seeing if today's number confirmed the disappointing CPI data. After cutting rates 100 basis points in the final months of 2024, Powell and the rest of the Fed has made clear their intent to pause any further monetary ease until there's a notable slowdown in the economy and/or inflation. Before the PPI figure was published, markets had priced in only one rate cut for all of 2025, according to the CME Fed Watch Tool .",Markets|Ppi|Inflation|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-13 13:35:16

No minimum staking requirement. Decentralized and community-driven governance. Cons of Lido 10% staking fee on rewards. Centralization concerns due to a limited number of validators. While Lido is good for some, OnStaking surpasses it with higher rewards, a referral system, and a more diversified staking portfolio. 3. Rocket Pool: Decentralized Staking for Ethereum Rocket Pool is another Ethereum-focused liquid staking protocol. Users can stake ETH and get rETH tokens which maintain liquidity and can be used in various DeFi applications. Pros of Rocket Pool Fully decentralized staking with node operators worldwide. Minimum staking requirement of 0.01 ETH. Non-custodial meaning users retain control of their private keys. Cons of Rocket Pool Lower staking rewards compared to OnStaking. ETH focused, limiting options for diversified staking. While Rocket Pool promotes decentralization, OnStaking has more flexibility, better user experience, and higher earning potential. 4.

If these bills pass, it could result in the purchase of $23 billion worth of Bitcoin, creating strong demand. This may also encourage state pension funds to invest in BTC, putting even more pressure on supply. With Bitcoin already nearing a supply shortage, even a few bills passing could cause prices to skyrocket. Interestingly, Since President Trump proposed a national Bitcoin Reserve, several states have started working on their own. Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck, analyzed these state proposals and their potential impact. “We reviewed 20 state-level Bitcoin reserve bills. If enacted, they could lead to 247,000 BTC in purchases, worth $23 billion. This figure doesn’t include pension fund investments, which could add even more demand,” Sigel noted. We analyzed 20 state-level Bitcoin reserve bills. If enacted, they could drive $23 billion in buying, or 247k BTC. This sum is independent of any pension fund allocations, likely to rise if legislators move forward. pic.twitter.com/5AZnkiwTZf — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) February 12, 2025 Notably, these bills in Oklahoma, Massachusetts, Wyoming, Ohio, Texas, Utah, North Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, New Mexico, South Dakota, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Arizona, Florida, and Pennsylvania propose various levels of bitcoin allocations from general funds, stabilization reserves, and state treasurers’ accounts. Some states are eyeing big Bitcoin investments, with Arizona proposing up to $8.7 billion and Florida planning $3 billion. Missouri has introduced a bill that could allocate over $1.7 billion to Bitcoin. However, not all states have shared specific funding amounts, making it hard to predict the total market impact, he shared. Sigel pointed out that North Dakota’s proposal lacks details, and some states like Pennsylvania have already seen their bills fail. Sigel is suggesting that the $23 billion estimate might be an understatement because some states have not disclosed how much they plan to invest. Since the investment amounts from several states are unknown, the actual total could be higher than the current estimate.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-13 13:37:12

Word on the street is that this digital asset could soar by 20,000%. Is this the next golden opportunity in the crypto space? Discover the insights behind this bold move. Alpha Meme Coin DOGEN Off to the Moon After Its Major Listing Event DOGEN, which has recently captured the interest of the crypto community with its bold narrative of the strongest meme coin for alpha males , was listed on February 4th. The listing comes at the perfect timing as the crypto market is on the brink of a massive bull run supported by favorable geopolitical factors. Affectionately dubbed “DOGE on steroids” by one community member, DOGEN is poised to replicate the success of popular meme coins such as Dogecoin, which has seen a whopping 66,000% increase compared to its launch price . Those who bought $DOGEN during the presale got it at a bargain price. However, it is not too late; $DOGEN remains a good value and its price is predicted to increase from here. Community-Driven with Real Value DOGEN isn’t just a fad; it’s a growing movement with a team dedicated to building a strong community of alpha leaders who are ready to take over the market. This token offers real value, including exciting campaigns and exclusive benefits for early adopters. DOGEN is a chance to be part of something big. The community-driven presale strategy has enabled DOGEN to raise $5.5 million in initial funding and amass a large community of nearly 20,000 DOGEN fans . This provides a strong foundation for the token to start its mission to the moon successfully. The $DOGEN private presale has concluded, and the token can now be purchased with SOL on major cryptocurrency exchanges. DOGEN is heading to the moon! Join the mission and don’t miss out! Dogecoin: A Popular Cryptocurrency Inspired by a Meme Dogecoin (DOGE) was launched in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to other cryptocurrencies. Its logo features a Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has no supply limit, and 10,000 new coins are created every minute. Initially considered a joke, its value rose in 2021 due to social media buzz and Elon Musk’s support. It became one of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market value, surpassing $50 billion. Dogecoin attracts users because of its active community and low transaction fees. Its appeal depends on social media trends and market conditions, making it an unpredictable but interesting choice for some cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Conclusion While DOGE, BONK, WIF, and Popcat show less short-term promise, DOGEN emerges as a standout. Designed for those who seek the best, it embodies luxury and success. With expected 700% growth by the end of its presale and potential for thousand-fold returns, DOGEN is building a community of leaders and offers real benefits to early adopters.

40279077,https://coingape.com/?p=238825,1739454065,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Breaking: Bitcoin Price Soars Despite US PPI Exceeds Wall Street Estimates,https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-soars-despite-us-ppi-dampens-crypto-market-sentiment/,"The much-awaited US PPI data today showed that inflation has advanced 3.5% in January, marking its highest increase since February 2023. This gloomy data, after the recent hotter-than-anticipated US CPI inflation figures, has further added pressure on the crypto market traders. However, with an unexpected twist, Bitcoin price has surged crossing the brief $96K mark. Bitcoin Rises After US PPI Release The latest US PPI Inflation data by the Labor Department has fueled concerns over a potential Bitcoin price crash ahead. However, it appears that the investors have shrugged off the inflationary concerns, as evidenced by the recent surge in BTC. Meanwhile, the latest data showed that the US PPI advanced 3.5% on a year-over-year basis (YoY) in January, up from 3.3% in the prior month. The inflation on a monthly basis came in at 0.4%, up from the prior month’s figure of 0.2%. Notably, the latest data exceeds Wall Street expectations. Simultaneously, the Core PPI, which excludes the food and energy prices, came in at 3.4% as compared to December’s figure of 3.3%. On the other hand, the Core PPI on a MoM basis rises to 0.3% from 0.1% recorded in the previous month. The market was expecting the Core PPI to come in at 3.3% and 0.2%, respectively. Bitcoin Price Soars 2% Reflecting Bullish Market Sentiment Bitcoin price today recorded a surge of over 2% despite the gloomy data and soared past the brief $96K mark after the US PPI release. This latest advancement in the crypto’s price indicates that the investors have shrugged off the inflationary concerns while focusing on the long-term potential of the coin. Besides, it also indicates that BTC has emerged as a safer haven amid inflationary and global macroeconomic concerns. Meanwhile, BTC price reacted immediately and slipped after the US CPI exceeded Wall Street expectations yesterday. Notably, these hotter-than-expected figures are likely to give more space to the Federal Reserve to move with their hawkish rate cut plans. Notably, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has reiterated his stance on interest rate cuts, saying that the central bank would consider the economic condition before coming to a decision. Having said that, these recent sets of data have cemented bets over no Fed rate cut before the first half of the year. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the US central bank is going to maintain the policy rates at their upcoming gathering in March. Source: CME FedWatch Tool Crypto Market Rallies Amid Cautious Stance The broader digital assets space also rallied today, with the global crypto market cap rising 2.1% to $3.18 trillion. Top altcoins like Ethereum, XRP, Cardano, and others, also followed Bitcoin price movements, witnessing gains of over 2% following the US PPI release. However, despite the immediate bullish response, market watchers are keeping close track of the flagship crypto’s performance. Recently, top analysts highlighted key support levels for BTC price , which the crypto should break to continue its upward run. Besides, an expert also predicted that a close below the $92K level could trigger a massive selloff in the market, potentially dragging down the Bitcoin price to the $70,000 level. Meanwhile, the US 10-year Bond Yield also slipped 1.2% to 4.577 while the US Dollar Index fell 0.12% to $107.690.

The flagship cryptocurrency is trading just over $96,000, as buyers look to prevent a further decline. Analysts believe BTC is stuck in a consolidation phase above key support levels. However, it must reclaim $100,000 to start a fresh rally and push toward its all-time high. Bitcoin ETF Outflows Register Uptick Spot Bitcoin ETFs registered a sharp increase in outflows on February 12, recording $251 million in outflows, a 342% jump from $56 million recorded a day prior. Fidelity led the outflows, registering $101.9 million in outflows, followed by ARK and 21Shares ARKB with $97 million. However, Grayscale’s Mini Bitcoin Trust was an exception, recording over $16 million in inflows. The remaining Bitcoin ETFs did not register any substantial movement. The total trading volume for Bitcoin ETFs was $2.53 billion on February 12, with cumulative net inflows at $40.21 billion. Spot Bitcoin outflows coincided with a drop in the price of BTC following stronger-than-expected US inflation data. January’s inflation was at 3.3%, exceeding the forecasted 3.1%. With inflation higher than expected, investors anticipate only one rate cut in 2025, with the Fed likely to maintain the status quo until 2026, adversely impacting risk assets like BTC . Goldman Sachs Doubles Down On Bitcoin ETFs Goldman Sachs has doubled down on its Bitcoin ETFs, significantly increasing its spot Bitcoin ETF holdings, according to its latest 13F filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The bank now holds $1.57 billion across various Bitcoin ETFs, up from the $710 million reported in Q3. Goldman Sach’s largest exposure to BTC is with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), where it holds 24.07 million shares worth $1.27 billion, an 88% jump since its last filing. According to market observers, Goldman’s positions reflect a shift in institutional outlook and investments in BTC and, to a lesser extent, ETH. Goldman Sachs’ SEC filing also reveals it added $288 million to Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF (FBTC), a 105% increase from the previous quarter. Goldman also holds $3.6 million through Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Additionally, it holds a $527 million put position, a $84 million put position through IBIT and FBTC, and a $157 million call position through IBIT. US Releases Russian Bitcoin Fraud As Part Of Prisoner Exchange The US will release a Russian national as part of a prisoner exchange that brought home American schoolteacher Marc Fogel. Alexander Vinnik, a Russian national, was arrested in 2017 on charges related to the laundering of billions of dollars using BTC . A grand jury convicted Vinnick on 21 counts related to the laundering of the stolen funds. The White House has also confirmed Vinnick’s impending release. President Donald Trump has also indicated another detainee would be freed in exchange for Fogel after he was released from a prison in Russia and returned to the US. Vinnick operated the BTC -e crypto exchange and was arrested in Greece at the request of US authorities who believed he was responsible for laundering up to $4 billion through the exchange. The Russian national pleaded guilty to the charges last year and was facing up to 20 years in prison. The US Justice Department stated that BTC -e was being used by cyber criminals to transfer, launder, and store proceeds from illegal activities, hacks, ransomware attacks, identity theft, and more. The Justice Department also stated that the exchange hand had no KYC processes in place. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is down nearly 2% during the ongoing session, retreating after hotter-than-expected inflation numbers adversely impacted risk sentiment. US inflation rose more than most economists predicted, impacting crypto and stock markets. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) grew 0.5% for the month, higher than the forecasted 0.3% and more than December’s 0.4% increase. The CPI rose 3% annually, slightly higher than the anticipated 2.9% and at par with December’s numbers. Core CPI rose 0.4% in January, higher than the predicted 0.3% and doubling December’s 0.2%. Meanwhile, Year-over-year core inflation is high at 3.3%, higher than the expected 3.1%. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has reiterated that further rate cuts are unlikely unless the economy or inflation numbers take an unexpected turn. BTC slumped below $96,000 during the current session as it struggled to break out of its trading range. Analysts believe BTC is stuck in a consolidation phase as it eyes a breakout. However, sellers hold the upper hand as of now. BTC made a strong recovery from last Monday’s low of $91,274, rising nearly 4% to $101,579. However, it was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping 3.54% to slip below $100,000 and the 50-day SMA and settling at $97,983. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell 1.34% to $96,668. BTC attempted a move past $100,000 on Thursday, reaching an intraday high of $99,237. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and fell to $96,641. The price briefly crossed $100,000 on Friday, surging to $100,222 before losing momentum and settling at $96,634. Source: TradingView Price action remained muted over the weekend as BTC registered a marginal increase on Saturday and a marginal decline on Sunday to settle at $96,526. Buyers returned to the market on Monday as BTC rose to an intraday high of $98,393 before settling at $97,468. However, the price fell on Tuesday, dropping nearly 2% to $95,801. BTC fell to an intraday low of $94,106 on Wednesday as selling pressure increased. It recovered from this level to register an increase of 2.17% and settle at $97,881. The current session sees BTC down nearly 2% as it struggles to stay above $96,000. BTC faces resistance at $98,000 and $100,000. If BTC can move past these levels, it could rally to $105,000 or higher. On the other hand, if sellers retain control of the session, BTC could drop to $93,000-$94,000. A break below this level could drag the price to $90,000. The RSI and MACD are bearish, indicating sellers have the upper hand. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

33767162,[object Object],1739454318,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Best Altcoins to Buy as 21Shares Files to Stake Its Spot ETH ETF – Crypto Bull Run Incoming?,https://bitcoinist.com/best-altcoins-to-buy-as-staking-spot-ethereum-etfs-fuel-crypto-bull-run/,"Earlier today, CBOE BZX Exchange filed for 21Shares to stake its spot $ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF), sparking optimism of a crypto bull run. If approved, 21 Shares would break new ground, so it’s not surprising that the 24-hour trading volume for $ETH has shot up by ~35% alongside the news spreading. Reason for the hype is that it’s anticipated to attract more eyes of institutional investors and uplift the industry at large. As the excitement continues, we anticipate new altcoins that also have novel values – like $BTCBULL and $MEMEX – to jump during the crypto bull run. 1. Bitcoin Bull ($BTCBULL) – Will Airdrop Bitcoin Every Time $BTC Breaks a Record First on our list is Bitcoin Bull ($BTCBULL) , and for good reason. It’s a perfectly titled bullish crypto project owing to dishing out $BTC every time the crypto leader breaks a new record ($150K, $200K, $250K, and so forth). Considering $BTC has nearly doubled since last year, winning the world’s largest cryptocurrency might just be a stone’s throw away. Plus, it’s not just $BTC that’s up for grabs. When Bitcoin reaches $250K, a hefty $BTCBULL airdrop awaits the most dedicated community members (10% of the total token supply is set aside for this purpose). To reap the rewards, all you need to do is connect Best Wallet to the Bitcoin Bull presale website , purchase $BTCBULL (currently at $0.00236), and wait for Bitcoin’s price to spike. You can also accumulate extra $BTCBULL by staking the token at an impressive 357% APY. 2. Catslap ($SLAP) – Virtually Slap Top Meme Coins to Snag Token Rewards Also predicted to fly high during the highly anticipated crypto bull run is $SLAP , which opens access to the world’s first-ever slap-to-earn game, Catslap, where a hefty amount of tokens can be won. To snag free crypto, all you need to do is play the game and act as a virtual cat to slap top meme coins (like $DOGE and $SHIB). If successful, you’ll rank up the slapometer (the project’s leadership board) and win $SLAP in return. The slapometer plays a prominent role in the ecosystem. Every time it reaches certain milestones (depending on how many slaps take place and $SLAP coins are unstaked early), a portion of the token’s total supply is burned (taken out of circulation). Rarer coins often attract attention because they are harder to accumulate, possibly making their prices jump. Further attracting eyes to Catslap is ‘Slap Drop.’ Here, you can earn more $SLAP by completing social tasks and interacting with memes on Zealy (but you must download the Best Wallet app first). To get started, buy $SLAP on the official site for $0.00113096 or on MEXC for $0.0010. Considering we predict its price will hit $0.0135 at the end of the year, and that it’s advocated by the popular YouTuber Crypto ZEUS (who has 85.3K subscribers), now signals a great time to buy. 3. Meme Index ($MEMEX) – Linchpin to the First Decentralized Meme Coin Indexes Another one of the best presales is Meme Index ($MEMEX) , the backbone of the world’s first decentralized meme coin indexes currently in development. But there’s a catch: only $MEMEX holders will get access to them once they go live. These meme coin baskets will be worth checking out because they cater to each trader’s risk tolerances, regardless of their needs. For example, Meme Titan Index is the most conservative approach because it highlights the top eight meme coins, whereas the Meme Frenzy Index is laden with high-risk coins that would yield the greatest returns. An extra bonus is that more $MEMEX can be accumulated through 632% staking rewards, of which 25% of the total token supply is set aside. To top it off, 20% of $MEMEX’s full amount is also allocated to governance and voting, so you can vote on your favorite memes to be featured in the Meme Frenzy Index and upcoming baskets. Joining the presale is easy. Head to the official Meme Index website , connect your wallet to the widget, and buy $MEMEX for $0.0161637 using either $ETH, $USDT, $BNB, or fiat. 4. Stobox Token ($STBU) – Low-Cap Entry Into the Rapidly Growing RWA Industry Last but not least is $STBU, whose daily trading volume is up by 39.57% owing to its distinct use cases. $STBU is a digital currency in the Stobox ecosystem, which entails blockchain services and tools, including the Stobox Dashboard and DS Swap. It pays transaction costs and commissions, rewards dedicated users, and provides governance and tokenization services. Also making it a valuable purchase during a crypto bull run is its tokenization service. Stobox turns real-world assets (RWAs) like property and shares into digital assets, leveraging $STBU in the process. Given that the RWA market is predicted to exceed $50B by the end of this year, the tokens are a cost-friendly entry point into a flourishing market that shows no signs of slowing down. Join the trend by purchasing $STBU for approximately $0.013 on major centralized exchanges, including Binance and KuCoin. Will Staking Spot ETH ETFs Spark a Crypto Bull Run? The anticipation of soon being able to stake 21Shares spot $ETH ETF is attracting attention, pointing at a crypto bull run potentially being just around the corner. It could significantly boost Ethereum’s overall adoption and have a ripple effect in the entire crypto realm. Also attracting attention to the development is that it’d be the first of its kind to do so. In the crypto space, investors are keen to get their hands on what’s typically hard to attain, which is why novel coins like $BTCBULL and $SLAP are also poised to rocket. Nonetheless, this isn’t investment advice. Always DYOR before making investments and never invest more than you’d be sad to lose.",Altcoin News|Crypto News|21Shares|bitcoin|Ethereum|ethereum etf,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-13 13:45:18

Despite this, the broader cryptocurrency market staged a modest recovery. Sui Network’s native token (SUI), for one, has witnessed over 10% rebound in market cap over the past 24 hours. In contrast, most other projects remained stagnant within the same timeframe. SUI’s 5:1 Positive Social Bias SUI momentum in 2025 has been further boosted by new partnerships and staking rewards, which have managed to sustain user engagement. Social media platforms like X, Reddit, and Telegram are abuzz with bullish sentiment. In fact, according to Santiment’s latest update , positive commentary on the Sui ecosystem has dwarfed negative commentary by almost a 5:1 ratio, which is the highest positive bias for the token since mid-September. Branded by its founders as a “Deliverer of Benefits of Web3 With the Ease of Web2,” Sui Network has managed to position itself as a leading player in the DeFi and gaming sectors while offering fast, low-cost transactions that appeal to users. While the current rebound is modest compared to SUI’s impressive rally of more than 259% over the past five months, it has revived optimism among investors. However, Santiment has warned against excessive crowd FOMO, cautioning that continued upward movement this week could spark retail greed and hinder the organic growth long-term investors are anticipating. “Just be cautious of too much crowd FOMO if the bounce continues the rest of the week, as retail greed could delay a more organic rally that patient investors have been waiting for.” SUI’s November Downtime Last November, Sui Network experienced significant disruption which halted mainnet block production for two hours due to a bug in its transaction scheduling logic, which caused validator crashes. The issue was swiftly addressed, allowing the network to resume transaction processing. However, the outage triggered a double-digit drop in SUI’s price. SUI’s recovery following the outage was quick. During the early 2025 rally, SUI capitalized on bullish market sentiment, surging above $5. However, as the market cooled off, SUI faced increased selling pressure which dragged its value back below $4 by February 2025.

The US has proposed two laws, the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act to set stricter rules for stablecoin issuers. These laws would require stablecoins to have reserves fully backed by liquid assets like US Treasuries. Regulatory Pressure Mounts on Tether JPMorgan’s latest report highlights concerns over Tether’s compliance with these new bills. The STABLE Act allows state-level oversight and enforces stricter reserve rules, while the GENIUS Act mandates federal oversight for large issuers but offers more flexibility in reserve assets. Under the House’s STABLE Act, only 66% of Tether’s reserves meet the compliance criteria, while the Senate’s GENIUS Act sets a slightly higher bar at 83%. This declining compliance ratio suggests that Tether’s ability to meet these requirements has weakened since mid-2024 due to the rapid expansion of stablecoin supply. If either bill becomes law, the report notes that Tether would need to restructure its reserves, shifting towards more liquid assets such as U.S. Treasuries. US Market Poses a Greater Challenge Tether has already faced regulatory hurdles in Europe, where the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) rules require large issuers to hold 60% of reserves in EU-based banks. While this led to delistings on several European exchanges, the impact was softened by Tether’s limited market share in the region. However, the U.S. presents a more significant challenge due to Tether’s dominant position in the American market. With U.S. lawmakers pushing for more transparency and frequent reserve audits, Tether could face increased scrutiny. The demand for high-quality and liquid reserves could put pressure on its dominant market presence. Will Tether Sell Bitcoin? Tether currently holds around 83,758 Bitcoin valued at over $8 billion as part of its reserves, according to Bitbo. In 2023, Tether announced plans to allocate 15% of its quarterly profits to Bitcoin purchases. Despite its robust financial standing, with a reported $13 billion in profits for 2024 and a reserve buffer exceeding $7 billion, regulatory changes may force the company to liquidate a portion of its Bitcoin holdings. If U.S. regulations demand greater liquidity in its reserves, Tether may have no choice but to adjust its asset allocation, potentially impacting the broader crypto market.",News,EN,0,0,USDT|BTC|MARKET|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-13 13:48:44

Despite this uncertainty, the price remains confined within a narrow trading range, with consolidation likely to persist in the short term. XRP Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart After a notable dip below the 100-day moving average at $2.1 and the lower boundary of the expanding wedge, Ripple quickly absorbed resting sell-side liquidity, which sparked a rebound above these vital support levels. This move helped clear out over-leveraged long positions in the perpetual markets, contributing to a cooling effect. Since then, the price action has been choppy with very low volatility, reflecting an uncertain market sentiment. Currently, XRP remains confined within a narrow trading range bounded by the dynamic 100-day moving average and the key $3 support level. In the absence of a decisive breakout, this consolidation phase is likely to persist, leaving the next trend direction in limbo. The 4-Hour Chart XRP’s price has shown signs of downward pressure on the shorter timeframes as it dipped into a significant liquidity zone below previous swing lows. This triggered a flurry of buy orders that led to a quick recovery. However, the impulsive rally encountered considerable selling pressure around the $2.7 level, resulting in a period of sideways trading. With the current low trading activity, the market is indecisive as buyers and sellers continue to contest the next move. Until a clear direction emerges, further consolidation within the $2 to $3 range is expected.

Working with the central banks of countries like Colombia, Georgia, Montenegro, and Palau could speed up the adoption of digital currencies globally. The news can only be good for Ripple’s own $XRP token. It plays a critical role in Ripple’s payments network as it standardizes bank transactions. If a bank in Georgia wants to send funds to Colombia, for example, it can do so using $XRP, eliminating conversion fees and other costs. As Ripple partners with more companies, this move would definitely help push up $XRP’s value in the foreseeable future. The token is currently trading at around $2.45, but some investors have speculated that it could soar well beyond that in the near future. Ripple’s potential partnership with the Bank of Japan, for instance, could further boost this possibility. Reports say that nearly 80% of banks in Japan plan on integrating $XRP into their systems. If it pushes through, this would result in lower costs and faster transaction speeds for these participating institutions. Of course, greater adoption of digital currencies could also pave the way for altcoins and even meme coins. If you’re looking to leverage the current momentum of cryptocurrencies for potentially huge gains, here are four worth checking out. 1. Solaxy ($SOLAXY) – It’s Solana Made Better If you’re tired of constantly dealing with Solana’s failed transactions and network congestion, Solaxy ($SOLX) promises to solve these once and for all. This Solana Layer 2-based token wants to offer faster transaction speeds, lower fees, and reliability. Since it’s based on Solana, this means that you’ll be able to enjoy unparalleled efficiency and security on the platform. By off-loading transactions on its Layer-2 chain and bundling them together, Solaxy can speed things up considerably, and offer a much cheaper trading experience for traders. The modular infrastructure also lets developers use Solaxy for diverse use-cases, as the components are plug-and-play and can be used for anything (like meme coins and financial systems). $SOLAXY currently costs $0.001634 and has already raised over $20M since its presale began (and its price is predicted to shoot u p). There’s another upcoming price increase in less than 48 hours, so it’s best to grab tokens at a discounted rate while you can. 2. BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) – Bet on a $BTC Bull Run and Earn Free Bitcoins BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) is a project that banks on the continued rise of Bitcoin ($BTC). When $BTC reaches certain milestones, like reaching $150K and $250K, $BTCBULL will give away free Bitcoins to its users. These milestones seem a bit far off from $BTC’s current sub-$100K price, but there’s a lot going for it. For example, a friendlier US government and increased interest from Japanese companies could boost $BTC’s price in the near future. Moreover, the project will also burn portions of the token supply when Bitcoin reaches specific price points, which should create scarcity and drive $BTCBULL’s token price upward. Overall, this translates to higher bullish potential for it. Other investors are also bullish on $BTC, given the fact that $BTCBULL was able to raise $1M shortly after announcing its presale (and over $500K in less than 24 hours), making it one of the best crypto presales at the moment. If you want to buy some, it’s still pretty cheap at $0.00236 per token. 3. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Buy Tokens, Decide Best Wallet’s Future Best Wallet is without a doubt one of the best crypto wallets in the market. Now it wants to give users the chance to have their say on how to develop its ecosystem via its Best Wallet Token ($BEST) . When you buy $BEST, you’ll be able to vote on the direction the project will take. Aside from that, you’ll also enjoy lower transaction fees on Best Wallet, get first dibs on its crypto presales and projects, and earn passive income when you stake your $BEST tokens. The project has raised nearly $10M since it began preselling its tokens. The price of $BEST has also increased several times since then, but you can still get it for only $0.023975 in the next 24 hours. 4. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) – Feeding Your Need for Speed on Bitcoin Similar to $SOLAXY, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) wants to address scalability issues on Bitcoin. In addition, it can speed up transactions as it features a 2-second block time compared to Bitcoin’s usual 10 minutes. This Bitcoin Layer 2 blockchain can help developers create DeFi dApps, including DEXs, NFTs, stablecoins, lending and borrowing platforms, and margin trading and futures platforms. $PLUTO is also compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. This means that it could potentially simplify integration with Ethereum-based projects. Like the other projects on our list, $PLUTO is currently on presale. You can still get it for only $0.10984 but you have only less than 24 hours before the next price increase. Our Verdict All in all, meme coins offer huge potential gains, especially those that offer utility. They could also benefit greatly from the growing adoption of digital currencies, thanks to initiatives of companies like Ripple. At the end of the day, though, it’s important to remember that cryptocurrencies tend to be highly volatile. Crypto trading isn’t for the faint of heart nor for the uninformed. Because of that, always remember to do your own research and never invest money you can’t afford to lose.

Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz , recently highlighted the efficiency and accessibility benefits of RWA tokenization using the XRP Ledger, positioning it as a key player in this emerging market. Meanwhile, the unexpected surge in demand for the Official TRUMP and Melania meme coins led to a liquidity crunch for MoonPay, prompting emergency funding from Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. Ripple CTO David Schwartz Highlights RWA Tokenization in Latest ‘Crypto in a Minute’ Video Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer and XRPL co-creator, David Schwartz, recently participated in the company’s “Crypto in a Minute” video series, discussing the potential of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. The short video, shared by Ripple enthusiast @BankXRP, highlights how blockchain technology can bring greater efficiency to the tokenization of physical assets such as real estate. According to Schwartz, RWA tokenization presents transformative possibilities, particularly in real estate markets, where ownership validation, fractional sales, and collateralization could be revolutionized. His insights align with Ripple’s broader strategic ambitions in the blockchain-based asset tokenization space, a sector expected to reach trillions of dollars in value in the coming years. In the video, Schwartz provided a concrete example to illustrate the benefits of RWA tokenization: tokenizing a house. He explained that this process would significantly simplify and streamline key aspects of property ownership, including: Fractional ownership: Tokenization could allow users to sell portions of their house, making property investments more accessible to a broader range of buyers. Proof of ownership: A tokenized asset could serve as a verifiable and immutable proof of ownership, reducing the potential for fraudulent transactions. Collateralization for loans: Homeowners could easily stake their tokenized property as collateral for borrowing money, facilitating a more efficient and transparent lending process. This efficiency gain is not limited to real estate. The broader financial sector could benefit from tokenized versions of treasuries, debt instruments, and structured yield strategies. Ripple has been actively positioning itself as a key player in the tokenization market. Earlier this week, the company released a blog post outlining its commitment to RWA tokenization using the XRP Ledger (XRPL). According to Ripple, XRPL offers unique advantages for tokenizing real-world assets, including: Seamless Token Creation: The XRPL allows users to mint new tokens instantly without requiring deep knowledge of smart contracts or programming. Built-in Decentralized Exchange (DEX): Any token created on the XRPL can be immediately traded on its native DEX, enhancing liquidity and accessibility. Cross-financial usability: The issued tokens can be integrated into various financial products, extending their use case beyond simple trading. Ripple has also identified several high-value areas where real-world asset tokenization can drive efficiency and innovation: Tokenized Treasuries: Converting traditional government bonds and corporate treasuries into blockchain-based assets could improve settlement times and reduce counterparty risks. Real Estate Tokenization: As mentioned by Schwartz, tokenizing properties could lower entry barriers and create new investment opportunities through fractional ownership. Tokenized Debt Markets: Debt instruments could become more transparent and tradable, offering greater liquidity compared to traditional financial systems. Yield Strategies: Tokenization could enhance decentralized finance (DeFi) yield models, providing investors with new ways to earn passive income. The potential applications of RWA tokenization extend well beyond these examples, as financial institutions explore ways to integrate blockchain technology into existing market structures. Challenges Hindering RWA Tokenization Growth Despite the promising outlook, Schwartz and Ripple acknowledge that significant obstacles still stand in the way of mass adoption. Regulatory Uncertainty One of the biggest hurdles facing RWA tokenization is unclear or inconsistent regulations across jurisdictions. Many financial authorities are still debating how to classify tokenized assets, leading to legal ambiguities. Countries with stringent financial rules may delay or restrict adoption, creating fragmented market conditions. Blockchain Interoperability Issues Tokenized assets must be interoperable across different blockchains and financial networks to achieve widespread adoption. Ensuring seamless transactions between various blockchain ecosystems remains a technical challenge. Secure Ownership & Settlement Mechanisms: Establishing trustless, tamper-proof ownership and robust settlement protocols is crucial. Cybersecurity risks and smart contract vulnerabilities must be addressed to protect investors and institutions. Schwartz emphasized that overcoming these challenges should be a top priority to unlock the full potential of tokenized assets and create a truly decentralized financial ecosystem. However, regulatory clarity, improved blockchain interoperability, and secure settlement mechanisms remain key factors that will determine how quickly RWA tokenization reaches its full potential. As more traditional financial players explore blockchain-based asset management, Ripple’s commitment to simplifying tokenization could help bridge the gap between legacy finance and the digital economy. MoonPay Secures $160 Million Emergency Loan From Galaxy Digital and Ripple Amid Trump Meme Coin Frenzy In other news, the crypto on-ramp platform MoonPay faced an unprecedented surge in demand during the launch of the Official TRUMP and Melania meme coins, forcing the company to secure an emergency loan totaling $160 million from Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. MoonPay’s enterprise president Keith Grossman revealed the details in a recent episode of the When Shift Happens podcast. According to Grossman, the platform saw a massive spike in activity the weekend ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration, leading to what he described as a virtual DDoS attack due to the overwhelming number of registrations and transactions. “The volumes were just gigantic. All of the liquidity that we used to buy and sell crypto was locked in BlackRock accounts in traditional finance… and it’s Saturday of a holiday weekend during the inauguration. So, we had no access to our capital. All of the reserves that we had were dwindling really fast,” Grossman stated. Faced with a liquidity crisis, Novogratz provided MoonPay with a $100 million loan, while Garlinghouse added another $60 million to help the company meet the surging demand for Trump’s meme coin. The demand for the Official TRUMP (TRUMP) meme coin was unlike anything seen before in the meme coin sector. Just one day after launch, the token’s market capitalization skyrocketed to nearly $9 billion, with a fully diluted valuation surpassing $70 billion. The massive success of the token showed the growing appeal of political and celebrity-backed meme coins but also ignited a debate about the ethics and legality of such ventures. Despite the controversy, the demand for the TRUMP and Melania meme coins drew comparisons to other celebrity-driven cryptocurrencies, reinforcing the idea that political branding and meme culture are becoming increasingly intertwined in the blockchain space. The explosive rise of the TRUMP meme coin did not go unnoticed by regulators and legal experts. The launch quickly drew legal scrutiny, with some attorneys arguing that it could be a violation of the US Constitution. David Lesperance, a legal expert, suggested that the meme coin could violate the Emoluments Clause, which prohibits US presidents from accepting gifts, payments, or financial benefits from foreign entities. The concern is that the Trump Organization and its affiliates reportedly control 80% of the TRUMP coin, creating a potential conflict of interest. Adding fuel to the controversy, US Senator Elizabeth Warren called for a federal investigation into the token’s launch, expressing concerns that it could serve as a hidden channel for political donations or bribery. “The Trump family-controlled Trump Organization and its affiliates hold 80 percent of the TRUMP coin,” Warren stated in a letter dated Jan. 22, 2025, urging authorities to examine the meme coin’s ownership structure and financial implications. Meanwhile, Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer protection organization, echoed Warren’s concerns. In a Feb. 5 letter, the group argued that a sitting president should be prohibited from launching a personal cryptocurrency, as it could create undue influence and financial conflicts. MoonPay’s Repayment and Market Aftermath MoonPay was able to access its BlackRock accounts on Jan. 21 and promptly repaid the $160 million loan from Novogratz and Garlinghouse. However, the rapid events of the weekend highlighted the volatility and unpredictability of the crypto sector, especially when high-profile figures and political figures are involved. The market reaction was equally dramatic. While the TRUMP meme coin experienced an explosive rally, it also saw major losses, with reports indicating that investors lost up to $2 billion in subsequent price corrections. The situation also renewed discussions about the regulatory landscape of meme coins. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has so far refrained from direct oversight of meme coins, treating them as speculative assets rather than securities. However, some regulators believe that tokens tied to public figures, corporations, or political campaigns should be subjected to stricter oversight to prevent potential market manipulation and fraud. The TRUMP meme coin saga is a stark reminder that the crypto industry is evolving in unexpected ways. The emergence of politically branded cryptocurrencies has introduced a new layer of controversy, legal debate, and regulatory uncertainty.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-13 14:00:00

The market is moving, and while many will wait for confirmation, the smart ones act now. The crypto expert who saw Avalanche (AVAX) and Stellar (XLM) before their massive rallies isn’t just making another prediction. The expert is giving a roadmap to the next major wealth opportunity .

Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood Says It’s Coming,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-1-5-million-ark-invest-ceo-cathie-wood-says-its-coming/,"ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood is steadfast on her estimate that Bitcoin may rise to $1.5 million by 2030, despite a bold projection that is causing a stir across the crypto space. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales On The Move—224,000+ ETH Withdrawn In Record Outflow Known for her lofty tech forecasts, the financial guru described this situation during Ark’s Big Ideas 2025 conference, where she revealed that the odds of reaching this astronomical figure have actually increased. The Path To A Million-Dollar Bitcoin Wood’s forecast goes beyond simply hauling figures out of thin air. Given Bitcoin’s current market value of $95,500, Ark’s prediction would be a startling 1,470% rise over the next five years. The company has sketched three possible routes: a middle-ground objective of $710,000, a conservative estimate of $300,000, and the headline-grabbing bull scenario of $1.5 million. These scenarios correspond to compound annual growth rates of 21%, 40%, and 58% respectively. Institutional Money Floods The Crypto Markets Research by Ark indicates that the terrain of bitcoin investment is changing significantly. Under the most hopeful scenario, their study shows institutional investors might commit up to 6.5% of their worldwide market portfolio to Bitcoin. Major financial companies are already seeing the flagship crypto as a portfolio diversifier, drawn by its special risk-return profile, hence this is not only theoretical thinking. The possibility of the digital asset to account for up to 60% of gold’s market capitalization lends still another degree of legitimacy to these bold forecasts. Cathie Wood: BTC could reach $600K by 2030, and even $1.5M in bull market ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood stated in an interview with CNBC that Bitcoin (BTC) is expected to reach $600,000 in the firm’s base case scenario by 2030 and could even hit $1.5 million in a bull case,… — CoinNess Global (@CoinnessGL) December 31, 2024 Stablecoins Dominate Conventional Payment Titans Perhaps the most eye-opening revelation from Ark’s research concerns stablecoins, which have quietly revolutionized the payment landscape. In 2024, stablecoin transaction values reached a whopping $15.6 trillion, surpassing both Mastercard and Visa. Stablecoin volumes were, in comparison, 119% of Visa’s and double Mastercard’s transaction numbers. Although conventional payment systems currently manage more individual transactions, the sheer financial value passing through stablecoins reveals a fascinating picture of the direction of digital finance. Multiple Growth Catalysts Point North Wood’s positive forecast is not predicated on any one element. Instead, Ark sees a confluence of growth drivers, including the adoption of Bitcoin as a safe haven by emerging economies, the incorporation of the digital currency into treasury holdings by nations, the growing use of on-chain financial services by corporations to diversify their cash reserves, and more.

As cryptocurrencies become more popular as an option to digital gold, and as their share of institutional portfolios grows, it seems that the market may not be giving them enough credit for their long-term potential. With the digital revolution happening in traditional finance right now, Wood’s big goals might not be so out of reach after all.

Although scam-related revenue has dropped, Chainalysis expects it to climb as more scam-related addresses are discovered. To top that, the rise of AI has also made scams more advanced and effective. AI Technology Amplifies Scams The scam technology vendors of the P2P marketplace offering various illicit services, Huione, received a minimum of $375.9 million in cryptocurrency in 2024. Between 2021 and 2024, Huione’s scam infrastructure providers saw exponential revenue growth, while AI service vendors’ earnings surged by 1,900%. This reflects the booming use of AI tools that allow scammers to impersonate individuals or craft realistic content to deceive victims into fraudulent investment schemes. Revenue and Growth: Chainalysis Generative AI has the potential to drive legitimate innovation but also enables scammers to scale their operations more efficiently and at a lower cost. AI-powered fraud detection solution Alterya discovered that 85% of scams involve fully verified accounts that bypass traditional identity checks. Using this technology, fraudsters often trick victims into approving payments under false pretenses, a tactic known as authorized push payment (APP) fraud, according to Chainalysis’ press release shared with CryptoPotato. In a statement, Elad Fouks, head of fraud products at Chainalysis and co-founder of Alterya, stated, “GenAI is amplifying scams, the leading threat to financial institutions, by enabling high-fidelity, low-cost, and highly scalable fraud that exploits human vulnerabilities. It facilitates the creation of synthetic and fake identities, allowing fraudsters to impersonate real users and bypass identity verification controls.” Platforms like Huione Guarantee , host numerous software vendors supplying generative AI tools for scams. One vendor on the platform promoted AI-based “face-changing services” priced at $200 in cryptocurrency. On-chain analysis also revealed several payments matching this amount, suggesting the buyers are likely scammers purchasing the software after encountering the vendor’s advertisements on Huione Guarantee. Data also indicates that scammers are utilizing these technology vendors to carry out fraudulent activities. Huione debuted a blockchain initiative called Xone last year, along with a USD-pegged stablecoin known as “USDH.” These tools are promoted as resistant to regulatory control and asset freezes, likely intended to bypass traditional restrictions. Whether XOC or USDH will emerge as Huione’s primary trading currency is yet to be determined. For now, USDH is only accessible through Huione-affiliated sites, but an October 2024 announcement confirmed ongoing talks with major exchanges to list USDH on widely used trading platforms. Huione Vendors Transfer Activity. Source: Chainalysis Chainalysis’ analysis of on-chain interactions in 2024 among vendors and scams on the Huione platform uncovered 2,345 transfers between scams, infrastructure providers, social media management services, AI vendors, and data vendors. Two vendor types – infrastructure providers and social media management services – had the most transaction activity, often sending funds to one another. Scams showed moderate activity, primarily paying for social media management services, while data vendors and AI service vendors had the least interactions and transactions with other entities.

Its crash has mirrored the performance of most meme coins, including big names like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. So, is the Pepe Coin price at risk after whales deposit 2.3T to CEX exchanges, or will it rally against the odds? Pepe Coin Price Crashes as Whale Offloads 2.3T PEPE Amid Smart Money Selloff Third-party data shows that the number of Pepe coins in centralized exchanges continued rising this week. An increase in CEX inflows, especially by whale investors , is usually a negative sign as it points to more selling. Santiment data shows that Pepe whales moved 2.3 trillion worth of tokens valued at $22 million to centralized exchanges (CEX). Pepe had wallet balances of 2.83 trillion tokens on February 11, which then dropped to 510 billion on the 13th. That is a sign that these whales offloaded their tokens to CEXs, a sign that they were selling their tokens as a sign of capitulation. Pepe Whale Deposit to CEX More data shows that smart money investors have dumped the Pepe coin in the past few months. There are now just 61 smart money holders of Pepe, down from 82 in November. These investors hold 9.59 trillion Pepe tokens, down from 12 million in the same period a year earlier. Whale dumps and smart money investors selling is a bearish factor that explains the current Pepe coin price crash. However, historically, such periods of negativity often become good periods to accumulate coins. Pepe Coin Smart Money Investors MVRV Indicator Hints Rebound Likely Meanwhile, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) indicator has dropped, a sign that accumulation may be going on. The 365D MVRV indicator moved to minus 43% on February 7. The last time the MVRV indicator was this low was in February last year when it moved to minus 24, which triggered a Pepe surge by 342%. As such, the MVRV hints that the coin is in an opportunity zone, which may lead to more gains in the near term. The MVRV indicator is a popular tool that compares an asset’s market value and the realized value and then applies a Z score. It is used to track the profit and loss of a coin’s holders in a certain duration, in this case 365 days. A negative data indicates that these investors are in a loss, and is where most smart money accumulation happens. Pepe Coin MVRV Indicator Pepe Coin Price Analysis as it Sits at a Key Support The daily chart is sending mixed signals about the Pepe coin price. On the positive side, the coin crashed to $0.00000811 last week as most coins dropped. This was an important support level since it failed to drop below the trendline in April, August, September, and November last year. It always bounced back whenever it dropped to that support level, signaling that it may also rebound now. For example, it surged by 270% after nearing that support in November. On the negative side, the coin recently formed a death cross as the 200-day and 50-day Weighted Moving Average (WMA) flipped each other. It has also formed a small bearish flag chart pattern, a continuation sign. Pepe Coin Price Pepe Token Targets Therefore, the value of Pepe may rebound to the 200-weighted moving average level at $0.000015, up by 50% from the current level. The bullish Pepe forecast will become invalid if it drops below the ascending trendline. Such a drop will bring the next support at $0.0000059, its lowest level in August.

Binance, however, has assured customers that their funds are safe. So, what evidence are these X analysts giving? Did Binance actually sell billions of US dollars worth of crypto? Analysts Question Whether Binance Sold Reserves to Pay DOJ Fine Binance, the biggest crypto exchange, reached a deal with the DoJ in 2023 to resolve a long-standing investigation. Changpeng Zhao was sentenced to four months in prison, and Binance was asked to pay a $4.3 billion fine. The company has until March 2025 to pay the fine. Some crypto analysts note that Binance may have sold tokens like BTC, SOL, and XRP to pay the DoJ fine. In an X post, Beanie , a popular crypto analyst with over 217k followers on X, said that the number of token reserves on Binance had crashed between January and February. Bitcoin reserves dropped from 46,896 in January to 2,747 in February, a 94% decline. Ethereum, Binance coins , and USDT reserves dropped by over 90% between the two months. Beanie noted: “ As I posted the other day, it’s now confirmed from Binance itself that it sold $5B of speculative crypto assets. Nearly 100% of its reserves. Only kept a tiny amount of Bitcoin. And most of its BNB. It’s now holding mostly only customer deposits. And has barely any long exposure.” Meanwhile, Marty Party , another popular crypto analyst, worried about the “highly alarmingly low” reserves. His calculations estimate that Binance held about $3.3 billion of BNB tokens, $1.3 billion worth of USDC, and $276 million worth of USDT. Its other holdings are in XRP, FDUSD, SOL, and ETH. The addition of all these tokens shows that it has less than $7 billion in reserves, most of which are BNB, its native token. The company’s crypto reserves Exchange Categorically Rejects These Claims Therefore, X analysts opine that Binance likely sold its reserves to pay the upcoming fine. In a reply to an X post, it rejected the claims and claimed that the asset movements was part of an adjustment in the treasury accounting process. The post also reiterated that customer funds were safe, saying : “ Binance is not selling assets . This was simply an adjustment in the Binance treasury’s accounting process. User funds are SAFU, as always.” The key concern among users is that dumping reserves worth billions would be risky for Binance, a company with millions of users. More so, by having BNB as its biggest reserve would mirror the situation that led to FTX’s crash. At the time, most of FTX’s assets were in FTT, whose value evaporated overnight when it imploded in 2022. Binance has faced criticism in the past. A key issue among regulators has been the fact that it has no headquarters, making it difficult to pursue. Binance, on the other hand, has historically claimed that it is a safe company. It publishes its proof of reserves to boost transparency. And in 2024, it hired Grant Thornton , a large accounting company, to audit its business. So, did the company sell its BTC, SOL, and XRP to pay its fine? As of now, these are just speculations, as Binance has rejected the claims.

Analysts connect the possibility of an approved XRP ETF to a potential $15 rally, which, if realized, would eclipse even the most optimistic forecasts from earlier this year. While supporters point to Ripple’s long standing cross-border ambitions, skeptics note that partial courtroom victories haven’t yet sparked the massive breakout many hoped for. Still, the idea of a double-digit XRP intrigues both institutional players and everyday traders looking for life-changing gains. $15 ETF Target: The Long-Awaited XRP Price Prediction? For months, enthusiasts have tossed around an XRP price prediction of $10 or more, often hinging on the theory that an SEC-approved ETF would catalyze a new wave of institutional investment. Ripple’s partial legal triumphs in 2023 fueled that speculation, but the process for an ETF remains complex. If a spot XRP ETF becomes reality, some believe it could inject billions into the token’s market cap, particularly from large funds seeking a regulated way to hold XRP. Still, the draw of a regulated investment vehicle for a token with existing enterprise ties is hard to dismiss. A successful ETF might confirm what many see as XRP’s underlying value: the potential to simplify global money transfers. Remittix: The “New XRP” Everyone’s Watching While XRP aims for a spot ETF and the $15 target, one coin repeatedly dubbed the “new XRP” is Remittix, a PayFi project surpassing $11.7 million in presale funding. Instead of partial chain upgrades or meme hype, Remittix tackles a $190 trillion global remittance market. That real-world use case—allowing freelancers and the unbanked to convert crypto into local cash at minimal fees—resonates widely. Some watchers see it outpacing even the most ambitious XRP price prediction, if bridging daily transactions lures a massive user base. Of course, success demands user-friendly apps, licensing, and strategic partnerships, but bridging crypto with real finances often commands mainstream appeal. If bridging local currency and digital assets piques your interest, see Remittix before the presale ends. Why a PayFi Pivot Could Matter More While ETFs and legal progress can boost short-term excitement, PayFi solutions might address deeper financial gaps, generating sustained demand for tokens that fix everyday money woes. Ripple has long courted banks and large remittance firms, but partial adoption has left many waiting for a full-scale breakthrough. Meanwhile, altcoins like Remittix may fill that gap by offering immediate benefits to people worldwide—especially the 1.7 billion adults who lack bank accounts. If bridging day-to-day finances proves more compelling than a single regulatory approval, we could see a broader market pivot toward PayFi tokens. That would mean coins like XRP must keep evolving to remain competitive, even if they secure an ETF listing. Could a $15 XRP Outshine PayFi? An XRP price prediction of $15 hinges on an ETF approval that might funnel institutional capital into Ripple’s ecosystem. Even so, high hopes for an ETF alone may not guarantee the token’s ascent if real adoption trails behind. Meanwhile, the “new XRP” label pinned on Remittixreflects a growing appetite for tokens solving tangible cross-border payment issues. Whether you believe the ETF hype or prefer PayFi altcoins, it’s clear that utility and regulatory clarity will shape the next bull run. If bridging local currency and crypto resonates more than waiting on an ETF, check Remittix now, and keep tabs on official updates at Linktree . As 2025 nears, the battle between speculative euphoria and practical finance might decide whether XRP’s $15 call materializes—or if new contenders like Remittix capture the lion’s share of market growth.

Experts link the potential approval of an XRP ETF to a possible $15 surge, a figure that could surpass even the most hopeful predictions from earlier in the year. While fans highlight Ripple’s enduring ambitions for cross-border transactions, skeptics argue that partial legal successes haven’t yet led to the explosive growth many anticipated. Nevertheless, the prospect of a double-digit XRP is capturing the attention of both institutional investors and everyday traders in search of transformative gains. $15 ETF Goal: Is This the Long-Awaited XRP Price Forecast? For a number of months, enthusiasts have speculated about an XRP price forecast of $10 or higher, often based on the idea that an SEC-approved ETF could trigger a new wave of institutional investment. Ripple’s partial victories in court in 2023 have fueled this speculation, though the process of getting an ETF approved remains intricate. Should a spot XRP ETF become a reality, some predict it could add billions to the token’s market cap, particularly from large funds seeking a compliant method to invest in XRP. The allure of a regulated investment option for a token already linked to enterprise is undeniable. A successful ETF might affirm what many perceive as XRP’s inherent value: simplifying global financial transactions. Remittix: The “New XRP” Gaining Attention As XRP strives for an ETF and the $15 milestone, a coin frequently branded as the “new XRP” is Remittix, a PayFi venture that has exceeded $11.7 million in presale funding. Rather than relying on partial chain upgrades or meme-driven hype, Remittix addresses the $190 trillion global remittance market. This tangible use case—enabling freelancers and the unbanked to convert crypto into local currency with minimal fees—is widely appealing. Some observers believe it could surpass even the boldest XRP price forecast, if it manages to attract a large user base through everyday transactions. Naturally, success will require user-friendly applications, proper licensing, and strategic partnerships, but bridging crypto with real-world finances often draws mainstream interest. If connecting local currency to digital assets interests you, check out Remittix before the presale concludes. Why Shifting to PayFi Could Be More Significant While ETFs and legal advancements can spark short-term enthusiasm, PayFi solutions might address more profound financial gaps, creating lasting demand for tokens that resolve everyday money challenges. Ripple has historically engaged with banks and major remittance firms, but full-scale adoption remains elusive. Meanwhile, altcoins like Remittix may fill that void by offering immediate advantages to people around the globe—particularly the 1.7 billion adults without bank accounts. If addressing daily financial needs proves more compelling than a singular regulatory approval, we might witness a broader market shift towards PayFi tokens. This would mean coins like XRP must continue to adapt to stay competitive, even if they achieve an ETF listing. Could a $15 XRP Surpass PayFi? An XRP price forecast of $15 relies on an ETF approval that could channel institutional funds into Ripple’s network. However, relying solely on an ETF may not be enough for the token’s rise if actual adoption lags. Meanwhile, the “new XRP” label given to Remittix highlights a growing interest in tokens addressing real cross-border payment challenges. Whether you buy into the ETF buzz or favor PayFi altcoins, it’s evident that utility and regulatory transparency will drive the next market upswing. If integrating local currency and crypto is more appealing than waiting for an ETF, explore Remittix now, and stay informed with official updates at Linktree . As 2025 approaches, the clash between speculative excitement and practical finance might determine whether XRP’s $15 prediction comes true—or if emerging players like Remittix claim the bulk of market expansion.",More News,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-02-13 15:36:55

Quant ( QNT ) token rose to an intraday high of $97.40, its highest level since February 2nd and 30% above its lowest swing this month. The token jumped after Oracle, the 19th-biggest company globally, unveiled its Oracle Blockchain Platform Digital Assets Edition. OBP DA is a new enterprise-grade solution designed to help partners build and deploy digital assets. It simplifies the tokenization efforts by combining a bank-grade distributed ledger infrastructure with smart contracts. The platform is built using Quant’s Overledger technology, which enables cross-ledger operations and workflows. Overledger is often seen as a better and more advanced alternative to Chainlink ( LINK ) Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol or CCIP. It enables the OBP DA to ensure atomic settlement with immediate finality and bridge the gap between blockchains.

Quant price technical analysis QNT chart | Source: Crypto.news The daily chart reveals that the QNT price soared to a high of $171.3 in 2024 and retreated to a low of $72.54 last week. It has bounced back and retested the crucial resistance at $95.57, the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level and its lowest swing in December and January. This is a sign that it has formed a break-and-retest pattern, a popular continuation sign. Quant has also remained below the 50-day and 200-day moving averages and the Ichimoku cloud indicators.

Cryptocurrency regulation in the UK is coming by 2026. The government aims to balance innovation and consumer protection, consolidating the country as a global hub of digital finance. The plan is to focus on stablecoins, staking services and trading platforms. The initiative comes at a crucial time: the cryptocurrency sector is transforming not only finance but also adjacent areas such as sports. Multi-million-dollar sponsorships, innovative fan tools and new business models are changing the rules of the game. The urgency to act is obvious. Without a clear regulatory framework, the risk is that the UK will lose ground to competitors such as the European Union and the United States, which are already busy devising regulatory strategies. But what will really change with the arrival of UK regulations? Tickmill , a leading online trading broker, has analysed the impact of blockchain in sports, linking the current situation to the prospects of an increasingly regulated market. From baseball to Formula 1 , basketball and tennis, blockchain-based technologies have already redefined the relationships between clubs, fans and cryptocurrency platforms. The real test case is in football: in the 2024/25 season, 14 of the 20 Premier League clubs have entered into agreements with crypto companies, for a total value of £130 million (+30% compared to the previous year). Only six clubs – Liverpool, Brighton, Brentford, Fulham, Ipswich Town and Bournemouth – still don’t have a cryptocurrency sponsor or partner. Partnerships may also include spin-offs on “fan tokens”: digital assets that allow fans to actively participate in the clubs' lives. Via crypto-based tokens, supporters can influence decisions, access exclusive events and receive unique rewards, strengthening their bond with the club. The introduction of regulations could lead to an increase in the number of athletes involved in the crypto world, following in the footsteps of sportsmen and women such as Lionel Messi, Serena Williams, Tom Brady and Kevin Durant - who have received part of their salaries in cryptocurrencies or actively invested in cryptocurrencies trading. An increase in regulations could also have repercussions on eSports. Regulation could act as a catalyst for crypto adoption in an industry where fan tokens, digital asset payments and play-to-earn games have already generated a veritable ecosystem based on talent and digital innovation. One must wonder what impact regulations will have on these complex and intertwined dynamics between the crypto world and sports. While promising greater transparency and protection for consumers, regulations could also mean new constraints for crypto companies and ‘burden’ them with more red tape, forcing them to review their strategies – including their involvement with sports clubs, athletes, supporters and the e-sports world.

A Financial Times insight, citing Goldman Sachs’ research on the effects of the “peace talks,” has laid out the potential economic consequences of two different peace scenarios. The first, a more limited truce with a gradual resolution of the war, would likely ease some pressure on European markets, particularly in the natural gas sector. The second, a more comprehensive peace agreement could deliver a greater boost to economic conditions. According to Goldman’s analysis, if a limited truce were to occur, natural gas prices in Europe could drop by 15%, leading to a modest inflation reduction of 0.15 percentage points. A broader peace deal, however, might lead to a 50% decrease in gas prices, cutting inflation by 0.5 percentage points and contributing to a potential 0.34% boost to the Eurozone GDP. Economic scenarios look ‘better’ if the war ends in peace Following President Trump and the Kremlin’s discussions of a possible ceasefire, European natural gas futures have already seen a notable decrease, dropping more than 5.5% to below €53 per megawatt-hour. Natural gas price chart. Source: Tradingeconomics Per a February 13 analysis from Trading Economics, the figure represents a significant decline from a two-year high of €59. The European Commission is expected to introduce a gas price cap as part of an upcoming support package, which could be announced by February 26. Despite the dip in gas prices, concerns linger over Europe’s low storage levels, which are at 47.2% full, the lowest for this time of year since 2022. This raises concerns about meeting energy demands for the upcoming winter. Since the outbreak of the war three years ago, consumer confidence in the Eurozone has sharply declined, yet analysts predict that a ceasefire could bring some modest recovery. However, high inflation, one of the biggest ‘why’s’ in weakening consumer sentiment, could continue rising even after Ukraine and Russia war stops. Euro area inflation for January 2025 could go up slightly to 2.5%, an uptick from 2.4% in December 2024. Services, which make up the largest portion of household expenditure in the Eurozone, are projected to experience a 3.9% inflation rate, down from 4.0% in December. Energy inflation, on the other hand, is expected to rise significantly to 1.8%, compared with just 0.1% in the previous month. Still, Goldman Sachs forecasts a slight improvement in confidence and a corresponding GDP increase of 0.03% to 0.09% in the event of the invasion ending. Ukraine reconstruction and European growth According to estimates from CEEMEA economists, rebuilding efforts in Ukraine could contribute a modest 0.02% to 0.08% to Eurozone GDP. The bulk of the financial burden would likely fall on the United States, but more than a half dozen senior European officials believe the US will expect Europe to shoulder the costs of reconstruction. This also including providing troops to maintain a peace deal, that the officials insists is a disadvantage if they will not be involved . Speaking to the Financial Times, one senior EU official said, “The Americans don’t see a role for Europe in the big geopolitical questions related to the war. It’s going to be a real test of unity.” The war in Ukraine has also had significant effects on financial markets across Europe, tightening financial conditions and leading to declines in equity prices and bond yields. However, economists believe that these effects could begin to ease as the war gradually stops, potentially providing a modest GDP boost of 0.06% to 0.13%. Barclays analysts noted that European equities could see a rebound , particularly among stocks benefiting from the physical reconstruction of Ukraine. According to the bank’s conversations with American investors, many pulled back their investments in Europe when the war broke out but may return if peace is achieved. “Any progress towards a pause in the conflict may be seen as likely to ease the fiscal and economic burden on the region,” said Barclays. “However, defence spending will continue to rise, with Trump unlikely to ease pressure on NATO to increase budgets.” While defense and energy stocks have surged since the war began, sectors like airlines, leisure, chemicals, and banks have experienced significant declines. This gap is starting to narrow, but Barclays analysts believe the crowded EU defense sector may see some profit-taking, offering opportunities for those looking for investments with long-term growth.

With its strong community-driven ecosystem and inspiration from the iconic panda, this Asia-led coin is causing a huge stir in the cryptocurrency world. With potential to be the top meme coin of 2025, SHIBI has already reached extraordinary heights thanks to Eastern investors, and the West is now beginning to take notice. Early adopters have a unique opportunity to profit before this high potential meme coin blows up, with a presale promising an incredible 1,200% price rise. Panshibi (SHIBI): The Next-Gen Meme Coin That’s Taking Over Panshibi isn’t just another meme coin, it’s a revolution. By merging three powerful forces, Asia, pandas, and the ever-expanding meme coin culture, Panshibi has positioned itself as a standout contender in a market flooded with clones. To provide a really participatory experience, SHIBI is combining SocialFi and AI-driven capabilities, unlike projects that rely solely on hype. SHIBI holders get access to exclusive rewards, competitive quests, and token stakes that yield industry-leading annual percentage yields (APYs) of up to 1,200%. That's only the start, though. By locking the liquidity pool for ten years and protecting team tokens for two years, the Panshibiteam has guaranteed long-term stability. This venture has significant potential and is well-structured; it is not only a pipe dream. As the presale progresses, the price of SHIBI continues to rise across 15 structured stages, rewarding early buyers with the highest profit potential. There is a definite chance for huge profits because 60% of the 2 billion token supply is set aside for the presale. Coinsult conducted a thorough audit of the smart contract, which passed with no problems, demonstrating the project's dedication to security and openness. From 1,200% Presale Gains to 145,000% Post-Launch: Panshibi’s Price Potential is Insane The statistics are self-evident for those who are still undecided. Panshibi’s presale is anticipated to climb by 1,200% before listing, and after debut, experts predict a 145,000% jump. This isn’t just speculation, meme coin market trends support such growth. Investors poured billions of dollars into the high potential meme coin space, which saw a 500% increase in market valuation in 2024 alone. The demand is greater than ever, shown by the fact that 31% of all cryptocurrency investor interest is currently on meme tokens. With the total meme coin market valued at $115 billion, major players are looking for the next breakout star. Panshibi is set to launch on top-tier centralized exchanges (CEXs) and Uniswap, ensuring that liquidity and accessibility won’t be a problem. Even better, the token’s ownership will be renounced after presale, giving full control to the community. This decentralized approach, combined with locked liquidity and an ambitious roadmap, makes SHIBI one of the top meme coins of 2025. Early investors have a chance to buy in before major exchange listings drive the price up even further. And with the best presale opportunity currently available, those who act now could see life-changing gains. Panshibi’s Future: The Meme Coin That Could Define 2025 The global crypto landscape is shifting, and Panshibi is leading the charge. While meme coins like Dogecoin and PEPE have established themselves in the market, SHIBI is proving that innovation and community-driven utility are the future. By embracing an Asia-first strategy while still capturing Western interest, Panshibi is creating a truly global movement. The West is now waking up to what early Asian investors already realized: this token has the potential to be the top meme coin of 2025. As the 100x presale continues, savvy investors are positioning themselves ahead of the curve. With staking rewards, a fully community run model, and a market-ready product, Panshibi is a powerhouse in the making. For those looking to invest in a high-potential meme coin with real growth opportunities, SHIBI is the name to watch. With just weeks left before the presale ends, now is the time to act.

But that's just the beginning. The Panshibi team has ensured long-term stability by locking the liquidity pool for a decade and securing team tokens for two years.

What's more, after the presale, token ownership will be transferred to the community, creating a decentralized environment. This approach, combined with secured liquidity and an ambitious roadmap, positions SHIBI as one of the top meme coins of 2025. Early investors have a window to get in before major exchange listings push the price even higher. With the current presale being a prime opportunity, acting now could lead to transformative gains. Panshibi’s Prospects: The Meme Coin That Might Shape 2025 The global crypto scene is evolving, and Panshibi is at the forefront of this change.

The fundraising round was led by Framework Ventures and will support Plasma’s testnet and mainnet launches, as well as its expansion into remittances, payments and DeFi applications, the team said. The investment followed a $4 million round with early backers including Bitfinex, stablecoin issuer Tether's CEO Paolo Ardoino, venture capitalist Peter Thiel and prominent crypto traders Cobie and Zaheer Ebtikar, also known as Split Capital. Stablecoins have become a dominant force in crypto surpassing $220 billion in supply, and are increasingly used for everyday payments and savings. While Bitcoin is the longest-running blockchain, most of the stablecoin activity happens on newer chains like Ethereum, Tron and Solana. Plasma is designed to be a sidechain on the Bitcoin blockchain with full compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which underpins a large part of decentralized finance activity. The team said they aim to address challenges faced by stablecoins on existing blockchains, such as high fees and scalability limits by leveraging Bitcoin’s security and offering zero-fee USDT transactions. ""Stablecoins are the clear winner in blockchain adoption, yet they’re treated as second-class citizens on current blockchains,"" Paul Faecks, founder and CEO of Plasma, said in a statement. ""By leveraging Bitcoin as a foundation, zero-fee USDT transfers, alongside a purpose-built ecosystem and infrastructure for stablecoins with deep liquidity, Plasma creates the most secure, scalable, and efficient blockchain for stablecoins on the market.”",Finance|Stablecoin|Plasma|USDT|Tether|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,USDT|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-13 15:46:56

The idea emerged after a viral social media exchange in which users pushed him to reveal his dog’s name and picture. A Possible Change in Perspective The discussion began when an X user, Crypto Kemal, asked CZ to share details about his pet. He responded with curiosity, writing, “Honest newbie question. How does this work? I share my dog’s name and picture, and then people create meme coins? How do you know which one is ‘official’? Or does that even matter.” After taking some time to consider the conversation, the former executive followed up by calling the idea “pretty interesting.” He stated that he would think it over for a day or so, as he typically does when making important decisions. He also mentioned that he might start engaging with memes on the BNB Chain. His comments fueled speculation that he was preparing to launch a meme token, causing traders to react in anticipation. While the Binance founder has yet to confirm any plans, some community members took matters into their own hands by launching their own coin. Will post the dog pic in 3 hours, 8PM ish Dubai time. https://t.co/DkaCEDsjc3 — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) February 13, 2025 Data from DEXScreener reveals that a newly launched token, TORO, branding itself as “CZ’s dog,” has already gained traction on the platform. TORO briefly reached a market cap of $4.8 million before plunging to around $300,000 at the time of writing. CZ’s Stance on Meme Coins This development is particularly notable due to the 48-year-old’s stance on the asset class. The former executive has previously expressed skepticism about meme coins. In November 2024, he described the trend as “a little weird” and urged developers to focus on building practical blockchain applications instead of speculative tokens. More recently, Zhao addressed issues surrounding meme coins after a test token incident. On February 9, Binance published a tutorial on how to launch a token. However, TST, the test token used in the demonstration, saw a sudden surge in value as traders rushed to buy it, turning it into a functional coin. CZ quickly clarified that Binance had no involvement in the token’s launch. Additionally, the executive also spoke about Binance’s listing process. He criticized the exchange’s approach, pointing out that listings are only announced four hours before going live. In a follow-up post on X, Zhao later said that he had never purchased any meme coins. He also said that while he was not personally interested in them, he had no objections to their existence. He added that he saw himself as a builder, focusing on fundamental blockchain development.

As a result, many altcoin investors are shifting their focus to Rollblock’s presale, seeing it as a more promising opportunity. Rollblock stands out by revolutionizing the $450 billion gaming industry through blockchain technology and crypto integration. The protocol enhances security and speed, ensuring a transparent and seamless gaming experience for players worldwide. With strong fundamentals and rapid adoption, Rollblock is gaining traction among both players and investors. Here’s why analysts are bullish about its future. Rollblock’s Scores Massive Presale Victory Rollblock has raised over $10.4 million across ten presale rounds, drawing interest from more than 5,0000 early investors. Currently priced at $0.053, RBLK’s deflationary tokenomics and strong market potential have positioned it as a standout opportunity in the GameFi space. What sets Rollblock apart from traditional gaming platforms is its blockchain-powered approach. The protocol offers a library of 7,000+ games, including live dealers and sports betting, all entirely on-chain. Every game outcome is encrypted and recorded on Ethereum, eliminating the risk of manipulation. To further enhance trust, Rollblock operates under a full e-gaming license issued by the Anjouan Gaming Authority and has successfully passed a SolidProof audit – ensuring transparency and security for players. This commitment to fairness and innovation has made Rollblock a magnet for players. In December alone, the platform saw a 600% surge in deposits and signups, alongside $1.75 million in wagers placed – clear indicators of its growing adoption. At the core of the ecosystem is RBLK, Rollblock’s native utility token. It serves multiple functions, including staking, governance and revenue-sharing. Rollblock uses up to 30% of its revenue to buy RBLK from the open market. 60% of the repurchased tokens are burned, creating a deflationary effect, while the remaining 40% are distributed as staking rewards, offering some of the highest APYs in the industry. Avalanche Shows Strong Fundamentals Avalanche is trading at $26, down 10% in the past week, and remains 56% below its all-time high. Despite its price struggles, network activity remains strong, with transaction volumes exceeding 4 million and new gaming projects surging on the platform. Additionally, Avalanche recently partnered with Keystone Wallet, further expanding its ecosystem. Avalanche is also making strides in real-world adoption. The network is now used for ticketing in Turkey’s Süper Lig, integrating with Passolig to combat fraud and regulate secondary sales. Meanwhile, the Avalanche Foundation is strengthening its presence in NFTs through Avaissance, an initiative supporting artists via an Artist in Residence program. These use cases highlight Avalanche’s long-term growth potential as industries adopt its fast and low-cost blockchain. Looking ahead, analysts remain divided on Avalanche’s price trajectory. Crypto analyst Grronk predicts a surge to $130 while Kaleo identifies $50 as a key breakout level before the token can push higher. Chainlink On the Brink of a Breakout as Market Adoption Increases Chainlink is regaining momentum as buying pressure pushes it toward $20. Despite a market downturn, sentiment remains positive, with Chainlink trading near mid-January levels. Since mid-December, Chainlink has dropped from $31 to $15 but shows signs of recovery. In the past 24 hours, $682K in trades were liquidated, with $574K from short sellers, signaling a shift in sentiment. Beyond price, Chainlink adoption is growing. Solv integrated Chainlink’s Proof of Reserve on BNB Chain, boosting transparency. Meanwhile, 17 new integrations across 12 blockchains strengthen its role in decentralized data solutions. As demand for secure data feeds rises, Chainlink remains a key Web3 player. With increasing adoption and renewed buying interest, Chainlink could reclaim higher levels, solidifying its position in blockchain infrastructure despite recent volatility. Is Rollblock the Next 100x Gem? Analysts predict that if Rollblock sustains its current momentum, RBLK could reach $1 by the end of 2025. This would represent a 100x return for early investors, far outpacing the growth of tokens like Chainlink and Avalanche. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

Central to the ecosystem is RBLK, Rollblock’s own utility token. It plays various roles, including staking, governance, and revenue-sharing. Rollblock allocates up to 30% of its revenue to repurchase RBLK from the open market. 60% of these bought-back tokens are burned, creating a deflationary effect, while the remaining 40% are given out as staking rewards, offering some of the industry's highest APYs. Avalanche Maintains Strong Fundamentals Avalanche is currently priced at $26, having dropped 10% over the past week, and remains 56% below its peak. Despite these price challenges, the network's activity is robust, with transaction volumes surpassing 4 million and a surge in new gaming projects on the platform. Moreover, Avalanche has recently partnered with Keystone Wallet, further broadening its ecosystem. Avalanche is also advancing in real-world applications. The network is now utilized for ticketing in Turkey's Süper Lig, working with Passolig to prevent fraud and manage secondary sales. Meanwhile, the Avalanche Foundation is enhancing its NFT presence through Avaissance, an initiative supporting artists with an Artist in Residence program. These use cases underscore Avalanche's long-term growth potential as industries embrace its fast and low-cost blockchain. Looking forward, analysts have varied opinions on Avalanche's price path. Crypto analyst Grronk anticipates a rise to $130, while Kaleo sees $50 as a crucial breakout point before the token can climb higher. Chainlink Nears a Breakout as Adoption Grows Chainlink is gaining ground as increased buying pressure moves it closer to $20. Despite the market downturn, sentiment remains positive, with Chainlink trading near its mid-January levels. Since mid-December, Chainlink has fallen from $31 to $15 but is showing signs of recovery. In the last 24 hours, $682K in trades were liquidated, with $574K from short sellers, indicating a shift in market sentiment. Beyond pricing, Chainlink's adoption is expanding. Solv has integrated Chainlink’s Proof of Reserve on BNB Chain, enhancing transparency. Additionally, 17 new integrations across 12 blockchains amplify its role in decentralized data solutions. With the growing demand for reliable data feeds, Chainlink remains a vital player in the Web3 space. As adoption increases and buying interest renews, Chainlink could reach higher levels, cementing its position in blockchain infrastructure despite recent market fluctuations. Could Rollblock Be the Next 100x Opportunity? Analysts suggest that if Rollblock maintains its current momentum, RBLK might hit $1 by the end of 2025. This would represent a 100x return for early investors, vastly outpacing the growth of tokens like Chainlink and Avalanche. Explore the Exciting Opportunities in the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

However, there are signs that in the top two layer one cryptocurrencies, outside of Bitcoin, a bottom could be forming. Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) are analysed. $ETH has hit major horizontal support and the bounce is on Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $ETH (ETH/USDT) is certainly not all gloom and doom. The major support at $2,000 held very nicely, and the resulting long wick underneath the candle body bears testament to the heavy buying that pushed the price right back up again. In addition, the Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart has the indicators nearly at the bottom. This means that a cross back up is only a week or two away. This could add a lot of fuel to this potential bounce. An ugly ETH/BTC chart Source: TradingView While $ETH may be coming back against its dollar pair, the ETH/BTC pair is another thing. This chart does look rather ugly, and if the current major support fails it will look uglier still. $ETH bulls must turn up, and they must turn up in force in order to salvage what is a very precarious state of affairs. The one hope is that the Stochastic RSI is nearly at the bottom. That said, if we look back at previous cross-ups in the Stochastic RSI, they did not succeed in pushing the price up far enough to break the downtrend. This time we could be in last chance saloon. Rejection at major $200 resistance for $SOL Source: TradingView The $SOL price did recently get rejected from the major $200 resistance again, and this could be construed as a confirmation of this level as resistance. That said, the major horizontal support at $185 is not far below. As long as this holds, there will be room for the bulls to have another crack at that $200 resistance. $SOL price reaching crucial decision point against $BTC pair Source: TradingView The SOL/BTC chart is much better to look at than the ETH/BTC counterpart. While $SOL was rejected at 0.00226 BTC, the major support at 0.0018 looks pretty solid, and this is also bolstered by the ascending bottom trendline of the triangle. The Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart is showing that a bottom is near. Should the cross-up take place, and the indicators do not flatline for a long period, a breakout of the top of the triangle is more likely than a breakdown. There aren’t many cryptocurrencies that are out-performing BTC, therefore this chart must be watched closely. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Despite this, there are indications that a bottom might be forming for the two leading layer one cryptocurrencies after Bitcoin, namely Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). $ETH Bounces Back from Strong Horizontal Support Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $ETH (ETH/USDT) isn't entirely negative. The significant support level at $2,000 has held firm, and the substantial wick below the candle's body indicates strong buying pressure that quickly brought the price back up. Moreover, the Stochastic RSI at the chart's bottom shows indicators nearing their lowest point. This suggests a potential upward crossover is just a week or two away, which may significantly boost this potential rebound. Challenging Times for the ETH/BTC Pair Source: TradingView Although $ETH might be recovering against the dollar, the ETH/BTC pair presents a different picture. The chart appears rather bleak, and if the current crucial support is lost, it could worsen. For $ETH bulls to turn the situation around, they need to step up significantly, given the precariously balanced state. The sole glimmer of hope is that the Stochastic RSI is nearing its lowest point. However, looking at past upward crosses, they haven't been strong enough to reverse the downtrend. This might be the last opportunity to change the trajectory. $SOL Faces Rejection at Key $200 Resistance Level Source: TradingView Recently, the $SOL price was turned away at the significant $200 resistance, reinforcing this level as a barrier. Nevertheless, the key horizontal support at $185 is close below. If this support holds strong, it could provide another chance for bulls to challenge the $200 resistance once more. $SOL Approaches a Critical Decision Point Against Bitcoin Source: TradingView The SOL/BTC chart presents a more favorable outlook than its ETH/BTC counterpart. Although $SOL faced rejection at 0.00226 BTC, the strong support at 0.0018 remains intact, further supported by the ascending trendline of the triangle pattern. The Stochastic RSI suggests that a bottom may be imminent. Should a cross-up occur and the indicators don't linger at the bottom, a breakout above the triangle's top is more probable than a breakdown.

Then, Layne Nadeau from NVAL answers questions about taxes and NFTs in Ask and Expert. – Sarah Morton Tax time – What You Need To Know About Crypto Taxes The 2024 tax year has come to a close, and tax filing season is now upon us. If you’ve been trading crypto, there are some things you need to consider. The first is, be sure not to waste time. While a large U.S. centralized exchange may provide you with an IRS Form 1099, other exchanges likely will not, so you will need time to organize your own tax records. Moreover, even if the exchange provides you with a 1099, it likely will not have cost basis information. And most non-U.S. exchanges and DeFi protocols will not provide you with tax information. In order to compute accurate gains and losses, you will need to have accurate trading records for each trade, including the cost basis of any tokens sold. You'll likely need to pull this information from the exchange if you failed to keep contemporaneous records while trading in 2024. Also note that going forward, for trading in 2025 and beyond, you are required to use “tax lot relief” methods — i.e., select which portion of fungible tokens were sold and their related tax basis, even if using first-in-first-out (FIFO) methodology, on a wallet-by-wallet basis. For example, if you sold from wallet number 4, you can’t identify a token from wallet number 7 as the token sold; you can only identify a tax lot from wallet number 4. As a result, you may want to consider consolidating wallets. Also, per IRS Rule 2024-28 , tax lot allocations were to be made before your first trade in 2025. Aside from good record keeping and tax basis tracking, all forms of income and expenditures in crypto should be considered. For example, did you receive an airdrop of a token that had value at the time of the drop? Remember that ordinary income is equal to the fair market value of the token as of the time you had the power to sell it, whether you did so or not (see IRS Rule 2019-24 ). That income inclusion amount then becomes your tax basis, and a future disposition will result in a capital gain or loss based on that tax basis. Also, did you earn crypto for services you provided as an employee or independent contractor? In that case, you had reportable income equal to the fair market value of the crypto received. That income is also subject to wage withholding or self-employment tax. Heading into the final months of 2024, you may have sold some of your digital assets trading at a loss (i.e., loss harvesting). If so, those losses can be used to offset your taxable gains and reduce your tax liability. This is true even if you bought the same tokens back shortly after selling them since there is currently no wash sale rule for buying and selling crypto. Remember this during 2025 to reduce your future taxes. Even after loss harvesting, did you still end up with taxable gains for 2024? You may still be able to contribute to your IRA if you haven’t done so already in order to create a deduction for 2024. In most cases, you have until April 15th to do this. And while you can’t contribute crypto to an IRA, if you have a self-directed IRA, you can contribute fiat to it and then use those funds to purchase crypto. Lastly, did you buy a bitcoin or ether ETF? Note that even if you didn’t sell the ETF in 2024, you may still have tax liability. This is because the ETFs are structured as grantor trusts, and they sell small amounts of crypto each month to fund the management fees. Each ETP publishes a tax report for the year and posts it on its website. This report tells you how to calculate your gains/losses for the year as a trust unitholder. These tax gains and losses are currently reportable by you. Good luck tax filing!! - Anthony Tuths, digital asset practice leader tax principle alternative investments, KPMG LLP Ask an Expert Q: How are non–fungible tokens (NFTs) treated for tax purposes? A: In many jurisdictions, NFTs are considered digital assets and are subject to the same tax rules as cryptocurrencies. Some jurisdictions look past this simplification at the underlying assets associated with the NFT and apply the appropriate tax treatment for those assets (e.g. Money Market Funds, Art & Collectibles, Private Debt, etc.). Consulting a tax accounting professional is recommended. Q: Can “Floor Price” be used to calculate the value of non-fungible assets for tax purposes? A: No, a floor price is not accepted by formal accounting or tax standards. A service is required that uses accepted accounting methods, such as market comparisons, to calculate an acceptable fair market value. Accounting providers that specialize in digital assets will have these service providers in their partner network. Q: Can a tax loss be realized for NFTs that have lost their value/market? A: Yes, if selling the token is no longer an option there are services (e.g. UnsellableNFTs.com ) that will “purchase” illiquid NFTs (for a nominal fee), allowing the capital loss to be booked. Due to the lack of guidance from most tax authorities on this topic, a potentially safer alternative is to send your NFT to a burn wallet like the standard ETH burn address. - Layne Nadeau, CEO, NVAL Keep Reading U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell committed during a Senate hearing to address the so-called ""debanking"" of legal business sectors , including digital assets.

Now you’re zooming out and looking to buy into some of the best altcoins on the market in 2025 as you diversify your portfolio. As more technologies emerge, protocol upgrades roll out, and new narratives enter the market, some of these new projects are truly phenomenal. This means that some of the best altcoins of 2025 may outpaceSolana (SOL) in the next bull run. Whether it's the OG resilience of Litecoin, the innovative punch of Remittix or the enterprise appeal of Hedera, each project brings something unique to the table. Let’s break down the best altcoins on the market this year, and take a closer look at the utility they bring for investors. Litecoin (LTC): Speedy Transactions and Scarcity Litecoin excels in the speed of its transactions, while offering a capped supply to introduce scarcity. Litecoin (LTC) has started 2025 with a bang, with its price jumping up by 20% in the last month, now hovering around the $115 mark. Technical analysis points to a critical threshold near the $133 Fibonacci retracement level that if surpassed could signal a bullish trend and draw more investor interest. Litecoin (LTC) is currently preparing for its next halving event in 2025, which will reduce block rewards and introduce more scarcity to the ecosystem, hopefully bringing up the token’s value for holders. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): Developer-Friendly and Scalable NEAR Protocol is a developer friendly platform excelling in sharding technology. Its core goals are to achieve maximum scalability and create a silky smooth user experience. There has been some instability for the asset lately, with NEAR Protocol seeing a 30% loss in the last month, though technical innovations have been strong. The network recently integrated the Rainbow Bridge with Ethereum, bringing more developers and users to its ecosystem. Plans for 2025 involve more scalability improvements and a range of new partnerships which should influence NEAR Protocol’s rate of adoption significantly. Hyperliquid (HYPE): High-Speed Trading Platform Hyperliquid is carving out a niche with its high-speed decentralized trading platform, appealing to traders seeking efficiency, speed, and reliability. Hyperliquid (HYPE) had a strong 2024, posting a net gain of more than 600%. The asset has seen a notable 15% reduction in the last week though this comes off the back of a 19% monthly gain, so Hyperliquid is still very much in the green. New upgrades to Hyperliquid have reduced latency and increased transaction throughput, making Hyperliquid a strong contender in the DeFi space. In 2025, Hyperliquid plans to add advanced trading features and expand its asset offerings. This should attract a broader user base, and ultimately catalyze Hyperliquid’sgrowth, making it one of the best altcoins on the market right now. Stellar (XLM): Bridging Financial Systems Stellar specializes in cross border transactions and is attracting interest from the financial sector owing to its efficiency and low transaction costs. Monero (XLM) remains in a net positive over the last 30 days, with a 13.2% increase on the whole. Though it has seen some volatility in the last week, sliding down by 2.5%. The developer team recently shared news that Stellar will be entering a key partnership, participating in the UN Development Programme. This programme aims to promote financial inclusion and Stellar’s participation will improve its social standing while increasing its exposure in emerging markets. Technical indicators indicate a bullish pennant pattern, which could lead to big gains. In 2025, Stellar hopes to broaden its partnerships, improve network scalability and become more involved in global finance, and the UN Development Programme represents a positive step in this direction. Sui (SUI): Web3 Gaming Pioneer Web3 gaming startup Sui is bringing blockchain principles to mainstream gaming. Today, Sui (SUI) is trading at $3.15 with intraday highs of $3.53 and lows of $3.11 suggesting growth potential. The asset has seen losses on monthly, weekly, and daily timeframes, but still maintains a net 82% gain in the last 12 months. The recent Sui Bridge update represents a major improvement for the networking, making it interoperable with Ethereum. This has increased Sui’s exposure while drawing in more developers to its ecosystem. On the cards for 2025 is the development of the SuiPlay0X1 Handheld Gaming Device. If this device is received well in the gaming community, it will take Sui’s reputation to new heights. Hedera (HBAR): Enterprise-Grade DLT Hedera offers an enterprise-grade distributed ledger technology, attracting businesses with its governance model, transaction speed, and robust security features. The network's recent increase in developer activity indicates robust growth potential and technological advancements. Technical patterns suggest a bullish flag formation, signaling possible upward movement and investor confidence. In 2025, Hedera aims to expand its enterprise partnerships, enhance network features, and strengthen its position in the competitive blockchain industry. Remittix (RTX): Leading The Best Altcoins Of 2025 The promising newcomer Remittix aims to connect crypto to traditional financial systems for faster, more efficient cross-border payments. Currently in its presale stage, Remittix is absolutely booming, having amassed more than $11.7 million in investment in just a few weeks. The native token, RTX, is up for grabs at an accessible price point of $0.0567. The platform strives for transparent, affordable global payments without compromising user privacy and agency. It facilitates the conversion of more than 40 cryptocurrencies to FIAT, while enabling transfers to bank accounts across the globe. Given the inefficiencies that currently exist in this $190 trillion industry, Remittix (RTX) is well on its way to disrupting the market, and analysts expect an 800% price surge in the presale phase alone. For any investor who wants to be a part of PayFi’s future, this is certainly one of the best altcoins to invest in this year.

This could be the perfect moment to explore some of the top altcoins available in 2025 as you look to diversify your investment portfolio. With the rapid emergence of new technologies, protocol advancements, and fresh market narratives, some of these innovative projects are truly remarkable. Consequently, the leading altcoins of 2025 might outperform Solana (SOL) in the upcoming bull market. Whether it’s the classic dependability of Litecoin, the inventive edge of Remittix, or the corporate allure of Hedera, each of these projects offers something distinctive. Let’s delve into the top altcoins available this year and examine the value they offer to investors. Litecoin (LTC): Fast Transactions and Limited Supply Litecoin stands out for its rapid transaction speed and its fixed supply, which adds an element of scarcity. As 2025 kicks off, Litecoin (LTC) has seen a robust 20% price increase in the last month, reaching around $115. Technical analysis highlights a pivotal point near the $133 Fibonacci retracement level, which, if surpassed, could trigger a bullish trend and draw more investors in. Litecoin (LTC) is gearing up for its forthcoming halving event in 2025, which will decrease block rewards, potentially enhancing the token's value due to increased scarcity. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): Developer-Centric and Highly Scalable NEAR Protocol is a developer-centric platform that excels with its sharding technology, aiming for maximum scalability and a seamless user experience. Despite some recent instability, with NEAR Protocol losing 30% over the past month, its technical advancements remain strong. The network has recently integrated the Rainbow Bridge with Ethereum, attracting more developers and users. Plans for 2025 include further scalability enhancements and numerous new partnerships, which should significantly boost NEAR Protocol’s adoption rate. Hyperliquid (HYPE): Cutting-Edge Trading Platform Hyperliquid is making waves with its high-speed decentralized trading platform, which appeals to traders who prioritize efficiency and reliability. After a strong performance in 2024, with a net gain exceeding 600%, Hyperliquid (HYPE) experienced a 15% dip last week, following a 19% gain over the month, keeping it positive overall. Recent updates have decreased latency and increased transaction throughput, positioning Hyperliquid as a formidable player in the DeFi arena. In 2025, Hyperliquid plans to introduce advanced trading features and expand its asset range, which should attract a wider user base and drive its growth, making it one of the most promising altcoins at present. Stellar (XLM): Connecting Global Financial Networks Stellar focuses on cross-border transfers and is gaining traction in the financial sector due to its efficiency and low transaction fees. Monero (XLM) remains net positive over the last 30 days, with a 13.2% increase overall, despite a 2.5% drop in the last week. The development team recently announced a significant partnership with the UN Development Programme, which aims to enhance financial inclusion.

The recent Sui Bridge update marked a significant networking improvement, enabling interoperability with Ethereum and drawing more developers to its ecosystem. For 2025, the development of the SuiPlay0X1 Handheld Gaming Device is on the horizon. If it gains favor within the gaming community, it could elevate Sui’s status significantly. Hedera (HBAR): Distributed Ledger for Enterprises Hedera provides an enterprise-level distributed ledger technology, attracting businesses with its governance structure, rapid transactions, and strong security measures. A recent increase in developer activity on the network suggests significant growth potential and technological progress. Technical patterns indicate a bullish flag formation, which could signal upward movement and boost investor confidence.

The shiba inu pricestarted the trading week at $0.0000120 before reaching $0.0000130 to finish with an 8% total increase according to recent market data. The slight price increases indicate a market stabilization process within an otherwise unpredictable market. Shiba Inu investors who track news about the token can confirm that it maintains its position as a popular and active token despite its current performance staying at a lower level.

Today, February 13, 2025, a prominent crypto expert shared a post on X (previously Twitter), stating that crypto whales have moved over 70 million ADA tokens from exchanges in the past four trading days. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1890019592590012762 Whales and Investors Bet Big on ADA This substantial withdrawal of tokens comes alongside a rising asset price. Data from TradingView shows that ADA has witnessed a notable 20% upside rally, suggesting that the accumulation of ADA tokens by crypto whales might be driving the recent gains. Besides this, investors and long-term holders have also been accumulating the tokens, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed an outflow of $11.75 million worth of ADA tokens in the past 48 hours, indicating potential accumulation that could create buying pressure and further upside momentum. However, the market has witnessed this outflow during a period when ADA has approached a crucial resistance level of $0.85. ADA’s Major Liquidation Levels Besides this, intraday traders also appear bullish. Data shows that traders’ bets on the long side are notably higher than on the short side. At press time, the major liquidation level on the lower side is $0.76, where traders holding long positions believe that ADA’s price won’t fall below this level and have built $8.75 million worth of long positions. Meanwhile, bearish traders are over-leveraged at $0.796, where they hold $6.75 million worth of short positions.

Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, ADA appears bullish but is currently facing mild resistance, creating a hurdle for the asset to soar. Based on recent price action and historical patterns, if ADA successfully breaches the resistance level and closes a daily candle above $0.85, there is a strong possibility it could surge by 33% to reach $1.13 in the future. Source: Trading View ADA is currently trading near $0.789 and has experienced a modest price surge of over 2.35% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume dropped by 40%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ADA|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-13 16:08:49

Ready For Listing on Major Exchanges, Could it Rival DOGE?",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/rblk-in-final-stages-of-presale-ready-for-listing-on-major-exchanges-could-it-rival-doge,"Rollblock is nearing the final stages of its presale and has raised over $10 million in funding. With momentum building, analysts anticipate that the protocol will soon announce RBLK listings on major exchanges. This could significantly increase demand and propel its price even higher. If listed, RBLK could be a top altcoin in 2025. Experts predict it may hit $1, surpassing hype-driven tokens like Dogecoin with strong fundamentals and real-world utility. Here’s why many experts are bullish on Rollblock’s future. Rollblock Attracts 50,000 Early Investors With Market Success Rollblock’s presale attracted over 50,000 early investors and raised $10.4 million in funding. This rapid growth is backed by strong fundamentals. In December alone, Rollblock recorded $1.75 million in wagers and saw a 600% spike in deposits and signups. This surge in adoption was driven by the launch of highly-anticipated sports betting, combined with Rollblock’s unwavering commitment to security and trust. A lack of transparency has long plagued the $450 billion gaming industry, with scams and unethical practices rising 60% in the past two years. Rollblock directly addresses this issue by leveraging blockchain and crypto technology. The platform offers 7,000+ games, including live dealers and sports betting, on-chain. Every outcome is encrypted and recorded on Ethereum, ensuring full transparency and eliminating the risk of tampering. Rollblock operates under a full e-gaming license from the Anjouan Gaming Authority to reinforce its credibility and has successfully passed a SolidProof audit, confirming the security of its smart contracts. At the core of the ecosystem is RBLK, Rollblock’s native token, which plays a key role in staking, governance, and revenue sharing. The protocol allocates up to 30% of its revenue to buy back RBLK from the open market, ensuring continuous demand. 60% of RBLK tokens are burned, while 40% go to staking rewards, offering top GameFi APYs. Priced at $0.053, RBLK outperformed Dogecoin and emerged as a top GameFi investment. Dogecoin Investor Confidence Is Stagnant Dogecoin has decreased 7% in the past 24 hours as it rode the wave of the red sea. Despite this, Dogecoin’s average holding time has actually increased by 302%, signaling reduced selling pressure and a shift toward accumulation. The Chaikin Money Flow indicator has climbed to 0.06, reflecting growing demand and a slowdown in sell-offs. Dogecoin could push toward $0.32 if this trend continues. A reversal could see the price drop to $0.24, further declining to $0.19 if selling pressure intensifies. Beyond market momentum, Dogecoin’s regulatory outlook is improving. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart now places the odds of a Dogecoin ETF approval at 75%, a significant shift in sentiment under the new administration. While past ETF filings for altcoins faced resistance from the SEC, the landscape is becoming more receptive, with XRP and Dogecoin ETF proposals expected to be acknowledged this week. A Dogecoin ETF approval could spark a new wave of institutional investment, mirroring the Bitcoin ETF boom in 2024. Analysts predict potential inflows of up to $580 million, providing long-term support for DOGE’s price and further solidifying its place in the evolving crypto market. Can Rollblock Outperform Dogecoin? Rollblock is positioning itself as a serious contender to outperform Dogecoin in the coming months. With strong fundamentals and growing market demand, the protocol is riding the wave of GameFi’s expansion within the Web3 industry. So far, RBLK has already surged by 430%, proving its potential for massive returns. Analysts believe this momentum could continue, with the token poised to deliver another significant rally as adoption increases.
