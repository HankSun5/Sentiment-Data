With thousands of tokens available, identifying the real opportunities can be challenging. Crypto isn’t just a trend—it’s transforming finance, offering unique investment potential. Choosing the right projects is key to maximizing gains and avoiding missed opportunities. Qubetics has recently emerged as a prominent name in the blockchain space. Far beyond a conventional cryptocurrency token, it serves as a comprehensive ecosystem designed to revolutionize asset ownership, trading, and monetization. By seamlessly integrating multiple blockchains and advanced financial tools, Qubetics enhances accessibility, security, and efficiency in decentralized transactions. But Qubetics isn’t the only big player in town. Heavyweights like Solana and Astra have already carved out their spots in the crypto hall of fame. Solana is revolutionizing blockchain speed, making it a go-to for DeFi and gaming, while Astra is ensuring regulatory compliance for decentralized finance. So, if you’re wondering which of these cryptos is the best to join this month, let’s dive into what makes them stand out. Qubetics: Redefining Real-World Asset Ownership Qubetics isn’t just another altcoin. It’s a game-changer in asset ownership, using blockchain technology to tokenize real-world assets. Imagine a world where owning a share of a skyscraper, a rare piece of art, or even a luxury car is as easy as buying Bitcoin. That’s what Qubetics is making possible. At its core, Qubetics is building a Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace, allowing businesses, professionals, and individuals to convert physical assets into blockchain-based tokens. This isn’t some futuristic dream—it’s happening right now. A real estate developer wants to raise capital for a new apartment complex. Instead of dealing with banks or big investors, they tokenize the property on Qubetics, allowing everyday investors to buy fractional ownership in the building. Suddenly, real estate investment isn’t just for the ultra-rich. The same goes for collectibles, fine art, and even businesses looking to sell equity in a decentralized way. Qubetics is proving that investors are hungry for blockchain-backed asset ownership, and the numbers tell the whole story. With over $12.3 million raised in its presale, more than 466 million $TICS tokens sold, and a growing community of 19,200+ token holders, Qubetics is gaining serious traction. Currently priced at $0.0667 in Stage 20 of the presale, the momentum is undeniable. These milestones aren’t just impressive—they signal massive adoption on the horizon. As demand for real-world asset tokenization grows, Qubetics is positioning itself as a leader in this evolving market. Solana: The High-Speed Blockchain Powerhouse If you’ve been in crypto for a while, you’ve probably heard the phrase “Ethereum killer.” While many projects have made that claim, Solana is one of the few that actually has the tech to back it up. Known for blazing-fast transactions and dirt-cheap fees, Solana has become a go-to blockchain for DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and even Web3 gaming projects. While Ethereum struggles with high gas fees and network congestion, Solana is cruising along with its Proof of History (PoH) mechanism, processing thousands of transactions per second. Solana isn’t just hype—it’s delivering real results. In 2024, Solana-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs) outpaced Ethereum’s DEX volume, hitting a 24-hour trading volume of $3.8 billion compared to Ethereum’s $1.7 billion. That’s a big deal. Right now, Solana’s native token SOL is trading around $198.81, but many analysts believe it could soar to $700 or beyond by the end of 2025. Why? Because Solana isn’t just competing with Ethereum—it’s eating into its market share. For investors looking for the best cryptos to join this month, Solana remains a strong contender due to its scalability, growing ecosystem, and increasing institutional interest. Astra: Bringing Compliance to DeFi While DeFi is all about decentralization, there’s one thing most projects struggle with—compliance. Governments worldwide are tightening their grip on crypto regulations, and many DeFi platforms could be in trouble if they don’t find a way to play by the rules. That’s where Astra comes in. Astra is the first decentralized compliance protocol, ensuring that DeFi platforms meet regulatory requirements while still keeping things decentralized. Think of it as a security guard for the wild world of DeFi, making sure everything is above board while still allowing users to benefit from decentralized finance. Regulatory uncertainty is one of the biggest threats to crypto’s mainstream adoption. Without proper compliance measures, DeFi could face massive crackdowns. Astra provides a decentralized KYC (Know Your Customer) solution, ensuring that DeFi platforms can onboard users without violating laws. Currently, Astra’s native token ASTRA is trading at about $0.0016, with steady growth in adoption. While it’s not as flashy as Solana or Qubetics, Astra is solving a major problem that could shape the future of crypto regulation. Conclusion If you’re looking for the best cryptos to join this month, Qubetics , Solana, and Astra each bring something unique. Qubetics’ real-world asset tokenization marketplace unlocks new investment opportunities beyond traditional crypto. Solana dominates the high-speed blockchain space, offering low fees and lightning-fast transactions as a strong Ethereum competitor. Meanwhile, Astra tackles one of crypto’s biggest hurdles—DeFi compliance, ensuring security and regulatory adherence as oversight tightens. While all three projects have strong fundamentals, Qubetics is the clear frontrunner. With its booming presale, real-world asset integration, and bullish price predictions, $TICS is shaping up to be a top crypto investment in 2025.

Qubetics is the first Web3 aggregator focused on real-world asset tokenization, allowing individuals and businesses to tokenize everything from real estate to collectibles. Why is Solana growing so fast? Solana’s low fees, high speed, and developer-friendly ecosystem make it a favorite for DeFi, NFTs, and gaming applications, giving it an edge over competitors like Ethereum. How does Astra help with crypto regulations? Astra provides decentralized compliance solutions, ensuring that DeFi platforms meet KYC and regulatory requirements while maintaining decentralization.

Bitcoin & XRP Investors Are Going ALL IN on These Coins!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/from-1000-to-a-private-island-bitcoin-xrp-investors-are-going-all-in-on-these-coins/,"From Bitcoin’s Ascent to THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s Breakthrough THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is capturing attention as the next big win in the crypto market, even as Bitcoin (BTC) celebrates its historic milestone of crossing $100,000. While Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate the DeFi space and Ripple (XRP) solidifies its position in cross-border payments, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven to be the standout investment. With $1.5 million raised in minutes during its presale, it has cemented its position as the ultimate opportunity of 2025. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is the Next Big Opportunity 1. Exceptional Market Demand In its presale, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN raised over $1.5 million almost instantly. This level of investor enthusiasm reflects the token’s high growth potential and positions it as the next major crypto to watch. 2. Deflationary Tokenomics With a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN creates scarcity that directly drives value. Its deflationary model offers early investors significant advantages, surpassing the gradual inflationary nature of tokens like APT and INJ. 3. Exclusive Availability Unlike BTC and ETH, which are traded on virtually every platform, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN . This exclusivity creates a controlled market environment, driving demand and making it an excellent choice for early adopters. How It Compares to Other Top Cryptos Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin may have hit $100K, but its market is mature, making THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN a stronger choice for exponential returns. Ethereum (ETH): A leader in smart contracts, ETH offers stability, but it lacks the exclusivity and early-stage growth of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Aptos (APT): Aptos focuses on scalability but hasn’t captured the same market excitement as this token. Injective Protocol (INJ): INJ excels in DeFi but cannot compete with the overwhelming momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Seize the Opportunity Now Bitcoin’s success paved the way for standout cryptos like THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN to dominate the market. With limited supply, overwhelming demand, and exclusive availability, it’s the ultimate choice for investors seeking the next big win.

The co-founder of Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, shared his usual Sunday Bitcoin chart on X today, teasing yet another purchase set for Monday. “Death to the blue lines. Long live the green dots,” Saylor said to his 4.1 million followers in the post, hinting at an end to the brief one-week pause in Bitcoin buying. Death to the blue lines. Long live the green dots. pic.twitter.com/SOtFHRoykd — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) February 9, 2025 Strategy, according to tracking platform SaylorTracker, currently holds 471,107 BTC. That stash is valued at $45.3 billion and includes the company’s January 27 addition of 10,107 BTC before the pause. Rebrand puts Bitcoin front and center On February 5, MicroStrategy shed its old identity and officially became Strategy and leaned into its Bitcoin-first reputation by adopting a Bitcoin logo. The company swapped its branding colors for Bitcoin-themed ones and made sure its marketing screamed pro-Bitcoin at every turn. Phong Le, Strategy’s CEO, said: “Bitcoin and artificial intelligence are the two most transformative technologies of the twenty-first century. Our new name powerfully, and simply, conveys the universal and global appeal of our company.” Strategy released its Q4 2024 earnings report on the same day it announced the rebrand and its software business pulled in $120.7 million in revenue—a 3% year-over-year drop. More notably, they posted a $640 million net loss for the quarter. Regardless, Q4 2024 became the company’s most aggressive quarter yet, with 218,887 Bitcoins worth $20.5 billion added to their pile. During the earnings call, Strategy presented shareholders with its roadmap for Bitcoin gains in 2025. They pointed to major catalysts, including the possibility of regulatory clarity in the US, stronger political support for digital assets, and improvements to Bitcoin ETFs as well as institutional investors. On August 7, 2024, Strategy split both Class A and Class B shares 10-for-1, which slashed entry costs for new investors and opened the doors for a wider base of potential shareholders. By the end of December, they had issued 42.3 million shares of Class A stock, raising $15.1 billion. In January and February 2025, they issued another 6.5 million shares, securing $2.4 billion. Even with these massive raises, Strategy still has $4.3 billion in Class A shares available for future offerings. CFO Andrew Kang called the company’s capital plan “firing on all cylinders” and confirmed they’ve already raised $20 billion out of their $42 billion goal. And that’s not all. Early in 2025, Strategy launched its first convertible preferred stock offering, raking in $584 million from institutional and retail backers. The company also issued $3 billion in 0% Convertible Senior Notes in November 2024, which will mature in 2029. These notes allow investors to convert holdings into Strategy stock at $672.40 per share, a price investors are betting will be a steal down the line. From the $3 billion note issuance, the company netted $2.97 billion after fees. But they weren’t done. In January 2025, they rolled out another fundraising vehicle: Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock. Priced at $80 per share, this raised $563.4 million after expenses. These preferred shares come with an 8% annual dividend and a $100 liquidation preference, giving Strategy another steady funding option. Strategy’s Bitcoin returns in 2024 were through the roof, with a BTC Yield of 74.3%. But for 2025, they’ve set a more conservative 15% target in a reported move toward a more sustainable pace.

This is because several asset managers in the U.S. appear set to launch it, as there are predictions that both DOGE ETF and Solana ETF could trigger the growth of RCO Finance. However, Canary Capital says it is not interested in joining the bandwagon. Dogecoin’s Lack of Utility and Unlimited Supply Raise Concerns According to a report , Steven McClurg, Canary Capital CEO, says the investment firm is interested in launching a spot DOGE ETF. The lack of interest in an ETF product for the dog-themed memecoin follows consideration of certain factors. Notably, McClurg emphasized the lack of utility for Dogecoin in the broader cryptocurrency space. Besides utility, he also highlighted the memecoin’s unlimited supply. These two factors are enough to discourage Canary Capital from considering launching an ETF. McClurg argued that DOGE, by design, will continue to depreciate as its supply increases. As such, he does not consider it fit for an ETF product as the supply remains unlimited. Canary Capital Eyes XRP, Solana, and Other Crypto ETFs Interestingly, Canary Capital is among several investment firms competing for other products. Notable among their interests include XRP and Solana. Since President Donald Trump returned to the White House, crypto industry stakeholders have looked forward to favorable regulation. Given its crypto-friendly disposition, many have rushed to file crypto ETF products . As such, Canary Capital has filed to launch ETF products for Solana, Litecoin, HBAR, and XRP. Unlike DOGE, Solana (SOL) has utility as it serves to pay for transactions on the Solana network. Recently, SOL was used for trading the popular official Trump memecoin. This not only boosted the value of the price of SOL but also increased activity on Solana. Asset Managers Bet on Dogecoin’s Loyal Community However, experts say what Dogecoin lacks in utility, it makes up for in its loyal fan base. A notable fan of the memecoin is Elon Musk, Tesla’s founder. The entrepreneur has consistently supported the memecoin with occasional posts on X. Musk’s posts usually trigger bullish sentiments in the ecosystem. Dogecoin’s loyal fan base and recent developments in the U.S. space might have prompted some asset managers to apply for an ETF to track DOGE. Notably, Grayscale has launched a Dogecoin Trust after it filed with regulatory authority to convert the fund into a spot ETF.

His technical analysis, which is based on SOL price action on the daily candlestick timeframe, shows that the altcoin has been trading in an uptrend channel since July 2024. Notably, this uptrend channel has been highlighted by the formation of higher lows and higher highs as Solana continued to push to new all-time highs. Now, Martinez noted that holding above a key support level could reinforce the altcoin’s uptrend towards the upper trendline of the support channel. Related Reading: Bold Prediction: XRP Holders On The Path To Millionaire Status—Analyst Analyst’s Technical Outlook: A Make-Or-Break Support Level At the time of Martinez’s analysis, Solana was trading at $193, following a barrage of declines throughout last week. Notably, this decline saw Solana hit the bottom trendline of this uptrend channel. As such, the analyst noted that SOL’s action from here could determine its next big move. If Solana manages to hold above this support level, the uptrend could regain strength, and the channel will still be in play. In this case, Solana will still be on track to push toward the upper end of the channel, which puts the price target around $387. On the other hand, if the support fails, a deeper correction could be on the table. Image From X: Ali_charts Solana Price Action: A Rollercoaster Ride To $293 And Back SOL is one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in the current crypto cycle, with its price recently skyrocketing to a new all-time high of $293 on January 19. The rally was primarily driven by a wave of interest following the launch of the Official Trump meme coin on the Solana blockchain, adding momentum to an already bullish trend for the altcoin. However, the euphoria has since cooled off, with Solana experiencing a 30% decline since the all-time high. Since the time of the analysis, Solana has managed to rebound slightly from the lower boundary of its uptrend channel. Solana is currently trading at $204, meaning it has increased by about 5.7% since Martinez highlighted the key support zone. This reversal suggests that the uptrend channel is still in play, and Solana could continue to push upwards until it reaches $389. Interestingly, this price target at the upper end of the channel is reinforced by the Fibonacci extension indicator. Related Reading: Final Dip? Dogecoin Correction Could Precede A Record Surge—Analyst This indicator is extended from the Solana low of $109 in August 2024, and the $389 price target is at the 1.272 extension level. The significance of this extension is reinforced by the fact that Solana’s January peak also coincided with the 1.0 Fibonacci level. Despite this recovery, the bullish momentum has yet to fully confirm itself with a strong breakout. There is still a possibility that Solana could retest the lower boundary of the channel again before establishing a more decisive uptrend.

Market signals suggest the decline could persist unless significant buying activity shifts momentum.n Meanwhile, Toncoin is hovering near key support levels, managing to rebound slightly but still facing uncertainty. Traders remain cautious as they await further confirmation of a potential recovery. Conversely, BlockDAG (BDAG) mining rigs are in high demand, with over 15,850 units sold. BDAG’s energy-efficient approach and strong return potential have positioned it as a preferred option for crypto miners. Analysts project a $20 valuation by 2027, making early mining even more appealing. Hyperliquid Continues Its Descent as Sellers Take Control Hyperliquid (HYPE) is struggling as market indicators reveal a growing bearish sentiment. Technical tools such as the Directional Movement Index (DMI) and Bollinger Band Trend (BBTrend) confirm fading bullish strength. The Negative Directional Indicator (-DI) has overtaken the Positive Directional Indicator (+DI), reinforcing selling pressure. Simultaneously, the Average Directional Index (ADX) indicates a strengthening downtrend. Furthermore, the potential formation of a “death cross” between moving averages raises concerns that HYPE may continue its decline unless a reversal takes place. Toncoin Faces Resistance After Bouncing from Key Support Toncoin recently tested a crucial $3.250 support level before climbing back to $3.81. While this bounce indicates some buyer interest, overall market sentiment remains uncertain. Analysts highlight that if momentum picks up, resistance levels at $5.262, $6.175, and $7.105 could come into play. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests an oversold condition, which may encourage additional buying. However, the MACD continues to reflect a bearish outlook, signaling caution. If Toncoin struggles to hold above $3.81, another retest of the support zone could follow before any potential rally gains traction. BlockDAG Miner Demand Surges Beyond 15,850 Units! Interest in BlockDAG mining rigs has escalated, with over 15,850 units sold as miners secure their positions ahead of expected profitability growth. This rush reflects confidence in BDAG’s potential as an efficient and high-return mining option. Unlike traditional mining setups that require excessive power and maintenance, BDAG miners optimize performance while minimizing energy consumption. Standard rigs often result in substantial operating expenses that reduce overall profitability. However, BDAG miners incorporate underclocked ASIC chips, maximizing efficiency and longevity. This approach reduces heat generation, extends hardware lifespan, and lowers maintenance costs, making mining more sustainable. BlockDAG offers mining solutions for various levels of participation, from the entry-level X10 miner to the high-performance X100 model. The low initial investment, combined with its energy efficiency and strong return potential, has positioned BDAG as a leading choice for crypto miners. Beyond mining, BlockDAG’s rapid market expansion is evident. The project has already raised $193.5 million, with its token price surging 2380%, climbing from $0.001 to $0.0248 over 27 presale batches. Market analysts forecast continued growth, predicting BDAG will surpass $20 by 2027. This makes mining rewards significantly more valuable, encouraging early adopters to secure rigs before the anticipated price surge. As BDAG gains traction, its impact in the crypto sector is becoming increasingly clear, prompting miners to take action now. Key Takeaways Market conditions are shifting, with each asset facing pivotal moments. Hyperliquid (HYPE) remains under heavy selling pressure, indicating potential further losses. Toncoin has shown some recovery signs, but whether it can sustain momentum remains uncertain. BlockDAG, however, is making a significant mark. With over 15,850 mining rigs sold, it is proving to be a top-tier choice for miners seeking efficiency and profitability. Analysts anticipate a price increase past $20 by 2027, reinforcing BDAG’s long-term potential. Those securing mining hardware now may be positioning themselves for substantial future gains.

Among the striking attributes of the project is its real utility, which is preparing this coin for mass adoption. Bitcoin Lithium is one of the few coins with a solid plan to make investors huge returns from the green energy revolution. As the world transitions from carbon-based fuel or fossil fuel to green energy, Bitcoin Lithium has positioned itself at the center of this revolution, making it a perfect financial investment today. Why Bitcoin Lithium? The foundation of this crypto project is pretty simple – investing in lithium technology. Among all the approaches to the green energy revolution, lithium remains one of the most valuable components to date. The product is majorly used for manufacturing energy storage, which makes it a key element in the green energy revolution. According to the project’s whitepaper, here are the core objectives: 1) financing renewable energy projects 2) Lithium exploration and development 3) Sustainable technological solutions, and 4) Energy storage infrastructures for remote communities. With this approach, this project is working on game-changing products that will attract mass adoption organically. That’s why thousands of crypto investors are showing interest in this coin. But why Lithium? Lithium is a revolutionary material in the modern world, especially for the green energy electrification of the world. It is the material behind a lot of tech industries like smartphones, computers, electric car manufacturers, and anything that utilizes stored electrical energy. It is the key material in the electrical batteries. The power behind Lithium is its ability to store a huge amount of electric energy for a long time. With green energy such as solar, you need storage to use it at night. Similarly, the wind is not always blowing. That’s where lithium comes in for energy storage purposes. The electric car industry which has made the likes of Elon Musk billionaires with his Tesla company, are the biggest beneficiaries of lithium. These cars are powered by lithium batteries. In addition, AI data centers, also a futuristic industry, are also big consumers of green energy. This shows lithium remains the future of green energy and its high recyclability makes it a key factor in the transition to sustainable green energy. All these factors explain why Bitcoin Lithium is getting a lot of attention as investors can see how futuristic it is. $BTCL To Grow +100X in 3 Yrs The growth potential of Bitcoin Lithium is immeasurable, according to crypto analysts. Unlike most crypto projects, this is a real utility token that touches on a real product that has huge potential for mass adoption. With lithium being the most preferred material for green electrification, and the adoption of electric vehicles already gaining momentum, this crypto project is riding on a wave that is growing organically. It is not a secret that investment in lithium today is giving massive returns – Elon Musk’s Tesla and many other electrical car manufacturers are just an example. With huge potential in green energy adoption, crypto analysts believe that Bitcoin Lithium ($BTCL) has the potential to explode +1000X in the next 3 years. Final Thought By investing in a disruptive real utility asset, Bitcoin Lithium ($BTCL) becomes a game-changing crypto project. The projected mass adoption of Lithium products comes with a huge opportunity for investors to make profits. Therefore, Bitcoin Lithium is gearing up for massive organic growth, and as predicted, it might hit +100X in the next 3 years making it a good buy today.

40129366,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=382349,1739138750,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/40129366.jpeg,Study: Social Media Users Are More Likely to Invest in Crypto,https://cryptopotato.com/study-social-media-users-are-more-likely-to-invest-in-crypto/,"A new study from the University of Georgia (UGA) has found that social media users are more likely to invest in crypto. The research concluded that engagement on platforms like YouTube, Reddit, and X increases the likelihood of investing in digital currencies. Social Media’s Influence on Crypto Investments The UGA review found that approximately half of social media users surveyed had invested in crypto, compared to just 10% of those who do not use social networks. Furthermore, it concluded that the more platforms an individual engaged with, the more likely they were to invest in the asset class. Those on YouTube, Reddit, X, and Clubhouse showed the highest investment rates, while Instagram users demonstrated less enthusiasm for crypto. The researchers suggested that this is because the first three facilitate discussions about crypto through long-form videos and text-based threads as opposed to Instagram’s visually oriented content. “A lot of people talk about cryptocurrency on social media and how popular it has become,” said Lu Fan, an associate professor at UGA. “There are a lot of celebrities talking about this. People are thinking, ‘Because my friends, family, and the celebrities I admire all invest in that, maybe I should too,” she added. The survey also revealed that investment patterns were influenced by demographics. Men and individuals with a higher risk tolerance were more likely to invest in crypto, while those with higher education levels were less inclined. Age also played a role, with older people showing less interest. Growth of Crypto Investments and Risk Awareness UGA’s findings are similar to a past report from the National Financial Capability Study and Investor Survey, which showed that in 2018, 15% of participants had invested in crypto. By 2021, that number had risen to 28%. The 2021 version of the survey also found that awareness had increased, with more than one in three participants considering an investment, compared to less than 20% in 2018. The University’s analysis also highlighted concerns about misinformation on social media. The researchers found that younger investors, who make up the largest part of the demographic, may overestimate their investment knowledge and be vulnerable to scams and poor financial advice. Professor Fan emphasized the importance of evaluating whether crypto aligns with an individual’s financial goals rather than making investment decisions based on social media trends. The research concluded by suggesting that policymakers consider these findings when developing regulations for crypto markets. Additionally, it called for increased efforts in media literacy education to help people distinguish between credible investment advice and misleading information.

Dogecoin was the first to prove that a meme-inspired token could capture global attention and deliver massive returns. Those who got in early saw jaw-dropping gains, watching a coin that started as a joke skyrocket in value and create an entirely new category of crypto investments. The problem? If you didn’t get in early, you missed out on the biggest profit window. But crypto always gives second chances. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is the latest meme coin making waves, and this one isn’t just riding on hype. It combines an engaging Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, 90% APY staking rewards, and a powerful community-driven Bulls Squad, making it one of the best new meme coins to join for long term . With its presale already raising over $5.97 million, BTFD is shaping up to be the next big thing in crypto—and this time, you have a shot at getting in early. BTFD Coin’s Play-to-Earn Game—The Future of Meme Coin Utility While many meme coins rely on community hype alone, BTFD Coin is rewriting the rules with its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game , which went live on January 1, 2025. This isn’t just a gimmick—P2E gaming is a booming industry that merges crypto with entertainment, allowing players to earn tokens while gaming. Unlike Dogecoin, which started as a fun meme, BTFD is built to be used, played, and rewarded, giving it real-world demand beyond speculation. Investors are already taking notice, and the presale is proof of the growing excitement. BTFD is now in Stage 14, with the price sitting at $0.00016. This price won’t last long, as each presale stage increases the token cost. Once it hits exchanges, the listing price is set at $0.0006, with analysts predicting a surge to $0.006 after launch. That’s an easy 3.75x gain on day one and a potential 37.5x return if the price reaches its projected moon level. Imagine dropping $8,000 into BTFD at the current price. That would get you 50 million tokens. At $0.0006, that investment becomes $30,000. If BTFD reaches $0.006, you’d be sitting on a massive $300,000. That kind of return isn’t just life-changing—it’s the kind of gain that turns early buyers into legends in the crypto space. Beyond gaming, BTFD Coin’s 90% APY staking rewards give holders another way to stack their profits. Staking is simple: lock up your tokens, earn rewards, and watch your portfolio grow while the market catches up to BTFD’s true value. Meanwhile, the Bulls Squad referral program rewards those who bring in new investors, ensuring BTFD’s community grows stronger every day. Stage 14 won’t last forever, and each new stage makes BTFD a little more expensive. If you’re looking for the best new meme coins to join for long term, this is your shot to buy before the next price jump. Getting in on BTFD Coin’s presale is simple. Set up your wallet with MetaMask or Trust Wallet and load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT. Head over to the presale page , connect your wallet, choose the amount of BTFD you want to buy, confirm the transaction, and you’re in. Once the presale ends, claim your tokens and start staking them for rewards. BTFD is already being called one of the best new meme coins to join for long term, and buying at presale prices could be your best crypto move yet. Dogecoin—The Meme Coin That Started It All Dogecoin was the original meme coin that showed the world how powerful internet culture could be in crypto. Created as a joke, it exploded into a cultural movement, supported by high-profile figures like Elon Musk and a community that turned “Doge to the moon” into reality. What started as an internet meme became one of the biggest cryptos in history, reaching an all-time high of $0.73 in 2021. Early adopters made millions, with some turning small investments into massive fortunes. But here’s the reality—Dogecoin’s best growth phase is over. While it remains a beloved token, the biggest profits have already been made, and new investors are unlikely to see the same 10,000x returns that early adopters did. That’s why BTFD Coin is now stealing the spotlight. With its P2E game, staking rewards, and growing Bulls Squad, it has everything Dogecoin once had—plus real utility. If you missed Dogecoin’s early days, BTFD Coin is giving you a second chance at a major meme coin breakout. Don’t Miss Out on BTFD Coin’s Presale—Your Next Big Crypto Play Dogecoin was the first meme coin revolution, but BTFD Coin is taking things to the next level. It’s not just a meme token—it’s a thriving ecosystem with Play-to-Earn gaming, staking rewards, and a growing community that could push its value to new heights. With BTFD Coin now being one of the best new meme coins to join for long term, the time to act is now. The presale price of $0.00016 won’t last, and once it hits $0.0006 on exchanges, early investors could already be sitting on major profits. If you missed Dogecoin’s run, don’t make the same mistake again— jump into BTFD Coin before the next price surge. FAQs Can BTFD Coin reach Dogecoin-level success? With its P2E game, staking rewards, and strong community, BTFD Coin has all the ingredients of a high-potential meme coin. Its early-stage presale makes it a better entry point than Dogecoin today. How high can BTFD Coin go after launch? Analysts predict BTFD Coin could hit $0.006, making it a 37.5x gain from its current presale price of $0.00016. Why is BTFD Coin one of the best new meme coins to join for long term? With its Play-to-Earn game, staking rewards, and Bulls Squad referral system, BTFD offers real utility beyond just hype, making it a solid long-term investment.

Many newcomers to online betting often wonder what is actually required to begin their journey. While each platform may have its own set of rules and unique features, most modern online casinos strive for a streamlined experience that allows you to register, deposit funds, and start playing without unnecessary complications. Understanding the key steps involved will help you navigate sign-up processes and deposit methods with confidence, so you can focus on enjoying your time at the virtual tables. Understanding the Basics of Registration The first stage in registering at an online casino typically involves providing basic personal information in a digital form like on this betway sign up page. This process usually requires your full name, date of birth, and contact details. The online casino needs these details not only to create your account but also to ensure compliance with gambling regulations. Establishing your age is crucial, as most legitimate casinos will only allow individuals who are of legal gambling age in their jurisdiction to proceed. Many platforms use secure software to verify your identity quickly, which helps maintain a safe and responsible environment for everyone involved. Once you submit your initial details, you will typically be asked to create a username and password. This step is important for securing your account and personal data. Many betting sites now provide two-factor authentication options , giving you an added layer of security when you log in. Taking a few moments to choose a strong, memorable password is a wise decision that can protect your account from unwanted access. After verifying your account via email or SMS, you’ll officially be a member of the online casino, ready to move on to the next phase. Providing Identification and Verification Although the basic sign-up forms help casinos gather essential information, there may come a stage where you are asked to provide scanned documents or photos of your ID. This additional step, often referred to as KYC (Know Your Customer), is a legal requirement in many regions and serves to confirm that the details you provided during registration are accurate. Verification measures can include a copy of your passport or driver’s license, proof of address in the form of a utility bill, or a recent bank statement. This process might sound daunting at first, but reputable casinos implement these measures to prevent underage gambling and financial fraud. In many cases, once your verification documents are approved, you will find that deposits and withdrawals process more smoothly. The exact requirements for document submission vary from one site to another, and different countries have differing rules. While some platforms allow you to start playing immediately after registration, others might request verification before you begin wagering. It is worth keeping digital copies of your relevant documents ready so that if a casino asks for confirmation, you can provide it quickly. These safeguards ultimately protect both you and the casino, ensuring a secure and trustworthy betting experience. Depositing Funds and Exploring Payment Methods When it comes to placing bets, you will naturally need a way to fund your account. Modern casinos offer a variety of deposit options, making it easier for players in different parts of the world to add money to their balance. Some players prefer credit or debit cards, while others opt for e-wallet services that provide a level of separation between personal banking information and casino accounts. In certain regions, prepaid cards or direct bank transfers might also be available. Some players even fund their accounts using cryptocurrencies or bitcoin lending apps . It is generally a good idea to start with small deposits to get a feel for the platform and confirm that everything runs smoothly. Some casinos reward new players with welcome bonuses or free spins upon their first deposit, giving you extra incentives to explore their selection of games. Reading through the terms and conditions is wise, because it ensures you know exactly how wagering requirements work and what is needed to withdraw potential winnings. Clear knowledge of these rules can help you avoid misunderstandings later on, especially if you aim to cash out your earnings. Navigating Bonus Offers and Promotions Bonuses and promotions often play a big role in attracting new players, and signing up for an online casino might grant you a welcome package that includes free spins or a deposit match. These rewards can amplify your initial bankroll, giving you a chance to explore different games without risking too much of your own money. However, it is critical to understand any attached terms, such as wagering requirements or game restrictions. Some bonuses may be exclusive to certain slots or table games, and you may need to wager bonus funds a specific number of times before converting them into real cash. Taking a moment to review these details helps you make informed decisions and avoid feeling misled by promotional hype. It also allows you to maximize the benefits of any rewards you receive. Exploring the Game Selection Once you’ve gone through the steps on the betway sign up page and funded your account, the real excitement begins as you explore a vast array of casino games. Modern platforms cater to every taste, from classic slot machines with fruit symbols to immersive video slots that feature captivating storylines, bonus rounds, and special effects. Fans of table games can dive into blackjack, roulette, or baccarat, either playing against software or joining live-dealer sessions that stream real-time footage from professional studios. This level of variety ensures you can always find a new game or variation to try, keeping the experience fresh and engaging. Observing how different wagers affect gameplay and learning the basics of each new challenge can be a rewarding process in itself.

While DOGE remains a well-known asset, some investors are shifting focus to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized lending platform currently in its presale phase. Offering real DeFi utilities such as lending, borrowing, and an overcollateralized stablecoin, Mutuum Finance is attracting early participants seeking high-growth potential. With its structured presale and planned exchange listings, analysts suggest that MUTM could deliver significant returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as a strong contender in the DeFi space, offering decentralized lending and borrowing services through a secure protocol. Unlike speculative assets, MUTM provides real utility by allowing users to act as both suppliers and borrowers. This functionality, combined with its structured token model, has drawn attention from investors seeking long-term growth. At the core of Mutuum Finance’s platform are two lending markets: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The P2C market allows users to supply or borrow crypto from a liquidity pool under preset conditions, managed by automated smart contracts. This system minimizes risk and adjusts interest rates based on market demand. The P2P market provides more flexibility, letting users negotiate loan terms directly. It also supports assets not available in P2C, including meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE). This gives borrowers and lenders access to a wider range of assets while maintaining the platform’s security. Mutuum Finance is also introducing an overcollateralized stablecoin to enhance liquidity. The stablecoin will be backed by collateral exceeding its issued value, ensuring stability and reliability. As adoption grows, demand for MUTM is expected to rise, further supporting price appreciation. Another key driver of price growth is Mutuum Finance’s buy-and-distribute mechanism. A portion of fees from lending and borrowing is used to purchase MUTM from the market, creating buy pressure. These tokens are then redistributed to holders, reducing the circulating supply and rewarding long-term investors. The presale is in its first stage, with MUTM priced at $0.01. In a short time, over 7 million tokens have been sold, raising more than $70,000 and attracting over 200 holders. As presale stages progress, the price will increase, reaching $0.06 in the final stage. Experts also anticipate that MUTM’s price will continue to rise after its launch, providing even greater returns for early investors. With real DeFi utilities, structured tokenomics, and growing market interest, analysts expect strong demand to push the token’s value higher once it is listed on exchanges. The project’s tokenomics are structured for long-term growth. Out of 4 billion total tokens, a large portion is allocated for the presale, liquidity, partnerships, and ecosystem expansion. This distribution ensures that the platform has the necessary resources to support its development, marketing, and future integrations while maintaining a balanced supply. A share of the total supply is also reserved for community incentives, including a $100,000 giveaway aimed at attracting new users. This giveaway will be split among 10 winners, each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. To participate, users need to follow Mutuum Finance on social media, engage with its content, and complete the required steps outlined on the official website. Mutuum Finance also plans to launch a beta version of its platform alongside the token’s exchange listing. This will allow users to explore lending and borrowing features before the full release. With strong fundamentals, a clear roadmap, and growing investor interest, Mutuum Finance is emerging as a serious player in DeFi. Ethereum whales have also taken notice, investing in MUTM as they diversify into projects with real utility. With a structured approach and increasing demand, this token stands out as an asset worth considering before its presale stages sell out.

With thousands of coins out there, finding the real gems is no easy task. The trick is spotting projects that offer more than just hype—they need real-world utility and strong market positioning. Among the most promising projects in 2025, Qubetics , Astra, and Aptos stand out. These aren’t just cheap tokens; they are game-changing crypto projects with massive growth potential. They’re shaking up the industry, making them top choices for investors looking to maximize their returns.

Qubetics is in its 21st presale stage, with the $TICS token priced at $0.0667. The presale has already raised over $12.3 million, selling more than 466 million tokens and attracting over 19,200 token holders. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 before the presale ends, a 274.70% ROI. Long-term forecasts suggest it could even skyrocket to $10, giving early investors a life-changing return. Qubetics isn’t just another token—it’s building critical infrastructure for the future of Web3. The Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet lets users manage assets across multiple blockchains seamlessly, without relying on centralized exchanges. Imagine you’re a trader holding Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon tokens. Instead of switching between wallets and paying crazy gas fees, Qubetics’ Multi-Chain Wallet lets you control everything from one simple interface. Then there’s the partnership with 1inch, one of the top decentralized exchange aggregators. This allows Qubetics users to swap tokens across blockchains at the best possible rates—all while staying in full control of their assets. For businesses, this is a game-changer. A global e-commerce platform can now accept crypto payments in multiple tokens without worrying about high conversion fees.

Or where content creators can sell their AI-generated works without middlemen taking a huge cut. Astra’s approach to AI and blockchain integration has caught the attention of investors. By creating a trustless, permissionless AI economy, Astra is setting the stage for mass adoption. As more businesses and developers turn to decentralized AI, Astra’s token demand will likely explode—making it one of the best cryptos under a penny to invest in. Aptos: The Blockchain Built for Speed and Efficiency Aptos isn’t just another layer-1 blockchain—it’s designed for scalability, security, and ultra-fast transactions. Built by ex-Meta (formerly Facebook) engineers, Aptos is powered by the Move programming language, which makes it faster and safer than many existing blockchains. Aptos solves major blockchain problems like slow transaction speeds and expensive gas fees. With its innovative technology, it can process thousands of transactions per second—making it a serious competitor to Ethereum and Solana. Aptos has already attracted major venture capital investments and is expanding its ecosystem rapidly. As Web3 projects and dApps migrate to Aptos, demand for its native token is expected to surge. If you’re looking for a blockchain project with real-world adoption and scalability, Aptos is one of the best cryptos under a penny to consider. Final Thoughts: Where Should You Invest?

Astra is bringing AI to the blockchain, making data ownership and decentralized AI services accessible.

By 2028, the price is projected to reach $14.65. By 2031, FIL may reach $49.84. Filecoin is a decentralized storage network designed to securely and efficiently store humanity’s most important information. Launched by Protocol Labs in October 2020, it utilizes blockchain technology to create a peer-to-peer digital storage marketplace. Users can rent unused hard drive space to earn Filecoin tokens (FIL), the network’s native cryptocurrency. The system operates on a proof-of-replication and proof-of-spacetime consensus mechanism, ensuring that data is reliably stored over time and that storage providers hold the exact copies they claim. This approach incentivizes a robust and distributed network of storage providers, enhancing data retrieval speeds and security compared to traditional centralized servers. Filecoin aims to reduce the costs of storage services by leveraging the global surplus of storage capacity. As part of the broader Web3 ecosystem, it supports decentralized applications (dApps) and services requiring secure, decentralized data storage solutions, significantly advancing decentralized internet infrastructure.

The Bollinger Bands indicate increased volatility, with prices hovering near the lower band at $2.68, acting as immediate support. Resistance is evident at $4.21, the midline of the Bollinger Bands, and $5.74 at the upper band. The RSI at 32.87 is near oversold territory, suggesting potential exhaustion of selling pressure. However, the consistent downward trend implies that bulls lack momentum for a reversal. If the current support fails, prices could test $2.50. A recovery above $3.50 would signal short-term bullish activity, but caution remains warranted. Filecoin price analysis 4-hour chart analysis FIL/USD chart Image Source: TradingView On the 4-hour FIL/USD chart, Filecoin is experiencing heavy bearish momentum, trading at $3.19, with prices consistently trending near the lower Bollinger Band. The MACD shows widening bearish histograms, reflecting sustained selling pressure. The Balance of Power indicator also signals negative sentiment, confirming sellers are dominating. Immediate support is seen at $3.07, with potential downside toward $2.90 if current levels fail.

The RSI on both the 1-day and 4-hour charts hovers near oversold territory, suggesting a possible relief rally if buying interest surfaces.

A prominent market analysts, Charles Edwards has hinted at a potential miner sell-off, a move that could tilt BTC price action bearish in the week ahead. Bitcoin (BTC) Enters 4-Day Stagnation as Bears Mount Resistance at $97K Bitcoin (BTC) made a sluggish start to February 2025, as bearish macroeconomic headwinds, as turbulence from Trump-led U.S.-China trade war tariffs, weighed heavily on market sentiment. Following an initial knee-jerk reaction that triggered over $2 billion in crypto liquidations, BTC markets found temporary relief on Thursday, February 6, stabilizing around the $96,000 support level. However, while major altcoins like Binance Coin ( BNB ) and Solana ( SOL ) have recorded considerable gains in recent days, Bitcoin has remained stagnant since February 6. Bitcoin Price Action (BTCUSDT), Feb 10, 2025 | Source: TradingView The shaded portion in the chart above illustrates BTC price consolidating within a tight $100,000 – $95,000 range over the past four trading sessions, signaling indecision among market participants. Despite resilient buyer support near $96,000, a breakout above the $97,000 resistance has remained elusive, raising concerns of a potential reversal if bearish pressures intensify. Capriole Investments Founder Hints at Miner Sell-Off Amid Subdued BTC Price Action When a systemically important asset like BTC lags behind the broader market uptrend, it often signals the presence of an active internal bearish catalyst. Supporting this theory, Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, flagged a significant miner sell-off event as a possible reason behind Bitcoin’s stagnation. “Bitcoin miner capitulation! A new capitulation event has just started. We all know what it means when a Hash Ribbon buy signal eventually follows… A lot can happen between now and then. But we are entering a window of opportunity,” Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments The Hash Ribbons indicator, a well-regarded on-chain metric, identifies periods of miner capitulation based on hash rate dynamics. Historically, when Bitcoin’s hash rate declines sharply, it suggests that miners are struggling with profitability, often leading to sell-offs as they offload BTC to cover operational costs. While miner capitulation typically precedes long-term recovery, it can induce short-term bearish price action. Miners’ Reserves Drop Signals Additional Selling Pressure Further supporting this bearish Bitcoin price forecast , IntoTheBlock’s Miner Reserves metric highlights a sharp drop in BTC holdings among mining entities. This indicator tracks the daily changes in the aggregate Bitcoin balances held in wallets controlled by recognized miners and mining pools, offering insights into miner activity. Between February 4 and February 8, miner reserves fell from 1.94 million BTC to 1.91 million BTC, marking an outflow of approximately 30,000 BTC—equivalent to nearly $3 billion at current market prices. This level of selling pressure is significant, as it inflates short-term market supply, potentially weighing down Bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin Miners Reserves | BTCUSDT Historically, periods of large miner sell-offs have coincided with either price stagnation or temporary declines, as excess BTC supply outpaces existing demand. If miners continue offloading reserves at this scale, Bitcoin could struggle to maintain the $96,000 support level, increasing the risk of a deeper pullback toward $94,500 or lower in the coming sessions. While long-term holders may view miner capitulation as a buy-the-dip opportunity, the immediate outlook for Bitcoin remains uncertain. If selling pressure from miners subsides and Bitcoin manages a sustained breakout above $97,000, a renewed bullish trend could emerge. However, failure to do so could see Bitcoin extend its current stagnation or even slip into a short-term downtrend. With Bitcoin at a critical juncture, traders and investors will be closely monitoring miner activity and macroeconomic developments for further directional cues.

Several exciting ICOs are gaining momentum in 2025, and Web3Bay leads the way with its decentralized e-commerce approach. Alongside Web3Bay, 5thScape and Meme Index are also proving to be strong contenders. Let’s explore these three promising projects and why they deserve attention this week. 1. Web3Bay: Leading Crypto ICO with Huge ROI Potential Web3Bay is making waves in the ICO space by introducing a decentralized platform aimed at reshaping online commerce. It allows users to maintain full control over their data and transactions, aligning with growing concerns about digital privacy. Since its launch, Web3Bay has raised over $1 million, with 280 million coins already sold at a price of $0.004562625 each. Currently, in its fourth phase of a 28-stage ICO, the price is expected to rise in the upcoming stages, ultimately reaching $0.1959 upon launch. This steady increase suggests Web3Bay could deliver returns similar to other blockchain-based projects, where early participants saw their holdings grow by 100x or even 1,000x. Unlike meme-based projects, Web3Bay offers a practical solution with real-world benefits. It prioritizes sustainable expansion by providing tangible advantages for users and businesses. This makes Web3Bay one of the best crypto ICOs available this week, with a strong potential for future growth. 2. 5thScape: Presale Crypto for Metaverse & VR 5thScape stands out in the best crypto ICOs by integrating blockchain with virtual reality (VR). The project is rapidly expanding, having already raised over $9.4 million. It focuses on the gaming, education, and healthcare industries by offering a blockchain-powered VR environment where users can earn rewards in digital worlds. 5thScape is set to become a key player in the VR and metaverse industries, both of which are witnessing rapid expansion. With planned exchange listings on MEXC and BitMart, demand for 5thScape is expected to surge, making this a project worth monitoring in the coming weeks. 3. Meme Index: A Smarter Way to Enter the Meme Market Meme-themed assets have gained massive popularity, but many people face risks when engaging with individual assets. Meme Index (MEMEX) changes this by offering a collection of various meme assets, reducing exposure to extreme price swings. MEMEX provides features like staking and voting rights for those who participate. This model allows meme fans to engage in the sector while lowering risks tied to single projects. For those seeking potential gains while managing risk, Meme Index stands out among the best crypto ICOs. With interest growing rapidly, it presents a strong opportunity in the expanding meme sector. Why These Crypto ICOs Are Worth Considering? Best crypto ICOs give early participants the chance to engage with digital assets at lower prices before they go mainstream. Web3Bay, 5thScape, and Meme Index are three leading projects offering diverse opportunities. Web3Bay is driving change with its decentralized marketplace and steady growth. Its structured ICO and long-term model make it a strong contender for those seeking expansion potential. 5thScape is embracing the VR and metaverse space, developing blockchain-powered experiences that are expected to play a crucial role in the future digital economy. Meme Index provides a safer way to navigate the meme sector, offering a diversified approach to minimize risk while still capitalizing on trends in the market. For those interested in early-stage opportunities, these best crypto ICOs present a solid chance to enter the market before they gain mainstream attention. As always, thorough research is essential before participating. If you’re looking for exciting projects this week, Web3Bay, 5thScape, and Meme Index should be on your watchlist.

Some laughed at it. Others dismissed it as a joke. Then, history unfolded before their eyes. That tiny Dogecoin price became a moonshot, turning mere pocket change into life-changing wealth. The echoes of regret still haunt crypto OGs who watched but never acted. This lesson is etched into the fabric of crypto history: fortunes favor those who recognize opportunity before the world realizes it. Now, the exact moment is here again. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) price , sits at $0.0420 , a price so small that history practically screams at those who missed out. This is an AI-powered financial opportunity. The question isn’t whether this token will surge but who will seize the moment before it does. Dogecoin Price Skyrocketed, But WallitIQ (WLTQ) Is Built For More Dogecoin price made millionaires out of those crypto OGs who saw the potential before the hype. But beyond the memes, it lacked real-world application. It was fun and unexpected, but it wasn’t engineered for long-term dominance. That’s where WallitIQ (WLTQ) changes the game . History makes it clear that this isn’t a speculative gamble but a project built for practical success. Its AI engine delivers precise investment recommendations. And security? This token doesn’t leave it to chance. Biometric authentication gives only investors access to their assets, while Escrow Connect , powered by AI Einstein, creates bulletproof trust in transactions. This isn’t just another altcoin. It is a financial fortress that crypto OGs have identified. Users gain total control over their transactions with the MVP Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App. Dogecoin price didn’t have this kind of infrastructure when it rose from fractions of a cent to a global sensation. But WallitIQ (WLTQ) isn’t waiting to play catch-up. It’s launching with everything in place, designed to support the explosive growth that made early Dogecoin (DOGE) holders millionaires. Why Crypto OGs Refuse To Miss Out Again The biggest names in crypto have one rule: learn from history. They’ve seen how Dogecoin price defied expectations, and they know the next explosive altcoin won’t wait for hesitation. That’s why the SolidProof-audited WallitIQ (WLTQ) has caught their attention. This isn’t just another token; it’s a platform built to dominate. While the Dogecoin price soared on community hype, this project is fueled by real innovation. Crypto OGs aren’t looking at this as just another altcoin. They’re seeing the blueprint of financial evolution, a project building the infrastructure that traditional cryptocurrencies never had. The beta platform is approaching, and early adopters are positioning themselves before the masses flood in. Crypto OGs know that having the right investments isn’t enough; managing them efficiently is just as crucial. WallitIQ (WLTQ) isn’t just giving investors a token; it’s giving them a complete financial toolkit. Crypto OGs Know That Wealth Moves Fast History has never been kind to those who hesitate. The same crypto OGs who regretted missing the Dogecoin price at $0.0001 know that sitting on the sidelines is a guaranteed way to miss out again. That’s why they’re already positioning themselves in WallitIQ (WLTQ) before it’s too late. This AI altcoin isn’t just another name in the market. The beta platform is about to launch , and when it does, the opportunity at $0.0420 will be gone forever. Crypto history is repeating itself, but smart money isn’t waiting this time. The choice is simple: be the person who looks back with regret or acts when the window is still open. Don’t miss out. Buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) now because this is one moment history won’t offer twice.

Binance Coin (BNB) is currently targeting a move above $620, Stellar (XLM) is showing signs of a breakout towards the $0.75-$0.80 range, and BlockDAG (BDAG) has seen remarkable demand for its mining equipment. Traders interpret the recent Binance coin price forecast as a signal that BNB could see further upward movement, provided it remains above the $600 level. On the other hand, in the mining sector, BlockDAG has sold over 15,850 mining rigs, attracting both new and experienced miners. With BlockDAG’s planned listing on major exchanges, some analysts suggest BDAG is a strong candidate for long-term mining returns, citing its energy-efficient design and promising growth potential. BlockDAG has raised over $193 million and is now in Batch 27, priced at $0.0248, representing a 2380% surge with over 18.4 billion coins sold. Binance Coin Price Forecast: Analyzing BNB’s Path to $620 Analysts are closely examining the latest Binance coin price forecast after BNB recovered above $600. This Binance coin price forecast indicates a potential 8% increase, which could lead to further gains if buyers maintain the current price floor. Market observers suggest that a successful close above $620 could validate the positive outlook presented by this Binance coin price forecast. Following the recent price increase, BNB has experienced a slight pullback, trading around $572. Some experts emphasize the importance of maintaining price stability above $600, as a drop below this level could lead to a price correction. Overall, the Binance coin price forecast remains optimistic, contingent on continued growth in BNB’s market demand. The Binance coin price forecast is a subject of much discussion. Stellar Breakout: Charting XLM’s Potential Upswing The cryptocurrency community is watching for a possible Stellar breakout that could propel XLM toward the $0.75-$0.80 range. Observers point to Stellar’s network expansion, including $458 million in tokenized assets, as evidence supporting a Stellar breakout. The blockchain’s low transaction fees further encourage adoption by businesses looking for affordable transaction solutions. Several analysts believe a Stellar breakout is likely, supported by 9 million active addresses. If XLM can overcome its current resistance levels around $0.34, it could reach higher price targets. Traders are paying close attention, believing that wider use cases and continued adoption will likely support any future rally. BlockDAG: A New Approach to Distributed Ledger Technology BlockDAG is making significant strides in the mining world, having sold over 15,850 crypto mining rigs during its presale. The demand for BDAG is high, as demonstrated by the $193 million raised and the 18.4 billion coins sold. Early participants have already seen a 2,380% return. The key attraction of BlockDAG lies in its environmentally conscious Proof-of-Work mining system, which balances performance with energy efficiency. BlockDAG’s mining hardware line includes the X10, X30, and X100 miners, each designed to meet different mining needs. The X10 can generate up to 200 BDAG daily, the X30 up to 600 BDAG, and the X100, designed for large-scale operations, can mine up to 2,000 BDAG per day. This scalability appeals to both new and experienced miners, especially with forecasts suggesting BDAG could reach $1 after its launch. With network growth and ongoing mining rewards, the community views BDAG as a long-term profitable venture. The project’s focus on consistent block rewards and specialized keccak256 hardware highlights its forward-looking approach. Miners aiming to maximize their earnings are actively acquiring these units, hoping to profit when BDAG is listed on major exchanges and establishes itself as a leading mining option. Market Outlook and Future Trends The cryptocurrency market is keeping traders engaged, with Binance Coin (BNB) attempting to surpass $620, provided it maintains key support levels. A Stellar breakout is also indicating a possible significant price increase. BlockDAG’s successful presale, with over 15,850 mining rigs sold, positions it as a strong contender for long-term, scalable mining rewards. Its energy-efficient mining and growing demand have solidified BDAG’s position in the market.

Some meme coins explode overnight, while others fade into obscurity. The key is knowing which projects have the momentum and long-term vision to deliver sustainable growth. With market volatility at an all-time high, choosing the right meme coin at the right time can mean the difference between life-changing profits and missed opportunities. Among the top new meme coins to buy this month, BTFD Coin is making waves with a record-breaking presale, analyst-backed price predictions, and a massive 100% bonus offer for early investors. While Popcat and Bonk fight to reclaim past glory, BTFD Coin is surging ahead with a presale that’s attracting serious attention. Investors looking for strong fundamentals, a growing community, and early-stage potential need to have BTFD Coin on their radar before it hits exchanges. BTFD Coin: The Presale That’s Smashing Records When it comes to high-potential meme coin investments, presales are where the magic happens. BTFD Coin’s presale has been nothing short of phenomenal, proving that investors are betting big on its success. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, BTFD Coin has built a strong foundation backed by investor confidence, staking rewards, and Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming. The excitement surrounding BTFD Coin isn’t just speculation. Analysts predict that upon launch, BTFD Coin could surge to $0.0006, with some forecasting a long-term climb to $0.006 as adoption grows. That’s a 3,650% potential return for those who get in early. This presale is gaining steam at the perfect time, and with market conditions favoring early-stage meme coin entries, BTFD Coin is positioned for a strong debut. Investors have already poured over $5.97 million into the presale, with more than 69 billion tokens sold and over 10,400 holders onboarded. These numbers demonstrate a growing belief in BTFD Coin’s long-term potential. But the real kicker? The exclusive LAUNCH100 bonus code is doubling every presale purchase, giving early adopters 100% extra tokens. This is one of the most aggressive incentives in the meme coin market today, making BTFD Coin one of the top new meme coins to buy this month before the bonus disappears. Popcat: The Meme That’s Fighting for Relevance Internet culture can be unpredictable, and Popcat’s journey proves that staying power is just as important as hype. Born from a viral image of a cat with an exaggerated jaw movement, Popcat became an instant sensation. Its strong internet presence and meme appeal gave it a fast-tracked entry into the crypto space, attracting traders looking to capitalize on short-term meme-driven volatility. While Popcat initially enjoyed impressive price action, its ability to maintain momentum has been challenged. Meme coins thrive on community engagement and ongoing development, and Popcat is working to evolve beyond a simple joke. Investors are watching closely to see if Popcat can sustain long-term interest or if it will be another short-lived trend. For traders looking to capitalize on meme-driven price swings, Popcat still holds promise. However, compared to BTFD Coin’s structured presale and strong fundamentals, Popcat’s future remains uncertain. Bonk: Can It Bounce Back After Struggles? Bonk took the Solana ecosystem by storm, becoming one of the most talked-about meme coins of the year. Its community-driven ethos and aggressive token burns initially fueled massive price gains, attracting both traders and long-term holders. However, recent struggles have tested its resilience. In an attempt to regain lost momentum, Bonk burned 2.02 trillion tokens in a move designed to boost scarcity and increase investor confidence. While burns often trigger bullish sentiment, Bonk’s price response has been underwhelming. Analysts suggest that unless Bonk’s market conditions improve, the token could face further downward pressure. Despite these setbacks, Bonk still has a loyal following and potential upside if market sentiment shifts. However, compared to BTFD Coin’s fast-growing presale and strategic incentives, Bonk’s outlook remains uncertain in the short term. Final Thoughts: Where Should You Invest This Month? Meme coins offer some of the most explosive opportunities in crypto, but timing and strategy are everything. Among the top new meme coins to buy this month , BTFD Coin stands out as the strongest contender. Its record-breaking presale, analyst-backed price forecasts, and investor-friendly incentives make it the top pick for those looking to get in early. For those looking to ride the meme wave, Popcat and Bonk still have potential, but their recent price struggles make them riskier bets. Meanwhile, BTFD Coin is thriving, with a growing investor base and a 100% bonus that gives early buyers an unbeatable edge. The LAUNCH100 bonus won’t last forever, and with over $5.97 million raised already, the final presale stages are closing in fast. If you’re looking for a high-growth meme coin with real momentum, now is the time to secure your BTFD tokens before the presale closes.

XRP & Bitcoin Holders Are Watching These Next-Gen Cryptos!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/500-to-1m-xrp-bitcoin-holders-are-watching-these-next-gen-cryptos/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has long been the cornerstone of cryptocurrency success stories, turning early adopters into millionaires. Cardano (ADA), Near Protocol (NEAR), and Kaspa (KAS) have also built strong reputations, while Arbitrum (ARB) has shown potential as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. However, a new coin, OFFICIALMAGACOIN, is now commanding the attention of savvy investors. OFFICIALMAGACOIN Could Deliver 60,000% Returns OFFICIALMAGACOIN has emerged as a unique player, with a record-breaking presale raising over $1.5 million in minutes. The token is only available at magacoinofficial.com , adding an element of exclusivity that appeals to both retail and institutional investors. Its potential for 60,000% returns has investors speculating that it could mirror or even surpass Bitcoin’s early growth trajectory. Early-Stage Growth Potential: With its presale success, OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers investors a chance to get in on the ground floor of a coin poised for exponential growth. Exclusivity and Scarcity: Available only at its official website, the token creates urgency and a sense of premium access. Affordable Entry Point: At less than $0.20 per token, OFFICIALMAGACOIN provides a low-risk, high-reward opportunity. Comparing OFFICIALMAGACOIN to Competitors Bitcoin (BTC): Established but lacks the explosive growth of a new coin. Cardano (ADA): Reliable but maturing, leaving little room for exponential returns. Near Protocol (NEAR): Focused on Web3 but cannot match OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s exclusivity. Kaspa (KAS): A promising blockchain but with a slower trajectory. Investors eager to secure their position in this promising token can do so exclusively at magacoinofficial.com . With market buzz intensifying, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is becoming a top contender in the race for the next crypto millionaire-maker.

The university plans to allocate over $5 million to this fund, which will be part of its $200 million endowment. Chun Lai, the foundation’s chief investment officer, emphasized the institution’s proactive approach, stating, “We don’t want to be left behind when their [cryptocurrency’s] potential materializes dramatically.” This initiative follows recent developments in higher education’s engagement with digital assets. Notably, Emory University recently disclosed a $15 million investment in Bitcoin through Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), marking it as the first U.S. university endowment to report such holdings. The University of Austin intends to maintain its Bitcoin holdings for a minimum of five years. Chad Thevenot, senior vice president for advancement at the university, explained the strategy: “We think there is long-term value there, just the same way that we might think there is long-term value in stocks or real estate.” Beyond academia, cryptocurrencies are gaining traction among retirement funds, indicating a broader shift in financial strategies. A recent Bitget Research report revealed that up to 20% of Gen Z and Alpha are open to receiving pensions in cryptocurrency. Furthermore, 78% of respondents expressed greater trust in “alternative retirement savings options” over traditional pension funds, highlighting a significant move towards decentralized finance and blockchain-based solutions. Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget, commented on this trend: “Younger generations are no longer content with one-size-fits-all pension systems. They’re looking for modern solutions that give them more control, flexibility, and transparency.” As of January 2025, 40% of individuals in these younger demographics had already invested in cryptocurrency, underscoring the growing acceptance and integration of digital assets in various sectors. The University of Austin’s initiative signifies a notable step in the evolving relationship between higher education and cryptocurrency investments, potentially setting a precedent for other institutions to follow.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-10 00:48:04

In its pursuit of technological supremacy, the UAE is actively fostering an environment conducive to digital transformation, attracting investors, entrepreneurs, and visionaries from around the world. A Crypto-Friendly Economy The UAE has positioned itself as one of the most progressive nations in terms of cryptocurrency adoption and regulation. Dubai and Abu Dhabi have introduced comprehensive legal frameworks to regulate and encourage the crypto industry. The Dubai Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA), established in 2022, provides clear guidelines for crypto exchanges, digital asset firms, and blockchain enterprises. This regulatory clarity has made the UAE an attractive destination for crypto startups and institutional investors alike. In addition, Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) has developed a robust regulatory framework for digital assets, enabling businesses to operate with legal certainty. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has secured operational approval in Dubai, while Kraken and other major players have established a presence in Abu Dhabi. By embracing digital currencies, the UAE is cementing itself as a financial innovation hub, encouraging both institutional and retail adoption. Beyond regulation, the UAE government has actively explored the integration of blockchain technology within public services. The Dubai Blockchain Strategy aims to transition government transactions onto blockchain platforms, enhancing transparency, security, and efficiency. Furthermore, the UAE Central Bank is developing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) to modernize the financial system and improve cross-border transactions. The Metaverse Revolution The UAE is not only embracing crypto but also investing heavily in the metaverse, with Dubai leading the charge. In 2022, Dubai launched its ambitious Metaverse Strategy, which aims to generate 40,000 virtual jobs and contribute $4 billion to the emirate’s economy by 2030. The initiative seeks to make Dubai one of the top 10 metaverse economies globally, fostering innovation in virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and Web3 technologies. Government-backed entities, including the Dubai Future Foundation and the Abu Dhabi Investment Office, are investing in metaverse startups and infrastructure. The Dubai Municipality has even announced plans to create a virtual city where residents can interact in a fully immersive digital environment. Businesses are also leveraging the metaverse, with real estate developers showcasing virtual properties and luxury brands launching digital stores tailored for metaverse consumers. Tourism and retail, two of the UAE’s strongest economic pillars, are also set to benefit from metaverse integration. Airlines such as Emirates have announced metaverse-driven experiences to enhance customer engagement, while retail giants are adopting virtual shopping platforms to cater to tech-savvy consumers. These initiatives highlight the UAE’s vision to be at the forefront of digital innovation. Artificial Intelligence As a Priority AI is at the heart of the UAE’s digital transformation strategy. The country’s leadership has made AI development a national priority, exemplified by the appointment of the world’s first Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence in 2017. The UAE AI Strategy 2031 aims to position the nation as a global leader in AI, with plans to integrate AI across various sectors, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and public services. Dubai’s Smart City initiative and Abu Dhabi’s AI research efforts are driving AI adoption in governance and business operations. The country is also home to some of the world’s most advanced AI-driven projects, such as the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), the first university dedicated solely to AI research. AI is transforming industries across the UAE, from autonomous transportation solutions to AI-powered healthcare diagnostics. The UAE’s embrace of AI is evident in initiatives such as the Dubai Police’s use of AI-powered surveillance and the implementation of smart traffic systems to reduce congestion. In finance, AI-driven algorithms are optimizing investment strategies, fraud detection, and customer service automation. A Magnet for Global Talent and Investment The UAE’s proactive approach to crypto, the metaverse, and AI has positioned it as a prime destination for global talent and investment. The government has introduced business-friendly policies, including 100% foreign ownership in various tech-related sectors and long-term residency visas for entrepreneurs, tech professionals, and investors. International firms are flocking to the UAE to capitalize on its supportive regulatory environment, strategic location, and tax-friendly policies. Events like the Dubai Future Blockchain Summit and AI Everything attract industry leaders and innovators, reinforcing the UAE’s reputation as a technology-driven economy.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|FIAT,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-10 01:11:01

With a presale price under $0.20 and a rapid rise in popularity, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is capturing the imagination of crypto enthusiasts who believe that $300 today could turn into $999,000 in the near future. Why OFFICIALMAGACOIN Could Transform Your Investment 1. Early-Stage Opportunity OFFICIALMAGACOIN is still in its presale phase, offering a ground-floor opportunity for investors to buy in before the token gains mainstream attention. This is the stage where gains of 1,000x or more become achievable, as seen with Bitcoin in its early days. 2. Exclusive AvailabilityUnlike widely distributed coins, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at magacoinofficial.com . This exclusivity drives demand, ensuring that early adopters benefit as interest surges. 3. Record-Breaking Presale SuccessRaising over $1.5 million in presale funds in record time, OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven its appeal among investors. Such strong initial support is a hallmark of projects poised for explosive growth. 4. Massive Growth PotentialExperts are predicting OFFICIALMAGACOIN could follow in Bitcoin’s footsteps, transforming small investments into extraordinary returns. With its low entry price and strong market momentum, the potential for turning $300 into $999,000 feels more achievable than ever. How It Stacks Up Against SOL, MATIC, KAS, and BTC Bitcoin (BTC): A proven store of value, but its days of exponential growth are behind it. Solana (SOL): Fast and scalable, but its market is maturing, making massive gains less likely. Polygon (MATIC): A strong performer in Ethereum scaling, but it lacks the exclusivity and newness of OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS): An up-and-coming blockchain project with potential but without the momentum OFFICIALMAGACOIN is generating. Don’t Miss Out on OFFICIALMAGACOIN The chance to turn $300 into $999K doesn’t come often, but OFFICIALMAGACOIN might just be that opportunity. With its affordable price, exclusivity, and massive growth potential, it’s a must-watch for 2025. Secure your tokens now at magacoinofficial.com and stay updated on their journey via Twitter/X.

XRP ETF Rumors Keep Prices Up & BNB Holds Firm,https://thecoinrise.com/biggest-presale-boom-web2bay-hits-1m-in-weeks-xrp-etf-rumors-keep-prices-up-bnb-holds-firm/,"Ripple XRP is still navigating regulatory matters, but its latest price surge to $3.03 suggests growing interest from major investors. With XRP ETF applications under review and leadership changes at the SEC, regulatory shifts could push its adoption further. Meanwhile, Binance Coin (BNB) remains a dominant force at $673.09, even as it faces increased regulatory pressure. While these coins continue to evolve, most Web3 projects remain centralized—except Web3Bay . Unlike Binance and XRP, where governance is handled by a select few, Web3Bay puts its users in control. Those participating early don’t just acquire digital assets—they gain voting rights and influence over how the platform operates. Web3Bay: Empowering Users with Real Control Most online platforms set fees and policies without user input. Web3Bay takes a different approach. Holders of 3BAY decide platform policies, vote on changes, and directly influence operations. Ripple XRP’s governance remains in the hands of a select group, while Web3Bay ensures decisions are driven by its community. This isn’t just about buying digital assets—it’s about shaping the future of decentralized marketplaces. Web3Bay’s presale is progressing fast, raising over $1 million and selling more than 280 million 3BAY. The current price stands at $0.004562625, increasing at each stage. Early supporters secure 3BAY at a fraction of its expected launch value of $0.1959. Holding 3BAY provides access to governance rights, marketplace perks, and exclusive benefits. With every presale stage, the price rises, making early participation crucial. As Web3 adoption grows, Web3Bay leads the way toward a decentralized future. Those who join now won’t just be buyers—they’ll help shape the platform’s direction. XRP ETF Progress and SEC Policy Shifts Ripple XRP has gained traction, currently priced at $3.03 as institutional interest increases. The major shift? Companies like Grayscale aim to transform their XRP Trust into a spot XRP ETF, a move that could introduce greater mainstream adoption. Canada’s Purpose Investments is also preparing an XRP ETF, hoping to launch before the U.S. makes a decision. As demand rises, XRP’s future hinges on regulatory approvals. On the legal front, Ripple’s situation may soon improve. With Paul Atkins now leading the SEC, regulatory policies around crypto could become more favorable. If changes benefit Ripple, this could remove a key barrier to XRP’s broader use. The focus remains on regulatory updates that could shift the market. BNB Faces Legal Pressure but Retains Market Strength Binance Coin (BNB) holds its ground at $673.09 despite ongoing regulatory scrutiny. French authorities have launched an inquiry into Binance, examining past tax and compliance issues. Despite legal hurdles, Binance remains the largest crypto exchange, serving 245 million users and processing an average daily trading volume of $14 billion. Traders continue to favor Binance due to its deep liquidity and low-cost transactions. While Ripple XRP’s growth has been impacted by legal uncertainties, Binance continues expanding. Recently, it introduced the VVVUSDT Perpetual Contract, offering up to 25x leverage on Venice Token (VVV). Although legal concerns persist, Binance’s influence remains significant. The key question is whether regulatory actions will impact its future. Final Call Ripple XRP and Binance Coin (BNB) are navigating significant developments. XRP ETF proposals and SEC policy shifts could drive further adoption, while Binance remains a strong market player despite regulatory scrutiny. However, both operate within centralized structures, limiting user control. Web3Bay offers a different approach. Rather than relying on central entities, Web3Bay ensures users have decision-making power. 3BAY holders vote on platform updates, governance policies, and marketplace improvements. As the crypto presale price climbs at each stage, early participants don’t just secure assets—they secure a role in Web3Bay’s future. This isn’t just about buying—it’s about leading.

Historical data suggests Ethereum Foundation’s latest 50,000 ETH transaction could potentially spark volatile market reactions in the week ahead. Ethereum Price Settles at $2,600 as Bearish Pressure Subsides Ethereum (ETH) has struggled to gain momentum in the first week of February, facing multiple bearish catalysts. Internal challenges, including controversial network updates and an increasing circulating supply, have hindered bullish advances. Additionally, macroeconomic headwinds from the U.S.-China trade war have exacerbated the downturn. Ethereum Price Action (ETHUSD) | Source: TradingView Between February 1 and February 7, ETH price experienced a sharp 20% decline, dropping from $3,300 to the $2,600 level. Since February 7, the downward momentum has halted as selling pressure has eased considerably. However, despite this stabilization, ETH has yet to stage a meaningful recovery from last week’s losses. While other top altcoins like Binance Coin ( BNB ) and Solana ( SOL ) have posted gains over the weekend, ETH has remained stagnant within a tight $2,500 to $2,700 range. This consolidation closely mirrors Bitcoin’s price hiatus, highlighting investor indecision and a wait-and-see approach among traders. Ethereum Foundation Spotted Moving 50,000 ETH, Sparking Speculation Ethereum’s stagnation over the weekend coincided with shifting investor focus towards the broader altcoin market. While Bitcoin’s price inactivity has been attributed to a miner sell-off , as highlighted by Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards, ETH’s sideways movement appears to be influenced by recent Ethereum Foundation transactions. On February 9, blockchain security and analytics platform PeckShield flagged a significant transaction involving the Ethereum Foundation—the organization responsible for overseeing the network’s operations and development. “#PeckShieldAlert The Ethereum Foundation has transferred 50,000 $ETH (worth ~$131.6M) to EF: DeFi Multisig for supporting and participating in the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem.” – PeckshieldAlert, Feb 9, 2025. Notably, PeckShield clarified that the 50,000 ETH (~$131.6 million) was not liquidated but rather transferred to a new multi-signature wallet intended to support Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem. In theory, this could be a bullish sign, signaling further investment in DeFi projects and ecosystem development. Ethereum Foundation Spotted Moving 50,000 ETH ($131.6 million) | Feb 9, 2025. However, historical trends suggest that ETH prices have often dipped following large Ethereum Foundation outflows. Insider sell-offs or major fund reallocations tend to trigger bearish sentiment among holders, as they raise concerns over potential future liquidations. These moves can also deter new market entrants who may fear increased volatility or further downside pressure. While this latest transaction was not a direct sell-off, traders are likely to remain cautious until further clarification emerges. Without a major positive uptick in broader market sentiment, ETH price could struggle for momentum at the start of the week. Looking ahead, investors will closely monitor Ethereum Foundation’s wallet activities and market reactions to gauge whether this latest development will ultimately serve as a bullish catalyst or signal renewed selling pressure. Until then, ETH’s short-term trajectory remains uncertain, with technical indicators pointing to both potential upside and risks of further stagnation. Ethereum Price Forecast: $2,750 Breakout Could Spin Market Sentiment Ethereum price prediction chart below presents a bearish-leaning outlook, as the asset continues to trade within a consolidation phase near $2,575. The falling wedge pattern, which previously provided a relief rally, has been invalidated by the latest breakdown, reinforcing near-term downside risks. Volume analysis reveals a notable decline in participation, suggesting a lack of bullish conviction at current levels. RSI stands at 29.61, deep in oversold territory, implying a potential technical rebound, but with the indicator still sloping downward, momentum remains weak. Ethereum Price Forecast | ETHUSDT For the bullish scenario, ETH would need to reclaim $2,750 as a support level to regain market confidence. A break above this level could trigger fresh buying pressure, opening the door for a recovery toward $3,000, where the prior resistance cluster resides. If buyers return, a shift in sentiment could propel ETH higher, mirroring gains seen in altcoins like Solana and Binance Coin. Conversely, failure to hold the $2,500 support could exacerbate selling pressure, potentially driving ETH toward $2,400 or lower. With historical data showing price declines following Ethereum Foundation transactions, traders remain cautious, and unless demand picks up, Ethereum could struggle to regain upward momentum in the near term.

As the blockchain ecosystem continues to evolve, new projects are emerging that promise to change the way we interact with digital finance. Among these rising stars are Qubetics ($TICS), Cronos (CRO), and Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance (ASIA). Each of these coins brings something unique to the table, targeting different aspects of the blockchain industry.

The presale has already raised over $12.3 million, and as it continues into its 21st stage, it’s clear that this project is gaining serious traction. For investors looking to diversify their portfolios, Qubetics presents a fascinating opportunity. On the other hand, Cronos (CRO) is no stranger to the crypto world. As the native token of the Crypto.com ecosystem, Cronos has a strong market presence and a broad array of use cases within decentralized finance (DeFi) and beyond. Its ability to connect various blockchain networks gives it a solid foundation for future growth, making it one of the best cryptos to buy now for anyone looking for a tried-and-true player in the space. Lastly, Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance (ASIA) is entering the market with a bold mission: to integrate AI with blockchain technology, creating a new frontier for both industries.

For those looking for something futuristic and forward-thinking, ASIA might just be the right pick. As we dive into the details of these three coins, let’s explore how Qubetics, Cronos, and ASIA stack up and why they should be on your radar as the best cryptos to buy now . Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionizing Blockchain Interoperability When it comes to the best cryptos to buy now , Qubetics ($TICS) is a project that cannot be overlooked. Positioned in the 21st stage of its presale, this innovative blockchain platform has already raised over $12.3 million, with more than 466 million tokens sold to over 19,200 holders. At just $0.0733 per token in this presale stage, $TICS presents an exciting entry point for early investors. One of the standout features of Qubetics is its focus on cross-chain interoperability. The QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is designed to simplify blockchain development, enabling businesses, professionals, and individuals to create decentralized applications (dApps) across multiple blockchain networks. This cross-chain functionality is a game-changer, allowing developers to reach broader audiences without being confined to a single blockchain ecosystem. Cross-border transactions, a critical aspect of global finance, are also made easier with Qubetics. The platform’s interoperability allows for smoother, faster, and more cost-effective international transactions. Whether you’re sending funds across continents or engaging in global business operations, Qubetics helps to eliminate many of the friction points that traditional blockchain systems face when dealing with cross-border payments. As Qubetics moves closer to the end of its presale, analysts are predicting significant returns. With a potential ROI of 240.64% if $TICS reaches $0.25 by the end of the presale, and even higher returns expected after the mainnet launch, Qubetics is shaping up to be one of the best cryptos to buy now . Cronos (CRO): The Heart of Crypto.com’s Ecosystem If you’re looking for a tried-and-true option, Cronos (CRO) is definitely one of the best cryptos to buy now. As the native token of the Crypto.com ecosystem, Cronos has cemented itself as a key player in the blockchain space. The Crypto.com platform has grown exponentially, offering a range of services from buying and selling crypto to staking, lending, and even credit card payments using CRO tokens. The key to Cronos’ success lies in its unique position as a multi-chain crypto network. With its interoperability features, Cronos allows developers to build decentralized applications on the platform while ensuring seamless integration with other networks. This opens up a vast potential market for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, making it an attractive choice for investors seeking exposure to both the growing DeFi sector and the broader cryptocurrency market. For those looking to invest in a coin that has real-world use cases, Cronos provides that in spades. With widespread adoption across the Crypto.com network and a growing number of projects being built on its blockchain, Cronos is in a strong position to continue its upward trajectory. Its multi-chain capabilities also give it a competitive edge over other single-chain platforms, ensuring that it will remain relevant as the blockchain ecosystem continues to evolve. While some cryptocurrencies may still be in their early stages, Cronos has a proven track record. If you’re looking for stability and long-term growth potential, this is definitely one of the best cryptos to buy now. Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance (ASIA): AI Meets Blockchain Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance (ASIA) is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the world of cryptocurrencies. By combining artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, ASIA is creating a new frontier for both industries. The integration of AI into decentralized finance (DeFi) and other blockchain applications is poised to disrupt how we think about digital transactions, smart contracts, and much more. What sets ASIA apart from other projects is its focus on using AI to enhance blockchain functionality. This could lead to the creation of more intelligent and adaptable systems that can optimize transactions, automate processes, and provide personalized services in ways that traditional blockchain platforms cannot. For example, imagine smart contracts that can adjust in real-time based on market conditions or user behavior. That’s the kind of future ASIA is working towards. The best cryptos to buy now aren’t just about investing in today’s technology—they’re about positioning yourself for the future. ASIA’s ambitious vision of integrating AI and blockchain could very well redefine the landscape of digital finance. For early investors, this presents a unique opportunity to get involved with a groundbreaking project that could change the game.

Cross-border transactions, for example, have long been a challenge in the financial world. Traditional banking systems are slow, expensive, and inefficient when it comes to sending money across borders. This is where blockchain technology, and specifically projects like Qubetics, come into play. Qubetics’ ability to facilitate cross-border transactions is one of its standout features. By utilizing cross-chain interoperability, Qubetics enables faster, cheaper, and more efficient international payments. Businesses and individuals can transfer funds without the hassle of high fees, long wait times, or the need for intermediaries.

BTC is struggling and might slip further unless there is a close above $98,800. Bitcoin started a fresh decline below the $98,000 level. The price is trading below $98,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $98,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $98,000 zone. Bitcoin Price Holds Support Bitcoin price failed to continue higher above the $100,500 zone. It started another decline below the $98,500 zone. BTC gained bearish momentum for a move below the $98,000 and $96,000 levels. There was a move below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $91,000 swing low to the $102,500 high. The price even spiked below the $95,500 support level and settled below the 100 hourly Simple moving average . It tested the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $91,000 swing low to the $102,500 high. Bitcoin price is now trading below $98,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $96,750 level. The first key resistance is near the $98,000 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $98,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The next key resistance could be $100,000. A close above the $100,000 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $101,200 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $102,500 level. More Losses In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $98,000 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $96,000 level. The first major support is near the $95,500 level. The next support is now near the $93,700 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $92,000 support in the near term. The main support sits at $91,000.

40138506,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=671515,1739156283,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40138506.jpeg,US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s plans depend on D.O.G.E’s success,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/scott-bessents-plans-depend-on-doge-success/,"Scott Bessent, the new US Treasury Secretary under Trump’s administration, has a monster-sized mission. He’s been handed an economic puzzle that could break all financial markets and the entire global economy if he screws up. Scott’s job is to keep bond yields down, cut down on federal spending without triggering a recession, and somehow deal with the chaos of oil prices, a volatile dollar, and inflation. So Scott’s whole strategy leans heavily on Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, also known as D.O.G.E. Without Elon and his efficiency freaks (as he calls them), Scott’s vision could crumble. According to a Bloomberg report , Scott’s first quarterly funding announcement stayed in line with Janet Yellen’s strategy, focusing on issuing short-term bonds. Analysts expected him to move toward long-term bonds, but he didn’t. Short-term borrowing is Scott’s way of buying time, but the bond market won’t wait forever. Oil prices are a problem Scott can’t ignore President Donald Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” campaign slogan promised to bring inflation down by boosting oil supply, but oil doesn’t behave the way most people think. Cheaper oil doesn’t directly lower real borrowing costs. Traders in inflation-protected securities (TIPS) use energy futures to hedge their bets, which skews how inflation expectations play out in bond markets. Scott knows that even if oil prices drop, it won’t be enough to fix his problems. According to data from Absolute Strategy Research, energy now makes up a much smaller share of overall production costs. Even if oil prices doubled tomorrow, it wouldn’t cause the same economic disaster seen during the energy crises of the 1970s. But pushing oil prices down won’t be easy. Trump’s plan to refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve will boost demand, driving prices up instead of down. And OPEC won’t sit by and let the US flood the market. Scott puts his faith in Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E team Cutting federal spending is where things get messy. According to data from BCA Research, federal spending needs to be reduced by 3.6% to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio. That’s a huge cut, and Congress won’t approve it without a fight. Elon’s D.O.G.E team is targeting waste across multiple departments and making aggressive cuts, but if they fail, Scott would be staring down a financial and economical meltdown. And if Elon cuts too much, he risks triggering a recession. If he cuts too little, we’re gonna face a bond market riot. Anyway, Scott is also steering Trump away from interfering with the Federal Reserve. Trump has said time and time again that he should have more control over interest rate decisions, but at his Senate confirmation hearing, Scott said he knows that would send markets into a panic. Instead, he’s pushing for a more strategic approach—replacing current Fed Chair Jerome Powell with someone the market respects. Former Fed governor Kevin Warsh is the top pick, because according to Scott, he’s experienced, market-friendly, and “unlikely to rock the boat.” Meanwhile, just earlier, president Trump ordered the US Treasury to stop producing pennies, via a post on Truth Social that reads: “For far too long the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents. This is so wasteful! I have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies. Let’s rip the waste out of our great nations budget, even if it’s a penny at a time.” This of course comes amid D.O.G.E’s tensions with the Treasury after he audited and was given access to its data. But unfortunately, a federal judge ruled on Saturday to ban Elon and his team from accessing the Treasury’s data ‘temporarily.’ Scott also faces a dollar problem. Historically, oil prices and the dollar move in opposite directions. When oil prices crash, the dollar tends to rise. It happened in 2014 when OPEC flooded the market, and it happened again in the 1980s after the Iran crisis. But a strong dollar makes imports cheaper, which helps fight inflation, but it also makes US exports less competitive. Trump’s economic vision relies on boosting exports, so you can see why Scott can’t afford a dollar that’s too strong.

With the growing integration of artificial intelligence in the crypto space, this emerging altcoin is gaining traction, promising exciting utilities and innovative features that could revolutionize the DeFi sector. Bearish Sentiment Worries Investors As The Dogecoin Price Declines The Dogecoin price has struggled to maintain momentum in recent days.

In only the last hour, it experienced another dip of 0.8%. This unimpressive Dogecoin price trend suggests the hype surrounding the meme coin has faded. Moreover, with no tangible utility backing the meme coin, investors’ concerns are heightened, and they may consider other alternatives backed by exciting utilities such as WallitIQ (WLTQ). At the time of this writing, Dogecoin price was $0.2619 . WallitIQ (WLTQ): The AI-Powered Altcoin With Attractive Utilities Set To Skyrocket By 69,000% WallitIQ (WLTQ) is reshaping the DeFi space with its one-of-a-kind crypto wallet.

Investors in WallitIQ (WLTQ) can rest easy knowing that their assets are secure.

Additionally, CoinMarketCap has recognized its potential and listed it on its website, further validating its trustworthiness and reliability. The recently unveiled build of WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Crypto Wallet Management mobile App has generated massive buzz in the crypto space. Its unique features have been a major discourse. Unsurprisingly, investors are hyped about its beta platform , which will be launched soon. Investors who want to maximize the features and returns this unique platform offers are prompted to buy its token for only $0.0420 now. Only token holders are guaranteed these groundbreaking features and potential ROIs. Besides, experts are tipping the hottest altcoin currently in the market, WallitIQ (WLTQ), to yield as high as 69,000% returns for early investors when its value skyrockets in the coming days.

This strategic move, which is expected to roll out later this year, will diversify the exchange’s crypto product range and strengthen the country’s digital asset market. The launch follows the success of Bitcoin futures, which were introduced in April 2024. These futures have generated significant trading volume, averaging 5 billion Brazilian Real (approximately $860 million) each month, a testament to the growing interest in crypto trading among Brazilian investors. Gilson Finkelsztain, CEO of B3, confirmed the expansion in an interview and opened up about the exchange’s commitment to staying at the forefront of the cryptocurrency space. The new Bitcoin options, along with ETH and SOL futures, are expected to attract institutional and retail traders alike, offering more flexibility and hedging opportunities within the rapidly evolving digital asset market. As the adoption of cryptocurrencies continues to grow, this move positions B3 as a key player in Brazil’s crypto ecosystem.

ETH is now moving lower and might slip further toward the $2,320 support. Ethereum started a fresh decline below the $2,700 level. The price is trading below $2,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,680 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if it stays below the $2,700 level. Ethereum Price Recovery Fades Ethereum price started a recovery wave above the $2,650 level, like Bitcoin . ETH was able to surpass the $2,700 and $2,750 resistance levels to move into a short-term positive zone. However, the bears were active above $2,800 and the price started another decline. There was a move below the $2,720 and $2,700 levels. The price dipped and tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,127 swing low to the $2,923 high. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,680 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,680 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The first major resistance is near the $2,700 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,880 or $2,920. A clear move above the $2,920 resistance might send the price toward the $3,000 resistance. An upside break above the $3,000 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,050 resistance zone or even $3,120 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,700 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,525 level. The first major support sits near the $2,440 zone. A clear move below the $2,440 support might push the price toward the $2,320 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,250 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,120. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

XRP and Solana (SOL) holders are flocking to OFFICIALMAGACOIN, with analysts comparing its growth potential to the early days of crypto’s biggest names. Why OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is Taking Over 1. Explosive Early Adoption Raising $1.5 million in minutes, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is proving to be a high-demand asset, attracting XRP and SOLANA holders who recognize its massive potential. 2.

One meme coin making headlines is Test (TST), a new coin on the Binance Smart Chain. There have been rumors that it’s linked to Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the founder of Binance. But CZ has stepped in to clear things up and address the growing buzz around TST. CZ Sets the Record Straight About TST CZ recently posted online to explain that TST was never officially endorsed by him or Binance. “It was just a test token used in a video tutorial,” he said. Despite his clarification, TST’s popularity only grew. “Every clarification post just made it more viral for whatever reason,” CZ jokes. As for the listing of TST on Binance, CZ explained that he wasn’t involved in the decision. “Exchanges want to list popular coins with high trading volume,” he said. “If your coin is in demand, you don’t need to talk to exchanges. Just focus on your project.” Is CZ Moving Away From Fundamentals? With the rise of meme coins, many wondered if CZ was shifting his focus away from the core principles of crypto. However, CZ made it clear that this was not the case. “I’m a builder,” he said. “I always focus on fundamentals.” Does he have any interest in meme coins? CZ said he hasn’t bought any. “I haven’t bought a single meme coin yet,” he confirmed. He also said that just because he’s not into meme coins, it doesn’t mean he’s against them. “I’ve worked hard to support many altcoins and the crypto industry as a whole, and I have the same view on meme coins.” Why Are Meme Coins So Popular? So why are meme coins like TST becoming so popular, especially compared to utility tokens? CZ had a few thoughts on this. He pointed out that in recent years, regulators have cracked down on utility tokens, calling them securities, which led some people to turn to meme coins as a safer option. He also explained that meme coins are harder to value, which makes them attractive to speculators. “Things with clear value are harder to speculate on,” he said. “Memes are fun, and there’s a whole community around them.”",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BNB|EXCHANGE|TRADING|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-10 03:55:55

Coin value dipped to a low of $598.6 over the last 24 hours. Overall, the currency value decreased by 2.39% on the day. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins to hold them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $5,472.04 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB down? BNB’s price decreased over the last 24 hours, above the support at $579.1. Sellers stepped in to sell the assets; moreover, the support floor at that level seems unstable because bears have mostly dominated in the past weeks, whereas the coin is still trading on the balanced end of its daily price range. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including Wallet Investor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another additional factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2028, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $5,331.19 by 2031.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coinmarketcap Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but stepped down to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In February 2025, BNB is trading near the psychological mark of $670, just below the January prices.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|MARKET|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-10 04:04:01

On Feb. 10, the Central African Republic made an unexpected move by announcing the launch of its own memecoin, CAR. The announcement came directly from the official X account of President Faustin-Archange Touadéra, who described the project as an experiment aimed at uniting people, supporting national development, and putting CAR in the global spotlight. Today, we are launching $CAR – an experiment designed to show how something as simple as a meme can unite people, support national development, and put the Central African Republic on the world stage in a unique way.

He linked the initiative to the country’s previous pro-crypto stance, noting that he was the second world leader to adopt Bitcoin ( BTC ) as legal tender.

Within hours, its valuation surged as traders rushed to participate in what was seen as the first-ever national memecoin. However, while the idea of a government-backed meme coin generated huge interest, skepticism quickly followed. Within hours, deepfake allegations, website suspensions, and questionable domain registrations began casting doubt on the project.

The announcement and immediate red flags Skepticism over the memecoin emerged after AI detection tools analyzed the president’s announcement video. One deepfake detection model, Seferbekov, found an 82% probability that the video was AI-generated, while another, Ensemble, also flagged it as suspicious. However, two other AI tools, Avatrify and Deepware’s checker, did not detect signs of manipulation. The controversy deepened when the memecoin’s official X account, created to provide updates on the project, was suspended without explanation. Hours later, the president’s X account acknowledged the suspension and stated that they were working with X to restore it. We are working with @X to get @CARMeme_News back as soon as possible.

He noted that the car.meme domain was registered on “Namecheap”, a budget-friendly domain provider, only three days before the announcement—a move he described as highly uncharacteristic for a government-backed initiative. ‼️ CT and my crew be cautious about $CAR domain registered on namecheap 3 days ago… does not look like what president or a country would do… do not let liquidity be sucked out from the ecosystem… NFA – I could be very well wrong… but 🚩 pic.twitter.com/KnDaIywTXl — Yokai Ryujin (@YokaiCapital) February 9, 2025 Shortly after, Namecheap suspended the website, confirming that it had been flagged as an “abusive service.” We have suspended the abusive service.

However, as of this writing on Feb. 10, the token’s value has dropped to $460 million. The timing of this controversy is crucial, as the crypto world has recently seen a spike in fraudulent meme coin launches. Just a few days ago, scammers hijacked the X accounts of former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and Solana DEX aggregator Jupiter to promote fraudulent memecoins. The similarities in tactics—unexpected high-profile endorsements, rapid website takedowns, and sudden social media suspensions—have led many to believe that CAR might be another high-profile deception. However, at this stage, there is no clear confirmation on whether CAR is an official government-backed initiative or an elaborate scam.

Some look at Ripple pushing XRP or at Cardano driving ADA, while a new contender named Remittix sparks interest with big remittance benefits. Below, we explore how these three compare, especially as a pro-crypto stance from figures like Trump spurs fresh enthusiasm. Ripple and Cardano Under Pressure Recent data shows Ripple trading near $2.41, losing about -15% over the week. Despite dips, fans of Ripple (XRP) note its strong cross-border aims. Even so, progress sometimes slows due to legal or market shifts. Meanwhile, Cardano sits near $0.6991, dropping -19.66%. Enthusiasts of Cardano (ADA) point to its evolving governance and eco-friendly staking, though some watchers say it needs more tangible adoption. Both Ripple and Cardano have big communities, but people still debate the best crypto pick this cycle. If a pro-crypto policy from leaders like Trump ushers in easier rules, either could rebound. Yet the question remains: do they solve major finance problems right now, or do they rely on partial updates? The search for real solutions leads many to check out a coin called Remittix instead. Remittix Surges with Global Focus A fresh star on Ethereum, Remittix leaps ahead by tackling expensive wire fees. Known as Remittix (RTX) , it trades around $0.0567, soaring +300% since presale. Some experts say it mirrors an early Ripple, but with simpler everyday aims. While Cardano (ADA) expands slowly, Remittix cuts costs for freelancers and families sending money worldwide an instant draw for real adoption. Supporters claim Remittix might overtake older networks if more unbanked users adopt it. Because it addresses immediate pain points, Remittix (RTX) can see faster growth than coins waiting on brand appeal. Observers consider it a top contender for the best crypto pick this cycle, shining in practical finance uses. That direct approach is why many compare it to early Ripple before the hype. Why Remittix Could Grab the Altcoin Crown Analysts say coins solving daily money hurdles often rise the quickest. While Ripple (XRP) depends on bank deals, and Cardano (ADA) invests in advanced governance, Remittix (RTX) meets routine transfer needs right away. People paying large fees for cross-border moves see how Remittix can save them time and cash. This advantage could push Remittix beyond the typical altcoin race and label it the best crypto pick this cycle. Because Remittix aims for widespread use, it may outshine projects that rely heavily on image or slow updates. If more users adopt it for cheap remittances, Remittix (RTX) could dethrone older coins. Trump’s pro-crypto signals might open new doors for fast-moving tokens, meaning an upstart like Remittix can capture the limelight. Many watchers now expect Remittix to outpace both Ripple and Cardano, taking this cycle’s altcoin crown. Conclusion Though Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) remain major names, a fresh contender like Remittix (RTX) may claim the top spot in the coming months. By offering quick, low-cost remittances, Remittix stands as the best crypto pick this cycle, solving core finance issues rather than waiting on brand or slow upgrades. As interest in pro-crypto policies grows, Remittix could easily surpass older networks, proving that useful tech and mainstream appeal often lead to the greatest success.

These changes have altered how digital assets are governed and exchanged, and beyond regulatory compliance, this transformation also affects how liquidity and risk are provided and managed, respectively. United States regulators are moving forward with clearer and broader regulatory frameworks for crypto trading. Industry participants have shown maturity, negotiating with relevant authorities to create operational yet viable frameworks. CLS Global is one such player. The top market-making company recently reached a settlement agreement with US authorities on all things regulatory-related. Through this, CLS Global reaffirms its dedication to utmost regulatory compliance by engaging with the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) and other authorities. It doesn’t end there; the market-making company is implementing strict measures and enhancing its service locations to comply with applicable regulations. Traditional markets are not left out. They are experiencing a significant change in models, no thanks to the competition with DeFi protocols for centralized trading avenues. Liquidity providers in the hybrid market face similar challenges; the existence of new trading venues combining DeFi and CeFi capabilities and the growing demand for cross-venue liquidity aggregation. Demand for Infrastructure that Closely Resembles Traditional Markets While Bitcoin’s price movements have garnered attention globally, the underlying and, most times, diminutive changes in how trades are executed are more important. Per an analysis report, there’s a demand for infrastructure that resembles traditional markets and their services, some of which include sophisticated algorithm execution, prime brokerage services, and credit networks. Despite the exponential growth of the industry, technical challenges such as the aforementioned remain. Speaking on this, CLS Global’s CEO, Filipp V, revealed that the next phase of the industry will depend mainly on bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems. The industry’s next phase will be defined by how effectively we bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems. Market makers capable of navigating both landscapes while upholding strong compliance standards will play a key role in shaping the future of digital asset trading, the CEO states. Navigating Financial and Technical Complexities The dynamic nature of the crypto landscape requires a fundamental rethink of existing market-making strategies as well as the incorporation of new features. Some of these include cross-venue inventory management, dynamic risk pricing across multiple blockchains, integration of on-chain and off-chain liquidity sources, and real-time adaptation to settlement finality conditions. As the United States regulatory parameters continue to cover emerging trends and markets, new changes are imminent, meaning that market makers must adapt. Market-making companies will need to evolve and leverage varying forms of automated market-making strategies that merge traditional DeFi features, settlement mechanisms, and advanced cross-chain liquidity provision protocols. CLS Global, as one of the leading market making firms, has demonstrated its commitment to regulatory compliance while providing comprehensive trading solutions and liquidity services to institutional clients globally. CLS Global’s settlement agreement with US authorities and the ongoing development of revolutionary trading strategies puts it at the driver’s seat of this new era of market-making. The company is merging powerful trading algorithms and an extensive liquidity network to deliver CEX solutions. The future of the digital assets market will be shaped by companies that successfully navigate both the technical and financial complexities of the crypto landscape, CLS Global aims to be one.",Information,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|BTC|REGULATION|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-10 04:59:36

Additionally, Kentucky recently became the 16th US state to propose a Bitcoin reserve, which fueled speculation about a potential global BTC accumulation race. Michael Saylor Teases More Bitcoin Purchases Michael Saylor, co-founder of the newly rebranded ”Strategy,” once again hinted at another Bitcoin acquisition after a quick one-week pause in the company’s aggressive BTC accumulation. The tech executive shared his usual Sunday Bitcoin chart post on X, cryptically stating, ”Death to the blue lines. Long live the green dots,” which many believe is a signal for an impending BTC purchase. According to SaylorTracker, Strategy currently holds 471,107 BTC, which is valued at around $45.3 billion. The company still seems very steadfast in its Bitcoin accumulation strategy, integrating BTC deeper into its corporate treasury approach despite the stock experiencing sideways price action. On Feb. 5, MicroStrategy officially rebranded to ”Strategy,” and adopted the Bitcoin logo as well as a Bitcoin-inspired color scheme to better align with its corporate vision. According to CEO Phong Le, the company is innovating in two of the most transformative technologies of the 21st century, which is Bitcoin and artificial intelligence. He believes the company’s new name powerfully reflects the firm’s global appeal. The rebrand announcement coincided with the company’s Q4 2024 earnings call, where it reported $120.7 million in revenue from its software business, which was a 3% year-over-year decline. Additionally, the company recorded a $640 million loss for the quarter. Despite this, Strategy is still very committed to its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition plan, and Q4 2024 was its largest quarter in terms of BTC purchases after adding more than 195,000 BTC during that period. Strategy’s Bitcoin treasury reserve growth (Source: Strategy ) The company outlined multiple bullish catalysts for Bitcoin in 2025, including a potential regulatory framework for digital assets in the US, increased political support for BTC, enhancements to existing Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and broader institutional adoption. Strategy’s stoc k is currently trading at approximately $327 per share, but this is a near 40% decline from its all-time high of around $543 that was recorded in November of 2024. University of Austin Bets Big on Bitcoin The University of Austin is also making a bold move into the world of Bitcoin by launching a pioneering investment fund . The university plans to raise a Bitcoin fund worth more than $5 million as part of its broader $200 million endowment. According to Chun Lai, the foundation’s chief investment officer, the institution is very eager to avoid being left behind as cryptocurrency's potential continues to materialize. This initiative is happening at a time when there is a growing trend of academic institutions showing interest in Bitcoin. Just a few months ago, a regulatory filing revealed that Emory University accumulated more than $15 million worth of Bitcoin through Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin ETF, which made it the first US university endowment to publicly report Bitcoin ETF holdings. The increasing institutional participation in Bitcoin ETFs has the potential to greatly impact the asset’s price, when considering the huge amount of capital these institutions manage. The University of Austin’s approach includes a long-term Bitcoin holding strategy, with a minimum investment period of five years. Chad Thevenot, the university’s senior vice president for advancement, firmly believes in Bitcoin’s long-term value, and even compared it to traditional assets like stocks and real estate. This perspective is very similar to the broader institutional shift towards digital assets as a legitimate and strategic component of diversified portfolios. Beyond educational institutions and traditional financial players, the rise of crypto adoption is also influencing retirement funds. A recent Bitget Research report pointed out a shift in attitudes among younger generations, with up to 20% of Gen Z and Generation Alpha expressing openness to receiving pensions in cryptocurrency. The survey also found that 78% of respondents showed a preference for alternative retirement savings over conventional pension funds, which indicates a more broader shift towards decentralized finance and blockchain-based solutions. Bitget CEO Gracy Chen described these findings as a wake-up call for the financial industry, especially as younger generations demand more modern solutions that offer greater control, flexibility, and transparency. Additionally, the report also revealed that as of January 2025, 40% of people in these demographics already invested in cryptocurrency. (Source: Bitget ) The University of Austin’s initiative proves that there is a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s role in long-term investment strategies, and could very likely set a precedent for other institutions to follow suit. Whether through university endowments or retirement funds, digital assets are becoming an integral part of the future financial ecosystem. Is a Global Bitcoin Accumulation Race About to Begin? Meanwhile, the growing number of Bitcoin reserve proposals in the United States started speculation about a possible global accumulation race, as early adopters could benefit from the cryptocurrency’s long-term monetary incentives. Kentucky recently became the 16th US state to introduce legislation that is aimed at establishing a Bitcoin reserve, which will allocate up to 10% of excess state reserves into digital assets. The move is part of the broader shift toward Bitcoin as a mainstream reserve asset, driven by increasing institutional and national-level adoption. According to Isaac Joshua , CEO of crypto startup platform Gems Launchpad, if Kentucky’s bill is approved, it could set off a domino effect that pushes other states and even nations to follow suit. He believes that once a single state officially adopts Bitcoin in its reserves, others will feel the pressure to do the same. Some of the world’s largest asset managers have already taken steps in this direction, with US spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively holding over 5.91% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, which is worth approximately $113.5 billion. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF alone accounts for almost half of these holdings. With Bitcoin ETFs continuing to see steady inflows, market analysts predict that Bitcoin could soon reach new all-time highs. In 2024, US Bitcoin ETFs contributed roughly 75% of new investments into Bitcoin, and became a key driver behind BTCs climb past $50,000 in mid-February. Bitcoin ETF stats (Source: Due Analytics ) Despite the growing momentum for Bitcoin reserve proposals , there are still some regulatory hurdles to overcome. James Wo, founder and CEO of venture capital firm DFG, pointed out that while the idea of an accumulation race is compelling, Kentucky’s bill is still just a proposal and has not yet been passed. He also mentioned concerns over Bitcoin’s volatility and strict fiscal policies that could make it difficult for legislators to approve such measures. However, if enough states successfully implement Bitcoin reserve policies, it could pave the way for discussions about a potential federal Bitcoin reserve in the future. States considering Bitcoin reserves (Source: Bitcoinlaws ) Kentucky’s proposal was submitted after similar initiatives from 15 other states, including Arizona, Alabama, Florida, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Kansas, and Wyoming. However, Bitcoin’s volatility is still a key point of debate. During the 2022 bear market, Bitcoin saw a sharp 64% correction, while the 2018 downturn resulted in a 73% decline. Nevertheless, Bitcoin has delivered an average return of over 1,077% over the past five years.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|TRADING|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-10 05:01:55

While the broader crypto market remains volatile, XRP is currently in a corrective phase, and there’s no clear indication of a major move upward for now. The price is stuck within a narrow range, with support and resistance levels dictating its short-term direction. At the time of writing, XRP is down by more than three percent and is trading at $2.39. XRP Faces Resistance at Key Levels The most critical resistance level for XRP is between $2.51 and $2.72, which represents the 50% to 88.7% retracement area. For bulls to regain control and start pushing prices higher, they need to break above this zone. As of now, it’s the bears who seem to dominate, as the price is correcting after a previous rally that saw XRP rise from a low of around $2.10 to a high of $2.80 . This correction, while expected, suggests that the bears are currently in charge, pushing the price lower. The latest bounce from the 50% retracement level appears corrective, indicating that the upward move might not be sustainable just yet. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Time to Buy XRP? Expert Reveals Key Insights , Potential Scenarios for XRP: A Range-Bound Market XRP is currently stuck within a defined range, and for now, support levels established over the weekend remain in play. This support, which was defined at key Fibonacci levels, has held strong so far. However, this consolidation phase can’t last forever. A breakout, either to the upside or downside, is expected soon. If the bulls can push past the resistance at $2.80, the next target would be a breakout above the Monday high, which could indicate that the corrective phase is over and a new rally could begin. However, the current trend points toward the possibility of another dip, potentially down to $2.11 or even $1.95 before any further upward momentum. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This triggered a serious panic in the market and is now following a strong negative bias. ADA’s overall market remains bullish on the macro level, but the trend is subjected to a downward slope following a back-to-back drop in the past month. The asset is now considered bearish on a short-term trend. Meanwhile, the last two weeks saw the asset through its biggest drop as it broke down from the $0.8 level to $0.5 – this marked its lowest price for the first time in three months. After a long-wick rejection, the bears showed up again and continued to mount pressure on a daily scale. Though the pressure is not much at the moment. The recent rejection suggested an exhaustion in selling. A rise in the selling volume could cause more dips in the future. If this week’s low holds well as support, we can expect a pushback to the broken level before deciding which direction to go next. At the time of writing, there is no sign of recovery as the price continued to drop. While this market is still under the bears’ radar, we may see a deeper retracement in the next few days. A hold above it should fuel a fresh buy in the market ADA’s Key Levels to Watch Source: Tradingview While ADA is negotiating $0.69, there’s support at $0.6. If it reclaims this week’s $0.5 low, the price may break lower to $0.43 and $0.36. If by any chance a bounce occurs, the potential resistance level for a buy would be $0.765, followed by $0.86. A push above it could bring us to $0.988. The next level for an increase would be $1.152.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/whales-grab-520-million-xrp-heres-the-significance/,"Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted significant XRP accumulation by large holders, commonly called “whales,” during a market dip. According to Martinez, whales purchased 520 million XRP during this period, indicating strategic buying behavior amid price fluctuations. This development has sparked discussions within the crypto community about market dynamics, institutional influence, and price manipulation in the digital asset space. Whales seized the opportunity during the recent dip, buying 520 million $XRP ! pic.twitter.com/v2Lu4uBMgm — Ali (@ali_charts) February 6, 2025 Whale Accumulation and Market Trends Martinez’s observation aligns with historical patterns where large holders capitalize on price drops to accumulate more XRP. This behavior often suggests confidence in the asset’s long-term potential and reflects a strategy commonly used in traditional and crypto markets. The accompanying chart in Martinez’s post illustrates the inverse relationship between whale holdings and price movement, reinforcing the idea that institutional buyers position themselves strategically. A notable factor in these market movements is the role of over-the-counter (OTC) sales and algorithmic trading. According to one X user, Nebulous, institutional players leverage these tools to execute large trades without significantly impacting market prices. Institutions can absorb substantial liquidity without triggering dramatic price spikes by acquiring XRP through OTC transactions. Institutional Influence and Market Behavior The discussion surrounding whale accumulation extends beyond XRP and touches on broader market trends in crypto. As traditional financial entities, including banks and investment funds , increase participation in crypto markets, price behavior becomes more aligned with traditional financial markets like stocks and futures. Nebulous argues that large players manipulate price movements by strategically driving prices higher to attract retail traders before reversing the trend to trigger panic selling. This cycle enables institutions to accumulate assets at lower prices and repeat the process, gradually increasing their holdings without overpaying. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The user also differentiates crypto and stock market trading patterns, emphasizing that institutional traders follow strict timing strategies based on global market openings. While crypto operates 24/7, institutional money is often in sync with traditional financial markets, particularly during key trading hours in the U.S., U.K., and Asia. This observation suggests that crypto traders can benefit from analyzing stock market behaviors to anticipate potential price movements in digital assets. Implications for Retail Traders The growing presence of institutional investors introduces opportunities and challenges for retail traders. Increased liquidity and mainstream adoption can drive long-term value appreciation for assets like XRP . On the other hand, institutional strategies may lead to heightened volatility, requiring retail participants to adopt more sophisticated trading approaches. Nebulous points out that institutional buying often leaves visible “price and time signatures” in market data, which traders can analyze to identify potential accumulation or distribution phases. Understanding these patterns can help retail traders navigate market fluctuations and make informed decisions rather than reacting emotionally to price swings. Retail traders looking to stay competitive in this environment may benefit from studying institutional trading patterns, monitoring OTC activity, and recognizing key market cycles. As the crypto space matures, such insights will become increasingly valuable in navigating the ever-changing landscape of digital assets.

This happens as the ETH price has seen strong selling pressure in recent weeks with short traders showing no signs of remorse. Analysts are weighing whether ETH could see further downfall or if a short squeeze is in the making. Ethereum Short Positions Paint A Scary Picture Over the past week, the Ethereum short positions have skyrocketed increasing by 40% and a staggering 500% since November 2024. Historically, this is the largest bearish bet on the world’s largest altcoin by Wall Street hedge funds as trader sentiment turns extremely negative. Source: ZeroHedge Earlier this month on February 2, a similar extreme positioning on Ethereum saw ETH price dropping 37% within three days on fears of the Trump trade war. Furthermore, the altcoin has seen robust trading volumes overall. Significant spikes were observed on January 21st, coinciding with Inauguration Day, and again during the February 3rd market crash. Despite the strong activity, ETH’s price has yet to recover from the gap lower, even a week after the downturn. Source: The Kobeissi Letter ETH Price Volatility Ahead? A Make-or-Break Situation This extreme positioning on Ethereum shows that it could experience strong ETH price volatility moving ahead. The ETH price has largely underperformed the broader crypto market in recent times while other altcoins managed to hit fresh highs. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has identified $2,600 as a critical support level for (ETH). In a recent post, Martinez suggested that if this level holds, Ethereum could gather enough momentum for a significant rebound, potentially pushing the price toward $3,000 or even $4,000. Traders and investors are closely monitoring ETH’s performance at this key threshold. Source: Ali Charts As of press time, Ethereum price is trading 1% down at $2,636 with its market cap at $317 billion and its daily trading volume surging 20% to $19.5 billion. As per the Coinglass data , the 24-hours liquidations have shot to $44.65 million of which $30 million is in long liquidations. Also, the massive movement of 50,000 ETH by the Ethereum Foundation has made investors cautious, as the fund has been selling the altcoin over the past few months. Crypto analyst Ted Pillows has drawn parallels between Ethereum’s recent price action and the market conditions of March 2020. He noted that ETH experienced a similar capitulation back triggering a long-term breakout for the altcoin. “At the time, many believed Ethereum was finished, but it staged a significant comeback,” he noted. Pillows remains optimistic, projecting Ethereum could reach $10,000 this cycle, calling it a “programmed” milestone. Further, the 90% drop in ETH gas fee could also contribute to the rally ahead.

Over three weeks, ETH attracted over $2 billion in new funds, including a record-breaking weekly inflow of $854 million.

Between February 3 and February 7 (Eastern Time), Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded a net inflow of $204 million, while the spot Ethereum ETFs outpaced Bitcoin with a notable net inflow of $420 million during the same period.

With 1,762 BTC and a bold 21,000 BTC target, it’s Asia’s top BTC play. Metaplanet Inc. has become Japan’s fastest-rising stock, surging more than 3,600% over the past 12 months as the country experiences a surge in Bitcoin ( BTC ) demand. Best performing Japanese stocks over the last 12 months | Source: TradingView The company, originally a hotel developer, pivoted to a Bitcoin-first strategy in early 2024 after pandemic-related struggles forced it to close most of its properties. Now, its stock has outperformed every other Japanese equity, attracting waves of retail investors looking for exposure to Bitcoin. The surge comes amid a global shift in sentiment, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of $109,000 on Jan. 20, the day of US President Donald Trump ’s inauguration. While BTC has since pulled back, trading at $97,000 as of this writing on Feb. 10, Metaplanet’s stock has continued to climb, reflecting growing interest in Bitcoin as an investment vehicle. CEO Simon Gerovich, a former Goldman Sachs equity derivatives trader, has drawn comparisons to Michael Saylor’s Strategy , formerly MicroStrategy, which has amassed over $45 billion in Bitcoin. Inspired by Saylor’s approach, Gerovich repositioned Metaplanet as Japan’s version of the American Bitcoin proxy, betting on BTC’s long-term growth. Expansion plans and the future of Metaplanet’s Bitcoin strategy Metaplanet’s transformation has led to a massive influx of investors. In 2024, its shareholder base increased by 500%, reaching nearly 50,000 investors, according to company data. While institutional players such as Capital Group—who also hold shares in Strategy—have taken positions, most of Metaplanet’s investors are retail traders, many with limited experience in crypto markets. A key factor in this retail surge is Japan’s revamped Nippon Individual Savings Account program, which was introduced in early 2024 to encourage long-term investment. Under the program, Japanese citizens can invest in stocks tax-free, making Metaplanet an attractive alternative to direct Bitcoin purchases, which are subject to capital gains taxes of up to 55%. As of the latest figures , Metaplanet holds 1,762 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $171 million at the time. The company has set an ambitious target to grow its holdings to 10,000 Bitcoin by the end of 2025 and 21,000 by the end of 2026. To reach its goal, Metaplanet plans to issue 21 million shares, aiming to raise approximately $750 million, marking the largest equity capital raise for Bitcoin in Asia to date. Beyond Bitcoin accumulation, Metaplanet is also integrating its remaining hotel business into its crypto-focused identity. Later this year, it plans to rebrand its last remaining property, the Royal Oak in Tokyo’s Gotanda district, as “The Bitcoin Hotel.” The hotel will serve as a hub for Bitcoin-related seminars and investor events, aligning with the company’s push to position itself at the center of Japan’s crypto economy. Despite its remarkable growth, Metaplanet faces risks. The company has posted six consecutive years of losses but is expected to report a profit in its upcoming fourth-quarter earnings. Analysts warn that if Bitcoin’s price drops sharply, the firm’s stock could see a sharp reversal, as its valuation is heavily tied to BTC’s performance.",News|Bitcoin|Japan,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ASIA|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-02-10 05:25:33

Analysts predict a bullish wave , especially for heavyweights like Solana and XRP . Meanwhile, the newest contender, Remittix , is fast gaining traction as it continues its presale. Many see this emerging platform as a potential 10x or even 20x gem, given its plan to merge crypto with FIAT in a user-friendly way. Across the board, altcoins have been reclaiming lost ground. Daily trading volumes are rising, and bullish sentiment is returning as more investors re-enter the market. After a wave of regulatory news and macroeconomic shifts, there’s renewed optimism that top altcoins like Solana and XRP will benefit from a broad upswing. With such robust momentum, let’s explore what could propel these three tokens to new heights. Solana: Speed, Scalability, and Surge Recent data shows Solana boasting over 2,000 transactions per second on average though it can theoretically handle up to 65,000 TPS . Transaction costs often remain below $0.001, making it one of the most cost-effective platforms in crypto. Solana’s market capitalization, currently above $98 billion , has rebounded from lows seen last year. Developers praise Solana for its swift transaction speeds and a wide array of DeFi and NFT projects. On-chain metrics highlight a jump in active addresses, reaching over 123 million monthly active users an impressive figure reflecting renewed interest. Thanks to these solid fundamentals and ongoing upgrades, some analysts forecast 10x potential for Solana in the coming bull cycle, driven largely by sustained user growth and innovative dApps. XRP: Overcoming Obstacles, Poised For Growth For a long time, regulatory hurdles created uncertainty for XRP , a token with a market cap hovering around $141 billion and known for its use in cross-border payments. Despite legal battles , XRP has maintained a dedicated global community, with daily trading volumes often surpassing $3.7 billion. Major financial institutions continue to explore solutions using XRP for near-instant settlements, reflecting strong demand for the technology behind Ripple’s network. Following positive developments in ongoing legal cases, investor sentiment around XRP has improved markedly. This has led to renewed predictions of a possible 20x upside if widespread adoption continues and the token’s utility for international transfers sees broader institutional uptake. Should the regulatory landscape turn more favorable, the stage could be set for an even bigger rally. Remittix: The Fastest Growing Crypto Presale At the center of all this excitement is Remittix, a project currently in presale at Remittix has quickly earned a reputation for merging digital assets with FIAT in a cost-efficient way. By allowing users to send crypto and deliver FIAT to any bank account worldwide, Remittix addresses a key gap in the market bridging the convenience of traditional banking with the speed and innovation of blockchain. Consider Michael, a freelance web designer in South America who just completed a contract for a client in Europe. Typically, high remittance fees and bank delays would reduce his earnings. With Remittix, Michael can receive payment in crypto, then convert those funds to FIAT and deposit them straight into his bank account with minimal fees and near-instant processing. This real-world application of blockchain solutions sets Remittix apart from speculative tokens lacking tangible utility. Remittix aims to raise $36m, making it one of the fastest-growing opportunities in today’s market. Some experts predict a 30x potential once it officially launches, bolstered by the platform’s seamless integration of crypto with traditional finance. If you’re eager to join its presale, head over to Remittix but act quickly, as tokens are selling at a rapid pace. Remittix Set to Steal the Spotlight While Solana and XRP look primed for a bullish wave , Remittix has emerged as the most exciting prospect for investors seeking the next breakout star. Its real-world focus bridging crypto and FIAT coupled with a fast-moving presale suggests a game-changing advantage over traditional tokens. With expert forecasts of 10x , 20x , or even 30x gains, Remittix stands poised to grab the limelight. Join the presale now to secure your share before it closes, and don’t forget to connect with the Remittix community. As the altcoin rally heats up, this dynamic newcomer could very well redefine how the world views crypto and cross-border finance.

Coinbase’s assets under management (AUM) have surpassed those of major US banks, highlighting the growing influence of crypto exchanges in traditional finance. Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has uncovered significant inefficiencies in government spending, sparking discussions about the role blockchain technology could play in enhancing transparency. Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Saves Taxpayers $36.7 Billion, Sparks Blockchain Transparency Debate Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has delivered a significant financial breakthrough for the US government, saving taxpayers a staggering $36.7 billion in just a few weeks. This development has reignited discussions among cryptocurrency and blockchain leaders about leveraging decentralized technology to enhance transparency in government spending. According to data from Doge-tracker, the savings account for just 1.8% of Musk’s ambitious goal to slash US government spending by up to $2 trillion. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO unveiled his cost-cutting vision during an interview with political strategist Mark Penn on Jan. 9, highlighting his commitment to fiscal responsibility and government accountability. Musk’s initiative has gained widespread applause from the crypto community. Coinbase co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong expressed his support in a Feb. 9 social media post, praising the DOGE program’s progress and urging further government transparency. “Great progress DOGE,” Armstrong wrote on X, joining other industry voices in advocating for blockchain-based solutions to improve public financial oversight. Blockchain technology has long been touted as a tool for increased transparency in financial systems, thanks to its decentralized nature and publicly verifiable ledgers. By integrating blockchain into government financial operations, transactions could become more accountable and verifiable in real time. A blockchain-powered treasury system could also introduce a more democratic approach to budget allocations. Some experts propose the implementation of mandatory spending proposals, wherein expenditures would require public voting approval before being executed. This approach, they argue, would significantly reduce inefficiencies and corruption in government finance. In a separate development, Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency uncovered a startling $100 billion annual loophole in US government spending. According to Musk, this sum was distributed as entitlement payments to individuals lacking Social Security numbers or valid temporary identity numbers, raising serious concerns over potential fraud. “When I asked if anyone at Treasury had a rough guess for what percentage of that number is unequivocal and obvious fraud, the consensus in the room was about half, so $50B/year or $1B/week!! This is utterly insane and must be addressed immediately,” Musk wrote in a Feb. 8 X post. Following this revelation, DOGE and the US Treasury reached a joint agreement aimed at introducing stricter auditing criteria and enhancing financial oversight. One of the key measures includes mandating payment categorization codes, which Musk claims were often left blank in previous transactions, making audits nearly impossible. Additionally, all payments must now include a detailed rationale explaining the necessity of each expenditure. Another major reform is the overhaul of the government’s “DO-NOT-PAY” list, which currently undergoes annual updates. Under Musk’s proposal, the list of flagged entities will be updated weekly or even daily to prevent fraudulent transactions from slipping through the cracks. Musk’s Vision for Blockchain in Government Finance Musk’s cost-cutting initiative has drawn attention from crypto and blockchain advocates who argue that his transparency-driven policies could pave the way for a blockchain-integrated US Treasury. Jean Rausis, co-founder of decentralized finance platform Smardex, believes that embracing blockchain technology could position the US as a global leader in financial innovation. “While it’s hard to say which blockchain would be up to the task, the important thing is that it is permissionless. Otherwise, the promised transparency would be just a sham. But if the US Treasury embraces decentralized infrastructure, this could be a catalyst for the Web2 and Web3 worlds to start merging,” Rausis said in a recent interview. The idea of moving government spending to blockchain has long been debated, with proponents citing benefits such as fraud prevention, auditability, and cost efficiency. By leveraging decentralized networks, public financial data could be easily accessible, ensuring that citizens have real-time visibility into where their tax dollars are going. Since its official website launch on Jan. 21, DOGE has already generated massive savings for US taxpayers, demonstrating the effectiveness of Musk’s cost-cutting strategies. However, the program is only in its early stages, with a long-term objective of reducing government bureaucracy and inefficiencies. According to Musk, DOGE’s work is set to conclude on July 4, 2026, aligning with the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. By that time, the goal is to establish a “smaller government with more efficiency and less bureaucracy.” Musk’s efforts to reshape US government spending could have far-reaching implications beyond fiscal policy. If blockchain technology is adopted at the federal level, it may signal a paradigm shift in how governments worldwide manage finances. As the crypto industry continues to push for financial transparency, Musk’s initiatives may serve as a proving ground for the integration of blockchain into public administration. Whether or not his vision materializes, one thing remains clear: the debate over government spending and financial transparency is far from over. Coinbase's $420 Billion AUM Surpasses Major US Banks, Showcasing Crypto’s Growing Dominance In related news, Coinbase , the third-largest centralized cryptocurrency exchange (CEX) by trading volume, is now managing over $420 billion worth of digital assets on behalf of its users, a figure that positions it ahead of major financial institutions in the United States. According to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, this staggering assets under management (AUM) figure makes Coinbase more valuable than the 21st largest bank in the country. In a Feb. 7 post on X, Armstrong drew a comparison between Coinbase’s AUM and traditional banking institutions, highlighting the platform’s rapid expansion. “If you think of Coinbase like a bank, we now hold about $0.42T in assets for our customers, which would make us the 21st largest bank in the US by total assets, and growing,” he wrote in the post. Armstrong further noted that if Coinbase were classified as a brokerage firm instead of a bank, it would rank as the eighth-largest brokerage firm in the US by AUM. This comparison signals the cryptocurrency exchange’s increasing relevance in the financial sector, especially as more investors and institutions turn to digital assets. Coinbase’s $420 billion in assets under management is more than three times the $112.9 billion controlled by New York Community Bancorp (NYCB), currently the 21st largest bank in the US. NYCB, which acquired the now-defunct Signature Bank in 2023—a crypto-friendly bank that collapsed in the wake of regulatory scrutiny—recently posted a $260 million loss for the fourth quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, Coinbase turned a profit of $273 million in Q4 2024, marking its first profitable quarter since late 2021. This milestone reinforces the notion that crypto platforms are increasingly outperforming traditional financial institutions in the digital era. Brian Armstrong envisions a future where crypto-driven financial services consolidate into one primary financial account, replacing the fragmented nature of traditional banking and brokerage services. “With crypto, the line between these categories is blurring. In the updated financial system, you will have a single primary financial account which serves all these functions. A greater percentage of global GDP will run on more efficient crypto rails over time,” Armstrong explained. Removing Crypto’s Friction Points for Mainstream Adoption Despite the massive growth in AUM and adoption, Armstrong and other industry leaders acknowledge that crypto still faces several barriers before achieving mass adoption. Coinbase’s Senior Director of Engineering, Chintan Turakhia, speaking at EthCC, highlighted key friction points that must be addressed before the next wave of users can fully integrate crypto into their financial lives. “If our goal is to bring in the next billion users—and let’s start with just 100 million—we have to take all those friction points out, ” Turakhia said. Some of the most pressing challenges he identified include: Complicated wallet setup: Users still struggle with seed phrases and the technical requirements of self-custody wallets. Transaction fees: High and unpredictable gas fees make transactions expensive and inconvenient. Blockchain-native tokens: Many users find it difficult to purchase and use blockchain-native tokens like ETH, SOL, or MATIC to interact with decentralized applications (dApps). Coinbase’s increasing AUM suggests a growing institutional and retail trust in digital assets as a viable alternative to traditional banking. With continued technological improvements, regulatory developments, and mainstream financial integrations, Coinbase could climb even higher in the rankings of the largest financial institutions. As traditional banks struggle with liquidity issues and regulatory hurdles, crypto platforms like Coinbase are positioning themselves as the next generation of financial powerhouses—ones that operate on decentralized, transparent, and borderless financial rails. With Armstrong’s vision of a single, crypto-powered financial ecosystem, the industry may soon witness a new era of financial dominance, one where digital assets drive the bulk of global economic activity. Coinbase's meteoric rise in AUM solidifies its role as a major player in global finance, outpacing even well-established US banks. As cryptocurrency adoption accelerates, the lines between banks, brokerages, and digital asset platforms are becoming increasingly blurred. The coming years will determine whether Coinbase—and the broader crypto industry—can fully replace or integrate into the traditional financial system.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|DOGE|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-10 05:30:00

Making an allocation to the right tokens can have a transformative effect on portfolio size and could make the difference between mediocre profits and generational wealth over the coming months. Experts have identified the following small-cap tokens as the most bullish projects in the crypto space right now. Plume, Telcoin, Comedian, Rollblock and Kava are all expected to rally magnificently this year, although Rollblock ($RBLK) stands out with predictions of a 50x rally in 2025 as it comes to dominate the crypto gaming sector. Rollblock ($RBLK): The Future of Blockchain-Backed Gaming Ramps Up Adoption Rollblock ($ RBLK ) is superbly well-positioned to benefit from the massive popularity of crypto gaming. With its genius move of securing each transaction and payout on the Ethereum blockchain, Rollblock has stamped out one of the major pain points for the $500 billion gaming industry, as now gamers have all the tools they need to verify for themselves that no shady manipulation has taken place behind the scenes. December was a huge month for Rollblock, resulting in an incredible 600% surge in new registrations on the platform . Rollblock has an impressive lineup of more than 7000 games alongside a sports prediction league that allows gamers to place bets across thousands of live fixtures and events. Rollblock allocates 30% of its profits toward buying back $RBLK, with 60% of these tokens immediately burned to reduce the overhanging supply, while 40% is used to fund staking rewards of up to 30%. This results in a drastic reduction in selling pressure, as the vast majority of these purchased tokens will never see the light of day again. Stage 10 $RBLK tokens are currently selling rapidly for the discounted price of $0.053. As its adoption continues to grow this year and its user base continues to swell, Rollblock could easily become a breakout project that sees its early adopters enjoy returns of more than 50x this year. Plume ($PLUME) Delivers Real-World Tokenization With Multiple Partnerships Plume gained 3.9% today to reach $0.11. The last seven days of trading have seen the price of Plume plummet by 31% as it was unable to hold its value above $0.16. Plume is one of the brightest stars in the RWA (real-world asset) niche, building out its ecosystem with 180 partners and 3.5 million active wallets. Plume recently completed a successful real-world airdrop, ensuring a fair distribution of its $PLUME tokens across the RWA community. This resulted in users of Ondo, Polymarket, and World Liberty Financial Gaming receiving generous allocations to Plume. Plume uses cutting-edge Skylink technology to bring together RWA hubs and deliver yield to its community members. Plume could easily reach the $1 level this quarter. Telcoin ($TEL): Disrupting Payments with Blockchain Telcoin has fallen by 3.2% in the last 24 hours as its price finds support at $0.0065. Telcoin is one of the few tokens to have had a positive month of price action, returning more than 21% as the Telcoin price has risen from $0.005. The Telcoin market cap is still comparatively small at just $602 million, giving Telcoin a place at 210 in the crypto rankings. Telcoin recently became the first federally regulated digital asset depository bank in the United States. Telcoin outlined its plans to issue dollar-backed stablecoins ($eUSD). Telcoin’s stablecoins will ensure secure storage and integrate seamlessly with traditional finance. Telcoin has assured the Nebraska Department of Banking and Finance that it will maintain liquid assets in US dollars equal to the complete value of any stablecoins that are issued on Telcoin. Telcoin is a strong contender for mass adoption as it will bring massively reduced fees for its near-instant transactions. Telcoin could easily reach $0.06 in 2025. Comedian ($BAN) Satirical Meme Coin with Serious Potential Comedian ($BAN) is gaining massive hype as the next big meme coin in crypto. Comedian offers rapid transactions for close to $0 fees and has seen huge adoption recently with its fun community-driven ecosystem. Comedian takes its inspiration from Cattelan’s artwork of a banana that was infamously purchased by Tron CEO Justin Sun. It takes a humorous swipe at the meme coin industry while capturing the mischievous spirit of the original artwork. Comedian has gained an astonishing 92% in the last seven days to trade at $0.063 at the time of writing. The market cap of Comedian is currently just above $63 million, securing Comedian a place at 469 in the crypto top 500. Meme coins such as Comedian are notoriously volatile and prone to wild swings in either direction. Comedian could deliver explosive gains if it continues to gain traction during Q1. Kava ($KAVA) Brings AI Compatibility to Blockchain Kava has gained 3.7% this week to trade at $0.46. In the last month, the price of Kava has fallen by 3% as it was unable to follow through on its recent rally. Kava is based on the Cosmos blockchain and is taking great leaps toward integrating artificial intelligence into its blockchain tech. On the 13th of January, the Kava network published the DeAI light paper, which outlined its roadmap to transform Kava into a decentralized AI project. This will involve removing any kind of centralized control over AI systems, ensuring ongoing data privacy on-chain, and collaborating with global leaders in the industry. Kava is ideally designed to handle the specific computational demands of AI, including decentralized storage and smart contracts for AI agents. Given that AI is such a fast-growing sector of the crypto economy, Kava looks set to trade over $3 in Q1 if it can deliver on its ambitious plans. Rollblock Will See a Meteoric Rise This Year Plume, Telcoin, Comedian, and Kava will likely see extraordinary upside in 2025, but Rollblock ($RBLK) stands out as the ultimate Web3 investment at this time. With its deflationary tokenomics and massive user growth, Rollblock could easily deliver the biggest gains of the year—potentially up to 50x or more.

These Cryptos Could Be the Biggest Movers of 2025!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-to-500k-these-cryptos-could-be-the-biggest-movers-of-2025/,"Could THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN Be the Key to $555K? Bitcoin (BTC) changed the lives of early investors with its groundbreaking returns, and Ethereum (ETH) reshaped the crypto world with its smart contracts. Now, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN , a new coin, is being called the next big opportunity for exponential growth. Why THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is the Ultimate Choice 1. A Fresh Entrant With Massive Potential: As a newly launched coin, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers investors the chance to enter at the ground floor. Its early-stage momentum makes it one of the most promising opportunities to achieve life-changing gains. 2. Record-Breaking Presale Success: Raising $1.5 million almost instantly, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven itself as a high-demand asset. This presale success has cemented its place as a token with unmatched growth potential. 3. Exclusivity That Drives Demand: Unlike ETH, MATIC, or APT, which are widely traded on multiple exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at magacoinofficial.com This exclusivity creates urgency and scarcity, increasing its value to early adopters. How It Stands Up Against Competitors XRP: A leader in payments, but it no longer offers the early-stage returns seen with this new coin. Solana (SOL): Strong in scalability but can’t match the momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Optimism (OP): A rising Layer-2 solution but lacks the excitement surrounding this token. SEI: Innovative but doesn’t have the same presale success or exclusivity. Secure Your Position Before It’s Too Late With its record-breaking presale and massive growth projections, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN is quickly becoming the most talked-about investment of 2025. Could $500 really turn into $555K? The answer lies in this explosive new coin.

Given Bitcoin’s current price of approximately $96,791, this historical ratio would theoretically price XRP at $21.75 today. The post generated mixed reactions within the crypto community, with some arguing that XRP remains significantly undervalued, while others dismissed the calculation as outdated and unrealistic. The minimum price $XRP is supposed to be right now is $21.75. That’s all I have to say. pic.twitter.com/awCOaHnNjO — Amonyx (@amonbuy) February 6, 2025 The Basis for the $21.75 Valuation Amonyx’s calculation is derived from this formula: 0.00022465 BTC x 96,791 USD/BTC = 21.75 USD/XRP. This approach assumes that XRP could maintain its peak BTC ratio in today’s market. However, it does not consider shifts in market structure, adoption trends, liquidity changes, or the evolving dominance of Bitcoin over the years. Community Reactions and Market Sentiment Following Amonyx’s post, several users on X (formerly Twitter) shared their perspectives. An X user, Prometheus (@Prometheus), criticized the idea, stating , “This is indicative of a dead token whose fan base can’t seem to accept its fate or can not adapt to the changes.” This reflects the skepticism some traders hold regarding XRP’s long-term potential. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another X user, ConsciousnessHub (@ConsciousnessHub), offered a different viewpoint, arguing that while XRP is “not a dead token, it’s overhyped.” He further explained, “Purely on market cap, this coin can’t raise to 20 dollars in the next 5 years. That means investors need to buy billions and billions of XRP.” This response highlights concerns regarding XRP’s high circulating supply and the capital required to drive such a price increase. While Amonyx’s calculation presents an interesting perspective, the assumption that XRP should be priced at $21.75 based solely on a past BTC ratio does not account for evolving market dynamics. Reaching such a price would require significant institutional investment, regulatory clarity , and increased market adoption. The discussion surrounding XRP’s value remains a contentious topic within the crypto community. Some believe it is undervalued with strong future potential, while others argue that its large supply and market conditions make such price levels unrealistic in the near term. Regardless, XRP continues to be a focal point in cryptocurrency discussions. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

40141987,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=127296,1739165696,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Cryptocurrency Prices and News: Will Bitcoin Rebound While Panshibi Is Set for Remarkable Growth?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/cryptocurrency-prices-and-news-will-bitcoin-rebound-while-panshibi-is-set-for-remarkable-growth/,"The Bitcoin price today sits at $96,424.94, reflecting a 5.61% drop over the past week. Many analysts remain cautiously optimistic that BTC could soon reverse course, especially if trading volumes rebound and institutional interest resurfaces. Meanwhile, the broader crypto market shows a mix of red and green, with some altcoins stabilizing as others seek momentum. In this uncertain environment, an emerging meme coin called Panshibi ($SHIBI) is garnering attention, prompting comparisons to earlier tokens that delivered exceptional returns. Bitcoin: A Possible Rebound? Traders monitoring the Bitcoin price today believe a short-term bounce is possible, though not guaranteed. Some point to historical patterns in which BTC dips precede robust recoveries – particularly when market watchers perceive oversold conditions. For a genuine upswing, however, observers say Bitcoin needs fresh catalysts, such as renewed corporate adoption or favorable regulatory announcements. Whales also play a role: increased buy-ins from large holders often coincide with reversals, though there’s no hard confirmation that’s about to happen. Cautious optimism surrounds the prospect that macroeconomic events – like easing inflation or central bank policy shifts – might shift capital back into crypto. Still, without a decisive push, Bitcoin price today might see more tepid trading. Many in the community remain confident that a future rally could emerge within months, potentially lifting the entire market from its lull. Panshibi ($SHIBI): A Meme Coin Poised for Growth As the Bitcoin price shows increasing volatility today, a different story is emerging in the meme coin sphere. Panshibi has combined comedic flair with a structured presale strategy to offer more than a fleeting novelty. Liquidity is locked for a full 10 years, team tokens remain locked for two and the contract undergoes rigorous auditing – measures specifically designed to safeguard early adopters. Now in Stage 3 of its presale at $0.004, $SHIBI has amassed over $700k, underscoring strong optimism in an otherwise unpredictable market environment. Beyond the surface-level buzz, Panshibi’s AI-driven “social-fi” features seek to keep the community active through staking rewards and quest-based engagement. By weaving fun branding with solid tokenomics, the project recalls earlier meme coins that soared by fusing humor with tangible value. If BTC and major altcoins remain sluggish, $SHIBI could provide an alluring alternative – especially for those aiming at 10x or 100x returns in 2025. This combination of security, comedic appeal and interactive user design places Panshibi at the forefront of up-and-coming meme tokens. Panda Power Over a Shaky BTC? While the Bitcoin price today hovers around $96K, speculation abounds as to whether a quick rebound can restore faith in the leading cryptocurrency. At the same time, altcoins like XRP maintain moderate interest, fueled by ongoing developments. Against this backdrop, Panshibi ($SHIBI) offers an alternative narrative: a meme coin meticulously constructed to address common pitfalls in the genre. If 2025’s market sees another wave of meme coin mania, Panshibi’s staged launch and comedic branding could yield the kind of explosive growth that more established tokens struggle to match.

Meanwhile, newer tokens like Remittix investment are shifting the focus toward real-world adoption. With the potential for the best crypto for 30 x returns, it’s crucial to explore whether meme coins can sustain their hype or if a utility-driven project like Remittix is the smarter choice. The difference is clear: speculation vs. real-world impact. Shiba Inu: Can the Hype Last? The large Shiba Inu (SHIB) community base exists primarily because people speculate on its value. Social media trends celebrity endorsements, and widespread interest in Dogecoin success drove the increase in Shiba Inu price. However, despite its popularity, SHIB faces challenges in proving real utility. The Shibarium layer-2 solution was introduced to add functionality, reducing transaction costs and improving scalability. The biggest issue with SHIB is its reliance on market trends rather than innovation. Investors seeking the best crypto for 30x returns may find it risky due to its unpredictable nature. Unlike projects solving real-world financial problems, SHIB remains a speculative asset with uncertain long-term potential. Dogecoin: The Original Meme Coin’s Struggle for Relevance Dogecoin (DOGE) entered the world as a funny digital currency standard before transforming into a top cryptocurrency in the industry. Despite its strong branding and endorsements from Elon Musk, DOGE struggles with adoption beyond a tipping currency. The absence of a supply limit in Dogecoin leads to unavoidable inflation in the system. DOGE operates with a safe functional network but its lack of development forbids it from being a credible market participant. Although DOGE has been accepted as payment by a few companies, it lacks integration into mainstream finance. It remains highly speculative, with price surges tied to social media hype rather than technological advancements. For those looking for best crypto for 30x returns, DOGE presents challenges due to its limited use case and reliance on market sentiment. It’s a fun, community-driven token, but without real-world utility, its long-term sustainability is questionable. Remittix: The Future of Crypto Utility and Banking Integration Unlike meme coins, Remittix investment is built to solve real financial problems. The technology allows crypto users to make CRYPTO-TO-FIAT transactions without any friction between the two financial domains. Crypto users achieve a major industry breakthrough through this solution which solves their most pressing issue of accessing usable FIAT currency from their digital assets. Consider the 1.4 billion unbanked individuals worldwide. Many lack access to banking services but can receive and send cryptocurrency. Through Remittix, they can convert their digital assets into cash, send funds via Western Union, or use them for daily expenses without relying on traditional banks. This aligns with crypto’s core values: financial freedom, anonymity, and control over one’s wealth. Why Remittix Is the Smartest Investment Right Now Beyond solving real-world issues, Remittix offers investors huge upside potential. It is currently in its presale stage, aiming to raise $36M, with early investors positioned for massive gains. The presale is structured to provide the best crypto for 30x return, making it an attractive alternative to meme coins. The Remittix investment model also competes directly with fintech giants like Stripe, Wise, and Coinbase. Remittix provides direct transactions to users because it operates without additional platform intermediaries which enables efficient and cost-effective payments. The industry faces a revolutionary shift through Remittix because it solves the problems of both expensive service charges and slow transaction timelines which affect global money transfers. Remittix builds a streamlined environment through blockchain that keeps the user in control of their assets together with traditional financial capabilities. While SHIB vs DOGE will continue to dominate social media discussions, their long-term value remains uncertain. Meme coins thrive on hype, but without real-world application, they face sustainability challenges. Remittix investment, on the other hand, is tackling one of the biggest pain points in crypto bridging the gap between digital assets and FIAT usability. With the potential for the best crypto for 30x returns, real-world adoption, and financial inclusivity, Remittix stands out as the smarter choice for forward-thinking investors.

The poster claimed that the token would help give CAR more worldly exposure and boost national development. However, two deepfake detectors have flagged the account’s video announcement as suspicious, raising concerns about whether the CAR token is just a big scam. Seferbekov and Ensemble detectors found the President’s video could be a deepfake In his X post , Faustion said : “Today, we are launching $CAR – an experiment designed to show how something as simple as a meme can unite people, support national development and put the Central African Republic on the world stage in a unique way.” – President Faustion-Archange Touadera In another post, the president added that he has always been supportive of crypto, and his country’s acceptance of Bitcoin as legal tender is a testament to that. Faustian then posted a video announcement for the new CAR meme coin, inviting the public to revel in the news. However, Deepware’s deepfake detector has flagged the video as ‘suspicious,’ with the Seferbekov model on the checker showing an 82% chance that the video was fabricated. Similarly, the Ensemble model revealed a 60% chance. Meanwhile, two other models on the checker tool, Avatarify and Deepware’s own checker, did not find the video to be a deepfake. Others have also expressed their doubts about the credibility of the president’s message, presuming that his X account could have been hacked. In a now-deleted post , Yokai Ryujin, founder of unrevealed XYZ, warned his team to be cautious about the new meme coin. He said its domain was registered about three days ago on namecheap.com—something he thinks a president of a country would not do. Moreover, X suspended the official account for the CAR meme coin announcements, but Faustion said he was working with the social media platform to restore the account. The CAR meme coin reached a record valuation of $600 million As per the official CAR meme coin website, the project’s tokenomics is as follows: for the country’s development, 25% will go to creators, 20.7% is planned for the liquidity pool, 10% will go to charity, and 9.3% is meant for public distribution. According to Solscan , about 33% of the CAR tokens are already in one wallet, 25% in another, and 9.81% and 8.39% are held in two other wallets. However, the 20.7% of the token supply dedicated to liquidity has yet to be included in the token’s liquidity pool. So far, the token has even reached a peak valuation of over $600 million before dropping to $298 million. The CAR token is currently trading at $0.2937.

Polymarket has become the go to avenue for placing on-chain bets, which has brought in scrutiny from regulators. Some countries have outright banned Polymarket, while the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) wants to gain access to the platform 's customer data. According to crypto attorney Aaron Brogan , the argument that prediction markets, like Polymarket, are simply a Web3 version of gambling is an inaccurate characterization. Brogan, said that unlike traditional betting platform, prediction markets make money on the transactions fees rather that the users. Regardless of the challenges, Polymarket is thriving and bettors are gaining or losing big sums of money. Traders go hard on sports bets On-chain from Polymarket Analytics shows that one trader going by the handle 'abeautifulmind' took home a profit of over $550,000 from their bets on the Eagles. Data shows that this user has an overall profit of just over $1 million, mostly from bets on sports. On the other side of the trade was a bettor by the name of hubertdakid, who lost $718,633 by betting against the Eagles. This trader seems to be down on their luck on Polymarket, with an overall loss of $638,177. Other Superbowl related contracts on Polymarket included one about how many times Taylor Swift would be shown on the broadcast and another about how long the national anthem performance would be. Overall, lifetime volume from sports related contracts on Polymarket has passed $6 billion. This is more than the volume on U.S. election markets, which came in at $5.2 billion according to Polymarket Analytics.",Markets,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-10 06:02:14

Vought announced the decision in a Feb. 9 post on X, stating that the CFPB would not request its next round of funding from the Federal Reserve. “I have notified the Federal Reserve that CFPB will not be taking its next draw of unappropriated funding because it is not ‘reasonably necessary’ to carry out its duties,” Vought wrote, adding that the agency’s current balance of $711.6 million is excessive given the fiscal climate. CFPB: Safeguarding Consumers from Predatory Financial Practices The CFPB was established to oversee financial institutions and protect consumers from predatory practices, particularly in response to the 2008 financial crisis. The agency has also played a role in handling complaints against U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges. However, it has been a point of contention within the crypto industry. Last year, the CFPB considered regulating crypto wallet providers but later dropped the initiative after facing industry pushback. According to Reuters , Vought sent a memo instructing CFPB employees to halt all supervisory and examination activities. Staff were also ordered to suspend investigations, refrain from initiating new cases, and discontinue issuing rules or public guidance. Additionally, the memo reportedly directed staff to work remotely this week as the agency’s offices would be closed. Pursuant to the Consumer Financial Protection Act, I have notified the Federal Reserve that CFPB will not be taking its next draw of unappropriated funding because it is not ""reasonably necessary"" to carry out its duties. The Bureau's current balance of $711.6 million is in fact… — Russ Vought (@russvought) February 9, 2025 The CFPB’s funding structure differs from most federal agencies, as it operates through budget requests to the Federal Reserve rather than congressional appropriations. Vought, who also serves as director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, framed the funding cutoff as a move toward greater accountability. “This spigot, long contributing to CFPB’s unaccountability, is now being turned off,” Vought stated. He was appointed to lead the agency on Feb. 7, replacing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Vought Advocates for Government Restructuring Vought has a history of advocating for significant government restructuring. He co-authored Project 2025 , a right-wing policy initiative aimed at increasing presidential power. The decision to freeze CFPB operations has drawn sharp criticism. Dennis Kelleher, co-founder of the financial oversight advocacy group Better Markets, condemned the move as an attack on consumers. “This latest attempt to kill the consumer bureau is another slap in the face for all Americans who depend on basic financial products and services,” Kelleher said, accusing Trump of exposing his own supporters to financial risks. Notably, the U.S. government is showing increasing support for the crypto industry. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently scaled back its crypto enforcement unit , signaling a softer stance on regulation. Additionally, Donald Trump signed an executive order directing the creation of a sovereign wealth fund, with pro-crypto officials Scott Bessent and Howard Lutnick among those managing it. Speculation is growing that this fund could include Bitcoin as part of its portfolio. Meanwhile, David Sacks, White House “crypto czar,” suggested the U.S. is looking to integrate stablecoins into the financial system, aiming to strengthen the dollar’s dominance internationally and digitally.

Recent predictions from investment giant VanEck have only added to Solana’s growing reputation. According to VanEck, Solana ($SOL) is on track to see its price surge by the end of 2025—to $520, in fact. This is a really bullish outlook. And the reason for it? VanEck says that Solana is gaining market share in the smart contract platform space. Not only is VanEck saying that Solana’s growth is impressive, but also that it’s very much a “dominate or be dominated” kind of scenario. DEX volumes, active users, and developers are all flocking to Solana. VanEck's prediction of #Solana reaching $520 by the end of 2025 is based on its projected market share within the smart contract platform (SCP) market. Solana is expected to increase its market share from 15% to 22% by the end of 2025, driven by its developer dominance, growth… pic.twitter.com/GCasQOWbft — Poloniex Exchange (@Poloniex) February 7, 2025 Solana’s Projected Market Growth VanEck bases its prediction of Solana reaching $520 by the end of 2025 on an autoregressive forecast model that takes the projected market share growth of the platform into account. The model indicates that Solana’s market cap could reach a staggering $250 billion, with the price of $SOL climbing to $520. This projection hinges on the workaround assumption that the circulating supply of $SOL will remain around 486 million and aligns with Solana’s current tokenomics. The key driver of this growth is that Solana is capturing a larger share of the SCP market. At present, Solana holds about 15% of the market share in this space, but VanEck thinks it will increase to 22% by 2025. This is supposed to happen because of several factors, like Solana’s developer dominance, which is like a platform’s long-term success indicator; its fast-growing decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes; and its fast-growing user base. The more Solana’s decentralized application (dApp) developer community grows, the faster its ecosystem builds out and the stronger it gets. And in this case, a faster path to a stronger ecosystem leads through greater transaction volumes and more kinds of use cases for the blockchain itself. The Rise of Solana’s Active User Base Another key component of the bullish forecast for Solana is its user base. As of January 2025, Solana boasts a total of 197 million active addresses. By contrast, the other smart contract platforms have far fewer addresses—they are far less active. Take, for example, Near Protocol, which according to the same recent data, has only 120 million active addresses. From there, the numbers drop off significantly: Tron has 68 million, Aptos has 38.1 million, and Base has 37.7 million. Solana leads the way with 197M active addresses in January Let's check out Top Chains by Total Active Addresses in January 2025 @solana – 197M @NEARProtocol – 120M @trondao – 68M @Aptos – 38.1M @base – 37.7M @BNBCHAIN – 36.9M @SuiNetwork – 21M @Bitcoin – 15.4M… https://t.co/cemxehQvHl pic.twitter.com/CTffEpGbaA — Solana Daily (@solana_daily) February 7, 2025 The number of addresses that are active is a key indicator of how well a network is doing. This really suggests how many people are using the platform and for what kinds of things. DeFi platforms and associated applications seem to have a good number of people using them. NFTs don’t seem to have their full potential realized yet, but they do have some number of people using them too. So when we talk about Solana’s wide adoption, we mean that a good number of people are doing several different things—some of it we don’t yet understand fully—on the platform. And that is why it’s a really interesting area to look into right now. Solana’s Developer Dominance and DEX Growth One of the most significant contributors to Solana’s success has been its developer ecosystem. In the past few years, Solana has been among the top platforms for developers wanting high throughput and low fees. The network’s performance makes it particularly attractive for DeFi projects, where it can manage a high volume of trades with low latency and minimal fees. These characteristics have helped it foster a DEX ecosystem that is thriving, with DEX volumes continuing to grow year after year. With many decentralized finance protocols and applications moving to Solana owing to its better scalability, the Solana blockchain is also beginning to quite obviously generate more revenue. Unquestionably, the most certain DEX growth narrative is that of Solana. It is not only the case that Solana is now generating DEX revenue, but Solana is also grabbing market share in this space. The Growing Ecosystem of Smart Contract Platforms Solana’s growth may be impressive, but one must also acknowledge the competitive atmosphere surrounding smart contract platforms. Aside from the market share Solana commands, several other significant contenders vie for dominance in the space, including Near Protocol, Tron, Aptos, and BNB Chain. Even within this competitive context, however, Solana seems to have an enviable position, with its active address growth far outstripping its nearest rivals and a developer environment that seems to be more inviting than the other platforms offer. As of January 2025, Solana’s active addresses are almost double those of the Near Protocol, which is the second-largest blockchain in terms of active addresses. While platforms such as Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Polygon continue to be the ruling giants of the overall blockchain ecosystem, Solana attracts and retains both developers and users. This situation enables Solana to have a real shot at success going forward. Conclusion: A Bright Future for Solana VanEck’s forecast of $520 per $SOL by 2025 might seem daring, but the figures we see suggest that Solana is well positioned for a pretty ambitious growth run. If we look at Solana’s increasing market share, the growing number of active users we see on the network, and the developer base we have over there, Solana is starting to look like a pretty dominant smart contract platform. And if Solana keeps this up and keeps attracting new users and developers to the platform, then hey, why not? They’re in a decent position to reach the pretty bold price projection set by VanEck.

40144231,https://nulltx.com/?p=144302,1739170821,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,$WLD Price Faces a Struggle Amid Market Turmoil,https://nulltx.com/wld-price-faces-a-struggle-amid-market-turmoil/,"The cost of $WLD , a token supported by the renowned artificial intelligence firm OpenAI, has recently achieved a noteworthy low—albeit one that probably won’t have investors cheering. For the first time, $WLD is hitting a price point that puts investors in the red, currently sitting around $0.97, which, as far as CoinGecko is concerned, represents the lowest price ever recorded for the token. The cryptocurrency community is now casting sideways glances at $WLD and asking some pointed questions. Why has a token with such prestigious AI backing gone the way of the dodo? And why hasn’t its narrative AI potential translated into increased gains? What’s Behind the Drop in $WLD’s Price? The $WLD falling below the $1 threshold represents more than just a symbolic moment for the token; it shows the wider obstacles the cryptocurrency market faces, especially the projects that hang their hopes on the AI narrative. A lot of people are now asking if the token even has a chance of getting back to where it was—or if it will keep on declining and maybe even become the next big loser in the crypto space. The performance of some leading funds that have invested in $WLD is particularly worrisome. Prominent investors like a16z, Blockchain Capital, and Coinbase Ventures are now notorious examples. These funds are said to have first come in at a price between $0.25 and $0.30 per token. That’s a far cry from the current price of $0.97. And while $WLD is awash in red, the tokens are still selling for 3 to 4 times what these funds originally paid. So, one can certainly see why traders and investors might be getting a little jittery when looking at the performance of $WLD and pondering the possibility that it might be part of some market shift. The Investor Sentiment on Major Exchanges Examining the trading action on the big exchanges, such as Binance and OKX, reveals more about how the recent downturn is affecting traders. The most striking thing is how the many more long accounts than short accounts—by factors of 2.58 times on Binance and 4.87 times on OKX—indicate that traders are mostly still long on $WLD and mostly believe that it will come back and that the current price pressures are just that: pressure. Yet, even though the token keeps sliding downward, some traders are becoming more cautious. Long traders who are already in the market seem reluctant to accept the lower prices we’re currently seeing, which suggests to me that they might be feeling a little more anxious about the token’s ability to regain upward price momentum. If the price keeps on falling, I think you could number among the possible outcome scenarios increasing liquidation of long positions that could keep pushing the price further downward. Broader Market Challenges and the Impact of DeepSeek One thing that could be contributing to $WLD’s troubles is the larger AI industry—especially the cryptocurrency-related part of it—that is facing some tough challenges right now. A recent incident involving DeepSeek, a competitor to ChatGPT, has caused some substantial disruption within the whole AI sector. DeepSeek’s troubles, and their impact on ChatGPT, have caused some investor confidence in AI-driven narrative tokens to crumble. $WLD về dưới 1$ Thật sự cảm xúc không biết nói gì khi giá $WLD về hẳn 0.97$, cái mốc này đang ghi nhận là giá thấp nhất mọi thời đại trên Coingecko. Giá mấy quỹ như a16z, Blockchain Capital, Coinbase Ventures,… đi ở các vòng ở mức 0.25$ – 0.3$. Giá hiện… https://t.co/jMJLFoXCyH pic.twitter.com/QGwJ5W50ZH — Blog Tiền Ảo (@blogtienao_hq) February 8, 2025 Although AI is generally regarded as one of the top-tier stories in crypto, the industry’s real risk is its volatility and competition. The collapse or troubles of the leaders in this space—like DeepSeek—only serve to point up how tied the AI story is to specific tokens and technologies. For $WLD, which rides the narrative AI wave, this is an obstacle. The potential for AI story tokens to see massive adoption is still in play, but the recent events have injected a needed dose of skepticism among investors. Looking Ahead: Can $WLD Rebound? $WLD is dealing with some serious problems right now, yet the situation may not be as dire as it seems. The project has strong backing from OpenAI, a really promising partner to have, and the $WLD narrative is one that could develop nicely in the crypto space. What’s more, if you take a look at the broader market, narrative AI seems to be a hedge-fund darling and a strong potential growth area. So, $WLD could do nicely both because of its specific situation and the conditions of the overarching market. The market’s present condition indicates that, although a recovery is feasible, it will demand a large-scale change in investor sentiment and a stabilization of the artificial intelligence narrative. If $WLD can weather the storm it is currently in, stabilize its price, and regain investor confidence, it could return to the higher levels at which it was once trading. Still, in light of the recent downturn and the current uncertainty in the supposed growth driver that is the AI sector, one should be cautious about making an investment in $WLD right now. To sum up, if $WLD remains likely to go under the price of $1 anytime soon, it would not be a good investment. Clearly, it is trading below $2, which is below its all-time high of $1.86. While WLD is not trading at an all-time high currently, it still hasn’t reached its all-time low either (which was $0.3908 and was seen just over a month ago — on July 24). In this instance, “fundamentals” help get a grasp on this situation more and serve as a better guide to inform any investment decisions. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

33767162,[object Object],1739170835,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Will GameStop Buy Bitcoin? Cohen And Saylor Fuel Rumors,https://bitcoinist.com/will-gamestop-buy-bitcoin-cohen-saylor-rumor/,"In a move that has reignited ongoing speculation within the Bitcoin community, GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen met with Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) Executive Chairman Michael Saylor on Saturday. Cohen subsequently shared a photo on X depicting him alongside Saylor—without providing any additional context. The post once again sparked rumors that GameStop could be contemplating a Bitcoin treasury strategy similar to what Strategy has pioneered under Saylor’s leadership. Notably, this is not a new rumor, but there has been no concrete evidence to date that GameStop has taken any official steps toward a BTC-centric corporate strategy. Will GameStop Adopt Bitcoin? Still, the sight of the two executives together has energized the rumor mill. One notable voice, Heisenberg (@Mr_Derivatives), commented on X Cohen’s photograph “could be the subtle hint” of a forthcoming BTC adoption, allowing the retailer to transform into “a BTC holding company much like MSTR.” He also hinted that under such a scenario, the stock might “easily 5-10x by the end of this decade,” or potentially sooner. One key element driving the chatter is the strength of GameStop’s balance sheet. Tim Kotzman, host of The Bitcoin Treasuries Podcast, underscored on X that as of October 31, 2024, the gaming retailer reported approximately $4.616 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. He highlighted a recent change in the company’s investment policy that grants Cohen “the authority to invest in cryptocurrencies without requiring shareholder or board approval.” According to Kotzman, this policy shift opens the door for a “Bitcoin Treasury Company” scenario, yet he was quick to note that “as of December 2024, there have been no public disclosures indicating that such investments have been made.” “If GameStop $GME, were to invest its $4.6 billion cash reserves into BTC, it would acquire approximately 48,000 BTC. This would make GameStop the second largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, ranking behind MicroStrategy and surpassing MARA Holdings,” Han Akamatsu noted via X. BritishHODL (@BritishHodl), a Bitcoin enthusiast, posted that GameStop “GameStop could be the straw that breaks the camels back on Wall Street of companies adopting the Bitcoin Reserve Strategy of MSTR to create shareholder value .” Meanwhile, crypto commentator @ProtestFiat took a more aggressive stance, suggesting that “GameStop […] adopting Bitcoin” might create a scenario where short sellers find themselves scrambling, given the potential for a sudden spike in share price. In a post, she outlined a sequence of steps: from the initial treasury announcement to subsequent share offerings used to buy more Bitcoin—each phase potentially fueling additional rallies and short squeezes. Though highly hypothetical, this argument resonates with the memories of the 2021 “meme stock” phenomenon , during which GameStop’s share price experienced a dramatic run-up and inflicted heavy losses on some short sellers. While the commentary from traders and podcast hosts underscores the intrigue around a possible Bitcoin pivot, it is essential to note the gap between rumor and reality. Historically, Cohen has been tight-lipped regarding any crypto-related moves for the company, even as GameStop dabbled with NFTs and blockchain projects in the past. For the moment, no verifiable evidence suggests an imminent purchase of BTC or other cryptocurrencies.

Two, in particular, have been making themselves known in recent months—Real World Assets (RWA) and AI Agents. The developments in these sectors show about as clear a potential as can be to influence the crypto market at large. Why? Because, at base, they’re providing ever-so-real value that links traditional finance to the blockchain, and they’re doing it with an ever-curious bridge—the tech innovations they’ve brought to the table. Although the early days of cryptocurrency were dominated by meme coins and altcoins, the emergence of real-world assets (RWA) and AI agents is steering the narrative toward something more meaningful—utility-driven assets. Instead of just being a speculative store of value, these sectors are now being viewed by both investors and institutions as the next big thing in crypto, with monumental potential to reshape our Web3-enabled future. RWA and AI agents are already pushing the boundaries of the possible, with both sectors starting to flirt with the trillion-dollar asset class. Despite a few emerging-tech hiccups, they aren’t going away. The Current State of the RWA & AI Agents Sectors Over the past few weeks, the RWA and the AI Agents sectors have experienced differing fortunes. The AI Agents sector has taken a substantial hit, according to data from Cookie Fun. Our current estimate of market value for AI Agents is about $6.2 billion, down from a peak of more than $20 billion in mid-January. We’ve roughly calculated that this sector has lost around $14 billion in market cap over the last three weeks. While we are concerned about the fortunes of the AI Agents sector, we do want to emphasize that the crypto market is highly volatile. Conversely, Real World Assets (RWA) have not only maintained their growth but have also shown a surprising resilience in recent months. RWA brings a real-world value to blockchain platforms, allowing an array of traditional assets—such as real estate, stocks, and even commodities—to be tokenized and traded on-chain. This hardly seems revolutionary; it’s part of what makes a blockchain a blockchain. But what’s happening with RWA is perhaps a good glimpse into the possible future of the crypto ecosystem. According to Cookie Fun, the AI ​​Agents sector has lost about $14 billion in market value in the past three weeks. The AI ​​Agents sector has continued to decline since reaching a peak of $20.37 billion in total market value on January 15, to the current level of about $6.2… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 8, 2025 Top Projects Leading the Way A few initiatives have become leaders in the RWA and AI Agents sectors, dominating by market cap and demonstrating the capabilities of these groundbreaking technologies. In the RWA space, Ondo Finance stands out as the most impressive project, with a market cap exceeding $2 billion. Ondo Finance is attempting to create a seamless bridge between traditional finance and the blockchain by tokenizing real-world assets. Other notable projects in the RWA sector include MANTRA Chain ($3.69B), Quant Network ($1.71B), Sky Ecosystem ($1.37B), and XDC Network ($1.219B), all of which have substantial roles in migrating traditional finance on-chain. At the same time, the sector for AI Agents shows that Virtuals.io is the standout project, boasting a market cap of $4.895 billion. AI Agents, which can be used to automate and optimize DeFi strategies, trading, and digital interactions, could change the ways in which we interact with decentralized finance (DeFi). Other leading AI Agent projects include ASI Alliance ($3.639B), AI16z ($2.608B), Aixbt Agent ($500M), and Freysa AI ($310M), in which each of the following entities is shown to be leading a top-10 crypto project powered by AI. 024 Wrap: Best Narrative of the Year This year, RWA (Real World Assets) & AI Agents didn’t just emerge—they completely dominated the Meme & Altcoin markets, reshaping the crypto innovation.

RWAs take us a step closer to bringing traditional finance onto the blockchain. They allow for the tokenization of not just digital but also physical and real-world assets and are creating some new opportunities in the investment universe. And then there’s AI. AI Agents are not really new. But we are seeing a lot more talk about using AI in finance and investment. And again, there’s not just a talk; there’s a walk we can actually see. The decentralized finance ecosystem comprises various aspects that can be automated or enhanced using artificial intelligence. While many sectors are now using AI to varying degrees, in DeFi, using AI is already highly beneficial and is rapidly leading to improvements. Conversely, these improvements are also making the use of AI in DeFi much smarter and more useful, thus creating a very rewarding feedback loop. From executing complex trades to managing overall risk and liquidity, “Agents” (AI in this case) are helping make DeFi a much smarter and more effective space for both retail and institutional investors. In unison, RWAs and AI agents are speeding up how quickly Web3 technologies are being accepted. They are two ways new opportunities are being created for developers and financial institutions in what was once an experimental blockchain industry. They are now two key elements in the rapidly maturing intersection between traditional industries and the blockchain. At their central core, RWAs and AI agents are Web3 opportunities. The Future of RWA and AI Agents in Crypto At present, the AI Agents sector is experiencing a decline in market capitalization, but the long-term growth potential seems just as bright as before. The downturn should not obscure the impact REAs and AI Agents are having on crypto and Web3. These sectors are moving the market toward a sustainable, utility-driven place—something that could draw even greater amounts of institutional money in the years to come. Continued development and refinement of offerings from RWA and AI Agents sector projects make it clear that these innovations are here to stay. The crypto world will not be future-fit if it is only driven by speculative assets. What will give the next phase of the crypto universe “tangible value”? Something how the what-next asset revolution might could improve, for example, the “enhanced utility and security of decentralized systems.” More and more leading projects are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in RWA and AI Agents. To sum up, despite facing some initial difficulties, the AI Agents sector appears to be moving toward the continued success and growth of so-called “RWA” (real-world asset) crypto projects. These promise to deliver a future of “blockchain everywhere,” with use cases that push utility, real-world value, and the next big thing in the crypto industry: “adoption.” The 2023 crypto market is one of “mounting institutional interest and a burgeoning development sphere.” Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Last week, after CZ shared a video tutorial featuring the Test Token, the TST price saw a sharp surge in a short period. Later, the Binance founder confirmed that it was just for educational purposes and that he doesn’t endorse the TST token. However, despite this, Binance announced a listing for the TST token while capitalizing on the trading volume. This has caused a major uproar in the crypto community asking CZ about the “fundamentals” of the token and the vetting process at the exchange. Is Changpeng Zhao Shifting From Fundamentals? Over the past year, Changpeng Zhao has been known for backing fundamentally strong projects. However, the recent developments around the TST token have prompted the crypto community to question him. Several people have been asking when CZ supports “fundamentals”, then why is he talking about the TST token which is functioning as a meme coin? This has led to questions like whether CZ is shifting away from fundamentals or is getting into meme coins now. Furthermore, Changpeng Zhao is facing the question of why the TST token got listed on Binance, despite Zhao distancing himself from it. Responding to this, CZ wrote: “I don’t know for sure. I am entirely NOT involved in their listing process. Based on historical experience, people always complain, “Why do you list this but not the coin I hold?” You might not like to hear this, but the truth is: exchanges must compete to list popular coins (with trading volume) as early as possible. If your coin is actively sought after by traders, you don’t need to talk to exchanges. As I always say, work on your project, not the exchanges”. Furthermore, commenting on his meme coin involvement, Zhao said: “Memes are fun, etc. It’s a cultural thing. I am not an expert in this area. There are plenty of die-hard defenders of memes. Don’t go against the community”. Zhao on Binance Listing Test (TST) Token Changpeng Zhao has expressed concerns over the platform’s token listing process, calling it “a bit broken.” In a statement on social media, Zhao highlighted how the four-hour window between the announcement of a listing and the actual listing creates significant price volatility, especially in the case of TST token. “The notice period is necessary, but in those 4 hours, token prices surge on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and then people sell on centralized exchanges (CEXs). Not sure if there is a solution for this though. Just beware,” Zhao noted . One user suggested that the listing on CEXs and DEXs should be simultaneous, responding to which, Zhao said: “I tend to agree. I think CEX should list (almost) everything automatically, just like DEX. But I am not running a CEX anymore”. TST Token Pump and Dump Soon after the Binance listing, the Test price surged by 300% to $0.50 with daily trading volume surging 372% to $1.42 billion. However, this was met with strong liquidations as the TST price tanked 60% from the peak and is currently trading under $0.20. Amid the ongoing TST token saga and Zhao clarification, the BNB price surged 7% earlier today.

For years, crypto prices have moved quite independently—often, the only price action seen in traditional financial markets was when they had to react to what was happening in crypto. But now, Bitcoin is becoming much more correlated to the traditional financial markets it used to be decoupled from, with the S&P 500 being the usual benchmark of reference. Bitcoin’s recent price moves also seem more intertwined with the movements of the US Dollar Index (DXY), which continues to be a prominent feature of the current macroeconomic landscape. Bitcoin's correlation with the S&P 500 is currently notably high, while the opposite is true for its correlation with the US dollar index. This combination aligns to crypto's weakness following the US tariffs news this week. pic.twitter.com/KoufPYsU57 — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) February 7, 2025 Bitcoin’s Correlation with Traditional Markets: A New Trend? Right now, Bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 is pretty high. This is a shift from the usually low correlation it shares with traditional assets. What does it mean for Bitcoin to correlate with the S&P 500? Well, for one, it means that even as institutional investors and the adoption of digital assets continue to grow, they’re not really affecting Bitcoin in any kind of positive way right now. Sure, institutions are buying Bitcoin. But what we’re seeing right now is that as Wall Street and the “macro bros” down at the Federal Reserve move the stock market, they’re also moving Bitcoin. Recent news regarding potential U.S. tariffs that could affect a swath of industries has amplified this trend. As the market took in this news, Bitcoin, like the S&P 500, showed some weakness. This suggests that the crypto markets are now more integrated than ever with traditional assets—and that they are feeling the same influence on them from broader market factors as traditional assets do. It also might signal yet another change in market psychology, with Bitcoin’s price movement now more aligned with general market sentiment. Exchange Withdrawals Signal Long-Term Confidence Though the wider market is weak, there is something positive for Bitcoin’s future. In the last week, over 70,000 Bitcoin have been pulled off exchanges. This is a good sign, as it shows that holders are confident enough in the future of Bitcoin to take it off exchanges—where it could be in danger if the exchange were to be hacked or go down—that they store it in more secure, long-term solutions like hardware wallets. Over 70,000 #Bitcoin $BTC have been withdrawn from exchanges in the past week, signaling long-term confidence! pic.twitter.com/d0KfDTud2M — Ali (@ali_charts) February 8, 2025 This development could suggest that investors are not deterred by short-term volatility and are instead placing themselves for future growth. In the past, significant withdrawals from exchanges have almost always preceded big moves up in the price of Bitcoin. That’s because it usually means a lot less of the asset is available to trade. If more people want to buy Bitcoin than sell it, the price is going up. Bitcoin’s Buying Opportunities: Is the Best Entry Yet to Come? Right now, Bitcoin’s price movements seem to be suggesting that there are still opportunities for traders to get into the market at a more favorable price. Based on historical price data, the best buying opportunities for Bitcoin tend to happen when traders are sitting at a -12% loss. At present, though, Bitcoin traders are holding a pretty comfortable 0.21% profit, which signals that we might not be too far away from a corrective price drop that would result in a better buying opportunity. The best buying opportunities for #Bitcoin $BTC historically come when traders are at a -12% loss. Right now, they’re still sitting at 0.21% in profit, suggesting there may still be room for a better entry! pic.twitter.com/7yp1pmqp9k — Ali (@ali_charts) February 8, 2025 The data indicate the possibility of a short-term decline, which could provide traders an opportunity to purchase Bitcoin at more favorable prices before a major rally. This interpretation follows the general presumption that Bitcoin has not yet established a definitive bottom. Market conditions, however, seem to almost guarantee that some investors will be shaken out of their positions. Even so, if you can hold on, you may be able to enjoy a “deeper pullback” that may get you “in-line” with a future rally. That Bitcoin has not yet experienced the kind of sharp correction that usually comes before big bullish moves suggests to me that there might still be a relatively calm period before the next uptrend. For people who are in Bitcoin for the long haul, it might be a good time to buy some more. Bitcoin Spot ETF Inflows Highlight Investor Confidence In spite of the general volatility, Bitcoin-based financial products have seen a very strong inflow. This is especially true for the Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). On February 7, the Bitcoin spot ETF pulled in a very large net inflow of $171 million. This inflow is indicative of an almost reverent attitude by these institutional investors concerning Bitcoin. And it now raises the almost ludicrous question of whether or not Bitcoin can somehow be “harnessed” to make a non-volatile version of itself, since ETFs can otherwise make quite erroneous claims. On February 7, the Bitcoin spot ETF had a total net inflow of $171 million. The Ethereum spot ETF had a total net inflow and net outflow of $0.00. https://t.co/59u0BnEqLG pic.twitter.com/AIlVjXAx4g — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 8, 2025 Bitcoin spot ETF inflows are rising, suggesting that institutional investors remain confident in the future of Bitcoin, even when the short-term market looks a little shaky. With the traditional investment world gaining more entry points to Bitcoin—most recently through the ETFs—the next push for ETF exposure could see another leg up for Bitcoin. More institutional involvement in the cryptocurrency space tends to be viewed positively and could be another spark for growth in the market. Conclusion: Looking Ahead to Bitcoin’s Future The latest developments in the Bitcoin market—its high correlation with the S&P 500, large exchange withdrawals, and the potential for better buying opportunities—suggest a future that is complex but promising for the cryptocurrency. Although the market’s short-term volatility and certain macroeconomic factors (like US tariffs) may still have it in their grip for now, the fundamentals underneath Bitcoin appear to be stronger than ever. Institutional adoption continues apace, long-term holders are removing their assets from exchanges, and potential buying opportunities are on the horizon. All this points toward a future for Bitcoin that is likely to be marked by further price appreciation—if the market can achieve some kind of stability and if it can overcome the current set of macroeconomic headwinds that seem to be blowing against it.

Over the last seven weeks, the network’s market cap has dropped a steep 36% from its local high. Investors and traders are now very concerned. What is happening? The downturn has coincided with a marked drop in the number of Ethereum tokens that are currently in profit. We’re seeing a negative sense of sentiment that has many retail traders just unloading their tokens. The underperformance in price compared to other large “cap” cryptocurrencies has left many questioning: can Ethereum recover? Ethereum's market cap has dropped -36% since its local high just 7 weeks ago. The result has been a stark drop in the amount of ETH tokens in profit since their date first mined. On the daily close, we are seeing the lowest percentage in profit in over 4 months, and lowest… pic.twitter.com/ze8uVeWqfA — Santiment (@santimentfeed) February 8, 2025 Ethereum’s Market Struggles and Profitability Decline The recent trend of profitability in Ethereum tokens has taken a sharp turn for the worse. Recent data shows that far fewer Ethereum tokens are currently in profit compared to previous months. In fact, the percentage of Ethereum that is in profit is at its lowest since April. To make matters worse, Ethereum’s profitability mound is facing such a steep downturn that it’s showing us the least amount of coins in profit since May. This is undoubtedly spelling a loss for a whole bunch of Ethereum investors across the board—especially the ones who got in early and have held on through this slump. This sustained downward spiral has been especially pronounced when you think about how Ethereum used to hold such dominance in the market. Once regarded as the top-tier, foundational blockchain for decentralized finance (DeFi), smart contracts, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs)—Ethereum’s recent performances have shoved it under the spotlight in terms of what not to do in the cryptocurrency space. These days, it pales in comparison to the sorts of upswings witnessed by other large-cap cryptocurrencies, like Solana, Binance Boin, and even Bitcoin. Retail Sentiment: Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) Driving Sales The Ethereum market has been permeated with Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) in recent weeks. This is mainly because traders and retail investors—who have a lower risk tolerance and are especially sensitive to price volatility—have lost faith in Ethereum due to its consistent underperformance. Retail investors have subsequently begun to dump their ETH holdings. Presto! Instant negative sentiment. And this negative sentiment looks like it is going to continue for a while because the dumping of Ethereum by retail traders seems to have only just begun. Market generally has been negative—extremely negative. Ethereum has been seen as an underachiever compared to the other big cryptos. Number two in market cap, but Ethereum now finds itself in a tighter race, with other networks not seen as rivals gaining ground. Networks like Solana and Avalanche—for them, user activity is going way up. Why? Faster transaction speeds. Lower fees. Au revoir, Ethereum. On February 7, the Bitcoin spot ETF had a total net inflow of $171 million. The Ethereum spot ETF had a total net inflow and net outflow of $0.00. https://t.co/59u0BnEqLG pic.twitter.com/AIlVjXAx4g — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 8, 2025 Even though Ethereum has faced difficulties lately, there might still be a promising sign on the horizon. Retail traders may be selling off their assets, but a committed development community is continuing to work on the network. They remain unwavering in their belief that the network holds potential, and they are attempting to realize that potential through development work. The transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which is part of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, is still in progress. The Ethereum Spot ETF: A Sign of Market Inactivity Further underscoring Ethereum’s recent market performance is the Ethereum spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), which had a rather mystifying day on February 7. The ETF recorded a combination net inflow and outflow of $0.00. That “0” in the inflow line might as well have been a “caution” light for the whole Ethereum market. ETF investors are not making moves, and this lack of moves could be interpreted as a lack of conviction about the Ethereum market in general. If the ETF is representing a cautious accumulation phase for Ethereum, then either side, bulls or bears, could be waiting until the next clear price signal before making a move. At the same time, Ethereum’s spot ETF is performing poorly, and this flat performance reflects a larger trend of indecision in the markets. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s price is in a downward spiral and retail sentiment is struggling. It seems that institutional investors may be taking a wait-and-see approach, perhaps opting to let the dust settle before making any large trades in either direction. If anything, these big players are likely keeping an even closer watch on the transition to Ethereum 2.0 and on whether it allows Ether to regain its competitive edge within the increasingly diverse and rapidly evolving crypto ecosystem. Potential for Recovery: Could Ethereum Bounce Back? Although Ethereum’s market slump and the emerging unfavorable sentiment might appear forbidding, they conceal something else: potential. It’s a situation that the Ethereum Foundation undoubtedly hopes won’t ever become the stuff of history, but it is still a reasonable enough precedent to bring up in discussing the current state of Ethereum. The cryptocurrency market is often more or less in a single phase together, rendering the Ethereum situation either more or less bleak. However, within that mode, the Ethereum Foundation is making progress in rendering either the current or a future iteration of the Ethereum network a place where transactions either cost less to make or happen so quickly that it hardly matters. To sum up, the latest market performance of Ethereum has not lived up to expectations, with the asset undergoing a steep plummet in its market cap, having fewer tokens in the profit zone, and experiencing a negative swing in the sentiment of traders and investors. But the cryptocurrency’s potential for resurgence remains quite palpable, especially if the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade unfolds in the way its creators promise and takes care of the network’s several outstanding problems. Still, the traders and investors who keep a close eye on these things surely will be watching to see whether Ethereum makes any distinct moves—upward or downward—in the next little while.

40144604,https://nulltx.com/?p=144311,1739171595,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"A Chaotic Week in Meme Coins: Lawsuits, Losses, and Market Shifts",https://nulltx.com/a-chaotic-week-in-meme-coins-lawsuits-losses-and-market-shifts/,"The meme coin market had a tumultuous week, with the sector experiencing a dramatic 28% drop. It fell to a market capitalization of $72.3 billion. The downturn, driven by a combination of liquidations and legal issues, has shaken investor confidence and left many wondering about the future of meme-based cryptocurrencies. Some tokens managed to stand out, showing resilience against the overall market slide. Here’s a breakdown of the week’s key events: legal troubles, new tokens, platform innovations, and other reasons to rethink the meme coin market. Meme Coin Market Faces Sharp Decline This week’s meme coin market crash has been nothing short of dramatic, with the sector losing approximately 28% of its total value. The market cap now stands at $72.3 billion, a significant drop from last week’s figures. This plummet has been marked by massive liquidations, with estimates suggesting that between $2 billion and $8 billion worth of positions were liquidated across meme coin projects. In contrast to this downward trend, one token, FU, managed to maintain its value and defy the broader market sentiment. Other tokens in the meme coin space weren’t as lucky during this deep correction the market went through. This market correction really reflects the more volatile side of cryptocurrency. Legal Troubles for Pump(.)fun and a New $200M Raise Pump(.)fun, a meme coin that has caught the eye of many, is now dealing with a securities lawsuit that threatens to short-circuit its future. The lawsuit, which centers on the token’s $500 million in fees, draws attention to the increasing scrutiny that meme coins and their progenitors are under from regulators. Even as it deals with this lawsuit and its potential fallout, Pump(.)fun claims to bring in a steady revenue stream, suggesting that there still is demand for the meme coin despite the serious troubles it finds itself in. In a turn of unexpected events, Errol Musk, father of Elon Musk, has stepped into the meme coin arena, announcing plans to raise $200 million for a new token, MUSKIT. How much interest exists in the potential raise can be judged by the seemingly inevitable headline: “Errol Musk Enters Crypto with New Memecoin, MUSKIT.” However, when one digs a little deeper into the make-believe world of meme coins and the impending Doom Hut coming to a virtual reality headset near you, one realizes that MUSKIT probably has a better chance of being a hit than some of the other Musk-related tokens (like DOGE). As the creator of the Silk Road, Ross Ulbricht is well-known. Unfortunately, he is well-known for losing a significant sum of money in the cryptocurrency space. His loss, though, has implications for the rest of us. Ulbricht’s wallets took a $12 million hit—not just because of the usually unavoidable volatility of crypto, but because a new and presumably untested crypto token was mishandled in the price-setting process. Innovation in the Meme Coin Space In the midst of the chaos, some innovation still seems to be occurring within the meme coin sector. This week sees the debut of Flaunch(.)gg, a new platform that has a somewhat unique model for charging its users. It takes 100% developer fees from the user as per usual in the meme coin space. But it also enforces a 30-minute no-sell rule that’s meant to get its users to hold onto the coins for longer instead of just flipping them. In other developments, ACT, a coin lesser known in the meme world, has shot up 35% recently after striking a partnership with Unicorn Verse, something that experts are calling a positive turn for the token. WIF, on the other hand, has seen a steep decline, down 82% from its all-time high, showing that not every project is thriving in this turbulent market climate. Market Structure and Cross-Chain Activity The meme coin market has also been in flux this week, with various cross-chain activities and market movements catching the eye. TARDI, a relatively new meme coin, has been leading the SUI chain, up 60%, and standing out as one of the few tokens with substantial growth to report during the downturn. Meanwhile, Base, a network known for its meme coin activity, has seen some measures of resilience, with tokens like SKI and HENLO managing to hold their ground as the broader market faces headwinds. A meme coin that once stirred up a substantial amount of excitement, Bitcoin Runes, has taken a sharp downturn in value. This makes the current problems of the meme coin sector even more pronounced. On the other hand, Tron, a long-time secure presence in the crypto market, had very little movement in terms of what meme coins were doing. This indicates that Tron has a much more conservative business strategy in the meme coin sector. Week in Meme Coins: Market Drops 28%, Elon’s Dad Apes In! Pump(.)fun faces new lawsuit! Elon's dad plans $200M raise! Ulbricht wallets lose $12M! Let's unpack this chaotic week in memes 1/6 pic.twitter.com/WJpgUDUDWw — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) February 7, 2025 Market makers have also been accused, with some alleging that they have contributed to the market’s downward trajectory through orchestrated dumps. If these allegations prove true, the implications for the meme coin space could be considerable, as they would strike at the trust and transparency that investors expect and demand. The Bigger Picture: Memes vs. NFTs According to recent data from DeFiLlama, meme coins are still outperforming NFTs, even as the market struggles. DeFiLlama’s data shows that meme coins have consistently been leading the way in terms of returns. The returns have been significant enough for DeFiLlama to name meme coins as one of “the few bright spots in the crypto bear market.” Still, that doesn’t mean buying, selling, or trading meme coins is a good idea. Meme coins face some serious headwinds. Even leading meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin have faced significant sell-offs recently. However, the same report highlights significant interest in meme coins among the crypto community. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

From staking rewards to gaming payouts and a generous referral program, BTFD isn’t just a meme—it’s a movement. A Presale That’s Already Winning Presale phases matter because they set the foundation for future growth. BTFD has already proven its early-stage dominance with over $5.94 million raised and 69 billion tokens sold. The price has risen from $0.000004 to $0.00016, with a final listing price of $0.0006—meaning early buyers will see a 275% return before it even hits exchanges. Imagine putting in $7,500 at today’s presale price. That would buy you 46.875 million BTFD tokens . At launch, when the price hits $0.0006, that $7,500 turns into a cool $28,125. And that’s before any potential post-listing rally. Play, Stake, and Earn with BTFD BTFD isn’t just about holding—it’s about playing and staking your way to bigger gains. The Play-to-Earn (P2E) game launches in January 2025, allowing users to earn rewards while enjoying competitive gameplay. Meanwhile, staking rewards are set at 90% APY, rewarding long-term holders with compounding returns. Instead of waiting for price pumps, you can earn passive income just for holding. Referral Program: Earn Even More by Sharing the Hype One of BTFD’s most lucrative features is its referral program, which rewards users for bringing in new investors. Refer friends and earn 10% of the BTFD coins they purchase—if you land in the top 20 on the leaderboard, you get 10% of the raised amount in BTFD tokens. Friends who use your code and buy $50+ worth of BTFD get an extra 10% in tokens , giving them a bigger bag right from the start. The leaderboard resets each month, giving new users multiple chances to claim top spots and maximize earnings. This isn’t just an airdrop gimmick—it’s a real opportunity to stack tokens before launch. Dogwifhat (WIF): The Meme Coin That Took Over Meme coins come and go, but some turn into legends. Dogwifhat (WIF) was one of 2023’s biggest surprises, proving that community-driven tokens can outpace even the strongest fundamentals. WIF launched as an inside joke—a Shiba Inu wearing a pink beanie—but the joke quickly turned serious. It rocketed from obscurity to top-tier exchanges, generating massive wealth for early buyers. If you bought WIF early, you watched your money 100x. If you didn’t, well… you probably watched in agony as it made others rich. Why WIF Succeeded—and What It Means for BTFD Dogwifhat thrived because of timing, culture, and community momentum. It became a meme coin giant simply because people rallied behind it, proving that in crypto, narrative can be just as valuable as utility. That’s exactly what’s happening with BTFD now. While WIF caught fire because of a viral joke, BTFD is turning a legendary crypto phrase into an ecosystem. Meme culture is built into its DNA, and its presale success proves the hype is real. If WIF’s history has taught us anything, it’s this: Don’t fade meme coins with strong communities. And right now, BTFD’s community is stacking tokens like it’s Black Friday. Final Thoughts: Don’t Miss BTFD Like You Missed WIF If you sat on the sidelines while Dogwifhat made early buyers rich, you don’t have to make the same mistake again. BTFD is proving itself as one of the top new meme coins to buy today , and its combination of presale momentum, staking, gaming, and referral rewards makes it one of the most exciting opportunities in 2025. With only a few presale stages left, the time to secure your position is now—before BTFD goes live and the next wave of FOMO kicks in. Don’t wait until you’re looking back at this moment, thinking, “I should’ve bought BTFD when it was still cheap.” The 14th presale stage is live, and with every new phase, the price only goes up.

BTFD Coin is a new meme coin that has gained traction due to its high-yield staking rewards, Play-to-Earn game, and viral referral program that allows users to earn rewards by sharing their unique codes. With over $5.94 million raised and 10,300+ holders, BTFD is shaping up to be a major player in the meme coin space. 2. How does the BTFD referral program work? BTFD rewards users for referring others. If someone uses your referral code to buy $50+ in BTFD, they get an extra 10% bonus. If you rank in the top 20 referrers, you’ll receive 10% of the raised amount in BTFD tokens. 3. How much can I earn with BTFD if I invest today? At the current presale price of $0.00016, an investment of $7,500 would get you 46,875,000 BTFD tokens. When it lists at $0.0006, that same investment turns into $28,125—a 275% return before the post-launch rally. The post Missed Dogwifhat’s Millionaire-Making Surge?

According to a Financial Times report , the 142-year-old University of Austin is raising a $5 million Bitcoin fund as part of its $200 million endowment, making it the first U.S. university endowment to launch a dedicated Bitcoin fund. An endowment is a pool of donated funds that a university invests to generate returns over time. The additional revenue is typically used to support operational costs, scholarships, and research, among other use cases. The University of Austin’s Bitcoin fund will be structured as a long-term investment, with the university planning to hold Bitcoin for at least five years. Chad Thevenot, senior vice president for advancement at the university, emphasized that the institution sees Bitcoin as having “long-term value,” much like “stocks or real estate.” You might also like: Wyoming proposes Bitcoin investments for state funds Initially announced in May, the fund was first revealed when the University of Austin partnered with Bitcoin financial services firm Unchained. As part of the collaboration, Unchained is handling custody of the fund’s Bitcoin holdings. While the University of Austin is the first to launch a dedicated Bitcoin fund, it’s not the only university dipping into crypto . In October, Emory University in Georgia became the first U.S. college endowment to gain exposure to Bitcoin. As previously reported by crypto.news, the university disclosed a $15.1 million investment in Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Prior to that, Stanford University’s Blyth Fund disclosed allocating 7% of its portfolio to Bitcoin.

""I Think Listings…""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/cz-talks-binance-listings-as-tst-debate-continues-i-think-listings/,"Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the founder of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, has been on the agenda with the memecoin called TST, which he recently promoted, and lastly spoke about listings. Stating that decentralized exchanges DEXs automate token listings, CZ said that centralized exchanges CEXs should also list everything automatically like DEXs. CZ stated that the Binance listing process is also a bit broken, and that Binance announces listings four hours before the relevant token listing, which often leads to price fluctuations. CZ pointed out that after the listing announcement, the token price increased on DEXs, and then investors sold on CEXs. While CZ admitted that there was no definitive solution to the listings, he said investors should be careful. While CZ recently added that he no longer operates a CEX, his comments come amid ongoing controversy over Binance’s listing practices, including the recent listing of BNB-based memecoin TST. “Finally, as an observer, I think the Binance listing process is a bit broken. They announce it, then 4 hours later they list it. The notification period is necessary, but within those 4 hours, token prices go up on DEXs and then people sell on CEX… I'm not sure if there is a solution for this, just be careful. “I think CEX should list (almost) everything automatically, just like DEX.

On Sunday, CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski announced that the firm would “embrace crypto,” acknowledging that the company is among the last major fintech players to step into the digital asset space. He described the move as a significant milestone for Klarna’s expansion strategy. Siemiatkowski also reached out to the crypto community, asking for suggestions on how it should integrate crypto into its ecosystem. He noted the firm’s scale, saying that the firm serves 85m users worldwide, processes $100b in transaction volume, supports over 500 million merchants and has issued more than 1m cards. Ok. I give up. Klarna and me will embrace crypto! More to come Yes I know! This post will get a huge sigh and 2 views But it still feels historic. Last large fintech in the world to embrace it. Someone had to be last. And that’s a milestone as well of some sort… — Sebastian Siemiatkowski (@klarnaseb) February 8, 2025 The CEO noted that many people suggested full compliance as a major advantage. He pointed out that this marks a shift in perspective compared to a few years ago. Expanding Payments Ecosystem Includes Crypto Ambitions Klarna, best known for its “Buy Now, Pay Later” (BNPL) services, enables consumers to spread out payments over time without immediate interest charges. Beyond BNPL, Klarna provides a range of payment solutions for online shopping, including direct payments, installment plans, and pay-after-delivery options. The company also offers payment processing, financing and banking services, ensuring smoother and more flexible transactions between retailers and consumers. By integrating cryptocurrency payment options, Klarna could tap into a tech-savvy audience already engaged with digital assets. This move could help expand its user base and position Klarna at the forefront of fintech innovation. Klarna’s Crypto Foray and IPO Plans Shape Its Future Klarna has a track record of embracing cutting-edge financial solutions, including past ventures into cryptocurrency. In 2021, the company partnered with Swedish crypto broker Safello to integrate its open banking services into crypto trading. This collaboration enabled users to buy cryptocurrencies directly from their bank accounts, marking Klarna’s first step into the digital asset space. Klarna filed for an IPO with the US SEC in November, but the company has yet to announce the listing date or exchange venue. According to the Financial Times, Klarna is aiming for an April IPO with a $15b valuation, slightly higher than the $14.6b estimate Bloomberg reported earlier. If successful, this would mark one of the largest fintech public listings in recent years, positioning Klarna as a major player in the evolving digital payments sector. Meanwhile, Klarna has been dealing with internal leadership tensions. A Sifted report suggests a growing divide between CEO Siemiatkowski and co-founder Victor Jacobsson. At the end of last year, Klarna’s shareholders voted to remove board member Mikael Walther, a close ally of Jacobsson. The move signaled potential power shifts within the company’s senior management, adding another layer of complexity to its IPO ambitions.

Robert Kiyosaki Warns Of The “Greatest Depression” Ahead Robert Kiyosaki has long warned about economic instability , and he now believes his predictions are coming true. In a recent post on X, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author expressed concerns about an impending “Greater Depression.” He stressed that those without financial education will suffer the most. According to Kiyosaki, traditional education fails to prepare individuals for financial independence. He believes that colleges teach students to become employees rather than investors or entrepreneurs. Instead, he urges people to focus on financial literacy and entrepreneurship to safeguard their wealth in a downturn. Rich Dad Poor Dad’s Investment Strategy Advice The Rich Dad Poor Dad author has shared key advice for people to invest in assets that retain value during the market downturn. Some of his key recommendations include: Gold, Silver, and Bitcoin: Kiyosaki advocates for these assets as hedges against inflation and economic collapse. He has repeatedly emphasized their role in preserving wealth when fiat currencies weaken. Real Estate Investments: While real estate prices may crash, he suggests acquiring properties at discounted rates. However, he warns against investing in office buildings and small retail spaces, which might struggle to recover. Self-Sufficiency and Business Ventures: Robert Kiyosaki encourages people to start businesses that thrive during downturns. He mentions agriculture, such as raising chickens or growing vegetables, as resilient business ideas. Bitcoin In Focus Robert Kiyosaki has been an active supporter of Bitcoin, deeming it as a hedge against the economic downturn. Recently, Kiyosaki highlighted two key reasons why he favors BTC over the US dollar. In addition, in a recent X post, he also said: “WHY I bought more gold and Bitcoin. Answer: Owning gold and Bitcoin is smarter and safer than saving dollars.” In addition, this also resonates with other experts’ outlook, who also deems BTC as a safer haven during economic turmoil. However, despite that, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author has recently warned about a Bitcoin crash as Trump’s tariff plans dampen market sentiment. Top Traders Echoes Similar Sentiment To Robert Kiyosaki Echoing Robert Kiyosaki’s concerns, veteran trader Peter Brandt recently shared a grim economic forecast shared by Tic Toc. According to professional trader Tic Toc, the US has already entered a recession, with worsening conditions expected in the next two to three quarters. According to the trader’s prediction, the expected consequences include: Negative GDP growth. Large-scale layoffs across industries. Gold prices rising to $3,000. An oversupply of existing homes in the market. Source: tic toc, X However, it’s worth noting that despite the looming economic turmoil, Robert Kiyosaki remains optimistic. He believes the coming crisis presents a rare opportunity for those willing to adapt. Besides, he has reiterated his confidence in BTC as a hedge against the upcoming market crash.

The CAR memecoin attracted huge attention from crypto traders, scaling to a market cap of nearly $1 billion and a 24-hour average traded volume of over $703 million. According to the on-chain data analysis provided by Geckotaminal, the CAR memecoin, with a pooled SOL liquidity of over 7,531 coins, had more than 35k on-chain holders. Earlier snipers of the CAR memecoin registered more than 180k percent gains. Before @FA_Touadera posted the $CAR contract address, this guy accidentally spent 25 $SOL ($4,905) to buy 49.6M $CAR , which is worth over $40M at the peak! But unfortunately, he sold it all for only 30 $SOL ($5,957).

The move, however, faced immense challenges as the country’s political and infrastructure remain dilapidated. The country also attempted to launch a crypto initiative dubbed Sango Coin, which failed to take off. With the skepticism and pushback from the Bank of Central African States (BEAC) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the country’s bid to tap into Bitcoin went down the river. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Brazil’s B3 Strengthens Crypto Market with New Bitcoin and Altcoin Futures , Advantage Taken After observing the success of $CAR , I am proud to announce the launch of the Republic of Congo Token.

However, more than five Solana contracts were launched by Tshisekedi’s X account, leading to huge losses to the early investors. As it has been observed with several other celebrity X accounts, it is thought that Tshisekedi’s X account was potentially intentionally compromised to advertise the memecoin. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The market sentiment has been waning since the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump, with analysts predicting further losses. However, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is gaining traction due to its upside potential. PropiChain’s footprint in the crypto market is growing because of its desire to use innovative technologies to transform the $300 trillion real estate industry. The AI altcoin has raised over $2 million, setting the stage for a rally that will likely outperform Cardano and PEPE in 2025. Major PEPE Transactions Triggers Optimism The recent market dip has hit the majority of altcoins, including PEPE, very hard. PEPE is down 47% in the past month, although its yearly gains stand at 906%. Despite the downturn, the meme coin holders have something to smile about. A mysterious wallet address has withdrawn 375.35 billion PEPE worth $3.73 million from Binance. This move indicates interest in PEPE from whales, with many investors hoping that this transaction could turn the meme coin’s fortunes. An analyst claims that PEPE can only gain momentum if the broader crypto market turns bullish. Here is Why PropiChain is the Top Altcoin to Invest In PropiChain is positioning itself as the next best altcoin to buy as the market loses momentum. The AI altcoin is capitalizing on the demand for innovation in the real estate industry. Its major highlight is tokenization, a tool that supports fractional ownership. This model democratizes access to the real estate industry and enables retail traders to be a part of the $300 trillion industry. Apart from tokenization , PropiChain is using AI to bring much-needed innovation to the real estate industry. The platform uses smart contracts for automating transactions such as auto-leasing and lease renewals. Smart contracts eliminate the need for human intervention and reduce administrative costs, making real estate management more efficient. PropiChain is committed to security and transparency. This is evidenced by its smart contract audit with BlockAudit, a reputable blockchain security company. The third-party audit ensures the integrity of the platform by eliminating loopholes that bad actors can exploit, putting user funds and data at risk. Additionally, PCHAIN also turns to automated valuation models to offer accurate and fair property appraisals. This is a powerful feature that minimizes costs in real estate deals. A buyer and a seller on PropiChain will use this feature to get the pricing for the property in question. There is no need to pay appraisal fees to third parties. When a fair price is put in place, the deal is quickly closed due to the fairness of the pricing structure. Furthermore, PropiChain offers potential property buyers an immersive viewing experience through the metaverse . The engaging feature helps investors make informed decisions even from the comfort of their homes. PCHAIN Tipped to Outperform Pepe and Cardano Cardano and Pepe are losing strength, with analysts predicting more losses down the line. An analyst claims that investing in PCHAIN in the second round of its presale is as good as buying Cardano in early November. Cardano rose from $0.33 in November 2024 to $1.23, marking a 273% growth in less than 2 months. PCHAIN is tipped to surge 35,000% in 2025. PCHAIN Gear for Growth, Invest Today PropiChain is up 200% in the first two rounds of its presale, with investors expecting 35,000% gains after listing. The AI altcoin has already been listed on CoinMarketCap, a leading price aggregator site in the crypto industry. This move highlights its commitment to transparency. After raising over $2 million, PropiChain is gaining exposure and more capital is flowing into the AI altcoin. Join PropiChain’s presale today and grow a $1K investment into $350,000 while transforming the real estate industry.

Nonetheless, with SHIB now priced at $0.00001578 and PEPE at $0.059561, the journey to $1 continues to be a challenging ascent. In the meantime, a number of lesser-known cryptocurrencies are gathering momentum, demonstrating solid technical setups and practical use cases that might allow them to surpass the $1 mark ahead of SHIB or PEPE. Promising Penny Crypto Tokens Set for Significant Surge Although meme coins remain prevalent in speculative trading, blockchain projects that have strong fundamentals and real-world uses are drawing the attention of investors. The next four penny crypto coins show significant growth potential and may emerge as the next major breakout stars. 1. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Game-Changer in DeFi with Real-World Asset Tokenization Rexas Finance (RXS) revolutionizes the DeFi sector by enabling fractional ownership of conventional assets like real estate and precious metals through the use of blockchain technology. This advancement opens up access to valuable investments, eliminating obstacles that have traditionally limited typical investors. Now in its 12th presale phase, Rexas Finance has successfully raised $44.1 million and distributed 440.5 million tokens. The RXS token is priced at $0.200, while its official launch price is established at $0.250, scheduled for June 2025. Buyers with a preference of early-stage cryptocurrencies still have the chance to obtain RXS at a lower price before it is broadly accessible on major exchanges. Moreover, the CertiK certification of Rexas Finance and its expanding community enhance trust in its sustainability, establishing it as a one of best new cryptocurrencies to watch in the DeFi sector. Rexas finance tokenomics 2. Chiliz (CHZ): Crypto Coin Breaks Out of 3.5-Year Falling Wedge Chiliz (CHZ), emerges as a crypto coin, popular for high engagement of fans in entertainment and sports. Recently, the CHZ experienced a technical breakout of a 3.5-year falling wedge—a bullish reversal pattern. This demonstrations an end to its lengthy correction phase, and the start of a new upward trajectory. Important historical stages of Chiliz: Discovery (2019): Achieved market recognition. Sharp Correction (2020): Faced a notable decline because of wider market circumstances. Momentum (2021): Experienced a rise during the cryptocurrency bull market. Flat Correction (2022–Present): Began a period of price stabilization and consolidation. With resistance levels being analyzed for the first time since 2021, analysts predict a potential increase surpassing $0.40. Should this upward momentum continue, CHZ could eventually exceed the $1 mark, by increasing acceptance in the sports and entertainment industries. 3. XDC Network (XDC) Targets $0.1814: Breakout Could Lead to $0.34122 XDC Network (XDC) has experienced a notable surge, rising by nearly 105% year-to-date, to trade today at $0.09046. The crypto coins performance indicates a possible breakout, which might result in additional profits. Market analysts suggest that if XDC breaks through its $0.1814 resistance point, the next significant target will be $0.34122. Considering its robust fundamentals and rising adoption in trade finance and decentralized applications, XDC is poised for sustained growth in the long run. The token’s upward trend offers an appealing opportunity as one of best cryptos to buy , for investors eager to benefit from its rising momentum. XDC Network (XDC) price chart 4. Coti (COTI): Crypto Coins Primed for Midterm Recovery Coti (COTI) is currently consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, a formation that often precedes significant price breakouts. The crypto coin has been reacting to its rising trendline, indicating strong buying pressure at key support levels. If COTI successfully breaks through the upper trendline, it could initiate a strong upward move toward its $0.50 target. Given its role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and payment systems, COTI remains a solid bet for midterm growth, with the potential to reach $1 as adoption increases. Final Thoughts While SHIB and PEPE continue to capture attention in the meme coin sector, projects like Rexas Finance, Chiliz, XDC Network, and Coti offer real-world utility and strong technical setups that could drive them toward the $1 milestone faster. With blockchain innovation shaping the future of DeFi and digital assets, these penny crypto coins present promising opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on the next wave of crypto market growth.

Here’s the Destination,https://timestabloid.com/trader-sends-3-36-trillion-shib-heres-the-destination/,"A substantial transaction involving 3.36 trillion Shiba Inu tokens has been detected on the blockchain. The transfer was reported by Whale Alert, which reported both wallets as unknown wallets. However, the sender has been identified as GnosisSafeProxy. The movement of such a significant volume of SHIB has drawn attention, particularly as the sender’s balance has been reduced to zero. Transaction Breakdown The transaction, which took place at 12:25 p.m. (UTC) yesterday, involved the transfer of exactly 3,368,549,976,020 SHIB, valued at approximately $51.15 million at the time of execution. Following this transfer, the receiving wallet now holds the entirety of the SHIB sent, making it the dominant asset in that wallet’s portfolio. On-chain data further reveals that the recipient address also contains 13,381 ETH, worth around $35.2 million. With three different cryptocurrencies in its balance, SHIB remains the most valuable asset by dollar value in this wallet. The purpose behind this transaction remains uncertain. With the recent resurgence in whale activity across prominent ecosystems like XRP, one could infer that whales are preparing for something big. However, this transaction could also be a strategic relocation of funds for security reasons or a routine transfer between private parties outside of an exchange. There has been no official information to clarify the exact motive behind the transaction. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Recent Whale Movements and Performance This is not the first time a substantial volume of Shiba Inu tokens has changed hands. On February 5, another significant transaction saw an anonymous entity withdraw 1.24 trillion SHIB from the Kraken exchange into another anonymous wallet. Such large withdrawals from exchanges typically suggest that holders intend to store the tokens long-term rather than trade them in the short term. The recent transfer also follows reports indicating increased accumulation of SHIB by large holders. Recent data from IntoTheBlock shows that whales have acquired approximately 6.33 trillion tokens since the beginning of the year, with 840 billion of these purchases occurring in February alone. This trend suggests sustained interest from major investors despite recent price fluctuations. Despite these notable transactions, the cryptocurrency has been experiencing a downtrend mirroring the broader market. The digital asset is trading at $0.00001589, down 12.03% from last week. However, it has experienced an increase of approximately 6% over the past 24 hours, suggesting the bearish phase could be over.

BNB Chain-based TST token, issued as a memecoin by the blockchain’s community following a tutorial video on how to issue tokens, zoomed to a $300 million market capitalization as Binance founder Changpeng Zhao referred to the token in several X posts — with it even gaining a coveted Binance listing on Sunday. Zhao, who stepped from a formal role at the company last year, said Sunday that he wasn’t for or against memecoins, and the category’s “fun” element makes it appealing for short-term traders. “Things with clear tangible value are harder to speculate on. They stay around the clear value,” Zhao said. “This is indeed a challenge for RWA. Memes are fun, etc. It’s a cultural thing. I am not an expert in this area. There are plenty of die-hard defenders of memes. Don’t go against the community.” Barstool’s Portnoy Buys “JAILSTOOL” David Portnoy, the influential founder of Barstool Sports, jumped into the memecoin fray on Friday with a coin called ""Montoya por favor,"" inspired by a contestant from the Spanish reality show La Isla De Las Tentaciones. Portnoy told his 3.5 million X followers that he was ""up a billion percent"" on his first foray into the meme tokens, helping the coins surge to a market capitalization of $14 million at its peak before plummeting down to a $1 million cap within a few hours. He has now set his sights on a Josh Allen MVP coin with a playful warning, ""Buy at your own risk. I just bought it. I’m gonna sell it. Don’t buy what ya can’t lose."" That coin also shot up, hitting a market cap of over $12 million, before nosediving to a capitalization under $100,000. Market watchers on X accused him of leading his massive following into a pump-and-dump scheme. But Portnoy defended his trading spree, claiming transparency and even humorously questioning if his actions could land him in jail. Someone then issued the JAILSTOOL token, a nod to Portnoy’s tweet…which Portnoy then purchased and promoted to his followers. “I may dump it eventually but I’ll let all you righteous losers dump on each other first. So don’t put in more than you can lose,” he quipped. JAILSTOOL surged from $1.2 million to over $200 million at peak, even gaining a spot listing on U.S.-based Kraken on Sunday. It trades at 8 cents in Asian afternoon hours on Monday at a $78 million market capitalization. Suspicions Rise as Central African Republic’s President Issues a Token Here's where the meme frenzy gets wild — an entire African country has decided to get in on the fun as the Central African Republic apparently issued its CAR memecoin over the weekend. CAR launched with a promise to aid in national development and to put one of the poorest countries “on the world stage,” its president said on X. The token's market cap soared to around $527 million shortly after issuance, nearly a fourth of the country’s GDP of $2.6 billion. “As the second president in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, I have always recognized the potential of crypto and its benefits on a global scale,” Faustin-Archange Touadéra said, linking to CAR’s website. But suspicions abound around CAR’s issuance, with the site’s domain provider taking it down late Sunday and some X users allegeding Touadéra’s video to be a deepfake. Solana decentralized exchange Jupiter said early Monday it had reached out to CAR representations for further validity of the token and its official connection to the country. Jupiter said it was able to verify the token’s deployers using an onchain transaction, but further confirmation and exact relation to the president’s office remain pending as of Asian afternoon hours.",Markets|meme coin|meme economy|Africa,EN,0,0,MARKET|BNB|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-10 07:44:33

She is the first female vice president and the highest-ranking female politician in the U.S. Kamala was Born in Oakland, California, and graduated from Howard University with a degree in political science and economics, and later pursued her law degree from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law. As a politician, she implemented stricter laws, the DREAM Act, and federal legalization of cannabis, healthcare, and taxation reform. Harris secured enough non-binding support from delegates to become the speculative nominee of the Democratic Party. Vice President was considered by most crypto enthusiasts to be a turning point in the journey of the crypto industry. It was expected that Trump would introduce several crypto-friendly policies. To an extent, the Trump administration has managed to live up to these general expectations. However, some recent economic policies of his administration, related to tariffs, have indirectly affected the cryptocurrency sector. The big question now is: Has the crypto industry really benefited from the political change in the US? Trump’s Tariff Announcement and Its Immediate Impact The newly inducted Trump administration on February 9 jolted the global economy with a new tariff move. More importantly, this time, it targeted the global aluminum and steel industry. It imposed a 25% tariff on aluminium and steel. According to the International Trade Administration’s Global Steel Trade Monitor report, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, South Korea, Russia, Japan, Germany, Turkey, Vietnam, and Taiwan are the top ten countries that export steel to the US. Meanwhile, as per the same report, Canada, Mexico, China, Italy, India, Belgium, Malta, Brazil, Germany, and South Korea are the top countries that import steel from the US. Yesterday, the total market cap of the cryptocurrency market declined sharply by around 0.32%. However, lately, the market has shown strong signs of recovery. Today, the market has grown by nearly 0.64%. Notably, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has decreased from 46 to 43, indicating that the recovery has failed to make any positive impact on investor confidence. Bitcoin and Ethereum Price Fluctuations Between February 8 and 9, the Bitcoin market declined by at least 0.040%. More importantly, at one point on February 9, the BTC price reached as low as $94,715.39. Today, the Bitcoin price has seen a surge of 0.51%. Yesterday, the Ethereum market slipped by approximately 0.20%. The market has not yet fully recovered from the correction, although today the Ethereum price has increased by 0.12%. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Red Alert: Trump’s 25% Tariff on Metals Shakes Markets, XRP and Dogecoin Suffer Major Losses , Trump’s Tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China and Their Market Impact This is not the first time that Trump has sent shockwaves through the global market with a tariff announcement. On February 1, the Trump administration imposed a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico, and a 10% tariff on China. On February 3, the administration paused the tariff action that it had initiated against Canada and Mexico. Meanwhile, the administration’s action against China escalated to a severe trade war, with China imposing a counter-tariff of 15% on selected US goods. It is possible that the administration could reinstate its tariff policy against its neighbours after the offered 30-day pause ends. At the start of February 1, the crypto market’s total market cap was at $3.45T. On February 2, it touched as low as 3.19T. Although on February 3 it rebounded to $3.29T, between February 4 and 7, the market slipped from $3.29T to 3.09T. The market has not yet recovered from the correction. Currently, the market cap stands at $3.12T. Potential Future Tariffs and Crypto Market Risks Reports suggest that the Trump administration may impose similar tariffs on semiconductors, oil, gas and copper. There are also rumours that the administration may impose a tariff on the European Union as well. If Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President continues with his tariff plans, the crypto market, especially Bitcoin and Ethereum , could face significant impacts. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The top contenders are Avalanche (AVAX) and Remittix (RTX) , with many analysts arguing that these tokens can outperform established coins like Solana (SOL). With significant advancements, AVAX and Remittix are drawing attention for their innovative features and market positioning. Avalanche (AVAX): A Rising Star in Blockchain Technology Avalanche is famous for its quick transactions and scalability. AVAX price stands at $25.05 after escaping the volatility of the market. Last month, the AVAX price increased by 13.28%, indicating a possible rally heading into the altcoin season. Experts point to Avalanche’s distinctive consensus mechanism. Unlike Solana or Ethereum, Avalanche enables thousands of transactions with finality in seconds and is used in decentralized finance (DeFi) and enterprise solutions. Experts think the AVAX price will rise as more projects migrate to the Avalanche network, which offers flexibility and lower transaction fees. With Ethereum gas fees fluctuating, Avalanche’s low pricing has attracted investors and developers. Remittix (RTX): The Future of Cross-Border Payments Remittix (RTX) almost exceeded $11.5 million in its ICO in a few months. The platform seeks to transform the banking system by allowing fast, safe and affordable cross-border payments. While cryptocurrency becomes mainstream, Remittix is attempting to plug a void in the marketplace by enabling people to convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into FIAT currency and fund any account worldwide within 24 hours. A key feature of Remittix is that it targets the unbanked. According to the World Bank, around 1.4 billion people worldwide lack access to conventional banking methods, but some own mobile phones and use crypto wallets. Remittix allows these folks to send and receive payments without going through traditional banks. Partnering with services like Western Union, Remittix is giving millions of dollars a lifeline to cash in underserved places. Additionally, Remittix is attracting interest from businesses that accept cryptocurrency payments. With the Remittix Pay API, merchants accept crypto payments, convert them to fiat currency in a split second, avoid the headaches of fluctuating crypto prices and complicated accounting methods. This solution appeals most to online businesses, overseas companies, and service providers who wish to incorporate cryptocurrency into their everyday activities without the volatility related to electronic assets. The Remittix platform is also integrated with Ethereum and other leading blockchain networks. As the worldwide need for quicker, cheaper cross-border payments elevates, Remittix is likely to be a significant player in the remittance market. Presale token performance indicates that the market is interested in this new solution, and Remittix is anticipated to grow significantly once fully launched. Solana (SOL): A Strong Contender with Scaling Challenges Although Solana remains a hotshot in the crypto space, trading at $202.06 at press time, the token faces challenges that may affect its performance in the coming altcoin season. Solana is characterized by high throughput and low-cost transactions; however, the network scalability has been under review, and the Solana price has increased. Even with major advances in network upgrades like Solana’s v1.10 update, the system has experienced regular outages and delays and is uncertain about its future reliability. Several experts think the Solana price growth might slow down if the network suffers performance problems. However, as more scalable platforms like Avalanche and brand-new presale tokens like Remittix emerge, Solana might compete for investor attention more fiercely. Join the Remittix Presale Today As the altcoin season draws near, the competition between Solana, Avalanche, and emerging presale tokens like Remittix is heating up. While Solana and Avalanche continue to be major players, Remittix is seen as having the potential to outperform established coins in the coming months. Remittix’s innovative cross-border payment solutions position it to become a top contender in the altcoin market. For investors, this is a time to stay informed and consider the long-term growth potential of these tokens. With AVAX price surging and new technologies on the horizon, presale token opportunities like Remittix could offer significant returns as the crypto market evolves. Whether you’re tracking Solana price trends or watching AVAX price movements, it’s clear that the future of altcoins is looking increasingly competitive.

The prices of the top tokens, like Bitcoin, have remained unchanged through out the weekend, which suggested a drop in the traders confidence and interest. Or, in another perspective, they might be waiting for the right time to enter as the markets are expected to be volatile for the rest of the week ahead of the U.S. CPI rates. The Bitcoin liquidation levels have a deep impact on the upcoming price action in the short term. After the recent liquidity grab at the support squashing the short trades, the BTC price experienced a decent rise from the levels around $94,500 to the current levels. Meanwhile, the price is heading towards a crucial price range, which may again trigger a liquidation and this time it could be in the opposite direction. The data from Coinglass suggests the token experienced a short liquidation of around $100M at around $95,000 and now another pile of around $200M is waiting for the token if it rises above $97,800. These longs are set to grab the liquidity at these levels, which may cause a short-term pullback, probably close to the $95,500 range. However, the technicals have turned bullish, which suggests the price may continue with a steep ascending trend if it manages to surpass the pivotal zone. The short-term price action suggests the price is poised for a small pullback as the bulls seem to have exhausted their strength. The stochastic RSI has reached the overbough levels and is preparing for a bearish crossover. This cold drags the levels to the support of the descending triangle and remains consolidated with the pattern until it reaches it’s apex. However, in the long term, the 50-day MA at $98,700 acts as a strong resistance and a rise above these levels may validate the beginning of a fresh bullish trend. Therefore, in the coming days, the Bitcoin (BTC) price may continue to chop around a narrow range as the fresh liquidity may enter only after the longs grab their liquidity at $98,000.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-10 07:54:26

With its innovative cross-chain transaction capabilities, exceptional $2 million presale, and real-world utility through crypto debit cards, 1Fuel is rapidly capturing investor attention. As XRP faces increasing selling pressure, could 1Fuel be the dark horse that dominates the market in 2025? Let’s find out! XRP’s February struggle: Will it break or bounce? XRP, the Ripple network’s native cryptocurrency, has been experiencing significant negative pressure recently, pushing XRP price to fall to a monthly low. A key indicator, the Price Daily Active Addresses (DAA) Divergence, is presently showing a sell signal, indicating a risky price trend. Additionally, the declining trading volume suggests a lack of faith in the altcoin’s near-term price prospects. In simple terms, the decline in market activity indicates that investors are backing away from XRP. Adding to the bearish attitude, XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has fallen to a three-month low, indicating that selling pressure is increasing. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.40, with a weekly loss of 7.3%, but, remaining above its critical support level of $2.33. This support zone has become essential for XRP. If XRP remains above this level, it will soon rebound. However, if the price falls below $2.33, it might spark a major decline to the next key support level of $1.94, compounding investors’ losses. 1Fuel (OFT) steals the spotlight: Next big crypto play? While the once-leading crypto project, XRP, struggles with regaining its momentum, the crypto market is now eyeing an upcoming project, 1Fuel (OFT) , which has taken over the crypto world owing to its cutting-edge features and massive returns potential. With its ground-breaking one-click cross-chain transactions feature, 1Fuel aims to streamline cryptocurrency transactions. Users will be able to trade across numerous networks with this feature by only selecting the asset of their choice, leaving the complex process to be handled by 1Fuel. Both newbie and seasoned traders and investors have been drawn to this feature. An integrated peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange in this upcoming wallet and DEX, further ups the ante by enabling direct asset transfers without the need for middlemen. This stands in line with their principle of complete decentralization by giving its users complete control over their assets. Furthermore, 1Fuel’s physical and virtual debit and credit cards will soon be launched, enabling users to conveniently utilize their cryptocurrency holdings like regular cash. This is anticipated to bridge the gap between the traditional finance and the digital finance world for once and all. The hottest ICO of 2025? 1Fuel’s adoption says yes 1Fuel (OFT) is currently in its presale phase and has proved itself as a leading ICO in recent times. The presale is in its 4th round and has already collected over $2 million in funding. Around 200,000,000 OFT tokens have been already sold. These numbers reflect the widespread adoption of this platform which has not even launched yet. Each OFT token is being sold for a mere $0.018 price point, already generating over 80% returns for its early backers. Analysts are predicting over 100x return potential once the coin hits the public exchanges, being the dark horse this year. Final thoughts XRP may be facing turbulence, but 1Fuel is on an entirely different trajectory. With its seamless cross-chain transactions, a fully decentralized P2P exchange, and real-world utility through its upcoming crypto debit cards, this project is redefining how we interact with digital assets. The presale is already delivering massive gains, and analysts predict an even bigger breakout when OFT hits exchanges. Don’t miss out!

The effects of this “extreme positioning” were seen earlier this month when crypto markets crashed , hitting Ethereum hard. The asset dumped 37% in 60 hours as Trump’s trade war headlines emerged. “It felt almost like the flash crash seen in stocks in 2010, but with no headlines,” it added. Ethereum Short Squeeze Despite all the negativity and buildup of short positions, Ethereum ETFs added $2 billion in new funds in December while achieving a record weekly inflow of $854 million. Trading volume has been strong, with spikes after Inauguration Day and the February crash, Kobeissi noted. Previous concerns about SEC classifying ETH as a security appear to be diminishing. The Trump Administration seems supportive of ETH , and Eric Trump’s positive comment about ETH briefly affected prices last week. Nevertheless, Ethereum is still trading 46% down from its November 2021 all-time high, which begs the question, “Why are hedge funds so dedicated to shorting Ethereum?” What is happening with Ethereum? Short positioning in Ethereum is now up +40% in ONE WEEK and +500% since November 2024. Never in history have Wall Street hedge funds been so short of Ethereum, and it’s not even close. What do hedge funds know is coming? (a thread) pic.twitter.com/knsyOhYyyt — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) February 9, 2025 There is a strong possibility of a short squeeze due to the extreme level of short positioning, the large gap between Bitcoin and Ethereum’s performance, and BTC being up approximately 12 times more than ETH over the past year or so. A short squeeze occurs when a heavily shorted asset like ETH starts to rise in price, forcing short sellers to cover their positions by buying back the asset to cut their losses. This buying pressure then pushes the asset even higher, forcing more short sellers to cover, creating a rapid upward spiral in price. Given the reported 500% increase in ETH short positions over the past three months, a short squeeze could be particularly dramatic. With so many short positions, this could create massive buying pressure, driving the price up very quickly and potentially closing some of that gap with Bitcoin’s performance. The impact could be especially significant because institutional investors holding these large short positions typically use leverage, which means they might need to cover their positions quickly if the market moves against them, potentially amplifying the squeeze effect. However, it should be noted that while short squeezes can cause dramatic price increases, these are often temporary, and the price may settle back down after the squeeze plays out. End of Altseason? Back to the current situation, ETH prices continue to crumble as the asset has lost 17% over the past fortnight. ETH dipped to an intraday low of $2,540 before a minor recovery to trade at $2,630 at the time of writing. However, traders and analysts have spotted similarities in chart patterns, noting that February has been historically bullish for ETH. Ethereum is mirroring 2020’s breakout structure.

In a new strategy session, pseudonymous analyst Cheds tells his 49,600 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin appears to be currently trading in a sideways trend with a well-defined resistance at $107,000 and a clear support level at $90,000. But Cheds says that Bitcoin bulls need to defend the critical support area as the $90,000 price level keeps BTC’s strong uptrend intact. He highlights that there’s no stopping BTC from going all the way down to the low $70,000 level if the support crumbles. “I think if Bitcoin loses $90,000, and you’ve heard me, I don’t think $78,000 is holding. I mean if we lose $90,000, we’re going to probably $74,000. That’s a high-confidence call and then probably $72,000… There’s no way it’s going to hold $85,000 or $78,000. The importance of [$90,000] cannot be understated. You have classical charting, multiple interactions. You have time interval between interactions. You have price distance peak to trough. It’s all in the context of an uptrend and losing this level would be a severe momentum blow. There’s going to be no pausing between here and $72,000 to $74,000.” Source: Cheds/YouTube At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $96,231, a fractional increase on the day.

Historically, Ethereum’s rallies have triggered capital rotations into smaller assets, but its recent underperformance has stalled market momentum. However, with key upgrades like Pectra and rising institutional demand, Ethereum’s breakout seems inevitable, likely setting the stage for an altcoin resurgence in line with the coveted 4-year cycle. Set to capitalize on this rise, Rollblock is emerging as a high-potential iGaming project, combining blockchain security with a plethora of entertainment options. With over 7,000 games, sports betting for major events, and a thriving play-to-earn model, Rollblock is attracting both players and investors in equal stead. Read on to learn more. Exploring Rollblock Rollblock RBLK’s Bullish Potential During The Presale Rollblock is revolutionizing online gaming with its advanced ERC-20 platform, blending security, innovative rewards, and immense growth potential for users and investors alike. The platform features an extensive library of 7,000+ games, spanning classic favorites like poker and blackjack to cutting-edge blockchain-based experiences. With the recent launch of sports betting and an ambitious roadmap set to introduce a dozen more games in early 2025, Rollblock is rapidly attracting a growing audience in 2025. December alone saw $1.75 million in wagers, and Q1 2025 could easily shatter new records. Rollblock’s play-to-earn model rewards users for engagement, turning gaming into a profitable experience. Players earn RBLK tokens through wagers, tournaments, and in-game achievements, with 60% of tokens bought back and burned to sustain value. With a SolidProof audit and an Anjouan Gaming license, Rollblock ensures full compliance and transparency while utilizing AI-driven encryption to provide top-tier security. These factors have helped the platform amass a loyal following of over 40,000 members, even at this early stage of its presale. Investors Await Altcoin Season Amid Some Bullish News For Ethereum Ethereum has faced extreme volatility, plunging 25% within minutes and wiping out over $600 million in liquidations earlier this week. Initially, the drop was attributed to Trump’s trade tariffs, but with agreements delaying their impact, the real cause appears to be mass liquidations and strategic market manipulation by whales and exchanges. Despite this turmoil, Ethereum has managed a 7% rebound within 24 hours, stabilizing around $2,830. Notably, Eric Trump’s tweet calling Ethereum a strong buy coincided with a rapid 35% bounce, drawing speculation over his influence on market sentiment, as speculations mount over Donald Trump’s next move following his unprecedented TRUMP meme coin launch. Amid these price swings, Ethereum has quietly implemented a major network upgrade, raising its gas limit for the first time since 2021. This enhancement increases transaction capacity, reduces congestion, and improves the overall efficiency of smart contracts and staking on the Ethereum network. Coupled with the upcoming Pectra upgrade in March, Ethereum is positioning itself as a more scalable and developer-friendly network. As Ethereum’s struggles have left the broader altcoin market stagnant, its historical role in leading past alt seasons cannot be ignored. Analysts argue that for a true altcoin surge to occur, Ethereum must regain strength and attract capital back into established Layer-1 ecosystems. With institutional demand for Ethereum ETFs growing and network upgrades improving usability, a decisive recovery could trigger the long-awaited altseason, allowing Ethereum to reclaim its dominance in the space. The good news is that Ethereum looks poised for a major resurrection, albeit slightly delayed in comparison to the previous two bull runs in 2021 and 2017. Don’t Miss Out On Rollblock RBLK!
