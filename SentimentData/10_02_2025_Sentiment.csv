With thousands of tokens available, identifying the real opportunities can be challenging. Crypto isn’t just a trend—it’s transforming finance, offering unique investment potential. Choosing the right projects is key to maximizing gains and avoiding missed opportunities. Qubetics has recently emerged as a prominent name in the blockchain space. Far beyond a conventional cryptocurrency token, it serves as a comprehensive ecosystem designed to revolutionize asset ownership, trading, and monetization. By seamlessly integrating multiple blockchains and advanced financial tools, Qubetics enhances accessibility, security, and efficiency in decentralized transactions. But Qubetics isn’t the only big player in town. Heavyweights like Solana and Astra have already carved out their spots in the crypto hall of fame. Solana is revolutionizing blockchain speed, making it a go-to for DeFi and gaming, while Astra is ensuring regulatory compliance for decentralized finance. So, if you’re wondering which of these cryptos is the best to join this month, let’s dive into what makes them stand out. Qubetics: Redefining Real-World Asset Ownership Qubetics isn’t just another altcoin. It’s a game-changer in asset ownership, using blockchain technology to tokenize real-world assets. Imagine a world where owning a share of a skyscraper, a rare piece of art, or even a luxury car is as easy as buying Bitcoin. That’s what Qubetics is making possible. At its core, Qubetics is building a Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace, allowing businesses, professionals, and individuals to convert physical assets into blockchain-based tokens. This isn’t some futuristic dream—it’s happening right now. A real estate developer wants to raise capital for a new apartment complex. Instead of dealing with banks or big investors, they tokenize the property on Qubetics, allowing everyday investors to buy fractional ownership in the building. Suddenly, real estate investment isn’t just for the ultra-rich. The same goes for collectibles, fine art, and even businesses looking to sell equity in a decentralized way. Qubetics is proving that investors are hungry for blockchain-backed asset ownership, and the numbers tell the whole story. With over $12.3 million raised in its presale, more than 466 million $TICS tokens sold, and a growing community of 19,200+ token holders, Qubetics is gaining serious traction. Currently priced at $0.0667 in Stage 20 of the presale, the momentum is undeniable. These milestones aren’t just impressive—they signal massive adoption on the horizon. As demand for real-world asset tokenization grows, Qubetics is positioning itself as a leader in this evolving market. Solana: The High-Speed Blockchain Powerhouse If you’ve been in crypto for a while, you’ve probably heard the phrase “Ethereum killer.” While many projects have made that claim, Solana is one of the few that actually has the tech to back it up. Known for blazing-fast transactions and dirt-cheap fees, Solana has become a go-to blockchain for DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and even Web3 gaming projects. While Ethereum struggles with high gas fees and network congestion, Solana is cruising along with its Proof of History (PoH) mechanism, processing thousands of transactions per second. Solana isn’t just hype—it’s delivering real results. In 2024, Solana-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs) outpaced Ethereum’s DEX volume, hitting a 24-hour trading volume of $3.8 billion compared to Ethereum’s $1.7 billion. That’s a big deal. Right now, Solana’s native token SOL is trading around $198.81, but many analysts believe it could soar to $700 or beyond by the end of 2025. Why? Because Solana isn’t just competing with Ethereum—it’s eating into its market share. For investors looking for the best cryptos to join this month, Solana remains a strong contender due to its scalability, growing ecosystem, and increasing institutional interest. Astra: Bringing Compliance to DeFi While DeFi is all about decentralization, there’s one thing most projects struggle with—compliance. Governments worldwide are tightening their grip on crypto regulations, and many DeFi platforms could be in trouble if they don’t find a way to play by the rules. That’s where Astra comes in. Astra is the first decentralized compliance protocol, ensuring that DeFi platforms meet regulatory requirements while still keeping things decentralized. Think of it as a security guard for the wild world of DeFi, making sure everything is above board while still allowing users to benefit from decentralized finance. Regulatory uncertainty is one of the biggest threats to crypto’s mainstream adoption. Without proper compliance measures, DeFi could face massive crackdowns. Astra provides a decentralized KYC (Know Your Customer) solution, ensuring that DeFi platforms can onboard users without violating laws. Currently, Astra’s native token ASTRA is trading at about $0.0016, with steady growth in adoption. While it’s not as flashy as Solana or Qubetics, Astra is solving a major problem that could shape the future of crypto regulation. Conclusion If you’re looking for the best cryptos to join this month, Qubetics , Solana, and Astra each bring something unique. Qubetics’ real-world asset tokenization marketplace unlocks new investment opportunities beyond traditional crypto. Solana dominates the high-speed blockchain space, offering low fees and lightning-fast transactions as a strong Ethereum competitor. Meanwhile, Astra tackles one of crypto’s biggest hurdles—DeFi compliance, ensuring security and regulatory adherence as oversight tightens. While all three projects have strong fundamentals, Qubetics is the clear frontrunner. With its booming presale, real-world asset integration, and bullish price predictions, $TICS is shaping up to be a top crypto investment in 2025.

Qubetics is the first Web3 aggregator focused on real-world asset tokenization, allowing individuals and businesses to tokenize everything from real estate to collectibles. Why is Solana growing so fast? Solana’s low fees, high speed, and developer-friendly ecosystem make it a favorite for DeFi, NFTs, and gaming applications, giving it an edge over competitors like Ethereum. How does Astra help with crypto regulations? Astra provides decentralized compliance solutions, ensuring that DeFi platforms meet KYC and regulatory requirements while maintaining decentralization.

Bitcoin & XRP Investors Are Going ALL IN on These Coins!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/from-1000-to-a-private-island-bitcoin-xrp-investors-are-going-all-in-on-these-coins/,"From Bitcoin’s Ascent to THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s Breakthrough THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is capturing attention as the next big win in the crypto market, even as Bitcoin (BTC) celebrates its historic milestone of crossing $100,000. While Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate the DeFi space and Ripple (XRP) solidifies its position in cross-border payments, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven to be the standout investment. With $1.5 million raised in minutes during its presale, it has cemented its position as the ultimate opportunity of 2025. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is the Next Big Opportunity 1. Exceptional Market Demand In its presale, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN raised over $1.5 million almost instantly. This level of investor enthusiasm reflects the token’s high growth potential and positions it as the next major crypto to watch. 2. Deflationary Tokenomics With a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN creates scarcity that directly drives value. Its deflationary model offers early investors significant advantages, surpassing the gradual inflationary nature of tokens like APT and INJ. 3. Exclusive Availability Unlike BTC and ETH, which are traded on virtually every platform, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN . This exclusivity creates a controlled market environment, driving demand and making it an excellent choice for early adopters. How It Compares to Other Top Cryptos Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin may have hit $100K, but its market is mature, making THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN a stronger choice for exponential returns. Ethereum (ETH): A leader in smart contracts, ETH offers stability, but it lacks the exclusivity and early-stage growth of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Aptos (APT): Aptos focuses on scalability but hasn’t captured the same market excitement as this token. Injective Protocol (INJ): INJ excels in DeFi but cannot compete with the overwhelming momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Seize the Opportunity Now Bitcoin’s success paved the way for standout cryptos like THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN to dominate the market. With limited supply, overwhelming demand, and exclusive availability, it’s the ultimate choice for investors seeking the next big win.

The co-founder of Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, shared his usual Sunday Bitcoin chart on X today, teasing yet another purchase set for Monday. “Death to the blue lines. Long live the green dots,” Saylor said to his 4.1 million followers in the post, hinting at an end to the brief one-week pause in Bitcoin buying. Death to the blue lines. Long live the green dots. pic.twitter.com/SOtFHRoykd — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) February 9, 2025 Strategy, according to tracking platform SaylorTracker, currently holds 471,107 BTC. That stash is valued at $45.3 billion and includes the company’s January 27 addition of 10,107 BTC before the pause. Rebrand puts Bitcoin front and center On February 5, MicroStrategy shed its old identity and officially became Strategy and leaned into its Bitcoin-first reputation by adopting a Bitcoin logo. The company swapped its branding colors for Bitcoin-themed ones and made sure its marketing screamed pro-Bitcoin at every turn. Phong Le, Strategy’s CEO, said: “Bitcoin and artificial intelligence are the two most transformative technologies of the twenty-first century. Our new name powerfully, and simply, conveys the universal and global appeal of our company.” Strategy released its Q4 2024 earnings report on the same day it announced the rebrand and its software business pulled in $120.7 million in revenue—a 3% year-over-year drop. More notably, they posted a $640 million net loss for the quarter. Regardless, Q4 2024 became the company’s most aggressive quarter yet, with 218,887 Bitcoins worth $20.5 billion added to their pile. During the earnings call, Strategy presented shareholders with its roadmap for Bitcoin gains in 2025. They pointed to major catalysts, including the possibility of regulatory clarity in the US, stronger political support for digital assets, and improvements to Bitcoin ETFs as well as institutional investors. On August 7, 2024, Strategy split both Class A and Class B shares 10-for-1, which slashed entry costs for new investors and opened the doors for a wider base of potential shareholders. By the end of December, they had issued 42.3 million shares of Class A stock, raising $15.1 billion. In January and February 2025, they issued another 6.5 million shares, securing $2.4 billion. Even with these massive raises, Strategy still has $4.3 billion in Class A shares available for future offerings. CFO Andrew Kang called the company’s capital plan “firing on all cylinders” and confirmed they’ve already raised $20 billion out of their $42 billion goal. And that’s not all. Early in 2025, Strategy launched its first convertible preferred stock offering, raking in $584 million from institutional and retail backers. The company also issued $3 billion in 0% Convertible Senior Notes in November 2024, which will mature in 2029. These notes allow investors to convert holdings into Strategy stock at $672.40 per share, a price investors are betting will be a steal down the line. From the $3 billion note issuance, the company netted $2.97 billion after fees. But they weren’t done. In January 2025, they rolled out another fundraising vehicle: Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock. Priced at $80 per share, this raised $563.4 million after expenses. These preferred shares come with an 8% annual dividend and a $100 liquidation preference, giving Strategy another steady funding option. Strategy’s Bitcoin returns in 2024 were through the roof, with a BTC Yield of 74.3%. But for 2025, they’ve set a more conservative 15% target in a reported move toward a more sustainable pace.

This is because several asset managers in the U.S. appear set to launch it, as there are predictions that both DOGE ETF and Solana ETF could trigger the growth of RCO Finance. However, Canary Capital says it is not interested in joining the bandwagon. Dogecoin’s Lack of Utility and Unlimited Supply Raise Concerns According to a report , Steven McClurg, Canary Capital CEO, says the investment firm is interested in launching a spot DOGE ETF. The lack of interest in an ETF product for the dog-themed memecoin follows consideration of certain factors. Notably, McClurg emphasized the lack of utility for Dogecoin in the broader cryptocurrency space. Besides utility, he also highlighted the memecoin’s unlimited supply. These two factors are enough to discourage Canary Capital from considering launching an ETF. McClurg argued that DOGE, by design, will continue to depreciate as its supply increases. As such, he does not consider it fit for an ETF product as the supply remains unlimited. Canary Capital Eyes XRP, Solana, and Other Crypto ETFs Interestingly, Canary Capital is among several investment firms competing for other products. Notable among their interests include XRP and Solana. Since President Donald Trump returned to the White House, crypto industry stakeholders have looked forward to favorable regulation. Given its crypto-friendly disposition, many have rushed to file crypto ETF products . As such, Canary Capital has filed to launch ETF products for Solana, Litecoin, HBAR, and XRP. Unlike DOGE, Solana (SOL) has utility as it serves to pay for transactions on the Solana network. Recently, SOL was used for trading the popular official Trump memecoin. This not only boosted the value of the price of SOL but also increased activity on Solana. Asset Managers Bet on Dogecoin’s Loyal Community However, experts say what Dogecoin lacks in utility, it makes up for in its loyal fan base. A notable fan of the memecoin is Elon Musk, Tesla’s founder. The entrepreneur has consistently supported the memecoin with occasional posts on X. Musk’s posts usually trigger bullish sentiments in the ecosystem. Dogecoin’s loyal fan base and recent developments in the U.S. space might have prompted some asset managers to apply for an ETF to track DOGE. Notably, Grayscale has launched a Dogecoin Trust after it filed with regulatory authority to convert the fund into a spot ETF.

His technical analysis, which is based on SOL price action on the daily candlestick timeframe, shows that the altcoin has been trading in an uptrend channel since July 2024. Notably, this uptrend channel has been highlighted by the formation of higher lows and higher highs as Solana continued to push to new all-time highs. Now, Martinez noted that holding above a key support level could reinforce the altcoin’s uptrend towards the upper trendline of the support channel. Related Reading: Bold Prediction: XRP Holders On The Path To Millionaire Status—Analyst Analyst’s Technical Outlook: A Make-Or-Break Support Level At the time of Martinez’s analysis, Solana was trading at $193, following a barrage of declines throughout last week. Notably, this decline saw Solana hit the bottom trendline of this uptrend channel. As such, the analyst noted that SOL’s action from here could determine its next big move. If Solana manages to hold above this support level, the uptrend could regain strength, and the channel will still be in play. In this case, Solana will still be on track to push toward the upper end of the channel, which puts the price target around $387. On the other hand, if the support fails, a deeper correction could be on the table. Image From X: Ali_charts Solana Price Action: A Rollercoaster Ride To $293 And Back SOL is one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in the current crypto cycle, with its price recently skyrocketing to a new all-time high of $293 on January 19. The rally was primarily driven by a wave of interest following the launch of the Official Trump meme coin on the Solana blockchain, adding momentum to an already bullish trend for the altcoin. However, the euphoria has since cooled off, with Solana experiencing a 30% decline since the all-time high. Since the time of the analysis, Solana has managed to rebound slightly from the lower boundary of its uptrend channel. Solana is currently trading at $204, meaning it has increased by about 5.7% since Martinez highlighted the key support zone. This reversal suggests that the uptrend channel is still in play, and Solana could continue to push upwards until it reaches $389. Interestingly, this price target at the upper end of the channel is reinforced by the Fibonacci extension indicator. Related Reading: Final Dip? Dogecoin Correction Could Precede A Record Surge—Analyst This indicator is extended from the Solana low of $109 in August 2024, and the $389 price target is at the 1.272 extension level. The significance of this extension is reinforced by the fact that Solana’s January peak also coincided with the 1.0 Fibonacci level. Despite this recovery, the bullish momentum has yet to fully confirm itself with a strong breakout. There is still a possibility that Solana could retest the lower boundary of the channel again before establishing a more decisive uptrend.

Market signals suggest the decline could persist unless significant buying activity shifts momentum.n Meanwhile, Toncoin is hovering near key support levels, managing to rebound slightly but still facing uncertainty. Traders remain cautious as they await further confirmation of a potential recovery. Conversely, BlockDAG (BDAG) mining rigs are in high demand, with over 15,850 units sold. BDAG’s energy-efficient approach and strong return potential have positioned it as a preferred option for crypto miners. Analysts project a $20 valuation by 2027, making early mining even more appealing. Hyperliquid Continues Its Descent as Sellers Take Control Hyperliquid (HYPE) is struggling as market indicators reveal a growing bearish sentiment. Technical tools such as the Directional Movement Index (DMI) and Bollinger Band Trend (BBTrend) confirm fading bullish strength. The Negative Directional Indicator (-DI) has overtaken the Positive Directional Indicator (+DI), reinforcing selling pressure. Simultaneously, the Average Directional Index (ADX) indicates a strengthening downtrend. Furthermore, the potential formation of a “death cross” between moving averages raises concerns that HYPE may continue its decline unless a reversal takes place. Toncoin Faces Resistance After Bouncing from Key Support Toncoin recently tested a crucial $3.250 support level before climbing back to $3.81. While this bounce indicates some buyer interest, overall market sentiment remains uncertain. Analysts highlight that if momentum picks up, resistance levels at $5.262, $6.175, and $7.105 could come into play. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests an oversold condition, which may encourage additional buying. However, the MACD continues to reflect a bearish outlook, signaling caution. If Toncoin struggles to hold above $3.81, another retest of the support zone could follow before any potential rally gains traction. BlockDAG Miner Demand Surges Beyond 15,850 Units! Interest in BlockDAG mining rigs has escalated, with over 15,850 units sold as miners secure their positions ahead of expected profitability growth. This rush reflects confidence in BDAG’s potential as an efficient and high-return mining option. Unlike traditional mining setups that require excessive power and maintenance, BDAG miners optimize performance while minimizing energy consumption. Standard rigs often result in substantial operating expenses that reduce overall profitability. However, BDAG miners incorporate underclocked ASIC chips, maximizing efficiency and longevity. This approach reduces heat generation, extends hardware lifespan, and lowers maintenance costs, making mining more sustainable. BlockDAG offers mining solutions for various levels of participation, from the entry-level X10 miner to the high-performance X100 model. The low initial investment, combined with its energy efficiency and strong return potential, has positioned BDAG as a leading choice for crypto miners. Beyond mining, BlockDAG’s rapid market expansion is evident. The project has already raised $193.5 million, with its token price surging 2380%, climbing from $0.001 to $0.0248 over 27 presale batches. Market analysts forecast continued growth, predicting BDAG will surpass $20 by 2027. This makes mining rewards significantly more valuable, encouraging early adopters to secure rigs before the anticipated price surge. As BDAG gains traction, its impact in the crypto sector is becoming increasingly clear, prompting miners to take action now. Key Takeaways Market conditions are shifting, with each asset facing pivotal moments. Hyperliquid (HYPE) remains under heavy selling pressure, indicating potential further losses. Toncoin has shown some recovery signs, but whether it can sustain momentum remains uncertain. BlockDAG, however, is making a significant mark. With over 15,850 mining rigs sold, it is proving to be a top-tier choice for miners seeking efficiency and profitability. Analysts anticipate a price increase past $20 by 2027, reinforcing BDAG’s long-term potential. Those securing mining hardware now may be positioning themselves for substantial future gains.

Among the striking attributes of the project is its real utility, which is preparing this coin for mass adoption. Bitcoin Lithium is one of the few coins with a solid plan to make investors huge returns from the green energy revolution. As the world transitions from carbon-based fuel or fossil fuel to green energy, Bitcoin Lithium has positioned itself at the center of this revolution, making it a perfect financial investment today. Why Bitcoin Lithium? The foundation of this crypto project is pretty simple – investing in lithium technology. Among all the approaches to the green energy revolution, lithium remains one of the most valuable components to date. The product is majorly used for manufacturing energy storage, which makes it a key element in the green energy revolution. According to the project’s whitepaper, here are the core objectives: 1) financing renewable energy projects 2) Lithium exploration and development 3) Sustainable technological solutions, and 4) Energy storage infrastructures for remote communities. With this approach, this project is working on game-changing products that will attract mass adoption organically. That’s why thousands of crypto investors are showing interest in this coin. But why Lithium? Lithium is a revolutionary material in the modern world, especially for the green energy electrification of the world. It is the material behind a lot of tech industries like smartphones, computers, electric car manufacturers, and anything that utilizes stored electrical energy. It is the key material in the electrical batteries. The power behind Lithium is its ability to store a huge amount of electric energy for a long time. With green energy such as solar, you need storage to use it at night. Similarly, the wind is not always blowing. That’s where lithium comes in for energy storage purposes. The electric car industry which has made the likes of Elon Musk billionaires with his Tesla company, are the biggest beneficiaries of lithium. These cars are powered by lithium batteries. In addition, AI data centers, also a futuristic industry, are also big consumers of green energy. This shows lithium remains the future of green energy and its high recyclability makes it a key factor in the transition to sustainable green energy. All these factors explain why Bitcoin Lithium is getting a lot of attention as investors can see how futuristic it is. $BTCL To Grow +100X in 3 Yrs The growth potential of Bitcoin Lithium is immeasurable, according to crypto analysts. Unlike most crypto projects, this is a real utility token that touches on a real product that has huge potential for mass adoption. With lithium being the most preferred material for green electrification, and the adoption of electric vehicles already gaining momentum, this crypto project is riding on a wave that is growing organically. It is not a secret that investment in lithium today is giving massive returns – Elon Musk’s Tesla and many other electrical car manufacturers are just an example. With huge potential in green energy adoption, crypto analysts believe that Bitcoin Lithium ($BTCL) has the potential to explode +1000X in the next 3 years. Final Thought By investing in a disruptive real utility asset, Bitcoin Lithium ($BTCL) becomes a game-changing crypto project. The projected mass adoption of Lithium products comes with a huge opportunity for investors to make profits. Therefore, Bitcoin Lithium is gearing up for massive organic growth, and as predicted, it might hit +100X in the next 3 years making it a good buy today.

The research concluded that engagement on platforms like YouTube, Reddit, and X increases the likelihood of investing in digital currencies. Social Media’s Influence on Crypto Investments The UGA review found that approximately half of social media users surveyed had invested in crypto, compared to just 10% of those who do not use social networks. Furthermore, it concluded that the more platforms an individual engaged with, the more likely they were to invest in the asset class. Those on YouTube, Reddit, X, and Clubhouse showed the highest investment rates, while Instagram users demonstrated less enthusiasm for crypto. The researchers suggested that this is because the first three facilitate discussions about crypto through long-form videos and text-based threads as opposed to Instagram’s visually oriented content. “A lot of people talk about cryptocurrency on social media and how popular it has become,” said Lu Fan, an associate professor at UGA. “There are a lot of celebrities talking about this. People are thinking, ‘Because my friends, family, and the celebrities I admire all invest in that, maybe I should too,” she added. The survey also revealed that investment patterns were influenced by demographics. Men and individuals with a higher risk tolerance were more likely to invest in crypto, while those with higher education levels were less inclined. Age also played a role, with older people showing less interest. Growth of Crypto Investments and Risk Awareness UGA’s findings are similar to a past report from the National Financial Capability Study and Investor Survey, which showed that in 2018, 15% of participants had invested in crypto. By 2021, that number had risen to 28%. The 2021 version of the survey also found that awareness had increased, with more than one in three participants considering an investment, compared to less than 20% in 2018. The University’s analysis also highlighted concerns about misinformation on social media. The researchers found that younger investors, who make up the largest part of the demographic, may overestimate their investment knowledge and be vulnerable to scams and poor financial advice. Professor Fan emphasized the importance of evaluating whether crypto aligns with an individual’s financial goals rather than making investment decisions based on social media trends. The research concluded by suggesting that policymakers consider these findings when developing regulations for crypto markets. Additionally, it called for increased efforts in media literacy education to help people distinguish between credible investment advice and misleading information.

Dogecoin was the first to prove that a meme-inspired token could capture global attention and deliver massive returns. Those who got in early saw jaw-dropping gains, watching a coin that started as a joke skyrocket in value and create an entirely new category of crypto investments. The problem? If you didn’t get in early, you missed out on the biggest profit window. But crypto always gives second chances. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is the latest meme coin making waves, and this one isn’t just riding on hype. It combines an engaging Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, 90% APY staking rewards, and a powerful community-driven Bulls Squad, making it one of the best new meme coins to join for long term . With its presale already raising over $5.97 million, BTFD is shaping up to be the next big thing in crypto—and this time, you have a shot at getting in early. BTFD Coin’s Play-to-Earn Game—The Future of Meme Coin Utility While many meme coins rely on community hype alone, BTFD Coin is rewriting the rules with its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game , which went live on January 1, 2025. This isn’t just a gimmick—P2E gaming is a booming industry that merges crypto with entertainment, allowing players to earn tokens while gaming. Unlike Dogecoin, which started as a fun meme, BTFD is built to be used, played, and rewarded, giving it real-world demand beyond speculation. Investors are already taking notice, and the presale is proof of the growing excitement. BTFD is now in Stage 14, with the price sitting at $0.00016. This price won’t last long, as each presale stage increases the token cost. Once it hits exchanges, the listing price is set at $0.0006, with analysts predicting a surge to $0.006 after launch. That’s an easy 3.75x gain on day one and a potential 37.5x return if the price reaches its projected moon level. Imagine dropping $8,000 into BTFD at the current price. That would get you 50 million tokens. At $0.0006, that investment becomes $30,000. If BTFD reaches $0.006, you’d be sitting on a massive $300,000. That kind of return isn’t just life-changing—it’s the kind of gain that turns early buyers into legends in the crypto space. Beyond gaming, BTFD Coin’s 90% APY staking rewards give holders another way to stack their profits. Staking is simple: lock up your tokens, earn rewards, and watch your portfolio grow while the market catches up to BTFD’s true value. Meanwhile, the Bulls Squad referral program rewards those who bring in new investors, ensuring BTFD’s community grows stronger every day. Stage 14 won’t last forever, and each new stage makes BTFD a little more expensive. If you’re looking for the best new meme coins to join for long term, this is your shot to buy before the next price jump. Getting in on BTFD Coin’s presale is simple. Set up your wallet with MetaMask or Trust Wallet and load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT. Head over to the presale page , connect your wallet, choose the amount of BTFD you want to buy, confirm the transaction, and you’re in. Once the presale ends, claim your tokens and start staking them for rewards. BTFD is already being called one of the best new meme coins to join for long term, and buying at presale prices could be your best crypto move yet. Dogecoin—The Meme Coin That Started It All Dogecoin was the original meme coin that showed the world how powerful internet culture could be in crypto. Created as a joke, it exploded into a cultural movement, supported by high-profile figures like Elon Musk and a community that turned “Doge to the moon” into reality. What started as an internet meme became one of the biggest cryptos in history, reaching an all-time high of $0.73 in 2021. Early adopters made millions, with some turning small investments into massive fortunes. But here’s the reality—Dogecoin’s best growth phase is over. While it remains a beloved token, the biggest profits have already been made, and new investors are unlikely to see the same 10,000x returns that early adopters did. That’s why BTFD Coin is now stealing the spotlight. With its P2E game, staking rewards, and growing Bulls Squad, it has everything Dogecoin once had—plus real utility. If you missed Dogecoin’s early days, BTFD Coin is giving you a second chance at a major meme coin breakout. Don’t Miss Out on BTFD Coin’s Presale—Your Next Big Crypto Play Dogecoin was the first meme coin revolution, but BTFD Coin is taking things to the next level. It’s not just a meme token—it’s a thriving ecosystem with Play-to-Earn gaming, staking rewards, and a growing community that could push its value to new heights. With BTFD Coin now being one of the best new meme coins to join for long term, the time to act is now. The presale price of $0.00016 won’t last, and once it hits $0.0006 on exchanges, early investors could already be sitting on major profits. If you missed Dogecoin’s run, don’t make the same mistake again— jump into BTFD Coin before the next price surge. FAQs Can BTFD Coin reach Dogecoin-level success? With its P2E game, staking rewards, and strong community, BTFD Coin has all the ingredients of a high-potential meme coin. Its early-stage presale makes it a better entry point than Dogecoin today. How high can BTFD Coin go after launch? Analysts predict BTFD Coin could hit $0.006, making it a 37.5x gain from its current presale price of $0.00016. Why is BTFD Coin one of the best new meme coins to join for long term? With its Play-to-Earn game, staking rewards, and Bulls Squad referral system, BTFD offers real utility beyond just hype, making it a solid long-term investment.

Many newcomers to online betting often wonder what is actually required to begin their journey. While each platform may have its own set of rules and unique features, most modern online casinos strive for a streamlined experience that allows you to register, deposit funds, and start playing without unnecessary complications. Understanding the key steps involved will help you navigate sign-up processes and deposit methods with confidence, so you can focus on enjoying your time at the virtual tables. Understanding the Basics of Registration The first stage in registering at an online casino typically involves providing basic personal information in a digital form like on this betway sign up page. This process usually requires your full name, date of birth, and contact details. The online casino needs these details not only to create your account but also to ensure compliance with gambling regulations. Establishing your age is crucial, as most legitimate casinos will only allow individuals who are of legal gambling age in their jurisdiction to proceed. Many platforms use secure software to verify your identity quickly, which helps maintain a safe and responsible environment for everyone involved. Once you submit your initial details, you will typically be asked to create a username and password. This step is important for securing your account and personal data. Many betting sites now provide two-factor authentication options , giving you an added layer of security when you log in. Taking a few moments to choose a strong, memorable password is a wise decision that can protect your account from unwanted access. After verifying your account via email or SMS, you’ll officially be a member of the online casino, ready to move on to the next phase. Providing Identification and Verification Although the basic sign-up forms help casinos gather essential information, there may come a stage where you are asked to provide scanned documents or photos of your ID. This additional step, often referred to as KYC (Know Your Customer), is a legal requirement in many regions and serves to confirm that the details you provided during registration are accurate. Verification measures can include a copy of your passport or driver’s license, proof of address in the form of a utility bill, or a recent bank statement. This process might sound daunting at first, but reputable casinos implement these measures to prevent underage gambling and financial fraud. In many cases, once your verification documents are approved, you will find that deposits and withdrawals process more smoothly. The exact requirements for document submission vary from one site to another, and different countries have differing rules. While some platforms allow you to start playing immediately after registration, others might request verification before you begin wagering. It is worth keeping digital copies of your relevant documents ready so that if a casino asks for confirmation, you can provide it quickly. These safeguards ultimately protect both you and the casino, ensuring a secure and trustworthy betting experience. Depositing Funds and Exploring Payment Methods When it comes to placing bets, you will naturally need a way to fund your account. Modern casinos offer a variety of deposit options, making it easier for players in different parts of the world to add money to their balance. Some players prefer credit or debit cards, while others opt for e-wallet services that provide a level of separation between personal banking information and casino accounts. In certain regions, prepaid cards or direct bank transfers might also be available. Some players even fund their accounts using cryptocurrencies or bitcoin lending apps . It is generally a good idea to start with small deposits to get a feel for the platform and confirm that everything runs smoothly. Some casinos reward new players with welcome bonuses or free spins upon their first deposit, giving you extra incentives to explore their selection of games. Reading through the terms and conditions is wise, because it ensures you know exactly how wagering requirements work and what is needed to withdraw potential winnings. Clear knowledge of these rules can help you avoid misunderstandings later on, especially if you aim to cash out your earnings. Navigating Bonus Offers and Promotions Bonuses and promotions often play a big role in attracting new players, and signing up for an online casino might grant you a welcome package that includes free spins or a deposit match. These rewards can amplify your initial bankroll, giving you a chance to explore different games without risking too much of your own money. However, it is critical to understand any attached terms, such as wagering requirements or game restrictions. Some bonuses may be exclusive to certain slots or table games, and you may need to wager bonus funds a specific number of times before converting them into real cash. Taking a moment to review these details helps you make informed decisions and avoid feeling misled by promotional hype. It also allows you to maximize the benefits of any rewards you receive. Exploring the Game Selection Once you’ve gone through the steps on the betway sign up page and funded your account, the real excitement begins as you explore a vast array of casino games. Modern platforms cater to every taste, from classic slot machines with fruit symbols to immersive video slots that feature captivating storylines, bonus rounds, and special effects. Fans of table games can dive into blackjack, roulette, or baccarat, either playing against software or joining live-dealer sessions that stream real-time footage from professional studios. This level of variety ensures you can always find a new game or variation to try, keeping the experience fresh and engaging. Observing how different wagers affect gameplay and learning the basics of each new challenge can be a rewarding process in itself.

While DOGE remains a well-known asset, some investors are shifting focus to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized lending platform currently in its presale phase. Offering real DeFi utilities such as lending, borrowing, and an overcollateralized stablecoin, Mutuum Finance is attracting early participants seeking high-growth potential. With its structured presale and planned exchange listings, analysts suggest that MUTM could deliver significant returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as a strong contender in the DeFi space, offering decentralized lending and borrowing services through a secure protocol. Unlike speculative assets, MUTM provides real utility by allowing users to act as both suppliers and borrowers. This functionality, combined with its structured token model, has drawn attention from investors seeking long-term growth. At the core of Mutuum Finance’s platform are two lending markets: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The P2C market allows users to supply or borrow crypto from a liquidity pool under preset conditions, managed by automated smart contracts. This system minimizes risk and adjusts interest rates based on market demand. The P2P market provides more flexibility, letting users negotiate loan terms directly. It also supports assets not available in P2C, including meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE). This gives borrowers and lenders access to a wider range of assets while maintaining the platform’s security. Mutuum Finance is also introducing an overcollateralized stablecoin to enhance liquidity. The stablecoin will be backed by collateral exceeding its issued value, ensuring stability and reliability. As adoption grows, demand for MUTM is expected to rise, further supporting price appreciation. Another key driver of price growth is Mutuum Finance’s buy-and-distribute mechanism. A portion of fees from lending and borrowing is used to purchase MUTM from the market, creating buy pressure. These tokens are then redistributed to holders, reducing the circulating supply and rewarding long-term investors. The presale is in its first stage, with MUTM priced at $0.01. In a short time, over 7 million tokens have been sold, raising more than $70,000 and attracting over 200 holders. As presale stages progress, the price will increase, reaching $0.06 in the final stage. Experts also anticipate that MUTM’s price will continue to rise after its launch, providing even greater returns for early investors. With real DeFi utilities, structured tokenomics, and growing market interest, analysts expect strong demand to push the token’s value higher once it is listed on exchanges. The project’s tokenomics are structured for long-term growth. Out of 4 billion total tokens, a large portion is allocated for the presale, liquidity, partnerships, and ecosystem expansion. This distribution ensures that the platform has the necessary resources to support its development, marketing, and future integrations while maintaining a balanced supply. A share of the total supply is also reserved for community incentives, including a $100,000 giveaway aimed at attracting new users. This giveaway will be split among 10 winners, each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. To participate, users need to follow Mutuum Finance on social media, engage with its content, and complete the required steps outlined on the official website. Mutuum Finance also plans to launch a beta version of its platform alongside the token’s exchange listing. This will allow users to explore lending and borrowing features before the full release. With strong fundamentals, a clear roadmap, and growing investor interest, Mutuum Finance is emerging as a serious player in DeFi. Ethereum whales have also taken notice, investing in MUTM as they diversify into projects with real utility. With a structured approach and increasing demand, this token stands out as an asset worth considering before its presale stages sell out.

With thousands of coins out there, finding the real gems is no easy task. The trick is spotting projects that offer more than just hype—they need real-world utility and strong market positioning. Among the most promising projects in 2025, Qubetics , Astra, and Aptos stand out. These aren’t just cheap tokens; they are game-changing crypto projects with massive growth potential. They’re shaking up the industry, making them top choices for investors looking to maximize their returns.

Qubetics is in its 21st presale stage, with the $TICS token priced at $0.0667. The presale has already raised over $12.3 million, selling more than 466 million tokens and attracting over 19,200 token holders. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 before the presale ends, a 274.70% ROI. Long-term forecasts suggest it could even skyrocket to $10, giving early investors a life-changing return. Qubetics isn’t just another token—it’s building critical infrastructure for the future of Web3. The Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet lets users manage assets across multiple blockchains seamlessly, without relying on centralized exchanges. Imagine you’re a trader holding Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon tokens. Instead of switching between wallets and paying crazy gas fees, Qubetics’ Multi-Chain Wallet lets you control everything from one simple interface. Then there’s the partnership with 1inch, one of the top decentralized exchange aggregators. This allows Qubetics users to swap tokens across blockchains at the best possible rates—all while staying in full control of their assets. For businesses, this is a game-changer. A global e-commerce platform can now accept crypto payments in multiple tokens without worrying about high conversion fees.

Or where content creators can sell their AI-generated works without middlemen taking a huge cut. Astra’s approach to AI and blockchain integration has caught the attention of investors. By creating a trustless, permissionless AI economy, Astra is setting the stage for mass adoption. As more businesses and developers turn to decentralized AI, Astra’s token demand will likely explode—making it one of the best cryptos under a penny to invest in. Aptos: The Blockchain Built for Speed and Efficiency Aptos isn’t just another layer-1 blockchain—it’s designed for scalability, security, and ultra-fast transactions. Built by ex-Meta (formerly Facebook) engineers, Aptos is powered by the Move programming language, which makes it faster and safer than many existing blockchains. Aptos solves major blockchain problems like slow transaction speeds and expensive gas fees. With its innovative technology, it can process thousands of transactions per second—making it a serious competitor to Ethereum and Solana. Aptos has already attracted major venture capital investments and is expanding its ecosystem rapidly. As Web3 projects and dApps migrate to Aptos, demand for its native token is expected to surge. If you’re looking for a blockchain project with real-world adoption and scalability, Aptos is one of the best cryptos under a penny to consider. Final Thoughts: Where Should You Invest?

Astra is bringing AI to the blockchain, making data ownership and decentralized AI services accessible.

By 2028, the price is projected to reach $14.65. By 2031, FIL may reach $49.84. Filecoin is a decentralized storage network designed to securely and efficiently store humanity’s most important information. Launched by Protocol Labs in October 2020, it utilizes blockchain technology to create a peer-to-peer digital storage marketplace. Users can rent unused hard drive space to earn Filecoin tokens (FIL), the network’s native cryptocurrency. The system operates on a proof-of-replication and proof-of-spacetime consensus mechanism, ensuring that data is reliably stored over time and that storage providers hold the exact copies they claim. This approach incentivizes a robust and distributed network of storage providers, enhancing data retrieval speeds and security compared to traditional centralized servers. Filecoin aims to reduce the costs of storage services by leveraging the global surplus of storage capacity. As part of the broader Web3 ecosystem, it supports decentralized applications (dApps) and services requiring secure, decentralized data storage solutions, significantly advancing decentralized internet infrastructure.

The Bollinger Bands indicate increased volatility, with prices hovering near the lower band at $2.68, acting as immediate support. Resistance is evident at $4.21, the midline of the Bollinger Bands, and $5.74 at the upper band. The RSI at 32.87 is near oversold territory, suggesting potential exhaustion of selling pressure. However, the consistent downward trend implies that bulls lack momentum for a reversal. If the current support fails, prices could test $2.50. A recovery above $3.50 would signal short-term bullish activity, but caution remains warranted. Filecoin price analysis 4-hour chart analysis FIL/USD chart Image Source: TradingView On the 4-hour FIL/USD chart, Filecoin is experiencing heavy bearish momentum, trading at $3.19, with prices consistently trending near the lower Bollinger Band. The MACD shows widening bearish histograms, reflecting sustained selling pressure. The Balance of Power indicator also signals negative sentiment, confirming sellers are dominating. Immediate support is seen at $3.07, with potential downside toward $2.90 if current levels fail.

The RSI on both the 1-day and 4-hour charts hovers near oversold territory, suggesting a possible relief rally if buying interest surfaces.

A prominent market analysts, Charles Edwards has hinted at a potential miner sell-off, a move that could tilt BTC price action bearish in the week ahead. Bitcoin (BTC) Enters 4-Day Stagnation as Bears Mount Resistance at $97K Bitcoin (BTC) made a sluggish start to February 2025, as bearish macroeconomic headwinds, as turbulence from Trump-led U.S.-China trade war tariffs, weighed heavily on market sentiment. Following an initial knee-jerk reaction that triggered over $2 billion in crypto liquidations, BTC markets found temporary relief on Thursday, February 6, stabilizing around the $96,000 support level. However, while major altcoins like Binance Coin ( BNB ) and Solana ( SOL ) have recorded considerable gains in recent days, Bitcoin has remained stagnant since February 6. Bitcoin Price Action (BTCUSDT), Feb 10, 2025 | Source: TradingView The shaded portion in the chart above illustrates BTC price consolidating within a tight $100,000 – $95,000 range over the past four trading sessions, signaling indecision among market participants. Despite resilient buyer support near $96,000, a breakout above the $97,000 resistance has remained elusive, raising concerns of a potential reversal if bearish pressures intensify. Capriole Investments Founder Hints at Miner Sell-Off Amid Subdued BTC Price Action When a systemically important asset like BTC lags behind the broader market uptrend, it often signals the presence of an active internal bearish catalyst. Supporting this theory, Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, flagged a significant miner sell-off event as a possible reason behind Bitcoin’s stagnation. “Bitcoin miner capitulation! A new capitulation event has just started. We all know what it means when a Hash Ribbon buy signal eventually follows… A lot can happen between now and then. But we are entering a window of opportunity,” Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments The Hash Ribbons indicator, a well-regarded on-chain metric, identifies periods of miner capitulation based on hash rate dynamics. Historically, when Bitcoin’s hash rate declines sharply, it suggests that miners are struggling with profitability, often leading to sell-offs as they offload BTC to cover operational costs. While miner capitulation typically precedes long-term recovery, it can induce short-term bearish price action. Miners’ Reserves Drop Signals Additional Selling Pressure Further supporting this bearish Bitcoin price forecast , IntoTheBlock’s Miner Reserves metric highlights a sharp drop in BTC holdings among mining entities. This indicator tracks the daily changes in the aggregate Bitcoin balances held in wallets controlled by recognized miners and mining pools, offering insights into miner activity. Between February 4 and February 8, miner reserves fell from 1.94 million BTC to 1.91 million BTC, marking an outflow of approximately 30,000 BTC—equivalent to nearly $3 billion at current market prices. This level of selling pressure is significant, as it inflates short-term market supply, potentially weighing down Bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin Miners Reserves | BTCUSDT Historically, periods of large miner sell-offs have coincided with either price stagnation or temporary declines, as excess BTC supply outpaces existing demand. If miners continue offloading reserves at this scale, Bitcoin could struggle to maintain the $96,000 support level, increasing the risk of a deeper pullback toward $94,500 or lower in the coming sessions. While long-term holders may view miner capitulation as a buy-the-dip opportunity, the immediate outlook for Bitcoin remains uncertain. If selling pressure from miners subsides and Bitcoin manages a sustained breakout above $97,000, a renewed bullish trend could emerge. However, failure to do so could see Bitcoin extend its current stagnation or even slip into a short-term downtrend. With Bitcoin at a critical juncture, traders and investors will be closely monitoring miner activity and macroeconomic developments for further directional cues.

Several exciting ICOs are gaining momentum in 2025, and Web3Bay leads the way with its decentralized e-commerce approach. Alongside Web3Bay, 5thScape and Meme Index are also proving to be strong contenders. Let’s explore these three promising projects and why they deserve attention this week. 1. Web3Bay: Leading Crypto ICO with Huge ROI Potential Web3Bay is making waves in the ICO space by introducing a decentralized platform aimed at reshaping online commerce. It allows users to maintain full control over their data and transactions, aligning with growing concerns about digital privacy. Since its launch, Web3Bay has raised over $1 million, with 280 million coins already sold at a price of $0.004562625 each. Currently, in its fourth phase of a 28-stage ICO, the price is expected to rise in the upcoming stages, ultimately reaching $0.1959 upon launch. This steady increase suggests Web3Bay could deliver returns similar to other blockchain-based projects, where early participants saw their holdings grow by 100x or even 1,000x. Unlike meme-based projects, Web3Bay offers a practical solution with real-world benefits. It prioritizes sustainable expansion by providing tangible advantages for users and businesses. This makes Web3Bay one of the best crypto ICOs available this week, with a strong potential for future growth. 2. 5thScape: Presale Crypto for Metaverse & VR 5thScape stands out in the best crypto ICOs by integrating blockchain with virtual reality (VR). The project is rapidly expanding, having already raised over $9.4 million. It focuses on the gaming, education, and healthcare industries by offering a blockchain-powered VR environment where users can earn rewards in digital worlds. 5thScape is set to become a key player in the VR and metaverse industries, both of which are witnessing rapid expansion. With planned exchange listings on MEXC and BitMart, demand for 5thScape is expected to surge, making this a project worth monitoring in the coming weeks. 3. Meme Index: A Smarter Way to Enter the Meme Market Meme-themed assets have gained massive popularity, but many people face risks when engaging with individual assets. Meme Index (MEMEX) changes this by offering a collection of various meme assets, reducing exposure to extreme price swings. MEMEX provides features like staking and voting rights for those who participate. This model allows meme fans to engage in the sector while lowering risks tied to single projects. For those seeking potential gains while managing risk, Meme Index stands out among the best crypto ICOs. With interest growing rapidly, it presents a strong opportunity in the expanding meme sector. Why These Crypto ICOs Are Worth Considering? Best crypto ICOs give early participants the chance to engage with digital assets at lower prices before they go mainstream. Web3Bay, 5thScape, and Meme Index are three leading projects offering diverse opportunities. Web3Bay is driving change with its decentralized marketplace and steady growth. Its structured ICO and long-term model make it a strong contender for those seeking expansion potential. 5thScape is embracing the VR and metaverse space, developing blockchain-powered experiences that are expected to play a crucial role in the future digital economy. Meme Index provides a safer way to navigate the meme sector, offering a diversified approach to minimize risk while still capitalizing on trends in the market. For those interested in early-stage opportunities, these best crypto ICOs present a solid chance to enter the market before they gain mainstream attention. As always, thorough research is essential before participating. If you’re looking for exciting projects this week, Web3Bay, 5thScape, and Meme Index should be on your watchlist.

Some laughed at it. Others dismissed it as a joke. Then, history unfolded before their eyes. That tiny Dogecoin price became a moonshot, turning mere pocket change into life-changing wealth. The echoes of regret still haunt crypto OGs who watched but never acted. This lesson is etched into the fabric of crypto history: fortunes favor those who recognize opportunity before the world realizes it. Now, the exact moment is here again. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) price , sits at $0.0420 , a price so small that history practically screams at those who missed out. This is an AI-powered financial opportunity. The question isn’t whether this token will surge but who will seize the moment before it does. Dogecoin Price Skyrocketed, But WallitIQ (WLTQ) Is Built For More Dogecoin price made millionaires out of those crypto OGs who saw the potential before the hype. But beyond the memes, it lacked real-world application. It was fun and unexpected, but it wasn’t engineered for long-term dominance. That’s where WallitIQ (WLTQ) changes the game . History makes it clear that this isn’t a speculative gamble but a project built for practical success. Its AI engine delivers precise investment recommendations. And security? This token doesn’t leave it to chance. Biometric authentication gives only investors access to their assets, while Escrow Connect , powered by AI Einstein, creates bulletproof trust in transactions. This isn’t just another altcoin. It is a financial fortress that crypto OGs have identified. Users gain total control over their transactions with the MVP Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App. Dogecoin price didn’t have this kind of infrastructure when it rose from fractions of a cent to a global sensation. But WallitIQ (WLTQ) isn’t waiting to play catch-up. It’s launching with everything in place, designed to support the explosive growth that made early Dogecoin (DOGE) holders millionaires. Why Crypto OGs Refuse To Miss Out Again The biggest names in crypto have one rule: learn from history. They’ve seen how Dogecoin price defied expectations, and they know the next explosive altcoin won’t wait for hesitation. That’s why the SolidProof-audited WallitIQ (WLTQ) has caught their attention. This isn’t just another token; it’s a platform built to dominate. While the Dogecoin price soared on community hype, this project is fueled by real innovation. Crypto OGs aren’t looking at this as just another altcoin. They’re seeing the blueprint of financial evolution, a project building the infrastructure that traditional cryptocurrencies never had. The beta platform is approaching, and early adopters are positioning themselves before the masses flood in. Crypto OGs know that having the right investments isn’t enough; managing them efficiently is just as crucial. WallitIQ (WLTQ) isn’t just giving investors a token; it’s giving them a complete financial toolkit. Crypto OGs Know That Wealth Moves Fast History has never been kind to those who hesitate. The same crypto OGs who regretted missing the Dogecoin price at $0.0001 know that sitting on the sidelines is a guaranteed way to miss out again. That’s why they’re already positioning themselves in WallitIQ (WLTQ) before it’s too late. This AI altcoin isn’t just another name in the market. The beta platform is about to launch , and when it does, the opportunity at $0.0420 will be gone forever. Crypto history is repeating itself, but smart money isn’t waiting this time. The choice is simple: be the person who looks back with regret or acts when the window is still open. Don’t miss out. Buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) now because this is one moment history won’t offer twice.

Binance Coin (BNB) is currently targeting a move above $620, Stellar (XLM) is showing signs of a breakout towards the $0.75-$0.80 range, and BlockDAG (BDAG) has seen remarkable demand for its mining equipment. Traders interpret the recent Binance coin price forecast as a signal that BNB could see further upward movement, provided it remains above the $600 level. On the other hand, in the mining sector, BlockDAG has sold over 15,850 mining rigs, attracting both new and experienced miners. With BlockDAG’s planned listing on major exchanges, some analysts suggest BDAG is a strong candidate for long-term mining returns, citing its energy-efficient design and promising growth potential. BlockDAG has raised over $193 million and is now in Batch 27, priced at $0.0248, representing a 2380% surge with over 18.4 billion coins sold. Binance Coin Price Forecast: Analyzing BNB’s Path to $620 Analysts are closely examining the latest Binance coin price forecast after BNB recovered above $600. This Binance coin price forecast indicates a potential 8% increase, which could lead to further gains if buyers maintain the current price floor. Market observers suggest that a successful close above $620 could validate the positive outlook presented by this Binance coin price forecast. Following the recent price increase, BNB has experienced a slight pullback, trading around $572. Some experts emphasize the importance of maintaining price stability above $600, as a drop below this level could lead to a price correction. Overall, the Binance coin price forecast remains optimistic, contingent on continued growth in BNB’s market demand. The Binance coin price forecast is a subject of much discussion. Stellar Breakout: Charting XLM’s Potential Upswing The cryptocurrency community is watching for a possible Stellar breakout that could propel XLM toward the $0.75-$0.80 range. Observers point to Stellar’s network expansion, including $458 million in tokenized assets, as evidence supporting a Stellar breakout. The blockchain’s low transaction fees further encourage adoption by businesses looking for affordable transaction solutions. Several analysts believe a Stellar breakout is likely, supported by 9 million active addresses. If XLM can overcome its current resistance levels around $0.34, it could reach higher price targets. Traders are paying close attention, believing that wider use cases and continued adoption will likely support any future rally. BlockDAG: A New Approach to Distributed Ledger Technology BlockDAG is making significant strides in the mining world, having sold over 15,850 crypto mining rigs during its presale. The demand for BDAG is high, as demonstrated by the $193 million raised and the 18.4 billion coins sold. Early participants have already seen a 2,380% return. The key attraction of BlockDAG lies in its environmentally conscious Proof-of-Work mining system, which balances performance with energy efficiency. BlockDAG’s mining hardware line includes the X10, X30, and X100 miners, each designed to meet different mining needs. The X10 can generate up to 200 BDAG daily, the X30 up to 600 BDAG, and the X100, designed for large-scale operations, can mine up to 2,000 BDAG per day. This scalability appeals to both new and experienced miners, especially with forecasts suggesting BDAG could reach $1 after its launch. With network growth and ongoing mining rewards, the community views BDAG as a long-term profitable venture. The project’s focus on consistent block rewards and specialized keccak256 hardware highlights its forward-looking approach. Miners aiming to maximize their earnings are actively acquiring these units, hoping to profit when BDAG is listed on major exchanges and establishes itself as a leading mining option. Market Outlook and Future Trends The cryptocurrency market is keeping traders engaged, with Binance Coin (BNB) attempting to surpass $620, provided it maintains key support levels. A Stellar breakout is also indicating a possible significant price increase. BlockDAG’s successful presale, with over 15,850 mining rigs sold, positions it as a strong contender for long-term, scalable mining rewards. Its energy-efficient mining and growing demand have solidified BDAG’s position in the market.

Some meme coins explode overnight, while others fade into obscurity. The key is knowing which projects have the momentum and long-term vision to deliver sustainable growth. With market volatility at an all-time high, choosing the right meme coin at the right time can mean the difference between life-changing profits and missed opportunities. Among the top new meme coins to buy this month, BTFD Coin is making waves with a record-breaking presale, analyst-backed price predictions, and a massive 100% bonus offer for early investors. While Popcat and Bonk fight to reclaim past glory, BTFD Coin is surging ahead with a presale that’s attracting serious attention. Investors looking for strong fundamentals, a growing community, and early-stage potential need to have BTFD Coin on their radar before it hits exchanges. BTFD Coin: The Presale That’s Smashing Records When it comes to high-potential meme coin investments, presales are where the magic happens. BTFD Coin’s presale has been nothing short of phenomenal, proving that investors are betting big on its success. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, BTFD Coin has built a strong foundation backed by investor confidence, staking rewards, and Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming. The excitement surrounding BTFD Coin isn’t just speculation. Analysts predict that upon launch, BTFD Coin could surge to $0.0006, with some forecasting a long-term climb to $0.006 as adoption grows. That’s a 3,650% potential return for those who get in early. This presale is gaining steam at the perfect time, and with market conditions favoring early-stage meme coin entries, BTFD Coin is positioned for a strong debut. Investors have already poured over $5.97 million into the presale, with more than 69 billion tokens sold and over 10,400 holders onboarded. These numbers demonstrate a growing belief in BTFD Coin’s long-term potential. But the real kicker? The exclusive LAUNCH100 bonus code is doubling every presale purchase, giving early adopters 100% extra tokens. This is one of the most aggressive incentives in the meme coin market today, making BTFD Coin one of the top new meme coins to buy this month before the bonus disappears. Popcat: The Meme That’s Fighting for Relevance Internet culture can be unpredictable, and Popcat’s journey proves that staying power is just as important as hype. Born from a viral image of a cat with an exaggerated jaw movement, Popcat became an instant sensation. Its strong internet presence and meme appeal gave it a fast-tracked entry into the crypto space, attracting traders looking to capitalize on short-term meme-driven volatility. While Popcat initially enjoyed impressive price action, its ability to maintain momentum has been challenged. Meme coins thrive on community engagement and ongoing development, and Popcat is working to evolve beyond a simple joke. Investors are watching closely to see if Popcat can sustain long-term interest or if it will be another short-lived trend. For traders looking to capitalize on meme-driven price swings, Popcat still holds promise. However, compared to BTFD Coin’s structured presale and strong fundamentals, Popcat’s future remains uncertain. Bonk: Can It Bounce Back After Struggles? Bonk took the Solana ecosystem by storm, becoming one of the most talked-about meme coins of the year. Its community-driven ethos and aggressive token burns initially fueled massive price gains, attracting both traders and long-term holders. However, recent struggles have tested its resilience. In an attempt to regain lost momentum, Bonk burned 2.02 trillion tokens in a move designed to boost scarcity and increase investor confidence. While burns often trigger bullish sentiment, Bonk’s price response has been underwhelming. Analysts suggest that unless Bonk’s market conditions improve, the token could face further downward pressure. Despite these setbacks, Bonk still has a loyal following and potential upside if market sentiment shifts. However, compared to BTFD Coin’s fast-growing presale and strategic incentives, Bonk’s outlook remains uncertain in the short term. Final Thoughts: Where Should You Invest This Month? Meme coins offer some of the most explosive opportunities in crypto, but timing and strategy are everything. Among the top new meme coins to buy this month , BTFD Coin stands out as the strongest contender. Its record-breaking presale, analyst-backed price forecasts, and investor-friendly incentives make it the top pick for those looking to get in early. For those looking to ride the meme wave, Popcat and Bonk still have potential, but their recent price struggles make them riskier bets. Meanwhile, BTFD Coin is thriving, with a growing investor base and a 100% bonus that gives early buyers an unbeatable edge. The LAUNCH100 bonus won’t last forever, and with over $5.97 million raised already, the final presale stages are closing in fast. If you’re looking for a high-growth meme coin with real momentum, now is the time to secure your BTFD tokens before the presale closes.

XRP & Bitcoin Holders Are Watching These Next-Gen Cryptos!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/500-to-1m-xrp-bitcoin-holders-are-watching-these-next-gen-cryptos/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has long been the cornerstone of cryptocurrency success stories, turning early adopters into millionaires. Cardano (ADA), Near Protocol (NEAR), and Kaspa (KAS) have also built strong reputations, while Arbitrum (ARB) has shown potential as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. However, a new coin, OFFICIALMAGACOIN, is now commanding the attention of savvy investors. OFFICIALMAGACOIN Could Deliver 60,000% Returns OFFICIALMAGACOIN has emerged as a unique player, with a record-breaking presale raising over $1.5 million in minutes. The token is only available at magacoinofficial.com , adding an element of exclusivity that appeals to both retail and institutional investors. Its potential for 60,000% returns has investors speculating that it could mirror or even surpass Bitcoin’s early growth trajectory. Early-Stage Growth Potential: With its presale success, OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers investors a chance to get in on the ground floor of a coin poised for exponential growth. Exclusivity and Scarcity: Available only at its official website, the token creates urgency and a sense of premium access. Affordable Entry Point: At less than $0.20 per token, OFFICIALMAGACOIN provides a low-risk, high-reward opportunity. Comparing OFFICIALMAGACOIN to Competitors Bitcoin (BTC): Established but lacks the explosive growth of a new coin. Cardano (ADA): Reliable but maturing, leaving little room for exponential returns. Near Protocol (NEAR): Focused on Web3 but cannot match OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s exclusivity. Kaspa (KAS): A promising blockchain but with a slower trajectory. Investors eager to secure their position in this promising token can do so exclusively at magacoinofficial.com . With market buzz intensifying, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is becoming a top contender in the race for the next crypto millionaire-maker.

The university plans to allocate over $5 million to this fund, which will be part of its $200 million endowment. Chun Lai, the foundation’s chief investment officer, emphasized the institution’s proactive approach, stating, “We don’t want to be left behind when their [cryptocurrency’s] potential materializes dramatically.” This initiative follows recent developments in higher education’s engagement with digital assets. Notably, Emory University recently disclosed a $15 million investment in Bitcoin through Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), marking it as the first U.S. university endowment to report such holdings. The University of Austin intends to maintain its Bitcoin holdings for a minimum of five years. Chad Thevenot, senior vice president for advancement at the university, explained the strategy: “We think there is long-term value there, just the same way that we might think there is long-term value in stocks or real estate.” Beyond academia, cryptocurrencies are gaining traction among retirement funds, indicating a broader shift in financial strategies. A recent Bitget Research report revealed that up to 20% of Gen Z and Alpha are open to receiving pensions in cryptocurrency. Furthermore, 78% of respondents expressed greater trust in “alternative retirement savings options” over traditional pension funds, highlighting a significant move towards decentralized finance and blockchain-based solutions. Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget, commented on this trend: “Younger generations are no longer content with one-size-fits-all pension systems. They’re looking for modern solutions that give them more control, flexibility, and transparency.” As of January 2025, 40% of individuals in these younger demographics had already invested in cryptocurrency, underscoring the growing acceptance and integration of digital assets in various sectors. The University of Austin’s initiative signifies a notable step in the evolving relationship between higher education and cryptocurrency investments, potentially setting a precedent for other institutions to follow.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-10 00:48:04

In its pursuit of technological supremacy, the UAE is actively fostering an environment conducive to digital transformation, attracting investors, entrepreneurs, and visionaries from around the world. A Crypto-Friendly Economy The UAE has positioned itself as one of the most progressive nations in terms of cryptocurrency adoption and regulation. Dubai and Abu Dhabi have introduced comprehensive legal frameworks to regulate and encourage the crypto industry. The Dubai Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA), established in 2022, provides clear guidelines for crypto exchanges, digital asset firms, and blockchain enterprises. This regulatory clarity has made the UAE an attractive destination for crypto startups and institutional investors alike. In addition, Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) has developed a robust regulatory framework for digital assets, enabling businesses to operate with legal certainty. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has secured operational approval in Dubai, while Kraken and other major players have established a presence in Abu Dhabi. By embracing digital currencies, the UAE is cementing itself as a financial innovation hub, encouraging both institutional and retail adoption. Beyond regulation, the UAE government has actively explored the integration of blockchain technology within public services. The Dubai Blockchain Strategy aims to transition government transactions onto blockchain platforms, enhancing transparency, security, and efficiency. Furthermore, the UAE Central Bank is developing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) to modernize the financial system and improve cross-border transactions. The Metaverse Revolution The UAE is not only embracing crypto but also investing heavily in the metaverse, with Dubai leading the charge. In 2022, Dubai launched its ambitious Metaverse Strategy, which aims to generate 40,000 virtual jobs and contribute $4 billion to the emirate’s economy by 2030. The initiative seeks to make Dubai one of the top 10 metaverse economies globally, fostering innovation in virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and Web3 technologies. Government-backed entities, including the Dubai Future Foundation and the Abu Dhabi Investment Office, are investing in metaverse startups and infrastructure. The Dubai Municipality has even announced plans to create a virtual city where residents can interact in a fully immersive digital environment. Businesses are also leveraging the metaverse, with real estate developers showcasing virtual properties and luxury brands launching digital stores tailored for metaverse consumers. Tourism and retail, two of the UAE’s strongest economic pillars, are also set to benefit from metaverse integration. Airlines such as Emirates have announced metaverse-driven experiences to enhance customer engagement, while retail giants are adopting virtual shopping platforms to cater to tech-savvy consumers. These initiatives highlight the UAE’s vision to be at the forefront of digital innovation. Artificial Intelligence As a Priority AI is at the heart of the UAE’s digital transformation strategy. The country’s leadership has made AI development a national priority, exemplified by the appointment of the world’s first Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence in 2017. The UAE AI Strategy 2031 aims to position the nation as a global leader in AI, with plans to integrate AI across various sectors, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and public services. Dubai’s Smart City initiative and Abu Dhabi’s AI research efforts are driving AI adoption in governance and business operations. The country is also home to some of the world’s most advanced AI-driven projects, such as the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), the first university dedicated solely to AI research. AI is transforming industries across the UAE, from autonomous transportation solutions to AI-powered healthcare diagnostics. The UAE’s embrace of AI is evident in initiatives such as the Dubai Police’s use of AI-powered surveillance and the implementation of smart traffic systems to reduce congestion. In finance, AI-driven algorithms are optimizing investment strategies, fraud detection, and customer service automation. A Magnet for Global Talent and Investment The UAE’s proactive approach to crypto, the metaverse, and AI has positioned it as a prime destination for global talent and investment. The government has introduced business-friendly policies, including 100% foreign ownership in various tech-related sectors and long-term residency visas for entrepreneurs, tech professionals, and investors. International firms are flocking to the UAE to capitalize on its supportive regulatory environment, strategic location, and tax-friendly policies. Events like the Dubai Future Blockchain Summit and AI Everything attract industry leaders and innovators, reinforcing the UAE’s reputation as a technology-driven economy.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|FIAT,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-10 01:11:01

With a presale price under $0.20 and a rapid rise in popularity, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is capturing the imagination of crypto enthusiasts who believe that $300 today could turn into $999,000 in the near future. Why OFFICIALMAGACOIN Could Transform Your Investment 1. Early-Stage Opportunity OFFICIALMAGACOIN is still in its presale phase, offering a ground-floor opportunity for investors to buy in before the token gains mainstream attention. This is the stage where gains of 1,000x or more become achievable, as seen with Bitcoin in its early days. 2. Exclusive AvailabilityUnlike widely distributed coins, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at magacoinofficial.com . This exclusivity drives demand, ensuring that early adopters benefit as interest surges. 3. Record-Breaking Presale SuccessRaising over $1.5 million in presale funds in record time, OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven its appeal among investors. Such strong initial support is a hallmark of projects poised for explosive growth. 4. Massive Growth PotentialExperts are predicting OFFICIALMAGACOIN could follow in Bitcoin’s footsteps, transforming small investments into extraordinary returns. With its low entry price and strong market momentum, the potential for turning $300 into $999,000 feels more achievable than ever. How It Stacks Up Against SOL, MATIC, KAS, and BTC Bitcoin (BTC): A proven store of value, but its days of exponential growth are behind it. Solana (SOL): Fast and scalable, but its market is maturing, making massive gains less likely. Polygon (MATIC): A strong performer in Ethereum scaling, but it lacks the exclusivity and newness of OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS): An up-and-coming blockchain project with potential but without the momentum OFFICIALMAGACOIN is generating. Don’t Miss Out on OFFICIALMAGACOIN The chance to turn $300 into $999K doesn’t come often, but OFFICIALMAGACOIN might just be that opportunity. With its affordable price, exclusivity, and massive growth potential, it’s a must-watch for 2025. Secure your tokens now at magacoinofficial.com and stay updated on their journey via Twitter/X.

XRP ETF Rumors Keep Prices Up & BNB Holds Firm,https://thecoinrise.com/biggest-presale-boom-web2bay-hits-1m-in-weeks-xrp-etf-rumors-keep-prices-up-bnb-holds-firm/,"Ripple XRP is still navigating regulatory matters, but its latest price surge to $3.03 suggests growing interest from major investors. With XRP ETF applications under review and leadership changes at the SEC, regulatory shifts could push its adoption further. Meanwhile, Binance Coin (BNB) remains a dominant force at $673.09, even as it faces increased regulatory pressure. While these coins continue to evolve, most Web3 projects remain centralized—except Web3Bay . Unlike Binance and XRP, where governance is handled by a select few, Web3Bay puts its users in control. Those participating early don’t just acquire digital assets—they gain voting rights and influence over how the platform operates. Web3Bay: Empowering Users with Real Control Most online platforms set fees and policies without user input. Web3Bay takes a different approach. Holders of 3BAY decide platform policies, vote on changes, and directly influence operations. Ripple XRP’s governance remains in the hands of a select group, while Web3Bay ensures decisions are driven by its community. This isn’t just about buying digital assets—it’s about shaping the future of decentralized marketplaces. Web3Bay’s presale is progressing fast, raising over $1 million and selling more than 280 million 3BAY. The current price stands at $0.004562625, increasing at each stage. Early supporters secure 3BAY at a fraction of its expected launch value of $0.1959. Holding 3BAY provides access to governance rights, marketplace perks, and exclusive benefits. With every presale stage, the price rises, making early participation crucial. As Web3 adoption grows, Web3Bay leads the way toward a decentralized future. Those who join now won’t just be buyers—they’ll help shape the platform’s direction. XRP ETF Progress and SEC Policy Shifts Ripple XRP has gained traction, currently priced at $3.03 as institutional interest increases. The major shift? Companies like Grayscale aim to transform their XRP Trust into a spot XRP ETF, a move that could introduce greater mainstream adoption. Canada’s Purpose Investments is also preparing an XRP ETF, hoping to launch before the U.S. makes a decision. As demand rises, XRP’s future hinges on regulatory approvals. On the legal front, Ripple’s situation may soon improve. With Paul Atkins now leading the SEC, regulatory policies around crypto could become more favorable. If changes benefit Ripple, this could remove a key barrier to XRP’s broader use. The focus remains on regulatory updates that could shift the market. BNB Faces Legal Pressure but Retains Market Strength Binance Coin (BNB) holds its ground at $673.09 despite ongoing regulatory scrutiny. French authorities have launched an inquiry into Binance, examining past tax and compliance issues. Despite legal hurdles, Binance remains the largest crypto exchange, serving 245 million users and processing an average daily trading volume of $14 billion. Traders continue to favor Binance due to its deep liquidity and low-cost transactions. While Ripple XRP’s growth has been impacted by legal uncertainties, Binance continues expanding. Recently, it introduced the VVVUSDT Perpetual Contract, offering up to 25x leverage on Venice Token (VVV). Although legal concerns persist, Binance’s influence remains significant. The key question is whether regulatory actions will impact its future. Final Call Ripple XRP and Binance Coin (BNB) are navigating significant developments. XRP ETF proposals and SEC policy shifts could drive further adoption, while Binance remains a strong market player despite regulatory scrutiny. However, both operate within centralized structures, limiting user control. Web3Bay offers a different approach. Rather than relying on central entities, Web3Bay ensures users have decision-making power. 3BAY holders vote on platform updates, governance policies, and marketplace improvements. As the crypto presale price climbs at each stage, early participants don’t just secure assets—they secure a role in Web3Bay’s future. This isn’t just about buying—it’s about leading.

Historical data suggests Ethereum Foundation’s latest 50,000 ETH transaction could potentially spark volatile market reactions in the week ahead. Ethereum Price Settles at $2,600 as Bearish Pressure Subsides Ethereum (ETH) has struggled to gain momentum in the first week of February, facing multiple bearish catalysts. Internal challenges, including controversial network updates and an increasing circulating supply, have hindered bullish advances. Additionally, macroeconomic headwinds from the U.S.-China trade war have exacerbated the downturn. Ethereum Price Action (ETHUSD) | Source: TradingView Between February 1 and February 7, ETH price experienced a sharp 20% decline, dropping from $3,300 to the $2,600 level. Since February 7, the downward momentum has halted as selling pressure has eased considerably. However, despite this stabilization, ETH has yet to stage a meaningful recovery from last week’s losses. While other top altcoins like Binance Coin ( BNB ) and Solana ( SOL ) have posted gains over the weekend, ETH has remained stagnant within a tight $2,500 to $2,700 range. This consolidation closely mirrors Bitcoin’s price hiatus, highlighting investor indecision and a wait-and-see approach among traders. Ethereum Foundation Spotted Moving 50,000 ETH, Sparking Speculation Ethereum’s stagnation over the weekend coincided with shifting investor focus towards the broader altcoin market. While Bitcoin’s price inactivity has been attributed to a miner sell-off , as highlighted by Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards, ETH’s sideways movement appears to be influenced by recent Ethereum Foundation transactions. On February 9, blockchain security and analytics platform PeckShield flagged a significant transaction involving the Ethereum Foundation—the organization responsible for overseeing the network’s operations and development. “#PeckShieldAlert The Ethereum Foundation has transferred 50,000 $ETH (worth ~$131.6M) to EF: DeFi Multisig for supporting and participating in the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem.” – PeckshieldAlert, Feb 9, 2025. Notably, PeckShield clarified that the 50,000 ETH (~$131.6 million) was not liquidated but rather transferred to a new multi-signature wallet intended to support Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem. In theory, this could be a bullish sign, signaling further investment in DeFi projects and ecosystem development. Ethereum Foundation Spotted Moving 50,000 ETH ($131.6 million) | Feb 9, 2025. However, historical trends suggest that ETH prices have often dipped following large Ethereum Foundation outflows. Insider sell-offs or major fund reallocations tend to trigger bearish sentiment among holders, as they raise concerns over potential future liquidations. These moves can also deter new market entrants who may fear increased volatility or further downside pressure. While this latest transaction was not a direct sell-off, traders are likely to remain cautious until further clarification emerges. Without a major positive uptick in broader market sentiment, ETH price could struggle for momentum at the start of the week. Looking ahead, investors will closely monitor Ethereum Foundation’s wallet activities and market reactions to gauge whether this latest development will ultimately serve as a bullish catalyst or signal renewed selling pressure. Until then, ETH’s short-term trajectory remains uncertain, with technical indicators pointing to both potential upside and risks of further stagnation. Ethereum Price Forecast: $2,750 Breakout Could Spin Market Sentiment Ethereum price prediction chart below presents a bearish-leaning outlook, as the asset continues to trade within a consolidation phase near $2,575. The falling wedge pattern, which previously provided a relief rally, has been invalidated by the latest breakdown, reinforcing near-term downside risks. Volume analysis reveals a notable decline in participation, suggesting a lack of bullish conviction at current levels. RSI stands at 29.61, deep in oversold territory, implying a potential technical rebound, but with the indicator still sloping downward, momentum remains weak. Ethereum Price Forecast | ETHUSDT For the bullish scenario, ETH would need to reclaim $2,750 as a support level to regain market confidence. A break above this level could trigger fresh buying pressure, opening the door for a recovery toward $3,000, where the prior resistance cluster resides. If buyers return, a shift in sentiment could propel ETH higher, mirroring gains seen in altcoins like Solana and Binance Coin. Conversely, failure to hold the $2,500 support could exacerbate selling pressure, potentially driving ETH toward $2,400 or lower. With historical data showing price declines following Ethereum Foundation transactions, traders remain cautious, and unless demand picks up, Ethereum could struggle to regain upward momentum in the near term.

As the blockchain ecosystem continues to evolve, new projects are emerging that promise to change the way we interact with digital finance. Among these rising stars are Qubetics ($TICS), Cronos (CRO), and Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance (ASIA). Each of these coins brings something unique to the table, targeting different aspects of the blockchain industry.

The presale has already raised over $12.3 million, and as it continues into its 21st stage, it’s clear that this project is gaining serious traction. For investors looking to diversify their portfolios, Qubetics presents a fascinating opportunity. On the other hand, Cronos (CRO) is no stranger to the crypto world. As the native token of the Crypto.com ecosystem, Cronos has a strong market presence and a broad array of use cases within decentralized finance (DeFi) and beyond. Its ability to connect various blockchain networks gives it a solid foundation for future growth, making it one of the best cryptos to buy now for anyone looking for a tried-and-true player in the space. Lastly, Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance (ASIA) is entering the market with a bold mission: to integrate AI with blockchain technology, creating a new frontier for both industries.

For those looking for something futuristic and forward-thinking, ASIA might just be the right pick. As we dive into the details of these three coins, let’s explore how Qubetics, Cronos, and ASIA stack up and why they should be on your radar as the best cryptos to buy now . Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionizing Blockchain Interoperability When it comes to the best cryptos to buy now , Qubetics ($TICS) is a project that cannot be overlooked. Positioned in the 21st stage of its presale, this innovative blockchain platform has already raised over $12.3 million, with more than 466 million tokens sold to over 19,200 holders. At just $0.0733 per token in this presale stage, $TICS presents an exciting entry point for early investors. One of the standout features of Qubetics is its focus on cross-chain interoperability. The QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is designed to simplify blockchain development, enabling businesses, professionals, and individuals to create decentralized applications (dApps) across multiple blockchain networks. This cross-chain functionality is a game-changer, allowing developers to reach broader audiences without being confined to a single blockchain ecosystem. Cross-border transactions, a critical aspect of global finance, are also made easier with Qubetics. The platform’s interoperability allows for smoother, faster, and more cost-effective international transactions. Whether you’re sending funds across continents or engaging in global business operations, Qubetics helps to eliminate many of the friction points that traditional blockchain systems face when dealing with cross-border payments. As Qubetics moves closer to the end of its presale, analysts are predicting significant returns. With a potential ROI of 240.64% if $TICS reaches $0.25 by the end of the presale, and even higher returns expected after the mainnet launch, Qubetics is shaping up to be one of the best cryptos to buy now . Cronos (CRO): The Heart of Crypto.com’s Ecosystem If you’re looking for a tried-and-true option, Cronos (CRO) is definitely one of the best cryptos to buy now. As the native token of the Crypto.com ecosystem, Cronos has cemented itself as a key player in the blockchain space. The Crypto.com platform has grown exponentially, offering a range of services from buying and selling crypto to staking, lending, and even credit card payments using CRO tokens. The key to Cronos’ success lies in its unique position as a multi-chain crypto network. With its interoperability features, Cronos allows developers to build decentralized applications on the platform while ensuring seamless integration with other networks. This opens up a vast potential market for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, making it an attractive choice for investors seeking exposure to both the growing DeFi sector and the broader cryptocurrency market. For those looking to invest in a coin that has real-world use cases, Cronos provides that in spades. With widespread adoption across the Crypto.com network and a growing number of projects being built on its blockchain, Cronos is in a strong position to continue its upward trajectory. Its multi-chain capabilities also give it a competitive edge over other single-chain platforms, ensuring that it will remain relevant as the blockchain ecosystem continues to evolve. While some cryptocurrencies may still be in their early stages, Cronos has a proven track record. If you’re looking for stability and long-term growth potential, this is definitely one of the best cryptos to buy now. Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance (ASIA): AI Meets Blockchain Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance (ASIA) is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the world of cryptocurrencies. By combining artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, ASIA is creating a new frontier for both industries. The integration of AI into decentralized finance (DeFi) and other blockchain applications is poised to disrupt how we think about digital transactions, smart contracts, and much more. What sets ASIA apart from other projects is its focus on using AI to enhance blockchain functionality. This could lead to the creation of more intelligent and adaptable systems that can optimize transactions, automate processes, and provide personalized services in ways that traditional blockchain platforms cannot. For example, imagine smart contracts that can adjust in real-time based on market conditions or user behavior. That’s the kind of future ASIA is working towards. The best cryptos to buy now aren’t just about investing in today’s technology—they’re about positioning yourself for the future. ASIA’s ambitious vision of integrating AI and blockchain could very well redefine the landscape of digital finance. For early investors, this presents a unique opportunity to get involved with a groundbreaking project that could change the game.

Cross-border transactions, for example, have long been a challenge in the financial world. Traditional banking systems are slow, expensive, and inefficient when it comes to sending money across borders. This is where blockchain technology, and specifically projects like Qubetics, come into play. Qubetics’ ability to facilitate cross-border transactions is one of its standout features. By utilizing cross-chain interoperability, Qubetics enables faster, cheaper, and more efficient international payments. Businesses and individuals can transfer funds without the hassle of high fees, long wait times, or the need for intermediaries.

BTC is struggling and might slip further unless there is a close above $98,800. Bitcoin started a fresh decline below the $98,000 level. The price is trading below $98,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $98,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $98,000 zone. Bitcoin Price Holds Support Bitcoin price failed to continue higher above the $100,500 zone. It started another decline below the $98,500 zone. BTC gained bearish momentum for a move below the $98,000 and $96,000 levels. There was a move below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $91,000 swing low to the $102,500 high. The price even spiked below the $95,500 support level and settled below the 100 hourly Simple moving average . It tested the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $91,000 swing low to the $102,500 high. Bitcoin price is now trading below $98,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $96,750 level. The first key resistance is near the $98,000 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $98,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The next key resistance could be $100,000. A close above the $100,000 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $101,200 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $102,500 level. More Losses In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $98,000 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $96,000 level. The first major support is near the $95,500 level. The next support is now near the $93,700 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $92,000 support in the near term. The main support sits at $91,000.

40138506,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=671515,1739156283,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40138506.jpeg,US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s plans depend on D.O.G.E’s success,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/scott-bessents-plans-depend-on-doge-success/,"Scott Bessent, the new US Treasury Secretary under Trump’s administration, has a monster-sized mission. He’s been handed an economic puzzle that could break all financial markets and the entire global economy if he screws up. Scott’s job is to keep bond yields down, cut down on federal spending without triggering a recession, and somehow deal with the chaos of oil prices, a volatile dollar, and inflation. So Scott’s whole strategy leans heavily on Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, also known as D.O.G.E. Without Elon and his efficiency freaks (as he calls them), Scott’s vision could crumble. According to a Bloomberg report , Scott’s first quarterly funding announcement stayed in line with Janet Yellen’s strategy, focusing on issuing short-term bonds. Analysts expected him to move toward long-term bonds, but he didn’t. Short-term borrowing is Scott’s way of buying time, but the bond market won’t wait forever. Oil prices are a problem Scott can’t ignore President Donald Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” campaign slogan promised to bring inflation down by boosting oil supply, but oil doesn’t behave the way most people think. Cheaper oil doesn’t directly lower real borrowing costs. Traders in inflation-protected securities (TIPS) use energy futures to hedge their bets, which skews how inflation expectations play out in bond markets. Scott knows that even if oil prices drop, it won’t be enough to fix his problems. According to data from Absolute Strategy Research, energy now makes up a much smaller share of overall production costs. Even if oil prices doubled tomorrow, it wouldn’t cause the same economic disaster seen during the energy crises of the 1970s. But pushing oil prices down won’t be easy. Trump’s plan to refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve will boost demand, driving prices up instead of down. And OPEC won’t sit by and let the US flood the market. Scott puts his faith in Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E team Cutting federal spending is where things get messy. According to data from BCA Research, federal spending needs to be reduced by 3.6% to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio. That’s a huge cut, and Congress won’t approve it without a fight. Elon’s D.O.G.E team is targeting waste across multiple departments and making aggressive cuts, but if they fail, Scott would be staring down a financial and economical meltdown. And if Elon cuts too much, he risks triggering a recession. If he cuts too little, we’re gonna face a bond market riot. Anyway, Scott is also steering Trump away from interfering with the Federal Reserve. Trump has said time and time again that he should have more control over interest rate decisions, but at his Senate confirmation hearing, Scott said he knows that would send markets into a panic. Instead, he’s pushing for a more strategic approach—replacing current Fed Chair Jerome Powell with someone the market respects. Former Fed governor Kevin Warsh is the top pick, because according to Scott, he’s experienced, market-friendly, and “unlikely to rock the boat.” Meanwhile, just earlier, president Trump ordered the US Treasury to stop producing pennies, via a post on Truth Social that reads: “For far too long the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents. This is so wasteful! I have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies. Let’s rip the waste out of our great nations budget, even if it’s a penny at a time.” This of course comes amid D.O.G.E’s tensions with the Treasury after he audited and was given access to its data. But unfortunately, a federal judge ruled on Saturday to ban Elon and his team from accessing the Treasury’s data ‘temporarily.’ Scott also faces a dollar problem. Historically, oil prices and the dollar move in opposite directions. When oil prices crash, the dollar tends to rise. It happened in 2014 when OPEC flooded the market, and it happened again in the 1980s after the Iran crisis. But a strong dollar makes imports cheaper, which helps fight inflation, but it also makes US exports less competitive. Trump’s economic vision relies on boosting exports, so you can see why Scott can’t afford a dollar that’s too strong.

With the growing integration of artificial intelligence in the crypto space, this emerging altcoin is gaining traction, promising exciting utilities and innovative features that could revolutionize the DeFi sector. Bearish Sentiment Worries Investors As The Dogecoin Price Declines The Dogecoin price has struggled to maintain momentum in recent days.

In only the last hour, it experienced another dip of 0.8%. This unimpressive Dogecoin price trend suggests the hype surrounding the meme coin has faded. Moreover, with no tangible utility backing the meme coin, investors’ concerns are heightened, and they may consider other alternatives backed by exciting utilities such as WallitIQ (WLTQ). At the time of this writing, Dogecoin price was $0.2619 . WallitIQ (WLTQ): The AI-Powered Altcoin With Attractive Utilities Set To Skyrocket By 69,000% WallitIQ (WLTQ) is reshaping the DeFi space with its one-of-a-kind crypto wallet.

Investors in WallitIQ (WLTQ) can rest easy knowing that their assets are secure.

Additionally, CoinMarketCap has recognized its potential and listed it on its website, further validating its trustworthiness and reliability. The recently unveiled build of WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Crypto Wallet Management mobile App has generated massive buzz in the crypto space. Its unique features have been a major discourse. Unsurprisingly, investors are hyped about its beta platform , which will be launched soon. Investors who want to maximize the features and returns this unique platform offers are prompted to buy its token for only $0.0420 now. Only token holders are guaranteed these groundbreaking features and potential ROIs. Besides, experts are tipping the hottest altcoin currently in the market, WallitIQ (WLTQ), to yield as high as 69,000% returns for early investors when its value skyrockets in the coming days.

This strategic move, which is expected to roll out later this year, will diversify the exchange’s crypto product range and strengthen the country’s digital asset market. The launch follows the success of Bitcoin futures, which were introduced in April 2024. These futures have generated significant trading volume, averaging 5 billion Brazilian Real (approximately $860 million) each month, a testament to the growing interest in crypto trading among Brazilian investors. Gilson Finkelsztain, CEO of B3, confirmed the expansion in an interview and opened up about the exchange’s commitment to staying at the forefront of the cryptocurrency space. The new Bitcoin options, along with ETH and SOL futures, are expected to attract institutional and retail traders alike, offering more flexibility and hedging opportunities within the rapidly evolving digital asset market. As the adoption of cryptocurrencies continues to grow, this move positions B3 as a key player in Brazil’s crypto ecosystem.

ETH is now moving lower and might slip further toward the $2,320 support. Ethereum started a fresh decline below the $2,700 level. The price is trading below $2,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,680 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if it stays below the $2,700 level. Ethereum Price Recovery Fades Ethereum price started a recovery wave above the $2,650 level, like Bitcoin . ETH was able to surpass the $2,700 and $2,750 resistance levels to move into a short-term positive zone. However, the bears were active above $2,800 and the price started another decline. There was a move below the $2,720 and $2,700 levels. The price dipped and tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,127 swing low to the $2,923 high. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,680 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,680 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The first major resistance is near the $2,700 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,880 or $2,920. A clear move above the $2,920 resistance might send the price toward the $3,000 resistance. An upside break above the $3,000 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,050 resistance zone or even $3,120 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,700 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,525 level. The first major support sits near the $2,440 zone. A clear move below the $2,440 support might push the price toward the $2,320 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,250 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,120. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

XRP and Solana (SOL) holders are flocking to OFFICIALMAGACOIN, with analysts comparing its growth potential to the early days of crypto’s biggest names. Why OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is Taking Over 1. Explosive Early Adoption Raising $1.5 million in minutes, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is proving to be a high-demand asset, attracting XRP and SOLANA holders who recognize its massive potential. 2.

One meme coin making headlines is Test (TST), a new coin on the Binance Smart Chain. There have been rumors that it’s linked to Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the founder of Binance. But CZ has stepped in to clear things up and address the growing buzz around TST. CZ Sets the Record Straight About TST CZ recently posted online to explain that TST was never officially endorsed by him or Binance. “It was just a test token used in a video tutorial,” he said. Despite his clarification, TST’s popularity only grew. “Every clarification post just made it more viral for whatever reason,” CZ jokes. As for the listing of TST on Binance, CZ explained that he wasn’t involved in the decision. “Exchanges want to list popular coins with high trading volume,” he said. “If your coin is in demand, you don’t need to talk to exchanges. Just focus on your project.” Is CZ Moving Away From Fundamentals? With the rise of meme coins, many wondered if CZ was shifting his focus away from the core principles of crypto. However, CZ made it clear that this was not the case. “I’m a builder,” he said. “I always focus on fundamentals.” Does he have any interest in meme coins? CZ said he hasn’t bought any. “I haven’t bought a single meme coin yet,” he confirmed. He also said that just because he’s not into meme coins, it doesn’t mean he’s against them. “I’ve worked hard to support many altcoins and the crypto industry as a whole, and I have the same view on meme coins.” Why Are Meme Coins So Popular? So why are meme coins like TST becoming so popular, especially compared to utility tokens? CZ had a few thoughts on this. He pointed out that in recent years, regulators have cracked down on utility tokens, calling them securities, which led some people to turn to meme coins as a safer option. He also explained that meme coins are harder to value, which makes them attractive to speculators. “Things with clear value are harder to speculate on,” he said. “Memes are fun, and there’s a whole community around them.”",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BNB|EXCHANGE|TRADING|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-10 03:55:55

Coin value dipped to a low of $598.6 over the last 24 hours. Overall, the currency value decreased by 2.39% on the day. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins to hold them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $5,472.04 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB down? BNB’s price decreased over the last 24 hours, above the support at $579.1. Sellers stepped in to sell the assets; moreover, the support floor at that level seems unstable because bears have mostly dominated in the past weeks, whereas the coin is still trading on the balanced end of its daily price range. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including Wallet Investor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another additional factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2028, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $5,331.19 by 2031.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coinmarketcap Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but stepped down to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In February 2025, BNB is trading near the psychological mark of $670, just below the January prices.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|MARKET|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-10 04:04:01

On Feb. 10, the Central African Republic made an unexpected move by announcing the launch of its own memecoin, CAR. The announcement came directly from the official X account of President Faustin-Archange Touadéra, who described the project as an experiment aimed at uniting people, supporting national development, and putting CAR in the global spotlight. Today, we are launching $CAR – an experiment designed to show how something as simple as a meme can unite people, support national development, and put the Central African Republic on the world stage in a unique way.

He linked the initiative to the country’s previous pro-crypto stance, noting that he was the second world leader to adopt Bitcoin ( BTC ) as legal tender.

Within hours, its valuation surged as traders rushed to participate in what was seen as the first-ever national memecoin. However, while the idea of a government-backed meme coin generated huge interest, skepticism quickly followed. Within hours, deepfake allegations, website suspensions, and questionable domain registrations began casting doubt on the project.

The announcement and immediate red flags Skepticism over the memecoin emerged after AI detection tools analyzed the president’s announcement video. One deepfake detection model, Seferbekov, found an 82% probability that the video was AI-generated, while another, Ensemble, also flagged it as suspicious. However, two other AI tools, Avatrify and Deepware’s checker, did not detect signs of manipulation. The controversy deepened when the memecoin’s official X account, created to provide updates on the project, was suspended without explanation. Hours later, the president’s X account acknowledged the suspension and stated that they were working with X to restore it. We are working with @X to get @CARMeme_News back as soon as possible.

He noted that the car.meme domain was registered on “Namecheap”, a budget-friendly domain provider, only three days before the announcement—a move he described as highly uncharacteristic for a government-backed initiative. ‼️ CT and my crew be cautious about $CAR domain registered on namecheap 3 days ago… does not look like what president or a country would do… do not let liquidity be sucked out from the ecosystem… NFA – I could be very well wrong… but 🚩 pic.twitter.com/KnDaIywTXl — Yokai Ryujin (@YokaiCapital) February 9, 2025 Shortly after, Namecheap suspended the website, confirming that it had been flagged as an “abusive service.” We have suspended the abusive service.

However, as of this writing on Feb. 10, the token’s value has dropped to $460 million. The timing of this controversy is crucial, as the crypto world has recently seen a spike in fraudulent meme coin launches. Just a few days ago, scammers hijacked the X accounts of former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and Solana DEX aggregator Jupiter to promote fraudulent memecoins. The similarities in tactics—unexpected high-profile endorsements, rapid website takedowns, and sudden social media suspensions—have led many to believe that CAR might be another high-profile deception. However, at this stage, there is no clear confirmation on whether CAR is an official government-backed initiative or an elaborate scam.

Some look at Ripple pushing XRP or at Cardano driving ADA, while a new contender named Remittix sparks interest with big remittance benefits. Below, we explore how these three compare, especially as a pro-crypto stance from figures like Trump spurs fresh enthusiasm. Ripple and Cardano Under Pressure Recent data shows Ripple trading near $2.41, losing about -15% over the week. Despite dips, fans of Ripple (XRP) note its strong cross-border aims. Even so, progress sometimes slows due to legal or market shifts. Meanwhile, Cardano sits near $0.6991, dropping -19.66%. Enthusiasts of Cardano (ADA) point to its evolving governance and eco-friendly staking, though some watchers say it needs more tangible adoption. Both Ripple and Cardano have big communities, but people still debate the best crypto pick this cycle. If a pro-crypto policy from leaders like Trump ushers in easier rules, either could rebound. Yet the question remains: do they solve major finance problems right now, or do they rely on partial updates? The search for real solutions leads many to check out a coin called Remittix instead. Remittix Surges with Global Focus A fresh star on Ethereum, Remittix leaps ahead by tackling expensive wire fees. Known as Remittix (RTX) , it trades around $0.0567, soaring +300% since presale. Some experts say it mirrors an early Ripple, but with simpler everyday aims. While Cardano (ADA) expands slowly, Remittix cuts costs for freelancers and families sending money worldwide an instant draw for real adoption. Supporters claim Remittix might overtake older networks if more unbanked users adopt it. Because it addresses immediate pain points, Remittix (RTX) can see faster growth than coins waiting on brand appeal. Observers consider it a top contender for the best crypto pick this cycle, shining in practical finance uses. That direct approach is why many compare it to early Ripple before the hype. Why Remittix Could Grab the Altcoin Crown Analysts say coins solving daily money hurdles often rise the quickest. While Ripple (XRP) depends on bank deals, and Cardano (ADA) invests in advanced governance, Remittix (RTX) meets routine transfer needs right away. People paying large fees for cross-border moves see how Remittix can save them time and cash. This advantage could push Remittix beyond the typical altcoin race and label it the best crypto pick this cycle. Because Remittix aims for widespread use, it may outshine projects that rely heavily on image or slow updates. If more users adopt it for cheap remittances, Remittix (RTX) could dethrone older coins. Trump’s pro-crypto signals might open new doors for fast-moving tokens, meaning an upstart like Remittix can capture the limelight. Many watchers now expect Remittix to outpace both Ripple and Cardano, taking this cycle’s altcoin crown. Conclusion Though Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) remain major names, a fresh contender like Remittix (RTX) may claim the top spot in the coming months. By offering quick, low-cost remittances, Remittix stands as the best crypto pick this cycle, solving core finance issues rather than waiting on brand or slow upgrades. As interest in pro-crypto policies grows, Remittix could easily surpass older networks, proving that useful tech and mainstream appeal often lead to the greatest success.

These changes have altered how digital assets are governed and exchanged, and beyond regulatory compliance, this transformation also affects how liquidity and risk are provided and managed, respectively. United States regulators are moving forward with clearer and broader regulatory frameworks for crypto trading. Industry participants have shown maturity, negotiating with relevant authorities to create operational yet viable frameworks. CLS Global is one such player. The top market-making company recently reached a settlement agreement with US authorities on all things regulatory-related. Through this, CLS Global reaffirms its dedication to utmost regulatory compliance by engaging with the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) and other authorities. It doesn’t end there; the market-making company is implementing strict measures and enhancing its service locations to comply with applicable regulations. Traditional markets are not left out. They are experiencing a significant change in models, no thanks to the competition with DeFi protocols for centralized trading avenues. Liquidity providers in the hybrid market face similar challenges; the existence of new trading venues combining DeFi and CeFi capabilities and the growing demand for cross-venue liquidity aggregation. Demand for Infrastructure that Closely Resembles Traditional Markets While Bitcoin’s price movements have garnered attention globally, the underlying and, most times, diminutive changes in how trades are executed are more important. Per an analysis report, there’s a demand for infrastructure that resembles traditional markets and their services, some of which include sophisticated algorithm execution, prime brokerage services, and credit networks. Despite the exponential growth of the industry, technical challenges such as the aforementioned remain. Speaking on this, CLS Global’s CEO, Filipp V, revealed that the next phase of the industry will depend mainly on bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems. The industry’s next phase will be defined by how effectively we bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems. Market makers capable of navigating both landscapes while upholding strong compliance standards will play a key role in shaping the future of digital asset trading, the CEO states. Navigating Financial and Technical Complexities The dynamic nature of the crypto landscape requires a fundamental rethink of existing market-making strategies as well as the incorporation of new features. Some of these include cross-venue inventory management, dynamic risk pricing across multiple blockchains, integration of on-chain and off-chain liquidity sources, and real-time adaptation to settlement finality conditions. As the United States regulatory parameters continue to cover emerging trends and markets, new changes are imminent, meaning that market makers must adapt. Market-making companies will need to evolve and leverage varying forms of automated market-making strategies that merge traditional DeFi features, settlement mechanisms, and advanced cross-chain liquidity provision protocols. CLS Global, as one of the leading market making firms, has demonstrated its commitment to regulatory compliance while providing comprehensive trading solutions and liquidity services to institutional clients globally. CLS Global’s settlement agreement with US authorities and the ongoing development of revolutionary trading strategies puts it at the driver’s seat of this new era of market-making. The company is merging powerful trading algorithms and an extensive liquidity network to deliver CEX solutions. The future of the digital assets market will be shaped by companies that successfully navigate both the technical and financial complexities of the crypto landscape, CLS Global aims to be one.",Information,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|BTC|REGULATION|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-10 04:59:36

Additionally, Kentucky recently became the 16th US state to propose a Bitcoin reserve, which fueled speculation about a potential global BTC accumulation race. Michael Saylor Teases More Bitcoin Purchases Michael Saylor, co-founder of the newly rebranded ”Strategy,” once again hinted at another Bitcoin acquisition after a quick one-week pause in the company’s aggressive BTC accumulation. The tech executive shared his usual Sunday Bitcoin chart post on X, cryptically stating, ”Death to the blue lines. Long live the green dots,” which many believe is a signal for an impending BTC purchase. According to SaylorTracker, Strategy currently holds 471,107 BTC, which is valued at around $45.3 billion. The company still seems very steadfast in its Bitcoin accumulation strategy, integrating BTC deeper into its corporate treasury approach despite the stock experiencing sideways price action. On Feb. 5, MicroStrategy officially rebranded to ”Strategy,” and adopted the Bitcoin logo as well as a Bitcoin-inspired color scheme to better align with its corporate vision. According to CEO Phong Le, the company is innovating in two of the most transformative technologies of the 21st century, which is Bitcoin and artificial intelligence. He believes the company’s new name powerfully reflects the firm’s global appeal. The rebrand announcement coincided with the company’s Q4 2024 earnings call, where it reported $120.7 million in revenue from its software business, which was a 3% year-over-year decline. Additionally, the company recorded a $640 million loss for the quarter. Despite this, Strategy is still very committed to its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition plan, and Q4 2024 was its largest quarter in terms of BTC purchases after adding more than 195,000 BTC during that period. Strategy’s Bitcoin treasury reserve growth (Source: Strategy ) The company outlined multiple bullish catalysts for Bitcoin in 2025, including a potential regulatory framework for digital assets in the US, increased political support for BTC, enhancements to existing Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and broader institutional adoption. Strategy’s stoc k is currently trading at approximately $327 per share, but this is a near 40% decline from its all-time high of around $543 that was recorded in November of 2024. University of Austin Bets Big on Bitcoin The University of Austin is also making a bold move into the world of Bitcoin by launching a pioneering investment fund . The university plans to raise a Bitcoin fund worth more than $5 million as part of its broader $200 million endowment. According to Chun Lai, the foundation’s chief investment officer, the institution is very eager to avoid being left behind as cryptocurrency's potential continues to materialize. This initiative is happening at a time when there is a growing trend of academic institutions showing interest in Bitcoin. Just a few months ago, a regulatory filing revealed that Emory University accumulated more than $15 million worth of Bitcoin through Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin ETF, which made it the first US university endowment to publicly report Bitcoin ETF holdings. The increasing institutional participation in Bitcoin ETFs has the potential to greatly impact the asset’s price, when considering the huge amount of capital these institutions manage. The University of Austin’s approach includes a long-term Bitcoin holding strategy, with a minimum investment period of five years. Chad Thevenot, the university’s senior vice president for advancement, firmly believes in Bitcoin’s long-term value, and even compared it to traditional assets like stocks and real estate. This perspective is very similar to the broader institutional shift towards digital assets as a legitimate and strategic component of diversified portfolios. Beyond educational institutions and traditional financial players, the rise of crypto adoption is also influencing retirement funds. A recent Bitget Research report pointed out a shift in attitudes among younger generations, with up to 20% of Gen Z and Generation Alpha expressing openness to receiving pensions in cryptocurrency. The survey also found that 78% of respondents showed a preference for alternative retirement savings over conventional pension funds, which indicates a more broader shift towards decentralized finance and blockchain-based solutions. Bitget CEO Gracy Chen described these findings as a wake-up call for the financial industry, especially as younger generations demand more modern solutions that offer greater control, flexibility, and transparency. Additionally, the report also revealed that as of January 2025, 40% of people in these demographics already invested in cryptocurrency. (Source: Bitget ) The University of Austin’s initiative proves that there is a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s role in long-term investment strategies, and could very likely set a precedent for other institutions to follow suit. Whether through university endowments or retirement funds, digital assets are becoming an integral part of the future financial ecosystem. Is a Global Bitcoin Accumulation Race About to Begin? Meanwhile, the growing number of Bitcoin reserve proposals in the United States started speculation about a possible global accumulation race, as early adopters could benefit from the cryptocurrency’s long-term monetary incentives. Kentucky recently became the 16th US state to introduce legislation that is aimed at establishing a Bitcoin reserve, which will allocate up to 10% of excess state reserves into digital assets. The move is part of the broader shift toward Bitcoin as a mainstream reserve asset, driven by increasing institutional and national-level adoption. According to Isaac Joshua , CEO of crypto startup platform Gems Launchpad, if Kentucky’s bill is approved, it could set off a domino effect that pushes other states and even nations to follow suit. He believes that once a single state officially adopts Bitcoin in its reserves, others will feel the pressure to do the same. Some of the world’s largest asset managers have already taken steps in this direction, with US spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively holding over 5.91% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, which is worth approximately $113.5 billion. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF alone accounts for almost half of these holdings. With Bitcoin ETFs continuing to see steady inflows, market analysts predict that Bitcoin could soon reach new all-time highs. In 2024, US Bitcoin ETFs contributed roughly 75% of new investments into Bitcoin, and became a key driver behind BTCs climb past $50,000 in mid-February. Bitcoin ETF stats (Source: Due Analytics ) Despite the growing momentum for Bitcoin reserve proposals , there are still some regulatory hurdles to overcome. James Wo, founder and CEO of venture capital firm DFG, pointed out that while the idea of an accumulation race is compelling, Kentucky’s bill is still just a proposal and has not yet been passed. He also mentioned concerns over Bitcoin’s volatility and strict fiscal policies that could make it difficult for legislators to approve such measures. However, if enough states successfully implement Bitcoin reserve policies, it could pave the way for discussions about a potential federal Bitcoin reserve in the future. States considering Bitcoin reserves (Source: Bitcoinlaws ) Kentucky’s proposal was submitted after similar initiatives from 15 other states, including Arizona, Alabama, Florida, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Kansas, and Wyoming. However, Bitcoin’s volatility is still a key point of debate. During the 2022 bear market, Bitcoin saw a sharp 64% correction, while the 2018 downturn resulted in a 73% decline. Nevertheless, Bitcoin has delivered an average return of over 1,077% over the past five years.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|TRADING|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-10 05:01:55

While the broader crypto market remains volatile, XRP is currently in a corrective phase, and there’s no clear indication of a major move upward for now. The price is stuck within a narrow range, with support and resistance levels dictating its short-term direction. At the time of writing, XRP is down by more than three percent and is trading at $2.39. XRP Faces Resistance at Key Levels The most critical resistance level for XRP is between $2.51 and $2.72, which represents the 50% to 88.7% retracement area. For bulls to regain control and start pushing prices higher, they need to break above this zone. As of now, it’s the bears who seem to dominate, as the price is correcting after a previous rally that saw XRP rise from a low of around $2.10 to a high of $2.80 . This correction, while expected, suggests that the bears are currently in charge, pushing the price lower. The latest bounce from the 50% retracement level appears corrective, indicating that the upward move might not be sustainable just yet. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Time to Buy XRP? Expert Reveals Key Insights , Potential Scenarios for XRP: A Range-Bound Market XRP is currently stuck within a defined range, and for now, support levels established over the weekend remain in play. This support, which was defined at key Fibonacci levels, has held strong so far. However, this consolidation phase can’t last forever. A breakout, either to the upside or downside, is expected soon. If the bulls can push past the resistance at $2.80, the next target would be a breakout above the Monday high, which could indicate that the corrective phase is over and a new rally could begin. However, the current trend points toward the possibility of another dip, potentially down to $2.11 or even $1.95 before any further upward momentum. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This triggered a serious panic in the market and is now following a strong negative bias. ADA’s overall market remains bullish on the macro level, but the trend is subjected to a downward slope following a back-to-back drop in the past month. The asset is now considered bearish on a short-term trend. Meanwhile, the last two weeks saw the asset through its biggest drop as it broke down from the $0.8 level to $0.5 – this marked its lowest price for the first time in three months. After a long-wick rejection, the bears showed up again and continued to mount pressure on a daily scale. Though the pressure is not much at the moment. The recent rejection suggested an exhaustion in selling. A rise in the selling volume could cause more dips in the future. If this week’s low holds well as support, we can expect a pushback to the broken level before deciding which direction to go next. At the time of writing, there is no sign of recovery as the price continued to drop. While this market is still under the bears’ radar, we may see a deeper retracement in the next few days. A hold above it should fuel a fresh buy in the market ADA’s Key Levels to Watch Source: Tradingview While ADA is negotiating $0.69, there’s support at $0.6. If it reclaims this week’s $0.5 low, the price may break lower to $0.43 and $0.36. If by any chance a bounce occurs, the potential resistance level for a buy would be $0.765, followed by $0.86. A push above it could bring us to $0.988. The next level for an increase would be $1.152.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/whales-grab-520-million-xrp-heres-the-significance/,"Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted significant XRP accumulation by large holders, commonly called “whales,” during a market dip. According to Martinez, whales purchased 520 million XRP during this period, indicating strategic buying behavior amid price fluctuations. This development has sparked discussions within the crypto community about market dynamics, institutional influence, and price manipulation in the digital asset space. Whales seized the opportunity during the recent dip, buying 520 million $XRP ! pic.twitter.com/v2Lu4uBMgm — Ali (@ali_charts) February 6, 2025 Whale Accumulation and Market Trends Martinez’s observation aligns with historical patterns where large holders capitalize on price drops to accumulate more XRP. This behavior often suggests confidence in the asset’s long-term potential and reflects a strategy commonly used in traditional and crypto markets. The accompanying chart in Martinez’s post illustrates the inverse relationship between whale holdings and price movement, reinforcing the idea that institutional buyers position themselves strategically. A notable factor in these market movements is the role of over-the-counter (OTC) sales and algorithmic trading. According to one X user, Nebulous, institutional players leverage these tools to execute large trades without significantly impacting market prices. Institutions can absorb substantial liquidity without triggering dramatic price spikes by acquiring XRP through OTC transactions. Institutional Influence and Market Behavior The discussion surrounding whale accumulation extends beyond XRP and touches on broader market trends in crypto. As traditional financial entities, including banks and investment funds , increase participation in crypto markets, price behavior becomes more aligned with traditional financial markets like stocks and futures. Nebulous argues that large players manipulate price movements by strategically driving prices higher to attract retail traders before reversing the trend to trigger panic selling. This cycle enables institutions to accumulate assets at lower prices and repeat the process, gradually increasing their holdings without overpaying. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The user also differentiates crypto and stock market trading patterns, emphasizing that institutional traders follow strict timing strategies based on global market openings. While crypto operates 24/7, institutional money is often in sync with traditional financial markets, particularly during key trading hours in the U.S., U.K., and Asia. This observation suggests that crypto traders can benefit from analyzing stock market behaviors to anticipate potential price movements in digital assets. Implications for Retail Traders The growing presence of institutional investors introduces opportunities and challenges for retail traders. Increased liquidity and mainstream adoption can drive long-term value appreciation for assets like XRP . On the other hand, institutional strategies may lead to heightened volatility, requiring retail participants to adopt more sophisticated trading approaches. Nebulous points out that institutional buying often leaves visible “price and time signatures” in market data, which traders can analyze to identify potential accumulation or distribution phases. Understanding these patterns can help retail traders navigate market fluctuations and make informed decisions rather than reacting emotionally to price swings. Retail traders looking to stay competitive in this environment may benefit from studying institutional trading patterns, monitoring OTC activity, and recognizing key market cycles. As the crypto space matures, such insights will become increasingly valuable in navigating the ever-changing landscape of digital assets.

This happens as the ETH price has seen strong selling pressure in recent weeks with short traders showing no signs of remorse. Analysts are weighing whether ETH could see further downfall or if a short squeeze is in the making. Ethereum Short Positions Paint A Scary Picture Over the past week, the Ethereum short positions have skyrocketed increasing by 40% and a staggering 500% since November 2024. Historically, this is the largest bearish bet on the world’s largest altcoin by Wall Street hedge funds as trader sentiment turns extremely negative. Source: ZeroHedge Earlier this month on February 2, a similar extreme positioning on Ethereum saw ETH price dropping 37% within three days on fears of the Trump trade war. Furthermore, the altcoin has seen robust trading volumes overall. Significant spikes were observed on January 21st, coinciding with Inauguration Day, and again during the February 3rd market crash. Despite the strong activity, ETH’s price has yet to recover from the gap lower, even a week after the downturn. Source: The Kobeissi Letter ETH Price Volatility Ahead? A Make-or-Break Situation This extreme positioning on Ethereum shows that it could experience strong ETH price volatility moving ahead. The ETH price has largely underperformed the broader crypto market in recent times while other altcoins managed to hit fresh highs. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has identified $2,600 as a critical support level for (ETH). In a recent post, Martinez suggested that if this level holds, Ethereum could gather enough momentum for a significant rebound, potentially pushing the price toward $3,000 or even $4,000. Traders and investors are closely monitoring ETH’s performance at this key threshold. Source: Ali Charts As of press time, Ethereum price is trading 1% down at $2,636 with its market cap at $317 billion and its daily trading volume surging 20% to $19.5 billion. As per the Coinglass data , the 24-hours liquidations have shot to $44.65 million of which $30 million is in long liquidations. Also, the massive movement of 50,000 ETH by the Ethereum Foundation has made investors cautious, as the fund has been selling the altcoin over the past few months. Crypto analyst Ted Pillows has drawn parallels between Ethereum’s recent price action and the market conditions of March 2020. He noted that ETH experienced a similar capitulation back triggering a long-term breakout for the altcoin. “At the time, many believed Ethereum was finished, but it staged a significant comeback,” he noted. Pillows remains optimistic, projecting Ethereum could reach $10,000 this cycle, calling it a “programmed” milestone. Further, the 90% drop in ETH gas fee could also contribute to the rally ahead.

Over three weeks, ETH attracted over $2 billion in new funds, including a record-breaking weekly inflow of $854 million.

Between February 3 and February 7 (Eastern Time), Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded a net inflow of $204 million, while the spot Ethereum ETFs outpaced Bitcoin with a notable net inflow of $420 million during the same period.

With 1,762 BTC and a bold 21,000 BTC target, it’s Asia’s top BTC play. Metaplanet Inc. has become Japan’s fastest-rising stock, surging more than 3,600% over the past 12 months as the country experiences a surge in Bitcoin ( BTC ) demand. Best performing Japanese stocks over the last 12 months | Source: TradingView The company, originally a hotel developer, pivoted to a Bitcoin-first strategy in early 2024 after pandemic-related struggles forced it to close most of its properties. Now, its stock has outperformed every other Japanese equity, attracting waves of retail investors looking for exposure to Bitcoin. The surge comes amid a global shift in sentiment, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of $109,000 on Jan. 20, the day of US President Donald Trump ’s inauguration. While BTC has since pulled back, trading at $97,000 as of this writing on Feb. 10, Metaplanet’s stock has continued to climb, reflecting growing interest in Bitcoin as an investment vehicle. CEO Simon Gerovich, a former Goldman Sachs equity derivatives trader, has drawn comparisons to Michael Saylor’s Strategy , formerly MicroStrategy, which has amassed over $45 billion in Bitcoin. Inspired by Saylor’s approach, Gerovich repositioned Metaplanet as Japan’s version of the American Bitcoin proxy, betting on BTC’s long-term growth. Expansion plans and the future of Metaplanet’s Bitcoin strategy Metaplanet’s transformation has led to a massive influx of investors. In 2024, its shareholder base increased by 500%, reaching nearly 50,000 investors, according to company data. While institutional players such as Capital Group—who also hold shares in Strategy—have taken positions, most of Metaplanet’s investors are retail traders, many with limited experience in crypto markets. A key factor in this retail surge is Japan’s revamped Nippon Individual Savings Account program, which was introduced in early 2024 to encourage long-term investment. Under the program, Japanese citizens can invest in stocks tax-free, making Metaplanet an attractive alternative to direct Bitcoin purchases, which are subject to capital gains taxes of up to 55%. As of the latest figures , Metaplanet holds 1,762 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $171 million at the time. The company has set an ambitious target to grow its holdings to 10,000 Bitcoin by the end of 2025 and 21,000 by the end of 2026. To reach its goal, Metaplanet plans to issue 21 million shares, aiming to raise approximately $750 million, marking the largest equity capital raise for Bitcoin in Asia to date. Beyond Bitcoin accumulation, Metaplanet is also integrating its remaining hotel business into its crypto-focused identity. Later this year, it plans to rebrand its last remaining property, the Royal Oak in Tokyo’s Gotanda district, as “The Bitcoin Hotel.” The hotel will serve as a hub for Bitcoin-related seminars and investor events, aligning with the company’s push to position itself at the center of Japan’s crypto economy. Despite its remarkable growth, Metaplanet faces risks. The company has posted six consecutive years of losses but is expected to report a profit in its upcoming fourth-quarter earnings. Analysts warn that if Bitcoin’s price drops sharply, the firm’s stock could see a sharp reversal, as its valuation is heavily tied to BTC’s performance.",News|Bitcoin|Japan,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ASIA|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-02-10 05:25:33

Analysts predict a bullish wave , especially for heavyweights like Solana and XRP . Meanwhile, the newest contender, Remittix , is fast gaining traction as it continues its presale. Many see this emerging platform as a potential 10x or even 20x gem, given its plan to merge crypto with FIAT in a user-friendly way. Across the board, altcoins have been reclaiming lost ground. Daily trading volumes are rising, and bullish sentiment is returning as more investors re-enter the market. After a wave of regulatory news and macroeconomic shifts, there’s renewed optimism that top altcoins like Solana and XRP will benefit from a broad upswing. With such robust momentum, let’s explore what could propel these three tokens to new heights. Solana: Speed, Scalability, and Surge Recent data shows Solana boasting over 2,000 transactions per second on average though it can theoretically handle up to 65,000 TPS . Transaction costs often remain below $0.001, making it one of the most cost-effective platforms in crypto. Solana’s market capitalization, currently above $98 billion , has rebounded from lows seen last year. Developers praise Solana for its swift transaction speeds and a wide array of DeFi and NFT projects. On-chain metrics highlight a jump in active addresses, reaching over 123 million monthly active users an impressive figure reflecting renewed interest. Thanks to these solid fundamentals and ongoing upgrades, some analysts forecast 10x potential for Solana in the coming bull cycle, driven largely by sustained user growth and innovative dApps. XRP: Overcoming Obstacles, Poised For Growth For a long time, regulatory hurdles created uncertainty for XRP , a token with a market cap hovering around $141 billion and known for its use in cross-border payments. Despite legal battles , XRP has maintained a dedicated global community, with daily trading volumes often surpassing $3.7 billion. Major financial institutions continue to explore solutions using XRP for near-instant settlements, reflecting strong demand for the technology behind Ripple’s network. Following positive developments in ongoing legal cases, investor sentiment around XRP has improved markedly. This has led to renewed predictions of a possible 20x upside if widespread adoption continues and the token’s utility for international transfers sees broader institutional uptake. Should the regulatory landscape turn more favorable, the stage could be set for an even bigger rally. Remittix: The Fastest Growing Crypto Presale At the center of all this excitement is Remittix, a project currently in presale at Remittix has quickly earned a reputation for merging digital assets with FIAT in a cost-efficient way. By allowing users to send crypto and deliver FIAT to any bank account worldwide, Remittix addresses a key gap in the market bridging the convenience of traditional banking with the speed and innovation of blockchain. Consider Michael, a freelance web designer in South America who just completed a contract for a client in Europe. Typically, high remittance fees and bank delays would reduce his earnings. With Remittix, Michael can receive payment in crypto, then convert those funds to FIAT and deposit them straight into his bank account with minimal fees and near-instant processing. This real-world application of blockchain solutions sets Remittix apart from speculative tokens lacking tangible utility. Remittix aims to raise $36m, making it one of the fastest-growing opportunities in today’s market. Some experts predict a 30x potential once it officially launches, bolstered by the platform’s seamless integration of crypto with traditional finance. If you’re eager to join its presale, head over to Remittix but act quickly, as tokens are selling at a rapid pace. Remittix Set to Steal the Spotlight While Solana and XRP look primed for a bullish wave , Remittix has emerged as the most exciting prospect for investors seeking the next breakout star. Its real-world focus bridging crypto and FIAT coupled with a fast-moving presale suggests a game-changing advantage over traditional tokens. With expert forecasts of 10x , 20x , or even 30x gains, Remittix stands poised to grab the limelight. Join the presale now to secure your share before it closes, and don’t forget to connect with the Remittix community. As the altcoin rally heats up, this dynamic newcomer could very well redefine how the world views crypto and cross-border finance.

Coinbase’s assets under management (AUM) have surpassed those of major US banks, highlighting the growing influence of crypto exchanges in traditional finance. Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has uncovered significant inefficiencies in government spending, sparking discussions about the role blockchain technology could play in enhancing transparency. Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Saves Taxpayers $36.7 Billion, Sparks Blockchain Transparency Debate Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has delivered a significant financial breakthrough for the US government, saving taxpayers a staggering $36.7 billion in just a few weeks. This development has reignited discussions among cryptocurrency and blockchain leaders about leveraging decentralized technology to enhance transparency in government spending. According to data from Doge-tracker, the savings account for just 1.8% of Musk’s ambitious goal to slash US government spending by up to $2 trillion. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO unveiled his cost-cutting vision during an interview with political strategist Mark Penn on Jan. 9, highlighting his commitment to fiscal responsibility and government accountability. Musk’s initiative has gained widespread applause from the crypto community. Coinbase co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong expressed his support in a Feb. 9 social media post, praising the DOGE program’s progress and urging further government transparency. “Great progress DOGE,” Armstrong wrote on X, joining other industry voices in advocating for blockchain-based solutions to improve public financial oversight. Blockchain technology has long been touted as a tool for increased transparency in financial systems, thanks to its decentralized nature and publicly verifiable ledgers. By integrating blockchain into government financial operations, transactions could become more accountable and verifiable in real time. A blockchain-powered treasury system could also introduce a more democratic approach to budget allocations. Some experts propose the implementation of mandatory spending proposals, wherein expenditures would require public voting approval before being executed. This approach, they argue, would significantly reduce inefficiencies and corruption in government finance. In a separate development, Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency uncovered a startling $100 billion annual loophole in US government spending. According to Musk, this sum was distributed as entitlement payments to individuals lacking Social Security numbers or valid temporary identity numbers, raising serious concerns over potential fraud. “When I asked if anyone at Treasury had a rough guess for what percentage of that number is unequivocal and obvious fraud, the consensus in the room was about half, so $50B/year or $1B/week!! This is utterly insane and must be addressed immediately,” Musk wrote in a Feb. 8 X post. Following this revelation, DOGE and the US Treasury reached a joint agreement aimed at introducing stricter auditing criteria and enhancing financial oversight. One of the key measures includes mandating payment categorization codes, which Musk claims were often left blank in previous transactions, making audits nearly impossible. Additionally, all payments must now include a detailed rationale explaining the necessity of each expenditure. Another major reform is the overhaul of the government’s “DO-NOT-PAY” list, which currently undergoes annual updates. Under Musk’s proposal, the list of flagged entities will be updated weekly or even daily to prevent fraudulent transactions from slipping through the cracks. Musk’s Vision for Blockchain in Government Finance Musk’s cost-cutting initiative has drawn attention from crypto and blockchain advocates who argue that his transparency-driven policies could pave the way for a blockchain-integrated US Treasury. Jean Rausis, co-founder of decentralized finance platform Smardex, believes that embracing blockchain technology could position the US as a global leader in financial innovation. “While it’s hard to say which blockchain would be up to the task, the important thing is that it is permissionless. Otherwise, the promised transparency would be just a sham. But if the US Treasury embraces decentralized infrastructure, this could be a catalyst for the Web2 and Web3 worlds to start merging,” Rausis said in a recent interview. The idea of moving government spending to blockchain has long been debated, with proponents citing benefits such as fraud prevention, auditability, and cost efficiency. By leveraging decentralized networks, public financial data could be easily accessible, ensuring that citizens have real-time visibility into where their tax dollars are going. Since its official website launch on Jan. 21, DOGE has already generated massive savings for US taxpayers, demonstrating the effectiveness of Musk’s cost-cutting strategies. However, the program is only in its early stages, with a long-term objective of reducing government bureaucracy and inefficiencies. According to Musk, DOGE’s work is set to conclude on July 4, 2026, aligning with the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. By that time, the goal is to establish a “smaller government with more efficiency and less bureaucracy.” Musk’s efforts to reshape US government spending could have far-reaching implications beyond fiscal policy. If blockchain technology is adopted at the federal level, it may signal a paradigm shift in how governments worldwide manage finances. As the crypto industry continues to push for financial transparency, Musk’s initiatives may serve as a proving ground for the integration of blockchain into public administration. Whether or not his vision materializes, one thing remains clear: the debate over government spending and financial transparency is far from over. Coinbase's $420 Billion AUM Surpasses Major US Banks, Showcasing Crypto’s Growing Dominance In related news, Coinbase , the third-largest centralized cryptocurrency exchange (CEX) by trading volume, is now managing over $420 billion worth of digital assets on behalf of its users, a figure that positions it ahead of major financial institutions in the United States. According to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, this staggering assets under management (AUM) figure makes Coinbase more valuable than the 21st largest bank in the country. In a Feb. 7 post on X, Armstrong drew a comparison between Coinbase’s AUM and traditional banking institutions, highlighting the platform’s rapid expansion. “If you think of Coinbase like a bank, we now hold about $0.42T in assets for our customers, which would make us the 21st largest bank in the US by total assets, and growing,” he wrote in the post. Armstrong further noted that if Coinbase were classified as a brokerage firm instead of a bank, it would rank as the eighth-largest brokerage firm in the US by AUM. This comparison signals the cryptocurrency exchange’s increasing relevance in the financial sector, especially as more investors and institutions turn to digital assets. Coinbase’s $420 billion in assets under management is more than three times the $112.9 billion controlled by New York Community Bancorp (NYCB), currently the 21st largest bank in the US. NYCB, which acquired the now-defunct Signature Bank in 2023—a crypto-friendly bank that collapsed in the wake of regulatory scrutiny—recently posted a $260 million loss for the fourth quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, Coinbase turned a profit of $273 million in Q4 2024, marking its first profitable quarter since late 2021. This milestone reinforces the notion that crypto platforms are increasingly outperforming traditional financial institutions in the digital era. Brian Armstrong envisions a future where crypto-driven financial services consolidate into one primary financial account, replacing the fragmented nature of traditional banking and brokerage services. “With crypto, the line between these categories is blurring. In the updated financial system, you will have a single primary financial account which serves all these functions. A greater percentage of global GDP will run on more efficient crypto rails over time,” Armstrong explained. Removing Crypto’s Friction Points for Mainstream Adoption Despite the massive growth in AUM and adoption, Armstrong and other industry leaders acknowledge that crypto still faces several barriers before achieving mass adoption. Coinbase’s Senior Director of Engineering, Chintan Turakhia, speaking at EthCC, highlighted key friction points that must be addressed before the next wave of users can fully integrate crypto into their financial lives. “If our goal is to bring in the next billion users—and let’s start with just 100 million—we have to take all those friction points out, ” Turakhia said. Some of the most pressing challenges he identified include: Complicated wallet setup: Users still struggle with seed phrases and the technical requirements of self-custody wallets. Transaction fees: High and unpredictable gas fees make transactions expensive and inconvenient. Blockchain-native tokens: Many users find it difficult to purchase and use blockchain-native tokens like ETH, SOL, or MATIC to interact with decentralized applications (dApps). Coinbase’s increasing AUM suggests a growing institutional and retail trust in digital assets as a viable alternative to traditional banking. With continued technological improvements, regulatory developments, and mainstream financial integrations, Coinbase could climb even higher in the rankings of the largest financial institutions. As traditional banks struggle with liquidity issues and regulatory hurdles, crypto platforms like Coinbase are positioning themselves as the next generation of financial powerhouses—ones that operate on decentralized, transparent, and borderless financial rails. With Armstrong’s vision of a single, crypto-powered financial ecosystem, the industry may soon witness a new era of financial dominance, one where digital assets drive the bulk of global economic activity. Coinbase's meteoric rise in AUM solidifies its role as a major player in global finance, outpacing even well-established US banks. As cryptocurrency adoption accelerates, the lines between banks, brokerages, and digital asset platforms are becoming increasingly blurred. The coming years will determine whether Coinbase—and the broader crypto industry—can fully replace or integrate into the traditional financial system.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|DOGE|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-10 05:30:00

Making an allocation to the right tokens can have a transformative effect on portfolio size and could make the difference between mediocre profits and generational wealth over the coming months. Experts have identified the following small-cap tokens as the most bullish projects in the crypto space right now. Plume, Telcoin, Comedian, Rollblock and Kava are all expected to rally magnificently this year, although Rollblock ($RBLK) stands out with predictions of a 50x rally in 2025 as it comes to dominate the crypto gaming sector. Rollblock ($RBLK): The Future of Blockchain-Backed Gaming Ramps Up Adoption Rollblock ($ RBLK ) is superbly well-positioned to benefit from the massive popularity of crypto gaming. With its genius move of securing each transaction and payout on the Ethereum blockchain, Rollblock has stamped out one of the major pain points for the $500 billion gaming industry, as now gamers have all the tools they need to verify for themselves that no shady manipulation has taken place behind the scenes. December was a huge month for Rollblock, resulting in an incredible 600% surge in new registrations on the platform . Rollblock has an impressive lineup of more than 7000 games alongside a sports prediction league that allows gamers to place bets across thousands of live fixtures and events. Rollblock allocates 30% of its profits toward buying back $RBLK, with 60% of these tokens immediately burned to reduce the overhanging supply, while 40% is used to fund staking rewards of up to 30%. This results in a drastic reduction in selling pressure, as the vast majority of these purchased tokens will never see the light of day again. Stage 10 $RBLK tokens are currently selling rapidly for the discounted price of $0.053. As its adoption continues to grow this year and its user base continues to swell, Rollblock could easily become a breakout project that sees its early adopters enjoy returns of more than 50x this year. Plume ($PLUME) Delivers Real-World Tokenization With Multiple Partnerships Plume gained 3.9% today to reach $0.11. The last seven days of trading have seen the price of Plume plummet by 31% as it was unable to hold its value above $0.16. Plume is one of the brightest stars in the RWA (real-world asset) niche, building out its ecosystem with 180 partners and 3.5 million active wallets. Plume recently completed a successful real-world airdrop, ensuring a fair distribution of its $PLUME tokens across the RWA community. This resulted in users of Ondo, Polymarket, and World Liberty Financial Gaming receiving generous allocations to Plume. Plume uses cutting-edge Skylink technology to bring together RWA hubs and deliver yield to its community members. Plume could easily reach the $1 level this quarter. Telcoin ($TEL): Disrupting Payments with Blockchain Telcoin has fallen by 3.2% in the last 24 hours as its price finds support at $0.0065. Telcoin is one of the few tokens to have had a positive month of price action, returning more than 21% as the Telcoin price has risen from $0.005. The Telcoin market cap is still comparatively small at just $602 million, giving Telcoin a place at 210 in the crypto rankings. Telcoin recently became the first federally regulated digital asset depository bank in the United States. Telcoin outlined its plans to issue dollar-backed stablecoins ($eUSD). Telcoin’s stablecoins will ensure secure storage and integrate seamlessly with traditional finance. Telcoin has assured the Nebraska Department of Banking and Finance that it will maintain liquid assets in US dollars equal to the complete value of any stablecoins that are issued on Telcoin. Telcoin is a strong contender for mass adoption as it will bring massively reduced fees for its near-instant transactions. Telcoin could easily reach $0.06 in 2025. Comedian ($BAN) Satirical Meme Coin with Serious Potential Comedian ($BAN) is gaining massive hype as the next big meme coin in crypto. Comedian offers rapid transactions for close to $0 fees and has seen huge adoption recently with its fun community-driven ecosystem. Comedian takes its inspiration from Cattelan’s artwork of a banana that was infamously purchased by Tron CEO Justin Sun. It takes a humorous swipe at the meme coin industry while capturing the mischievous spirit of the original artwork. Comedian has gained an astonishing 92% in the last seven days to trade at $0.063 at the time of writing. The market cap of Comedian is currently just above $63 million, securing Comedian a place at 469 in the crypto top 500. Meme coins such as Comedian are notoriously volatile and prone to wild swings in either direction. Comedian could deliver explosive gains if it continues to gain traction during Q1. Kava ($KAVA) Brings AI Compatibility to Blockchain Kava has gained 3.7% this week to trade at $0.46. In the last month, the price of Kava has fallen by 3% as it was unable to follow through on its recent rally. Kava is based on the Cosmos blockchain and is taking great leaps toward integrating artificial intelligence into its blockchain tech. On the 13th of January, the Kava network published the DeAI light paper, which outlined its roadmap to transform Kava into a decentralized AI project. This will involve removing any kind of centralized control over AI systems, ensuring ongoing data privacy on-chain, and collaborating with global leaders in the industry. Kava is ideally designed to handle the specific computational demands of AI, including decentralized storage and smart contracts for AI agents. Given that AI is such a fast-growing sector of the crypto economy, Kava looks set to trade over $3 in Q1 if it can deliver on its ambitious plans. Rollblock Will See a Meteoric Rise This Year Plume, Telcoin, Comedian, and Kava will likely see extraordinary upside in 2025, but Rollblock ($RBLK) stands out as the ultimate Web3 investment at this time. With its deflationary tokenomics and massive user growth, Rollblock could easily deliver the biggest gains of the year—potentially up to 50x or more.

These Cryptos Could Be the Biggest Movers of 2025!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-to-500k-these-cryptos-could-be-the-biggest-movers-of-2025/,"Could THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN Be the Key to $555K? Bitcoin (BTC) changed the lives of early investors with its groundbreaking returns, and Ethereum (ETH) reshaped the crypto world with its smart contracts. Now, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN , a new coin, is being called the next big opportunity for exponential growth. Why THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is the Ultimate Choice 1. A Fresh Entrant With Massive Potential: As a newly launched coin, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers investors the chance to enter at the ground floor. Its early-stage momentum makes it one of the most promising opportunities to achieve life-changing gains. 2. Record-Breaking Presale Success: Raising $1.5 million almost instantly, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven itself as a high-demand asset. This presale success has cemented its place as a token with unmatched growth potential. 3. Exclusivity That Drives Demand: Unlike ETH, MATIC, or APT, which are widely traded on multiple exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at magacoinofficial.com This exclusivity creates urgency and scarcity, increasing its value to early adopters. How It Stands Up Against Competitors XRP: A leader in payments, but it no longer offers the early-stage returns seen with this new coin. Solana (SOL): Strong in scalability but can’t match the momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Optimism (OP): A rising Layer-2 solution but lacks the excitement surrounding this token. SEI: Innovative but doesn’t have the same presale success or exclusivity. Secure Your Position Before It’s Too Late With its record-breaking presale and massive growth projections, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN is quickly becoming the most talked-about investment of 2025. Could $500 really turn into $555K? The answer lies in this explosive new coin.

Given Bitcoin’s current price of approximately $96,791, this historical ratio would theoretically price XRP at $21.75 today. The post generated mixed reactions within the crypto community, with some arguing that XRP remains significantly undervalued, while others dismissed the calculation as outdated and unrealistic. The minimum price $XRP is supposed to be right now is $21.75. That’s all I have to say. pic.twitter.com/awCOaHnNjO — Amonyx (@amonbuy) February 6, 2025 The Basis for the $21.75 Valuation Amonyx’s calculation is derived from this formula: 0.00022465 BTC x 96,791 USD/BTC = 21.75 USD/XRP. This approach assumes that XRP could maintain its peak BTC ratio in today’s market. However, it does not consider shifts in market structure, adoption trends, liquidity changes, or the evolving dominance of Bitcoin over the years. Community Reactions and Market Sentiment Following Amonyx’s post, several users on X (formerly Twitter) shared their perspectives. An X user, Prometheus (@Prometheus), criticized the idea, stating , “This is indicative of a dead token whose fan base can’t seem to accept its fate or can not adapt to the changes.” This reflects the skepticism some traders hold regarding XRP’s long-term potential. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another X user, ConsciousnessHub (@ConsciousnessHub), offered a different viewpoint, arguing that while XRP is “not a dead token, it’s overhyped.” He further explained, “Purely on market cap, this coin can’t raise to 20 dollars in the next 5 years. That means investors need to buy billions and billions of XRP.” This response highlights concerns regarding XRP’s high circulating supply and the capital required to drive such a price increase. While Amonyx’s calculation presents an interesting perspective, the assumption that XRP should be priced at $21.75 based solely on a past BTC ratio does not account for evolving market dynamics. Reaching such a price would require significant institutional investment, regulatory clarity , and increased market adoption. The discussion surrounding XRP’s value remains a contentious topic within the crypto community. Some believe it is undervalued with strong future potential, while others argue that its large supply and market conditions make such price levels unrealistic in the near term. Regardless, XRP continues to be a focal point in cryptocurrency discussions. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

40141987,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=127296,1739165696,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Cryptocurrency Prices and News: Will Bitcoin Rebound While Panshibi Is Set for Remarkable Growth?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/cryptocurrency-prices-and-news-will-bitcoin-rebound-while-panshibi-is-set-for-remarkable-growth/,"The Bitcoin price today sits at $96,424.94, reflecting a 5.61% drop over the past week. Many analysts remain cautiously optimistic that BTC could soon reverse course, especially if trading volumes rebound and institutional interest resurfaces. Meanwhile, the broader crypto market shows a mix of red and green, with some altcoins stabilizing as others seek momentum. In this uncertain environment, an emerging meme coin called Panshibi ($SHIBI) is garnering attention, prompting comparisons to earlier tokens that delivered exceptional returns. Bitcoin: A Possible Rebound? Traders monitoring the Bitcoin price today believe a short-term bounce is possible, though not guaranteed. Some point to historical patterns in which BTC dips precede robust recoveries – particularly when market watchers perceive oversold conditions. For a genuine upswing, however, observers say Bitcoin needs fresh catalysts, such as renewed corporate adoption or favorable regulatory announcements. Whales also play a role: increased buy-ins from large holders often coincide with reversals, though there’s no hard confirmation that’s about to happen. Cautious optimism surrounds the prospect that macroeconomic events – like easing inflation or central bank policy shifts – might shift capital back into crypto. Still, without a decisive push, Bitcoin price today might see more tepid trading. Many in the community remain confident that a future rally could emerge within months, potentially lifting the entire market from its lull. Panshibi ($SHIBI): A Meme Coin Poised for Growth As the Bitcoin price shows increasing volatility today, a different story is emerging in the meme coin sphere. Panshibi has combined comedic flair with a structured presale strategy to offer more than a fleeting novelty. Liquidity is locked for a full 10 years, team tokens remain locked for two and the contract undergoes rigorous auditing – measures specifically designed to safeguard early adopters. Now in Stage 3 of its presale at $0.004, $SHIBI has amassed over $700k, underscoring strong optimism in an otherwise unpredictable market environment. Beyond the surface-level buzz, Panshibi’s AI-driven “social-fi” features seek to keep the community active through staking rewards and quest-based engagement. By weaving fun branding with solid tokenomics, the project recalls earlier meme coins that soared by fusing humor with tangible value. If BTC and major altcoins remain sluggish, $SHIBI could provide an alluring alternative – especially for those aiming at 10x or 100x returns in 2025. This combination of security, comedic appeal and interactive user design places Panshibi at the forefront of up-and-coming meme tokens. Panda Power Over a Shaky BTC? While the Bitcoin price today hovers around $96K, speculation abounds as to whether a quick rebound can restore faith in the leading cryptocurrency. At the same time, altcoins like XRP maintain moderate interest, fueled by ongoing developments. Against this backdrop, Panshibi ($SHIBI) offers an alternative narrative: a meme coin meticulously constructed to address common pitfalls in the genre. If 2025’s market sees another wave of meme coin mania, Panshibi’s staged launch and comedic branding could yield the kind of explosive growth that more established tokens struggle to match.

Meanwhile, newer tokens like Remittix investment are shifting the focus toward real-world adoption. With the potential for the best crypto for 30 x returns, it’s crucial to explore whether meme coins can sustain their hype or if a utility-driven project like Remittix is the smarter choice. The difference is clear: speculation vs. real-world impact. Shiba Inu: Can the Hype Last? The large Shiba Inu (SHIB) community base exists primarily because people speculate on its value. Social media trends celebrity endorsements, and widespread interest in Dogecoin success drove the increase in Shiba Inu price. However, despite its popularity, SHIB faces challenges in proving real utility. The Shibarium layer-2 solution was introduced to add functionality, reducing transaction costs and improving scalability. The biggest issue with SHIB is its reliance on market trends rather than innovation. Investors seeking the best crypto for 30x returns may find it risky due to its unpredictable nature. Unlike projects solving real-world financial problems, SHIB remains a speculative asset with uncertain long-term potential. Dogecoin: The Original Meme Coin’s Struggle for Relevance Dogecoin (DOGE) entered the world as a funny digital currency standard before transforming into a top cryptocurrency in the industry. Despite its strong branding and endorsements from Elon Musk, DOGE struggles with adoption beyond a tipping currency. The absence of a supply limit in Dogecoin leads to unavoidable inflation in the system. DOGE operates with a safe functional network but its lack of development forbids it from being a credible market participant. Although DOGE has been accepted as payment by a few companies, it lacks integration into mainstream finance. It remains highly speculative, with price surges tied to social media hype rather than technological advancements. For those looking for best crypto for 30x returns, DOGE presents challenges due to its limited use case and reliance on market sentiment. It’s a fun, community-driven token, but without real-world utility, its long-term sustainability is questionable. Remittix: The Future of Crypto Utility and Banking Integration Unlike meme coins, Remittix investment is built to solve real financial problems. The technology allows crypto users to make CRYPTO-TO-FIAT transactions without any friction between the two financial domains. Crypto users achieve a major industry breakthrough through this solution which solves their most pressing issue of accessing usable FIAT currency from their digital assets. Consider the 1.4 billion unbanked individuals worldwide. Many lack access to banking services but can receive and send cryptocurrency. Through Remittix, they can convert their digital assets into cash, send funds via Western Union, or use them for daily expenses without relying on traditional banks. This aligns with crypto’s core values: financial freedom, anonymity, and control over one’s wealth. Why Remittix Is the Smartest Investment Right Now Beyond solving real-world issues, Remittix offers investors huge upside potential. It is currently in its presale stage, aiming to raise $36M, with early investors positioned for massive gains. The presale is structured to provide the best crypto for 30x return, making it an attractive alternative to meme coins. The Remittix investment model also competes directly with fintech giants like Stripe, Wise, and Coinbase. Remittix provides direct transactions to users because it operates without additional platform intermediaries which enables efficient and cost-effective payments. The industry faces a revolutionary shift through Remittix because it solves the problems of both expensive service charges and slow transaction timelines which affect global money transfers. Remittix builds a streamlined environment through blockchain that keeps the user in control of their assets together with traditional financial capabilities. While SHIB vs DOGE will continue to dominate social media discussions, their long-term value remains uncertain. Meme coins thrive on hype, but without real-world application, they face sustainability challenges. Remittix investment, on the other hand, is tackling one of the biggest pain points in crypto bridging the gap between digital assets and FIAT usability. With the potential for the best crypto for 30x returns, real-world adoption, and financial inclusivity, Remittix stands out as the smarter choice for forward-thinking investors.

The poster claimed that the token would help give CAR more worldly exposure and boost national development. However, two deepfake detectors have flagged the account’s video announcement as suspicious, raising concerns about whether the CAR token is just a big scam. Seferbekov and Ensemble detectors found the President’s video could be a deepfake In his X post , Faustion said : “Today, we are launching $CAR – an experiment designed to show how something as simple as a meme can unite people, support national development and put the Central African Republic on the world stage in a unique way.” – President Faustion-Archange Touadera In another post, the president added that he has always been supportive of crypto, and his country’s acceptance of Bitcoin as legal tender is a testament to that. Faustian then posted a video announcement for the new CAR meme coin, inviting the public to revel in the news. However, Deepware’s deepfake detector has flagged the video as ‘suspicious,’ with the Seferbekov model on the checker showing an 82% chance that the video was fabricated. Similarly, the Ensemble model revealed a 60% chance. Meanwhile, two other models on the checker tool, Avatarify and Deepware’s own checker, did not find the video to be a deepfake. Others have also expressed their doubts about the credibility of the president’s message, presuming that his X account could have been hacked. In a now-deleted post , Yokai Ryujin, founder of unrevealed XYZ, warned his team to be cautious about the new meme coin. He said its domain was registered about three days ago on namecheap.com—something he thinks a president of a country would not do. Moreover, X suspended the official account for the CAR meme coin announcements, but Faustion said he was working with the social media platform to restore the account. The CAR meme coin reached a record valuation of $600 million As per the official CAR meme coin website, the project’s tokenomics is as follows: for the country’s development, 25% will go to creators, 20.7% is planned for the liquidity pool, 10% will go to charity, and 9.3% is meant for public distribution. According to Solscan , about 33% of the CAR tokens are already in one wallet, 25% in another, and 9.81% and 8.39% are held in two other wallets. However, the 20.7% of the token supply dedicated to liquidity has yet to be included in the token’s liquidity pool. So far, the token has even reached a peak valuation of over $600 million before dropping to $298 million. The CAR token is currently trading at $0.2937.

Polymarket has become the go to avenue for placing on-chain bets, which has brought in scrutiny from regulators. Some countries have outright banned Polymarket, while the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) wants to gain access to the platform 's customer data. According to crypto attorney Aaron Brogan , the argument that prediction markets, like Polymarket, are simply a Web3 version of gambling is an inaccurate characterization. Brogan, said that unlike traditional betting platform, prediction markets make money on the transactions fees rather that the users. Regardless of the challenges, Polymarket is thriving and bettors are gaining or losing big sums of money. Traders go hard on sports bets On-chain from Polymarket Analytics shows that one trader going by the handle 'abeautifulmind' took home a profit of over $550,000 from their bets on the Eagles. Data shows that this user has an overall profit of just over $1 million, mostly from bets on sports. On the other side of the trade was a bettor by the name of hubertdakid, who lost $718,633 by betting against the Eagles. This trader seems to be down on their luck on Polymarket, with an overall loss of $638,177. Other Superbowl related contracts on Polymarket included one about how many times Taylor Swift would be shown on the broadcast and another about how long the national anthem performance would be. Overall, lifetime volume from sports related contracts on Polymarket has passed $6 billion. This is more than the volume on U.S. election markets, which came in at $5.2 billion according to Polymarket Analytics.",Markets,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-10 06:02:14

Vought announced the decision in a Feb. 9 post on X, stating that the CFPB would not request its next round of funding from the Federal Reserve. “I have notified the Federal Reserve that CFPB will not be taking its next draw of unappropriated funding because it is not ‘reasonably necessary’ to carry out its duties,” Vought wrote, adding that the agency’s current balance of $711.6 million is excessive given the fiscal climate. CFPB: Safeguarding Consumers from Predatory Financial Practices The CFPB was established to oversee financial institutions and protect consumers from predatory practices, particularly in response to the 2008 financial crisis. The agency has also played a role in handling complaints against U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges. However, it has been a point of contention within the crypto industry. Last year, the CFPB considered regulating crypto wallet providers but later dropped the initiative after facing industry pushback. According to Reuters , Vought sent a memo instructing CFPB employees to halt all supervisory and examination activities. Staff were also ordered to suspend investigations, refrain from initiating new cases, and discontinue issuing rules or public guidance. Additionally, the memo reportedly directed staff to work remotely this week as the agency’s offices would be closed. Pursuant to the Consumer Financial Protection Act, I have notified the Federal Reserve that CFPB will not be taking its next draw of unappropriated funding because it is not ""reasonably necessary"" to carry out its duties. The Bureau's current balance of $711.6 million is in fact… — Russ Vought (@russvought) February 9, 2025 The CFPB’s funding structure differs from most federal agencies, as it operates through budget requests to the Federal Reserve rather than congressional appropriations. Vought, who also serves as director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, framed the funding cutoff as a move toward greater accountability. “This spigot, long contributing to CFPB’s unaccountability, is now being turned off,” Vought stated. He was appointed to lead the agency on Feb. 7, replacing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Vought Advocates for Government Restructuring Vought has a history of advocating for significant government restructuring. He co-authored Project 2025 , a right-wing policy initiative aimed at increasing presidential power. The decision to freeze CFPB operations has drawn sharp criticism. Dennis Kelleher, co-founder of the financial oversight advocacy group Better Markets, condemned the move as an attack on consumers. “This latest attempt to kill the consumer bureau is another slap in the face for all Americans who depend on basic financial products and services,” Kelleher said, accusing Trump of exposing his own supporters to financial risks. Notably, the U.S. government is showing increasing support for the crypto industry. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently scaled back its crypto enforcement unit , signaling a softer stance on regulation. Additionally, Donald Trump signed an executive order directing the creation of a sovereign wealth fund, with pro-crypto officials Scott Bessent and Howard Lutnick among those managing it. Speculation is growing that this fund could include Bitcoin as part of its portfolio. Meanwhile, David Sacks, White House “crypto czar,” suggested the U.S. is looking to integrate stablecoins into the financial system, aiming to strengthen the dollar’s dominance internationally and digitally.

Recent predictions from investment giant VanEck have only added to Solana’s growing reputation. According to VanEck, Solana ($SOL) is on track to see its price surge by the end of 2025—to $520, in fact. This is a really bullish outlook. And the reason for it? VanEck says that Solana is gaining market share in the smart contract platform space. Not only is VanEck saying that Solana’s growth is impressive, but also that it’s very much a “dominate or be dominated” kind of scenario. DEX volumes, active users, and developers are all flocking to Solana. VanEck's prediction of #Solana reaching $520 by the end of 2025 is based on its projected market share within the smart contract platform (SCP) market. Solana is expected to increase its market share from 15% to 22% by the end of 2025, driven by its developer dominance, growth… pic.twitter.com/GCasQOWbft — Poloniex Exchange (@Poloniex) February 7, 2025 Solana’s Projected Market Growth VanEck bases its prediction of Solana reaching $520 by the end of 2025 on an autoregressive forecast model that takes the projected market share growth of the platform into account. The model indicates that Solana’s market cap could reach a staggering $250 billion, with the price of $SOL climbing to $520. This projection hinges on the workaround assumption that the circulating supply of $SOL will remain around 486 million and aligns with Solana’s current tokenomics. The key driver of this growth is that Solana is capturing a larger share of the SCP market. At present, Solana holds about 15% of the market share in this space, but VanEck thinks it will increase to 22% by 2025. This is supposed to happen because of several factors, like Solana’s developer dominance, which is like a platform’s long-term success indicator; its fast-growing decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes; and its fast-growing user base. The more Solana’s decentralized application (dApp) developer community grows, the faster its ecosystem builds out and the stronger it gets. And in this case, a faster path to a stronger ecosystem leads through greater transaction volumes and more kinds of use cases for the blockchain itself. The Rise of Solana’s Active User Base Another key component of the bullish forecast for Solana is its user base. As of January 2025, Solana boasts a total of 197 million active addresses. By contrast, the other smart contract platforms have far fewer addresses—they are far less active. Take, for example, Near Protocol, which according to the same recent data, has only 120 million active addresses. From there, the numbers drop off significantly: Tron has 68 million, Aptos has 38.1 million, and Base has 37.7 million. Solana leads the way with 197M active addresses in January Let's check out Top Chains by Total Active Addresses in January 2025 @solana – 197M @NEARProtocol – 120M @trondao – 68M @Aptos – 38.1M @base – 37.7M @BNBCHAIN – 36.9M @SuiNetwork – 21M @Bitcoin – 15.4M… https://t.co/cemxehQvHl pic.twitter.com/CTffEpGbaA — Solana Daily (@solana_daily) February 7, 2025 The number of addresses that are active is a key indicator of how well a network is doing. This really suggests how many people are using the platform and for what kinds of things. DeFi platforms and associated applications seem to have a good number of people using them. NFTs don’t seem to have their full potential realized yet, but they do have some number of people using them too. So when we talk about Solana’s wide adoption, we mean that a good number of people are doing several different things—some of it we don’t yet understand fully—on the platform. And that is why it’s a really interesting area to look into right now. Solana’s Developer Dominance and DEX Growth One of the most significant contributors to Solana’s success has been its developer ecosystem. In the past few years, Solana has been among the top platforms for developers wanting high throughput and low fees. The network’s performance makes it particularly attractive for DeFi projects, where it can manage a high volume of trades with low latency and minimal fees. These characteristics have helped it foster a DEX ecosystem that is thriving, with DEX volumes continuing to grow year after year. With many decentralized finance protocols and applications moving to Solana owing to its better scalability, the Solana blockchain is also beginning to quite obviously generate more revenue. Unquestionably, the most certain DEX growth narrative is that of Solana. It is not only the case that Solana is now generating DEX revenue, but Solana is also grabbing market share in this space. The Growing Ecosystem of Smart Contract Platforms Solana’s growth may be impressive, but one must also acknowledge the competitive atmosphere surrounding smart contract platforms. Aside from the market share Solana commands, several other significant contenders vie for dominance in the space, including Near Protocol, Tron, Aptos, and BNB Chain. Even within this competitive context, however, Solana seems to have an enviable position, with its active address growth far outstripping its nearest rivals and a developer environment that seems to be more inviting than the other platforms offer. As of January 2025, Solana’s active addresses are almost double those of the Near Protocol, which is the second-largest blockchain in terms of active addresses. While platforms such as Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Polygon continue to be the ruling giants of the overall blockchain ecosystem, Solana attracts and retains both developers and users. This situation enables Solana to have a real shot at success going forward. Conclusion: A Bright Future for Solana VanEck’s forecast of $520 per $SOL by 2025 might seem daring, but the figures we see suggest that Solana is well positioned for a pretty ambitious growth run. If we look at Solana’s increasing market share, the growing number of active users we see on the network, and the developer base we have over there, Solana is starting to look like a pretty dominant smart contract platform. And if Solana keeps this up and keeps attracting new users and developers to the platform, then hey, why not? They’re in a decent position to reach the pretty bold price projection set by VanEck.

40144231,https://nulltx.com/?p=144302,1739170821,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,$WLD Price Faces a Struggle Amid Market Turmoil,https://nulltx.com/wld-price-faces-a-struggle-amid-market-turmoil/,"The cost of $WLD , a token supported by the renowned artificial intelligence firm OpenAI, has recently achieved a noteworthy low—albeit one that probably won’t have investors cheering. For the first time, $WLD is hitting a price point that puts investors in the red, currently sitting around $0.97, which, as far as CoinGecko is concerned, represents the lowest price ever recorded for the token. The cryptocurrency community is now casting sideways glances at $WLD and asking some pointed questions. Why has a token with such prestigious AI backing gone the way of the dodo? And why hasn’t its narrative AI potential translated into increased gains? What’s Behind the Drop in $WLD’s Price? The $WLD falling below the $1 threshold represents more than just a symbolic moment for the token; it shows the wider obstacles the cryptocurrency market faces, especially the projects that hang their hopes on the AI narrative. A lot of people are now asking if the token even has a chance of getting back to where it was—or if it will keep on declining and maybe even become the next big loser in the crypto space. The performance of some leading funds that have invested in $WLD is particularly worrisome. Prominent investors like a16z, Blockchain Capital, and Coinbase Ventures are now notorious examples. These funds are said to have first come in at a price between $0.25 and $0.30 per token. That’s a far cry from the current price of $0.97. And while $WLD is awash in red, the tokens are still selling for 3 to 4 times what these funds originally paid. So, one can certainly see why traders and investors might be getting a little jittery when looking at the performance of $WLD and pondering the possibility that it might be part of some market shift. The Investor Sentiment on Major Exchanges Examining the trading action on the big exchanges, such as Binance and OKX, reveals more about how the recent downturn is affecting traders. The most striking thing is how the many more long accounts than short accounts—by factors of 2.58 times on Binance and 4.87 times on OKX—indicate that traders are mostly still long on $WLD and mostly believe that it will come back and that the current price pressures are just that: pressure. Yet, even though the token keeps sliding downward, some traders are becoming more cautious. Long traders who are already in the market seem reluctant to accept the lower prices we’re currently seeing, which suggests to me that they might be feeling a little more anxious about the token’s ability to regain upward price momentum. If the price keeps on falling, I think you could number among the possible outcome scenarios increasing liquidation of long positions that could keep pushing the price further downward. Broader Market Challenges and the Impact of DeepSeek One thing that could be contributing to $WLD’s troubles is the larger AI industry—especially the cryptocurrency-related part of it—that is facing some tough challenges right now. A recent incident involving DeepSeek, a competitor to ChatGPT, has caused some substantial disruption within the whole AI sector. DeepSeek’s troubles, and their impact on ChatGPT, have caused some investor confidence in AI-driven narrative tokens to crumble. $WLD về dưới 1$ Thật sự cảm xúc không biết nói gì khi giá $WLD về hẳn 0.97$, cái mốc này đang ghi nhận là giá thấp nhất mọi thời đại trên Coingecko.

Giá hiện… https://t.co/jMJLFoXCyH pic.twitter.com/QGwJ5W50ZH — Blog Tiền Ảo (@blogtienao_hq) February 8, 2025 Although AI is generally regarded as one of the top-tier stories in crypto, the industry’s real risk is its volatility and competition. The collapse or troubles of the leaders in this space—like DeepSeek—only serve to point up how tied the AI story is to specific tokens and technologies. For $WLD, which rides the narrative AI wave, this is an obstacle. The potential for AI story tokens to see massive adoption is still in play, but the recent events have injected a needed dose of skepticism among investors. Looking Ahead: Can $WLD Rebound? $WLD is dealing with some serious problems right now, yet the situation may not be as dire as it seems. The project has strong backing from OpenAI, a really promising partner to have, and the $WLD narrative is one that could develop nicely in the crypto space. What’s more, if you take a look at the broader market, narrative AI seems to be a hedge-fund darling and a strong potential growth area. So, $WLD could do nicely both because of its specific situation and the conditions of the overarching market. The market’s present condition indicates that, although a recovery is feasible, it will demand a large-scale change in investor sentiment and a stabilization of the artificial intelligence narrative. If $WLD can weather the storm it is currently in, stabilize its price, and regain investor confidence, it could return to the higher levels at which it was once trading. Still, in light of the recent downturn and the current uncertainty in the supposed growth driver that is the AI sector, one should be cautious about making an investment in $WLD right now. To sum up, if $WLD remains likely to go under the price of $1 anytime soon, it would not be a good investment. Clearly, it is trading below $2, which is below its all-time high of $1.86. While WLD is not trading at an all-time high currently, it still hasn’t reached its all-time low either (which was $0.3908 and was seen just over a month ago — on July 24). In this instance, “fundamentals” help get a grasp on this situation more and serve as a better guide to inform any investment decisions. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Two, in particular, have been making themselves known in recent months—Real World Assets (RWA) and AI Agents. The developments in these sectors show about as clear a potential as can be to influence the crypto market at large. Why? Because, at base, they’re providing ever-so-real value that links traditional finance to the blockchain, and they’re doing it with an ever-curious bridge—the tech innovations they’ve brought to the table. Although the early days of cryptocurrency were dominated by meme coins and altcoins, the emergence of real-world assets (RWA) and AI agents is steering the narrative toward something more meaningful—utility-driven assets. Instead of just being a speculative store of value, these sectors are now being viewed by both investors and institutions as the next big thing in crypto, with monumental potential to reshape our Web3-enabled future. RWA and AI agents are already pushing the boundaries of the possible, with both sectors starting to flirt with the trillion-dollar asset class. Despite a few emerging-tech hiccups, they aren’t going away. The Current State of the RWA & AI Agents Sectors Over the past few weeks, the RWA and the AI Agents sectors have experienced differing fortunes. The AI Agents sector has taken a substantial hit, according to data from Cookie Fun. Our current estimate of market value for AI Agents is about $6.2 billion, down from a peak of more than $20 billion in mid-January. We’ve roughly calculated that this sector has lost around $14 billion in market cap over the last three weeks. While we are concerned about the fortunes of the AI Agents sector, we do want to emphasize that the crypto market is highly volatile. Conversely, Real World Assets (RWA) have not only maintained their growth but have also shown a surprising resilience in recent months. RWA brings a real-world value to blockchain platforms, allowing an array of traditional assets—such as real estate, stocks, and even commodities—to be tokenized and traded on-chain. This hardly seems revolutionary; it’s part of what makes a blockchain a blockchain. But what’s happening with RWA is perhaps a good glimpse into the possible future of the crypto ecosystem. According to Cookie Fun, the AI ​​Agents sector has lost about $14 billion in market value in the past three weeks. The AI ​​Agents sector has continued to decline since reaching a peak of $20.37 billion in total market value on January 15, to the current level of about $6.2… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 8, 2025 Top Projects Leading the Way A few initiatives have become leaders in the RWA and AI Agents sectors, dominating by market cap and demonstrating the capabilities of these groundbreaking technologies. In the RWA space, Ondo Finance stands out as the most impressive project, with a market cap exceeding $2 billion. Ondo Finance is attempting to create a seamless bridge between traditional finance and the blockchain by tokenizing real-world assets. Other notable projects in the RWA sector include MANTRA Chain ($3.69B), Quant Network ($1.71B), Sky Ecosystem ($1.37B), and XDC Network ($1.219B), all of which have substantial roles in migrating traditional finance on-chain. At the same time, the sector for AI Agents shows that Virtuals.io is the standout project, boasting a market cap of $4.895 billion. AI Agents, which can be used to automate and optimize DeFi strategies, trading, and digital interactions, could change the ways in which we interact with decentralized finance (DeFi). Other leading AI Agent projects include ASI Alliance ($3.639B), AI16z ($2.608B), Aixbt Agent ($500M), and Freysa AI ($310M), in which each of the following entities is shown to be leading a top-10 crypto project powered by AI. 024 Wrap: Best Narrative of the Year This year, RWA (Real World Assets) & AI Agents didn’t just emerge—they completely dominated the Meme & Altcoin markets, reshaping the crypto innovation. Here are the leading projects in charge by Market Cap: Most Impressive RWA… https://t.co/1dz6jTQjRy pic.twitter.com/N1PelMYF3v — Ethereum Daily (@ETH_Daily) February 7, 2025 The Growing Influence of RWA and AI Agents on Web3 We are not just seeing an increase in the market value of RWAs and AI Agents; they are also signifying a shift in how we use blockchain technology. RWAs take us a step closer to bringing traditional finance onto the blockchain. They allow for the tokenization of not just digital but also physical and real-world assets and are creating some new opportunities in the investment universe. And then there’s AI. AI Agents are not really new. But we are seeing a lot more talk about using AI in finance and investment. And again, there’s not just a talk; there’s a walk we can actually see. The decentralized finance ecosystem comprises various aspects that can be automated or enhanced using artificial intelligence. While many sectors are now using AI to varying degrees, in DeFi, using AI is already highly beneficial and is rapidly leading to improvements. Conversely, these improvements are also making the use of AI in DeFi much smarter and more useful, thus creating a very rewarding feedback loop. From executing complex trades to managing overall risk and liquidity, “Agents” (AI in this case) are helping make DeFi a much smarter and more effective space for both retail and institutional investors. In unison, RWAs and AI agents are speeding up how quickly Web3 technologies are being accepted. They are two ways new opportunities are being created for developers and financial institutions in what was once an experimental blockchain industry. They are now two key elements in the rapidly maturing intersection between traditional industries and the blockchain. At their central core, RWAs and AI agents are Web3 opportunities. The Future of RWA and AI Agents in Crypto At present, the AI Agents sector is experiencing a decline in market capitalization, but the long-term growth potential seems just as bright as before. The downturn should not obscure the impact REAs and AI Agents are having on crypto and Web3. These sectors are moving the market toward a sustainable, utility-driven place—something that could draw even greater amounts of institutional money in the years to come. Continued development and refinement of offerings from RWA and AI Agents sector projects make it clear that these innovations are here to stay. The crypto world will not be future-fit if it is only driven by speculative assets. What will give the next phase of the crypto universe “tangible value”? Something how the what-next asset revolution might could improve, for example, the “enhanced utility and security of decentralized systems.” More and more leading projects are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in RWA and AI Agents. To sum up, despite facing some initial difficulties, the AI Agents sector appears to be moving toward the continued success and growth of so-called “RWA” (real-world asset) crypto projects. These promise to deliver a future of “blockchain everywhere,” with use cases that push utility, real-world value, and the next big thing in the crypto industry: “adoption.” The 2023 crypto market is one of “mounting institutional interest and a burgeoning development sphere.” Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Last week, after CZ shared a video tutorial featuring the Test Token, the TST price saw a sharp surge in a short period. Later, the Binance founder confirmed that it was just for educational purposes and that he doesn’t endorse the TST token. However, despite this, Binance announced a listing for the TST token while capitalizing on the trading volume. This has caused a major uproar in the crypto community asking CZ about the “fundamentals” of the token and the vetting process at the exchange. Is Changpeng Zhao Shifting From Fundamentals? Over the past year, Changpeng Zhao has been known for backing fundamentally strong projects. However, the recent developments around the TST token have prompted the crypto community to question him. Several people have been asking when CZ supports “fundamentals”, then why is he talking about the TST token which is functioning as a meme coin? This has led to questions like whether CZ is shifting away from fundamentals or is getting into meme coins now. Furthermore, Changpeng Zhao is facing the question of why the TST token got listed on Binance, despite Zhao distancing himself from it. Responding to this, CZ wrote: “I don’t know for sure. I am entirely NOT involved in their listing process. Based on historical experience, people always complain, “Why do you list this but not the coin I hold?” You might not like to hear this, but the truth is: exchanges must compete to list popular coins (with trading volume) as early as possible. If your coin is actively sought after by traders, you don’t need to talk to exchanges. As I always say, work on your project, not the exchanges”. Furthermore, commenting on his meme coin involvement, Zhao said: “Memes are fun, etc. It’s a cultural thing. I am not an expert in this area. There are plenty of die-hard defenders of memes. Don’t go against the community”. Zhao on Binance Listing Test (TST) Token Changpeng Zhao has expressed concerns over the platform’s token listing process, calling it “a bit broken.” In a statement on social media, Zhao highlighted how the four-hour window between the announcement of a listing and the actual listing creates significant price volatility, especially in the case of TST token. “The notice period is necessary, but in those 4 hours, token prices surge on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and then people sell on centralized exchanges (CEXs). Not sure if there is a solution for this though. Just beware,” Zhao noted . One user suggested that the listing on CEXs and DEXs should be simultaneous, responding to which, Zhao said: “I tend to agree. I think CEX should list (almost) everything automatically, just like DEX. But I am not running a CEX anymore”. TST Token Pump and Dump Soon after the Binance listing, the Test price surged by 300% to $0.50 with daily trading volume surging 372% to $1.42 billion. However, this was met with strong liquidations as the TST price tanked 60% from the peak and is currently trading under $0.20. Amid the ongoing TST token saga and Zhao clarification, the BNB price surged 7% earlier today.

40144470,https://nulltx.com/?p=144313,1739171297,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Bitcoin’s Market Behavior: S&P 500 Correlation, Exchange Withdrawals, and Potential Buying Opportunities",https://nulltx.com/bitcoins-market-behavior-sp-500-correlation-exchange-withdrawals-and-potential-buying-opportunities/,"The past few months have brought a dramatic shift to Bitcoin’s market dynamics. For years, crypto prices have moved quite independently—often, the only price action seen in traditional financial markets was when they had to react to what was happening in crypto. But now, Bitcoin is becoming much more correlated to the traditional financial markets it used to be decoupled from, with the S&P 500 being the usual benchmark of reference. Bitcoin’s recent price moves also seem more intertwined with the movements of the US Dollar Index (DXY), which continues to be a prominent feature of the current macroeconomic landscape. Bitcoin's correlation with the S&P 500 is currently notably high, while the opposite is true for its correlation with the US dollar index. This combination aligns to crypto's weakness following the US tariffs news this week. pic.twitter.com/KoufPYsU57 — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) February 7, 2025 Bitcoin’s Correlation with Traditional Markets: A New Trend? Right now, Bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 is pretty high. This is a shift from the usually low correlation it shares with traditional assets. What does it mean for Bitcoin to correlate with the S&P 500? Well, for one, it means that even as institutional investors and the adoption of digital assets continue to grow, they’re not really affecting Bitcoin in any kind of positive way right now. Sure, institutions are buying Bitcoin. But what we’re seeing right now is that as Wall Street and the “macro bros” down at the Federal Reserve move the stock market, they’re also moving Bitcoin. Recent news regarding potential U.S. tariffs that could affect a swath of industries has amplified this trend. As the market took in this news, Bitcoin, like the S&P 500, showed some weakness. This suggests that the crypto markets are now more integrated than ever with traditional assets—and that they are feeling the same influence on them from broader market factors as traditional assets do. It also might signal yet another change in market psychology, with Bitcoin’s price movement now more aligned with general market sentiment. Exchange Withdrawals Signal Long-Term Confidence Though the wider market is weak, there is something positive for Bitcoin’s future. In the last week, over 70,000 Bitcoin have been pulled off exchanges. This is a good sign, as it shows that holders are confident enough in the future of Bitcoin to take it off exchanges—where it could be in danger if the exchange were to be hacked or go down—that they store it in more secure, long-term solutions like hardware wallets. Over 70,000 #Bitcoin $BTC have been withdrawn from exchanges in the past week, signaling long-term confidence! pic.twitter.com/d0KfDTud2M — Ali (@ali_charts) February 8, 2025 This development could suggest that investors are not deterred by short-term volatility and are instead placing themselves for future growth. In the past, significant withdrawals from exchanges have almost always preceded big moves up in the price of Bitcoin. That’s because it usually means a lot less of the asset is available to trade. If more people want to buy Bitcoin than sell it, the price is going up. Bitcoin’s Buying Opportunities: Is the Best Entry Yet to Come? Right now, Bitcoin’s price movements seem to be suggesting that there are still opportunities for traders to get into the market at a more favorable price. Based on historical price data, the best buying opportunities for Bitcoin tend to happen when traders are sitting at a -12% loss. At present, though, Bitcoin traders are holding a pretty comfortable 0.21% profit, which signals that we might not be too far away from a corrective price drop that would result in a better buying opportunity. The best buying opportunities for #Bitcoin $BTC historically come when traders are at a -12% loss. Right now, they’re still sitting at 0.21% in profit, suggesting there may still be room for a better entry! pic.twitter.com/7yp1pmqp9k — Ali (@ali_charts) February 8, 2025 The data indicate the possibility of a short-term decline, which could provide traders an opportunity to purchase Bitcoin at more favorable prices before a major rally. This interpretation follows the general presumption that Bitcoin has not yet established a definitive bottom. Market conditions, however, seem to almost guarantee that some investors will be shaken out of their positions. Even so, if you can hold on, you may be able to enjoy a “deeper pullback” that may get you “in-line” with a future rally. That Bitcoin has not yet experienced the kind of sharp correction that usually comes before big bullish moves suggests to me that there might still be a relatively calm period before the next uptrend. For people who are in Bitcoin for the long haul, it might be a good time to buy some more. Bitcoin Spot ETF Inflows Highlight Investor Confidence In spite of the general volatility, Bitcoin-based financial products have seen a very strong inflow. This is especially true for the Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). On February 7, the Bitcoin spot ETF pulled in a very large net inflow of $171 million. This inflow is indicative of an almost reverent attitude by these institutional investors concerning Bitcoin. And it now raises the almost ludicrous question of whether or not Bitcoin can somehow be “harnessed” to make a non-volatile version of itself, since ETFs can otherwise make quite erroneous claims. On February 7, the Bitcoin spot ETF had a total net inflow of $171 million. The Ethereum spot ETF had a total net inflow and net outflow of $0.00. https://t.co/59u0BnEqLG pic.twitter.com/AIlVjXAx4g — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 8, 2025 Bitcoin spot ETF inflows are rising, suggesting that institutional investors remain confident in the future of Bitcoin, even when the short-term market looks a little shaky. With the traditional investment world gaining more entry points to Bitcoin—most recently through the ETFs—the next push for ETF exposure could see another leg up for Bitcoin. More institutional involvement in the cryptocurrency space tends to be viewed positively and could be another spark for growth in the market. Conclusion: Looking Ahead to Bitcoin’s Future The latest developments in the Bitcoin market—its high correlation with the S&P 500, large exchange withdrawals, and the potential for better buying opportunities—suggest a future that is complex but promising for the cryptocurrency. Although the market’s short-term volatility and certain macroeconomic factors (like US tariffs) may still have it in their grip for now, the fundamentals underneath Bitcoin appear to be stronger than ever. Institutional adoption continues apace, long-term holders are removing their assets from exchanges, and potential buying opportunities are on the horizon. All this points toward a future for Bitcoin that is likely to be marked by further price appreciation—if the market can achieve some kind of stability and if it can overcome the current set of macroeconomic headwinds that seem to be blowing against it.

Over the last seven weeks, the network’s market cap has dropped a steep 36% from its local high. Investors and traders are now very concerned. What is happening? The downturn has coincided with a marked drop in the number of Ethereum tokens that are currently in profit. We’re seeing a negative sense of sentiment that has many retail traders just unloading their tokens. The underperformance in price compared to other large “cap” cryptocurrencies has left many questioning: can Ethereum recover? Ethereum's market cap has dropped -36% since its local high just 7 weeks ago. The result has been a stark drop in the amount of ETH tokens in profit since their date first mined. On the daily close, we are seeing the lowest percentage in profit in over 4 months, and lowest… pic.twitter.com/ze8uVeWqfA — Santiment (@santimentfeed) February 8, 2025 Ethereum’s Market Struggles and Profitability Decline The recent trend of profitability in Ethereum tokens has taken a sharp turn for the worse. Recent data shows that far fewer Ethereum tokens are currently in profit compared to previous months. In fact, the percentage of Ethereum that is in profit is at its lowest since April. To make matters worse, Ethereum’s profitability mound is facing such a steep downturn that it’s showing us the least amount of coins in profit since May. This is undoubtedly spelling a loss for a whole bunch of Ethereum investors across the board—especially the ones who got in early and have held on through this slump. This sustained downward spiral has been especially pronounced when you think about how Ethereum used to hold such dominance in the market. Once regarded as the top-tier, foundational blockchain for decentralized finance (DeFi), smart contracts, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs)—Ethereum’s recent performances have shoved it under the spotlight in terms of what not to do in the cryptocurrency space. These days, it pales in comparison to the sorts of upswings witnessed by other large-cap cryptocurrencies, like Solana, Binance Boin, and even Bitcoin. Retail Sentiment: Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) Driving Sales The Ethereum market has been permeated with Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) in recent weeks. This is mainly because traders and retail investors—who have a lower risk tolerance and are especially sensitive to price volatility—have lost faith in Ethereum due to its consistent underperformance. Retail investors have subsequently begun to dump their ETH holdings. Presto! Instant negative sentiment. And this negative sentiment looks like it is going to continue for a while because the dumping of Ethereum by retail traders seems to have only just begun. Market generally has been negative—extremely negative. Ethereum has been seen as an underachiever compared to the other big cryptos. Number two in market cap, but Ethereum now finds itself in a tighter race, with other networks not seen as rivals gaining ground. Networks like Solana and Avalanche—for them, user activity is going way up. Why? Faster transaction speeds. Lower fees. Au revoir, Ethereum. On February 7, the Bitcoin spot ETF had a total net inflow of $171 million. The Ethereum spot ETF had a total net inflow and net outflow of $0.00. https://t.co/59u0BnEqLG pic.twitter.com/AIlVjXAx4g — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 8, 2025 Even though Ethereum has faced difficulties lately, there might still be a promising sign on the horizon. Retail traders may be selling off their assets, but a committed development community is continuing to work on the network. They remain unwavering in their belief that the network holds potential, and they are attempting to realize that potential through development work. The transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which is part of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, is still in progress. The Ethereum Spot ETF: A Sign of Market Inactivity Further underscoring Ethereum’s recent market performance is the Ethereum spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), which had a rather mystifying day on February 7. The ETF recorded a combination net inflow and outflow of $0.00. That “0” in the inflow line might as well have been a “caution” light for the whole Ethereum market. ETF investors are not making moves, and this lack of moves could be interpreted as a lack of conviction about the Ethereum market in general. If the ETF is representing a cautious accumulation phase for Ethereum, then either side, bulls or bears, could be waiting until the next clear price signal before making a move. At the same time, Ethereum’s spot ETF is performing poorly, and this flat performance reflects a larger trend of indecision in the markets. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s price is in a downward spiral and retail sentiment is struggling. It seems that institutional investors may be taking a wait-and-see approach, perhaps opting to let the dust settle before making any large trades in either direction. If anything, these big players are likely keeping an even closer watch on the transition to Ethereum 2.0 and on whether it allows Ether to regain its competitive edge within the increasingly diverse and rapidly evolving crypto ecosystem. Potential for Recovery: Could Ethereum Bounce Back? Although Ethereum’s market slump and the emerging unfavorable sentiment might appear forbidding, they conceal something else: potential. It’s a situation that the Ethereum Foundation undoubtedly hopes won’t ever become the stuff of history, but it is still a reasonable enough precedent to bring up in discussing the current state of Ethereum. The cryptocurrency market is often more or less in a single phase together, rendering the Ethereum situation either more or less bleak. However, within that mode, the Ethereum Foundation is making progress in rendering either the current or a future iteration of the Ethereum network a place where transactions either cost less to make or happen so quickly that it hardly matters. To sum up, the latest market performance of Ethereum has not lived up to expectations, with the asset undergoing a steep plummet in its market cap, having fewer tokens in the profit zone, and experiencing a negative swing in the sentiment of traders and investors. But the cryptocurrency’s potential for resurgence remains quite palpable, especially if the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade unfolds in the way its creators promise and takes care of the network’s several outstanding problems. Still, the traders and investors who keep a close eye on these things surely will be watching to see whether Ethereum makes any distinct moves—upward or downward—in the next little while.

40144604,https://nulltx.com/?p=144311,1739171595,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"A Chaotic Week in Meme Coins: Lawsuits, Losses, and Market Shifts",https://nulltx.com/a-chaotic-week-in-meme-coins-lawsuits-losses-and-market-shifts/,"The meme coin market had a tumultuous week, with the sector experiencing a dramatic 28% drop. It fell to a market capitalization of $72.3 billion. The downturn, driven by a combination of liquidations and legal issues, has shaken investor confidence and left many wondering about the future of meme-based cryptocurrencies. Some tokens managed to stand out, showing resilience against the overall market slide. Here’s a breakdown of the week’s key events: legal troubles, new tokens, platform innovations, and other reasons to rethink the meme coin market. Meme Coin Market Faces Sharp Decline This week’s meme coin market crash has been nothing short of dramatic, with the sector losing approximately 28% of its total value. The market cap now stands at $72.3 billion, a significant drop from last week’s figures. This plummet has been marked by massive liquidations, with estimates suggesting that between $2 billion and $8 billion worth of positions were liquidated across meme coin projects. In contrast to this downward trend, one token, FU, managed to maintain its value and defy the broader market sentiment. Other tokens in the meme coin space weren’t as lucky during this deep correction the market went through. This market correction really reflects the more volatile side of cryptocurrency. Legal Troubles for Pump(.)fun and a New $200M Raise Pump(.)fun, a meme coin that has caught the eye of many, is now dealing with a securities lawsuit that threatens to short-circuit its future. The lawsuit, which centers on the token’s $500 million in fees, draws attention to the increasing scrutiny that meme coins and their progenitors are under from regulators. Even as it deals with this lawsuit and its potential fallout, Pump(.)fun claims to bring in a steady revenue stream, suggesting that there still is demand for the meme coin despite the serious troubles it finds itself in. In a turn of unexpected events, Errol Musk, father of Elon Musk, has stepped into the meme coin arena, announcing plans to raise $200 million for a new token, MUSKIT. How much interest exists in the potential raise can be judged by the seemingly inevitable headline: “Errol Musk Enters Crypto with New Memecoin, MUSKIT.” However, when one digs a little deeper into the make-believe world of meme coins and the impending Doom Hut coming to a virtual reality headset near you, one realizes that MUSKIT probably has a better chance of being a hit than some of the other Musk-related tokens (like DOGE). As the creator of the Silk Road, Ross Ulbricht is well-known. Unfortunately, he is well-known for losing a significant sum of money in the cryptocurrency space. His loss, though, has implications for the rest of us. Ulbricht’s wallets took a $12 million hit—not just because of the usually unavoidable volatility of crypto, but because a new and presumably untested crypto token was mishandled in the price-setting process. Innovation in the Meme Coin Space In the midst of the chaos, some innovation still seems to be occurring within the meme coin sector. This week sees the debut of Flaunch(.)gg, a new platform that has a somewhat unique model for charging its users. It takes 100% developer fees from the user as per usual in the meme coin space. But it also enforces a 30-minute no-sell rule that’s meant to get its users to hold onto the coins for longer instead of just flipping them. In other developments, ACT, a coin lesser known in the meme world, has shot up 35% recently after striking a partnership with Unicorn Verse, something that experts are calling a positive turn for the token. WIF, on the other hand, has seen a steep decline, down 82% from its all-time high, showing that not every project is thriving in this turbulent market climate. Market Structure and Cross-Chain Activity The meme coin market has also been in flux this week, with various cross-chain activities and market movements catching the eye. TARDI, a relatively new meme coin, has been leading the SUI chain, up 60%, and standing out as one of the few tokens with substantial growth to report during the downturn. Meanwhile, Base, a network known for its meme coin activity, has seen some measures of resilience, with tokens like SKI and HENLO managing to hold their ground as the broader market faces headwinds. A meme coin that once stirred up a substantial amount of excitement, Bitcoin Runes, has taken a sharp downturn in value. This makes the current problems of the meme coin sector even more pronounced. On the other hand, Tron, a long-time secure presence in the crypto market, had very little movement in terms of what meme coins were doing. This indicates that Tron has a much more conservative business strategy in the meme coin sector. Week in Meme Coins: Market Drops 28%, Elon’s Dad Apes In! Pump(.)fun faces new lawsuit! Elon's dad plans $200M raise! Ulbricht wallets lose $12M! Let's unpack this chaotic week in memes 1/6 pic.twitter.com/WJpgUDUDWw — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) February 7, 2025 Market makers have also been accused, with some alleging that they have contributed to the market’s downward trajectory through orchestrated dumps. If these allegations prove true, the implications for the meme coin space could be considerable, as they would strike at the trust and transparency that investors expect and demand. The Bigger Picture: Memes vs. NFTs According to recent data from DeFiLlama, meme coins are still outperforming NFTs, even as the market struggles. DeFiLlama’s data shows that meme coins have consistently been leading the way in terms of returns. The returns have been significant enough for DeFiLlama to name meme coins as one of “the few bright spots in the crypto bear market.” Still, that doesn’t mean buying, selling, or trading meme coins is a good idea. Meme coins face some serious headwinds. Even leading meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin have faced significant sell-offs recently. However, the same report highlights significant interest in meme coins among the crypto community. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

One day, you’re dismissing a coin as “just another meme,” and the next, you’re kicking yourself for missing out on a life-changing pump. If you were around when Dogwifhat (WIF) launched, you know exactly what that feels like. The quirky dog-themed token went from an internet joke to a crypto goldmine, creating overnight millionaires. Now, history is repeating itself, and those who learned from their mistakes aren’t sleeping on the next big thing— BTFD Coin (BTFD) . Sitting in its 14th presale stage and priced at just $0.00016, BTFD is already making waves, raising over $5.94 million with 69 billion coins sold to more than 10,300 holders. With a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game launching in 2025, a 90% APY staking system, and a rewarding referral program, BTFD is stacking utility behind its meme-fueled hype. By the time the presale ends, BTFD will list at $0.0006, delivering an instant 275% ROI to those who got in early. If you missed out on Dogwifhat, this is your shot at redemption. BTFD Coin – The Meme Coin Frenzy’s Newest Goldmine Meme coins thrive on community, culture, and timing. BTFD is bringing all three to the table, turning a legendary crypto mantra into an ecosystem where investors don’t just hold—they earn. From staking rewards to gaming payouts and a generous referral program, BTFD isn’t just a meme—it’s a movement. A Presale That’s Already Winning Presale phases matter because they set the foundation for future growth. BTFD has already proven its early-stage dominance with over $5.94 million raised and 69 billion tokens sold. The price has risen from $0.000004 to $0.00016, with a final listing price of $0.0006—meaning early buyers will see a 275% return before it even hits exchanges. Imagine putting in $7,500 at today’s presale price. That would buy you 46.875 million BTFD tokens . At launch, when the price hits $0.0006, that $7,500 turns into a cool $28,125. And that’s before any potential post-listing rally. Play, Stake, and Earn with BTFD BTFD isn’t just about holding—it’s about playing and staking your way to bigger gains. The Play-to-Earn (P2E) game launches in January 2025, allowing users to earn rewards while enjoying competitive gameplay. Meanwhile, staking rewards are set at 90% APY, rewarding long-term holders with compounding returns. Instead of waiting for price pumps, you can earn passive income just for holding. Referral Program: Earn Even More by Sharing the Hype One of BTFD’s most lucrative features is its referral program, which rewards users for bringing in new investors. Refer friends and earn 10% of the BTFD coins they purchase—if you land in the top 20 on the leaderboard, you get 10% of the raised amount in BTFD tokens. Friends who use your code and buy $50+ worth of BTFD get an extra 10% in tokens , giving them a bigger bag right from the start. The leaderboard resets each month, giving new users multiple chances to claim top spots and maximize earnings. This isn’t just an airdrop gimmick—it’s a real opportunity to stack tokens before launch. Dogwifhat (WIF): The Meme Coin That Took Over Meme coins come and go, but some turn into legends. Dogwifhat (WIF) was one of 2023’s biggest surprises, proving that community-driven tokens can outpace even the strongest fundamentals. WIF launched as an inside joke—a Shiba Inu wearing a pink beanie—but the joke quickly turned serious. It rocketed from obscurity to top-tier exchanges, generating massive wealth for early buyers. If you bought WIF early, you watched your money 100x. If you didn’t, well… you probably watched in agony as it made others rich. Why WIF Succeeded—and What It Means for BTFD Dogwifhat thrived because of timing, culture, and community momentum. It became a meme coin giant simply because people rallied behind it, proving that in crypto, narrative can be just as valuable as utility. That’s exactly what’s happening with BTFD now. While WIF caught fire because of a viral joke, BTFD is turning a legendary crypto phrase into an ecosystem. Meme culture is built into its DNA, and its presale success proves the hype is real. If WIF’s history has taught us anything, it’s this: Don’t fade meme coins with strong communities. And right now, BTFD’s community is stacking tokens like it’s Black Friday. Final Thoughts: Don’t Miss BTFD Like You Missed WIF If you sat on the sidelines while Dogwifhat made early buyers rich, you don’t have to make the same mistake again. BTFD is proving itself as one of the top new meme coins to buy today , and its combination of presale momentum, staking, gaming, and referral rewards makes it one of the most exciting opportunities in 2025. With only a few presale stages left, the time to secure your position is now—before BTFD goes live and the next wave of FOMO kicks in. Don’t wait until you’re looking back at this moment, thinking, “I should’ve bought BTFD when it was still cheap.” The 14th presale stage is live, and with every new phase, the price only goes up.

According to a Financial Times report , the 142-year-old University of Austin is raising a $5 million Bitcoin fund as part of its $200 million endowment, making it the first U.S. university endowment to launch a dedicated Bitcoin fund. An endowment is a pool of donated funds that a university invests to generate returns over time. The additional revenue is typically used to support operational costs, scholarships, and research, among other use cases. The University of Austin’s Bitcoin fund will be structured as a long-term investment, with the university planning to hold Bitcoin for at least five years. Chad Thevenot, senior vice president for advancement at the university, emphasized that the institution sees Bitcoin as having “long-term value,” much like “stocks or real estate.” You might also like: Wyoming proposes Bitcoin investments for state funds Initially announced in May, the fund was first revealed when the University of Austin partnered with Bitcoin financial services firm Unchained. As part of the collaboration, Unchained is handling custody of the fund’s Bitcoin holdings. While the University of Austin is the first to launch a dedicated Bitcoin fund, it’s not the only university dipping into crypto . In October, Emory University in Georgia became the first U.S. college endowment to gain exposure to Bitcoin. As previously reported by crypto.news, the university disclosed a $15.1 million investment in Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Prior to that, Stanford University’s Blyth Fund disclosed allocating 7% of its portfolio to Bitcoin. Notably, in March, the endowment-backed student-run fund invested in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF after a proposal from Stanford’s Blockchain Club.

""I Think Listings…""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/cz-talks-binance-listings-as-tst-debate-continues-i-think-listings/,"Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the founder of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, has been on the agenda with the memecoin called TST, which he recently promoted, and lastly spoke about listings. Stating that decentralized exchanges DEXs automate token listings, CZ said that centralized exchanges CEXs should also list everything automatically like DEXs. CZ stated that the Binance listing process is also a bit broken, and that Binance announces listings four hours before the relevant token listing, which often leads to price fluctuations. CZ pointed out that after the listing announcement, the token price increased on DEXs, and then investors sold on CEXs. While CZ admitted that there was no definitive solution to the listings, he said investors should be careful. While CZ recently added that he no longer operates a CEX, his comments come amid ongoing controversy over Binance’s listing practices, including the recent listing of BNB-based memecoin TST. “Finally, as an observer, I think the Binance listing process is a bit broken. They announce it, then 4 hours later they list it. The notification period is necessary, but within those 4 hours, token prices go up on DEXs and then people sell on CEX… I'm not sure if there is a solution for this, just be careful. “I think CEX should list (almost) everything automatically, just like DEX. But I don't run a CEX anymore…” https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1888680094736240919 *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: CZ Talks Binance Listings as TST Debate Continues!

On Sunday, CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski announced that the firm would “embrace crypto,” acknowledging that the company is among the last major fintech players to step into the digital asset space. He described the move as a significant milestone for Klarna’s expansion strategy. Siemiatkowski also reached out to the crypto community, asking for suggestions on how it should integrate crypto into its ecosystem. He noted the firm’s scale, saying that the firm serves 85m users worldwide, processes $100b in transaction volume, supports over 500 million merchants and has issued more than 1m cards. Ok. I give up. Klarna and me will embrace crypto! More to come Yes I know! This post will get a huge sigh and 2 views But it still feels historic. Last large fintech in the world to embrace it. Someone had to be last. And that’s a milestone as well of some sort… — Sebastian Siemiatkowski (@klarnaseb) February 8, 2025 The CEO noted that many people suggested full compliance as a major advantage. He pointed out that this marks a shift in perspective compared to a few years ago. Expanding Payments Ecosystem Includes Crypto Ambitions Klarna, best known for its “Buy Now, Pay Later” (BNPL) services, enables consumers to spread out payments over time without immediate interest charges. Beyond BNPL, Klarna provides a range of payment solutions for online shopping, including direct payments, installment plans, and pay-after-delivery options. The company also offers payment processing, financing and banking services, ensuring smoother and more flexible transactions between retailers and consumers. By integrating cryptocurrency payment options, Klarna could tap into a tech-savvy audience already engaged with digital assets. This move could help expand its user base and position Klarna at the forefront of fintech innovation. Klarna’s Crypto Foray and IPO Plans Shape Its Future Klarna has a track record of embracing cutting-edge financial solutions, including past ventures into cryptocurrency. In 2021, the company partnered with Swedish crypto broker Safello to integrate its open banking services into crypto trading. This collaboration enabled users to buy cryptocurrencies directly from their bank accounts, marking Klarna’s first step into the digital asset space. Klarna filed for an IPO with the US SEC in November, but the company has yet to announce the listing date or exchange venue. According to the Financial Times, Klarna is aiming for an April IPO with a $15b valuation, slightly higher than the $14.6b estimate Bloomberg reported earlier. If successful, this would mark one of the largest fintech public listings in recent years, positioning Klarna as a major player in the evolving digital payments sector. Meanwhile, Klarna has been dealing with internal leadership tensions. A Sifted report suggests a growing divide between CEO Siemiatkowski and co-founder Victor Jacobsson. At the end of last year, Klarna’s shareholders voted to remove board member Mikael Walther, a close ally of Jacobsson. The move signaled potential power shifts within the company’s senior management, adding another layer of complexity to its IPO ambitions.

He predicts that 2025 will witness the “biggest market crash in history,” potentially leading to job losses, declining stocks, and a housing market slump. However, Kiyosaki has also provided crucial advice to help investors navigate the turbulence and seize new opportunities. Robert Kiyosaki Warns Of The “Greatest Depression” Ahead Robert Kiyosaki has long warned about economic instability , and he now believes his predictions are coming true. In a recent post on X, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author expressed concerns about an impending “Greater Depression.” He stressed that those without financial education will suffer the most. According to Kiyosaki, traditional education fails to prepare individuals for financial independence. He believes that colleges teach students to become employees rather than investors or entrepreneurs. Instead, he urges people to focus on financial literacy and entrepreneurship to safeguard their wealth in a downturn. Rich Dad Poor Dad’s Investment Strategy Advice The Rich Dad Poor Dad author has shared key advice for people to invest in assets that retain value during the market downturn. Some of his key recommendations include: Gold, Silver, and Bitcoin: Kiyosaki advocates for these assets as hedges against inflation and economic collapse. He has repeatedly emphasized their role in preserving wealth when fiat currencies weaken. Real Estate Investments: While real estate prices may crash, he suggests acquiring properties at discounted rates. However, he warns against investing in office buildings and small retail spaces, which might struggle to recover. Self-Sufficiency and Business Ventures: Robert Kiyosaki encourages people to start businesses that thrive during downturns. He mentions agriculture, such as raising chickens or growing vegetables, as resilient business ideas. Bitcoin In Focus Robert Kiyosaki has been an active supporter of Bitcoin, deeming it as a hedge against the economic downturn. Recently, Kiyosaki highlighted two key reasons why he favors BTC over the US dollar. In addition, in a recent X post, he also said: “WHY I bought more gold and Bitcoin. Answer: Owning gold and Bitcoin is smarter and safer than saving dollars.” In addition, this also resonates with other experts’ outlook, who also deems BTC as a safer haven during economic turmoil. However, despite that, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author has recently warned about a Bitcoin crash as Trump’s tariff plans dampen market sentiment. Top Traders Echoes Similar Sentiment To Robert Kiyosaki Echoing Robert Kiyosaki’s concerns, veteran trader Peter Brandt recently shared a grim economic forecast shared by Tic Toc. According to professional trader Tic Toc, the US has already entered a recession, with worsening conditions expected in the next two to three quarters. According to the trader’s prediction, the expected consequences include: Negative GDP growth. Large-scale layoffs across industries. Gold prices rising to $3,000. An oversupply of existing homes in the market. Source: tic toc, X However, it’s worth noting that despite the looming economic turmoil, Robert Kiyosaki remains optimistic. He believes the coming crisis presents a rare opportunity for those willing to adapt. Besides, he has reiterated his confidence in BTC as a hedge against the upcoming market crash.

Having raised $1.5 million in minutes during its presale, it has captured the attention of investors and insiders alike. As interest in crypto grows, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is leading the way with unparalleled momentum and profit potential. Why Investors Are Choosing THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN 1. Record-Breaking Demand Raising $1.5 million within minutes, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has solidified its reputation as a high-demand asset. This overwhelming interest highlights its potential for exponential growth. 2. Scarcity Meets Exclusivity With a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN ensures scarcity while offering tokens exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN . This combination drives value and creates urgency among investors. 3. Proven Momentum Crypto insiders recognize the unique trajectory of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN, which has outpaced the early adoption rates of MATIC, APT, and SEI. Its presale success confirms its position as a market leader. How It Stands Out Against Competitors Bitcoin (BTC): A leader in market value, but its growth is slower compared to this rising star.

The CAR memecoin attracted huge attention from crypto traders, scaling to a market cap of nearly $1 billion and a 24-hour average traded volume of over $703 million. According to the on-chain data analysis provided by Geckotaminal, the CAR memecoin, with a pooled SOL liquidity of over 7,531 coins, had more than 35k on-chain holders. Earlier snipers of the CAR memecoin registered more than 180k percent gains. Before @FA_Touadera posted the $CAR contract address, this guy accidentally spent 25 $SOL ($4,905) to buy 49.6M $CAR , which is worth over $40M at the peak! But unfortunately, he sold it all for only 30 $SOL ($5,957). Realizing he had missed the rally, he quickly spent 139… pic.twitter.com/tpG7HSxcnd — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) February 10, 2025 Central African Republic and Crypto Assets The Central African Republic (CAR) made headlines in April 2022 after it announced the adoption of Bitcoin as a legal tender, thus joining El Salvador. The move, however, faced immense challenges as the country’s political and infrastructure remain dilapidated. The country also attempted to launch a crypto initiative dubbed Sango Coin, which failed to take off. With the skepticism and pushback from the Bank of Central African States (BEAC) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the country’s bid to tap into Bitcoin went down the river. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Brazil’s B3 Strengthens Crypto Market with New Bitcoin and Altcoin Futures , Advantage Taken After observing the success of $CAR , I am proud to announce the launch of the Republic of Congo Token.

However, more than five Solana contracts were launched by Tshisekedi’s X account, leading to huge losses to the early investors. As it has been observed with several other celebrity X accounts, it is thought that Tshisekedi’s X account was potentially intentionally compromised to advertise the memecoin. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The market sentiment has been waning since the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump, with analysts predicting further losses. However, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is gaining traction due to its upside potential. PropiChain’s footprint in the crypto market is growing because of its desire to use innovative technologies to transform the $300 trillion real estate industry. The AI altcoin has raised over $2 million, setting the stage for a rally that will likely outperform Cardano and PEPE in 2025. Major PEPE Transactions Triggers Optimism The recent market dip has hit the majority of altcoins, including PEPE, very hard. PEPE is down 47% in the past month, although its yearly gains stand at 906%. Despite the downturn, the meme coin holders have something to smile about. A mysterious wallet address has withdrawn 375.35 billion PEPE worth $3.73 million from Binance. This move indicates interest in PEPE from whales, with many investors hoping that this transaction could turn the meme coin’s fortunes. An analyst claims that PEPE can only gain momentum if the broader crypto market turns bullish. Here is Why PropiChain is the Top Altcoin to Invest In PropiChain is positioning itself as the next best altcoin to buy as the market loses momentum. The AI altcoin is capitalizing on the demand for innovation in the real estate industry. Its major highlight is tokenization, a tool that supports fractional ownership. This model democratizes access to the real estate industry and enables retail traders to be a part of the $300 trillion industry. Apart from tokenization , PropiChain is using AI to bring much-needed innovation to the real estate industry. The platform uses smart contracts for automating transactions such as auto-leasing and lease renewals. Smart contracts eliminate the need for human intervention and reduce administrative costs, making real estate management more efficient. PropiChain is committed to security and transparency. This is evidenced by its smart contract audit with BlockAudit, a reputable blockchain security company. The third-party audit ensures the integrity of the platform by eliminating loopholes that bad actors can exploit, putting user funds and data at risk. Additionally, PCHAIN also turns to automated valuation models to offer accurate and fair property appraisals. This is a powerful feature that minimizes costs in real estate deals. A buyer and a seller on PropiChain will use this feature to get the pricing for the property in question. There is no need to pay appraisal fees to third parties. When a fair price is put in place, the deal is quickly closed due to the fairness of the pricing structure. Furthermore, PropiChain offers potential property buyers an immersive viewing experience through the metaverse . The engaging feature helps investors make informed decisions even from the comfort of their homes. PCHAIN Tipped to Outperform Pepe and Cardano Cardano and Pepe are losing strength, with analysts predicting more losses down the line. An analyst claims that investing in PCHAIN in the second round of its presale is as good as buying Cardano in early November. Cardano rose from $0.33 in November 2024 to $1.23, marking a 273% growth in less than 2 months. PCHAIN is tipped to surge 35,000% in 2025. PCHAIN Gear for Growth, Invest Today PropiChain is up 200% in the first two rounds of its presale, with investors expecting 35,000% gains after listing. The AI altcoin has already been listed on CoinMarketCap, a leading price aggregator site in the crypto industry. This move highlights its commitment to transparency. After raising over $2 million, PropiChain is gaining exposure and more capital is flowing into the AI altcoin.

Nonetheless, with SHIB now priced at $0.00001578 and PEPE at $0.059561, the journey to $1 continues to be a challenging ascent. In the meantime, a number of lesser-known cryptocurrencies are gathering momentum, demonstrating solid technical setups and practical use cases that might allow them to surpass the $1 mark ahead of SHIB or PEPE. Promising Penny Crypto Tokens Set for Significant Surge Although meme coins remain prevalent in speculative trading, blockchain projects that have strong fundamentals and real-world uses are drawing the attention of investors. The next four penny crypto coins show significant growth potential and may emerge as the next major breakout stars. 1. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Game-Changer in DeFi with Real-World Asset Tokenization Rexas Finance (RXS) revolutionizes the DeFi sector by enabling fractional ownership of conventional assets like real estate and precious metals through the use of blockchain technology. This advancement opens up access to valuable investments, eliminating obstacles that have traditionally limited typical investors. Now in its 12th presale phase, Rexas Finance has successfully raised $44.1 million and distributed 440.5 million tokens. The RXS token is priced at $0.200, while its official launch price is established at $0.250, scheduled for June 2025. Buyers with a preference of early-stage cryptocurrencies still have the chance to obtain RXS at a lower price before it is broadly accessible on major exchanges. Moreover, the CertiK certification of Rexas Finance and its expanding community enhance trust in its sustainability, establishing it as a one of best new cryptocurrencies to watch in the DeFi sector. Rexas finance tokenomics 2. Chiliz (CHZ): Crypto Coin Breaks Out of 3.5-Year Falling Wedge Chiliz (CHZ), emerges as a crypto coin, popular for high engagement of fans in entertainment and sports. Recently, the CHZ experienced a technical breakout of a 3.5-year falling wedge—a bullish reversal pattern. This demonstrations an end to its lengthy correction phase, and the start of a new upward trajectory. Important historical stages of Chiliz: Discovery (2019): Achieved market recognition. Sharp Correction (2020): Faced a notable decline because of wider market circumstances. Momentum (2021): Experienced a rise during the cryptocurrency bull market. Flat Correction (2022–Present): Began a period of price stabilization and consolidation. With resistance levels being analyzed for the first time since 2021, analysts predict a potential increase surpassing $0.40. Should this upward momentum continue, CHZ could eventually exceed the $1 mark, by increasing acceptance in the sports and entertainment industries. 3. XDC Network (XDC) Targets $0.1814: Breakout Could Lead to $0.34122 XDC Network (XDC) has experienced a notable surge, rising by nearly 105% year-to-date, to trade today at $0.09046. The crypto coins performance indicates a possible breakout, which might result in additional profits. Market analysts suggest that if XDC breaks through its $0.1814 resistance point, the next significant target will be $0.34122. Considering its robust fundamentals and rising adoption in trade finance and decentralized applications, XDC is poised for sustained growth in the long run. The token’s upward trend offers an appealing opportunity as one of best cryptos to buy , for investors eager to benefit from its rising momentum. XDC Network (XDC) price chart 4. Coti (COTI): Crypto Coins Primed for Midterm Recovery Coti (COTI) is currently consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, a formation that often precedes significant price breakouts. The crypto coin has been reacting to its rising trendline, indicating strong buying pressure at key support levels. If COTI successfully breaks through the upper trendline, it could initiate a strong upward move toward its $0.50 target. Given its role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and payment systems, COTI remains a solid bet for midterm growth, with the potential to reach $1 as adoption increases. Final Thoughts While SHIB and PEPE continue to capture attention in the meme coin sector, projects like Rexas Finance, Chiliz, XDC Network, and Coti offer real-world utility and strong technical setups that could drive them toward the $1 milestone faster. With blockchain innovation shaping the future of DeFi and digital assets, these penny crypto coins present promising opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on the next wave of crypto market growth.

Here’s the Destination,https://timestabloid.com/trader-sends-3-36-trillion-shib-heres-the-destination/,"A substantial transaction involving 3.36 trillion Shiba Inu tokens has been detected on the blockchain. The transfer was reported by Whale Alert, which reported both wallets as unknown wallets. However, the sender has been identified as GnosisSafeProxy. The movement of such a significant volume of SHIB has drawn attention, particularly as the sender’s balance has been reduced to zero. Transaction Breakdown The transaction, which took place at 12:25 p.m. (UTC) yesterday, involved the transfer of exactly 3,368,549,976,020 SHIB, valued at approximately $51.15 million at the time of execution. Following this transfer, the receiving wallet now holds the entirety of the SHIB sent, making it the dominant asset in that wallet’s portfolio. On-chain data further reveals that the recipient address also contains 13,381 ETH, worth around $35.2 million. With three different cryptocurrencies in its balance, SHIB remains the most valuable asset by dollar value in this wallet. The purpose behind this transaction remains uncertain. With the recent resurgence in whale activity across prominent ecosystems like XRP, one could infer that whales are preparing for something big. However, this transaction could also be a strategic relocation of funds for security reasons or a routine transfer between private parties outside of an exchange. There has been no official information to clarify the exact motive behind the transaction.

On February 5, another significant transaction saw an anonymous entity withdraw 1.24 trillion SHIB from the Kraken exchange into another anonymous wallet. Such large withdrawals from exchanges typically suggest that holders intend to store the tokens long-term rather than trade them in the short term. The recent transfer also follows reports indicating increased accumulation of SHIB by large holders. Recent data from IntoTheBlock shows that whales have acquired approximately 6.33 trillion tokens since the beginning of the year, with 840 billion of these purchases occurring in February alone. This trend suggests sustained interest from major investors despite recent price fluctuations. Despite these notable transactions, the cryptocurrency has been experiencing a downtrend mirroring the broader market. The digital asset is trading at $0.00001589, down 12.03% from last week. However, it has experienced an increase of approximately 6% over the past 24 hours, suggesting the bearish phase could be over.

Rising expenses and losses highlight risks in Strategy’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy. Market uncertainty grows as Bitcoin drops 11% amid post-inauguration trade concerns. Michael Saylor’s recent social media activity has ignited speculation on a potential new Bitcoin acquisition by Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy. The company, a long-time Bitcoin advocate, has a history of hinting at its purchases through cryptic posts and chart updates. This pattern appeared again when Saylor shared a Bitcoin tracker on X, boosting market expectations. Bitcoin’s price movements have added further intrigue, as the asset recently dipped below $96,000 before recovering above $96,500.

BNB Chain-based TST token, issued as a memecoin by the blockchain’s community following a tutorial video on how to issue tokens, zoomed to a $300 million market capitalization as Binance founder Changpeng Zhao referred to the token in several X posts — with it even gaining a coveted Binance listing on Sunday. Zhao, who stepped from a formal role at the company last year, said Sunday that he wasn’t for or against memecoins, and the category’s “fun” element makes it appealing for short-term traders. “Things with clear tangible value are harder to speculate on. They stay around the clear value,” Zhao said. “This is indeed a challenge for RWA. Memes are fun, etc. It’s a cultural thing. I am not an expert in this area. There are plenty of die-hard defenders of memes. Don’t go against the community.” Barstool’s Portnoy Buys “JAILSTOOL” David Portnoy, the influential founder of Barstool Sports, jumped into the memecoin fray on Friday with a coin called ""Montoya por favor,"" inspired by a contestant from the Spanish reality show La Isla De Las Tentaciones. Portnoy told his 3.5 million X followers that he was ""up a billion percent"" on his first foray into the meme tokens, helping the coins surge to a market capitalization of $14 million at its peak before plummeting down to a $1 million cap within a few hours. He has now set his sights on a Josh Allen MVP coin with a playful warning, ""Buy at your own risk. I just bought it. I’m gonna sell it. Don’t buy what ya can’t lose."" That coin also shot up, hitting a market cap of over $12 million, before nosediving to a capitalization under $100,000. Market watchers on X accused him of leading his massive following into a pump-and-dump scheme. But Portnoy defended his trading spree, claiming transparency and even humorously questioning if his actions could land him in jail. Someone then issued the JAILSTOOL token, a nod to Portnoy’s tweet…which Portnoy then purchased and promoted to his followers. “I may dump it eventually but I’ll let all you righteous losers dump on each other first. So don’t put in more than you can lose,” he quipped. JAILSTOOL surged from $1.2 million to over $200 million at peak, even gaining a spot listing on U.S.-based Kraken on Sunday. It trades at 8 cents in Asian afternoon hours on Monday at a $78 million market capitalization. Suspicions Rise as Central African Republic’s President Issues a Token Here's where the meme frenzy gets wild — an entire African country has decided to get in on the fun as the Central African Republic apparently issued its CAR memecoin over the weekend. CAR launched with a promise to aid in national development and to put one of the poorest countries “on the world stage,” its president said on X. The token's market cap soared to around $527 million shortly after issuance, nearly a fourth of the country’s GDP of $2.6 billion. “As the second president in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, I have always recognized the potential of crypto and its benefits on a global scale,” Faustin-Archange Touadéra said, linking to CAR’s website. But suspicions abound around CAR’s issuance, with the site’s domain provider taking it down late Sunday and some X users allegeding Touadéra’s video to be a deepfake. Solana decentralized exchange Jupiter said early Monday it had reached out to CAR representations for further validity of the token and its official connection to the country. Jupiter said it was able to verify the token’s deployers using an onchain transaction, but further confirmation and exact relation to the president’s office remain pending as of Asian afternoon hours.",Markets|meme coin|meme economy|Africa,EN,0,0,MARKET|BNB|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-10 07:44:33

She is the first female vice president and the highest-ranking female politician in the U.S. Kamala was Born in Oakland, California, and graduated from Howard University with a degree in political science and economics, and later pursued her law degree from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law. As a politician, she implemented stricter laws, the DREAM Act, and federal legalization of cannabis, healthcare, and taxation reform. Harris secured enough non-binding support from delegates to become the speculative nominee of the Democratic Party. Vice President was considered by most crypto enthusiasts to be a turning point in the journey of the crypto industry. It was expected that Trump would introduce several crypto-friendly policies. To an extent, the Trump administration has managed to live up to these general expectations. However, some recent economic policies of his administration, related to tariffs, have indirectly affected the cryptocurrency sector. The big question now is: Has the crypto industry really benefited from the political change in the US? Trump’s Tariff Announcement and Its Immediate Impact The newly inducted Trump administration on February 9 jolted the global economy with a new tariff move. More importantly, this time, it targeted the global aluminum and steel industry. It imposed a 25% tariff on aluminium and steel. According to the International Trade Administration’s Global Steel Trade Monitor report, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, South Korea, Russia, Japan, Germany, Turkey, Vietnam, and Taiwan are the top ten countries that export steel to the US. Meanwhile, as per the same report, Canada, Mexico, China, Italy, India, Belgium, Malta, Brazil, Germany, and South Korea are the top countries that import steel from the US. Yesterday, the total market cap of the cryptocurrency market declined sharply by around 0.32%. However, lately, the market has shown strong signs of recovery. Today, the market has grown by nearly 0.64%. Notably, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has decreased from 46 to 43, indicating that the recovery has failed to make any positive impact on investor confidence. Bitcoin and Ethereum Price Fluctuations Between February 8 and 9, the Bitcoin market declined by at least 0.040%. More importantly, at one point on February 9, the BTC price reached as low as $94,715.39. Today, the Bitcoin price has seen a surge of 0.51%. Yesterday, the Ethereum market slipped by approximately 0.20%. The market has not yet fully recovered from the correction, although today the Ethereum price has increased by 0.12%. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Red Alert: Trump’s 25% Tariff on Metals Shakes Markets, XRP and Dogecoin Suffer Major Losses , Trump’s Tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China and Their Market Impact This is not the first time that Trump has sent shockwaves through the global market with a tariff announcement. On February 1, the Trump administration imposed a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico, and a 10% tariff on China. On February 3, the administration paused the tariff action that it had initiated against Canada and Mexico. Meanwhile, the administration’s action against China escalated to a severe trade war, with China imposing a counter-tariff of 15% on selected US goods. It is possible that the administration could reinstate its tariff policy against its neighbours after the offered 30-day pause ends. At the start of February 1, the crypto market’s total market cap was at $3.45T. On February 2, it touched as low as 3.19T. Although on February 3 it rebounded to $3.29T, between February 4 and 7, the market slipped from $3.29T to 3.09T. The market has not yet recovered from the correction. Currently, the market cap stands at $3.12T. Potential Future Tariffs and Crypto Market Risks Reports suggest that the Trump administration may impose similar tariffs on semiconductors, oil, gas and copper. There are also rumours that the administration may impose a tariff on the European Union as well. If Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President continues with his tariff plans, the crypto market, especially Bitcoin and Ethereum , could face significant impacts. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The top contenders are Avalanche (AVAX) and Remittix (RTX) , with many analysts arguing that these tokens can outperform established coins like Solana (SOL). With significant advancements, AVAX and Remittix are drawing attention for their innovative features and market positioning. Avalanche (AVAX): A Rising Star in Blockchain Technology Avalanche is famous for its quick transactions and scalability. AVAX price stands at $25.05 after escaping the volatility of the market. Last month, the AVAX price increased by 13.28%, indicating a possible rally heading into the altcoin season. Experts point to Avalanche’s distinctive consensus mechanism. Unlike Solana or Ethereum, Avalanche enables thousands of transactions with finality in seconds and is used in decentralized finance (DeFi) and enterprise solutions. Experts think the AVAX price will rise as more projects migrate to the Avalanche network, which offers flexibility and lower transaction fees. With Ethereum gas fees fluctuating, Avalanche’s low pricing has attracted investors and developers. Remittix (RTX): The Future of Cross-Border Payments Remittix (RTX) almost exceeded $11.5 million in its ICO in a few months. The platform seeks to transform the banking system by allowing fast, safe and affordable cross-border payments. While cryptocurrency becomes mainstream, Remittix is attempting to plug a void in the marketplace by enabling people to convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into FIAT currency and fund any account worldwide within 24 hours. A key feature of Remittix is that it targets the unbanked. According to the World Bank, around 1.4 billion people worldwide lack access to conventional banking methods, but some own mobile phones and use crypto wallets. Remittix allows these folks to send and receive payments without going through traditional banks. Partnering with services like Western Union, Remittix is giving millions of dollars a lifeline to cash in underserved places. Additionally, Remittix is attracting interest from businesses that accept cryptocurrency payments. With the Remittix Pay API, merchants accept crypto payments, convert them to fiat currency in a split second, avoid the headaches of fluctuating crypto prices and complicated accounting methods. This solution appeals most to online businesses, overseas companies, and service providers who wish to incorporate cryptocurrency into their everyday activities without the volatility related to electronic assets. The Remittix platform is also integrated with Ethereum and other leading blockchain networks. As the worldwide need for quicker, cheaper cross-border payments elevates, Remittix is likely to be a significant player in the remittance market. Presale token performance indicates that the market is interested in this new solution, and Remittix is anticipated to grow significantly once fully launched. Solana (SOL): A Strong Contender with Scaling Challenges Although Solana remains a hotshot in the crypto space, trading at $202.06 at press time, the token faces challenges that may affect its performance in the coming altcoin season. Solana is characterized by high throughput and low-cost transactions; however, the network scalability has been under review, and the Solana price has increased. Even with major advances in network upgrades like Solana’s v1.10 update, the system has experienced regular outages and delays and is uncertain about its future reliability. Several experts think the Solana price growth might slow down if the network suffers performance problems. However, as more scalable platforms like Avalanche and brand-new presale tokens like Remittix emerge, Solana might compete for investor attention more fiercely. Join the Remittix Presale Today As the altcoin season draws near, the competition between Solana, Avalanche, and emerging presale tokens like Remittix is heating up. While Solana and Avalanche continue to be major players, Remittix is seen as having the potential to outperform established coins in the coming months. Remittix’s innovative cross-border payment solutions position it to become a top contender in the altcoin market. For investors, this is a time to stay informed and consider the long-term growth potential of these tokens. With AVAX price surging and new technologies on the horizon, presale token opportunities like Remittix could offer significant returns as the crypto market evolves. Whether you’re tracking Solana price trends or watching AVAX price movements, it’s clear that the future of altcoins is looking increasingly competitive.

The prices of the top tokens, like Bitcoin, have remained unchanged through out the weekend, which suggested a drop in the traders confidence and interest. Or, in another perspective, they might be waiting for the right time to enter as the markets are expected to be volatile for the rest of the week ahead of the U.S. CPI rates. The Bitcoin liquidation levels have a deep impact on the upcoming price action in the short term. After the recent liquidity grab at the support squashing the short trades, the BTC price experienced a decent rise from the levels around $94,500 to the current levels. Meanwhile, the price is heading towards a crucial price range, which may again trigger a liquidation and this time it could be in the opposite direction. The data from Coinglass suggests the token experienced a short liquidation of around $100M at around $95,000 and now another pile of around $200M is waiting for the token if it rises above $97,800. These longs are set to grab the liquidity at these levels, which may cause a short-term pullback, probably close to the $95,500 range. However, the technicals have turned bullish, which suggests the price may continue with a steep ascending trend if it manages to surpass the pivotal zone. The short-term price action suggests the price is poised for a small pullback as the bulls seem to have exhausted their strength. The stochastic RSI has reached the overbough levels and is preparing for a bearish crossover. This cold drags the levels to the support of the descending triangle and remains consolidated with the pattern until it reaches it’s apex. However, in the long term, the 50-day MA at $98,700 acts as a strong resistance and a rise above these levels may validate the beginning of a fresh bullish trend. Therefore, in the coming days, the Bitcoin (BTC) price may continue to chop around a narrow range as the fresh liquidity may enter only after the longs grab their liquidity at $98,000.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-10 07:54:26

With its innovative cross-chain transaction capabilities, exceptional $2 million presale, and real-world utility through crypto debit cards, 1Fuel is rapidly capturing investor attention. As XRP faces increasing selling pressure, could 1Fuel be the dark horse that dominates the market in 2025? Let’s find out! XRP’s February struggle: Will it break or bounce? XRP, the Ripple network’s native cryptocurrency, has been experiencing significant negative pressure recently, pushing XRP price to fall to a monthly low. A key indicator, the Price Daily Active Addresses (DAA) Divergence, is presently showing a sell signal, indicating a risky price trend. Additionally, the declining trading volume suggests a lack of faith in the altcoin’s near-term price prospects. In simple terms, the decline in market activity indicates that investors are backing away from XRP. Adding to the bearish attitude, XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has fallen to a three-month low, indicating that selling pressure is increasing. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.40, with a weekly loss of 7.3%, but, remaining above its critical support level of $2.33. This support zone has become essential for XRP. If XRP remains above this level, it will soon rebound. However, if the price falls below $2.33, it might spark a major decline to the next key support level of $1.94, compounding investors’ losses. 1Fuel (OFT) steals the spotlight: Next big crypto play? While the once-leading crypto project, XRP, struggles with regaining its momentum, the crypto market is now eyeing an upcoming project, 1Fuel (OFT) , which has taken over the crypto world owing to its cutting-edge features and massive returns potential. With its ground-breaking one-click cross-chain transactions feature, 1Fuel aims to streamline cryptocurrency transactions. Users will be able to trade across numerous networks with this feature by only selecting the asset of their choice, leaving the complex process to be handled by 1Fuel. Both newbie and seasoned traders and investors have been drawn to this feature. An integrated peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange in this upcoming wallet and DEX, further ups the ante by enabling direct asset transfers without the need for middlemen. This stands in line with their principle of complete decentralization by giving its users complete control over their assets. Furthermore, 1Fuel’s physical and virtual debit and credit cards will soon be launched, enabling users to conveniently utilize their cryptocurrency holdings like regular cash. This is anticipated to bridge the gap between the traditional finance and the digital finance world for once and all. The hottest ICO of 2025? 1Fuel’s adoption says yes 1Fuel (OFT) is currently in its presale phase and has proved itself as a leading ICO in recent times. The presale is in its 4th round and has already collected over $2 million in funding. Around 200,000,000 OFT tokens have been already sold. These numbers reflect the widespread adoption of this platform which has not even launched yet. Each OFT token is being sold for a mere $0.018 price point, already generating over 80% returns for its early backers. Analysts are predicting over 100x return potential once the coin hits the public exchanges, being the dark horse this year. Final thoughts XRP may be facing turbulence, but 1Fuel is on an entirely different trajectory. With its seamless cross-chain transactions, a fully decentralized P2P exchange, and real-world utility through its upcoming crypto debit cards, this project is redefining how we interact with digital assets. The presale is already delivering massive gains, and analysts predict an even bigger breakout when OFT hits exchanges. Don’t miss out!

The effects of this “extreme positioning” were seen earlier this month when crypto markets crashed , hitting Ethereum hard. The asset dumped 37% in 60 hours as Trump’s trade war headlines emerged. “It felt almost like the flash crash seen in stocks in 2010, but with no headlines,” it added. Ethereum Short Squeeze Despite all the negativity and buildup of short positions, Ethereum ETFs added $2 billion in new funds in December while achieving a record weekly inflow of $854 million. Trading volume has been strong, with spikes after Inauguration Day and the February crash, Kobeissi noted. Previous concerns about SEC classifying ETH as a security appear to be diminishing. The Trump Administration seems supportive of ETH , and Eric Trump’s positive comment about ETH briefly affected prices last week. Nevertheless, Ethereum is still trading 46% down from its November 2021 all-time high, which begs the question, “Why are hedge funds so dedicated to shorting Ethereum?” What is happening with Ethereum? Short positioning in Ethereum is now up +40% in ONE WEEK and +500% since November 2024. Never in history have Wall Street hedge funds been so short of Ethereum, and it’s not even close. What do hedge funds know is coming? (a thread) pic.twitter.com/knsyOhYyyt — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) February 9, 2025 There is a strong possibility of a short squeeze due to the extreme level of short positioning, the large gap between Bitcoin and Ethereum’s performance, and BTC being up approximately 12 times more than ETH over the past year or so. A short squeeze occurs when a heavily shorted asset like ETH starts to rise in price, forcing short sellers to cover their positions by buying back the asset to cut their losses. This buying pressure then pushes the asset even higher, forcing more short sellers to cover, creating a rapid upward spiral in price. Given the reported 500% increase in ETH short positions over the past three months, a short squeeze could be particularly dramatic. With so many short positions, this could create massive buying pressure, driving the price up very quickly and potentially closing some of that gap with Bitcoin’s performance. The impact could be especially significant because institutional investors holding these large short positions typically use leverage, which means they might need to cover their positions quickly if the market moves against them, potentially amplifying the squeeze effect. However, it should be noted that while short squeezes can cause dramatic price increases, these are often temporary, and the price may settle back down after the squeeze plays out. End of Altseason? Back to the current situation, ETH prices continue to crumble as the asset has lost 17% over the past fortnight. ETH dipped to an intraday low of $2,540 before a minor recovery to trade at $2,630 at the time of writing. However, traders and analysts have spotted similarities in chart patterns, noting that February has been historically bullish for ETH. Ethereum is mirroring 2020’s breakout structure.

In a new strategy session, pseudonymous analyst Cheds tells his 49,600 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin appears to be currently trading in a sideways trend with a well-defined resistance at $107,000 and a clear support level at $90,000. But Cheds says that Bitcoin bulls need to defend the critical support area as the $90,000 price level keeps BTC’s strong uptrend intact. He highlights that there’s no stopping BTC from going all the way down to the low $70,000 level if the support crumbles. “I think if Bitcoin loses $90,000, and you’ve heard me, I don’t think $78,000 is holding. I mean if we lose $90,000, we’re going to probably $74,000. That’s a high-confidence call and then probably $72,000… There’s no way it’s going to hold $85,000 or $78,000. The importance of [$90,000] cannot be understated. You have classical charting, multiple interactions. You have time interval between interactions. You have price distance peak to trough. It’s all in the context of an uptrend and losing this level would be a severe momentum blow. There’s going to be no pausing between here and $72,000 to $74,000.” Source: Cheds/YouTube At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $96,231, a fractional increase on the day.

Historically, Ethereum’s rallies have triggered capital rotations into smaller assets, but its recent underperformance has stalled market momentum. However, with key upgrades like Pectra and rising institutional demand, Ethereum’s breakout seems inevitable, likely setting the stage for an altcoin resurgence in line with the coveted 4-year cycle. Set to capitalize on this rise, Rollblock is emerging as a high-potential iGaming project, combining blockchain security with a plethora of entertainment options. With over 7,000 games, sports betting for major events, and a thriving play-to-earn model, Rollblock is attracting both players and investors in equal stead. Read on to learn more. Exploring Rollblock Rollblock RBLK’s Bullish Potential During The Presale Rollblock is revolutionizing online gaming with its advanced ERC-20 platform, blending security, innovative rewards, and immense growth potential for users and investors alike. The platform features an extensive library of 7,000+ games, spanning classic favorites like poker and blackjack to cutting-edge blockchain-based experiences. With the recent launch of sports betting and an ambitious roadmap set to introduce a dozen more games in early 2025, Rollblock is rapidly attracting a growing audience in 2025. December alone saw $1.75 million in wagers, and Q1 2025 could easily shatter new records. Rollblock’s play-to-earn model rewards users for engagement, turning gaming into a profitable experience. Players earn RBLK tokens through wagers, tournaments, and in-game achievements, with 60% of tokens bought back and burned to sustain value. With a SolidProof audit and an Anjouan Gaming license, Rollblock ensures full compliance and transparency while utilizing AI-driven encryption to provide top-tier security. These factors have helped the platform amass a loyal following of over 40,000 members, even at this early stage of its presale. Investors Await Altcoin Season Amid Some Bullish News For Ethereum Ethereum has faced extreme volatility, plunging 25% within minutes and wiping out over $600 million in liquidations earlier this week. Initially, the drop was attributed to Trump’s trade tariffs, but with agreements delaying their impact, the real cause appears to be mass liquidations and strategic market manipulation by whales and exchanges. Despite this turmoil, Ethereum has managed a 7% rebound within 24 hours, stabilizing around $2,830. Notably, Eric Trump’s tweet calling Ethereum a strong buy coincided with a rapid 35% bounce, drawing speculation over his influence on market sentiment, as speculations mount over Donald Trump’s next move following his unprecedented TRUMP meme coin launch. Amid these price swings, Ethereum has quietly implemented a major network upgrade, raising its gas limit for the first time since 2021. This enhancement increases transaction capacity, reduces congestion, and improves the overall efficiency of smart contracts and staking on the Ethereum network. Coupled with the upcoming Pectra upgrade in March, Ethereum is positioning itself as a more scalable and developer-friendly network. As Ethereum’s struggles have left the broader altcoin market stagnant, its historical role in leading past alt seasons cannot be ignored. Analysts argue that for a true altcoin surge to occur, Ethereum must regain strength and attract capital back into established Layer-1 ecosystems. With institutional demand for Ethereum ETFs growing and network upgrades improving usability, a decisive recovery could trigger the long-awaited altseason, allowing Ethereum to reclaim its dominance in the space. The good news is that Ethereum looks poised for a major resurrection, albeit slightly delayed in comparison to the previous two bull runs in 2021 and 2017. Don’t Miss Out On Rollblock RBLK!

Bitcoin (BTC) changed the game for early investors, delivering life-changing returns, and Solana (SOL) is recognized for its exceptional scalability. Now, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN , a new coin in the market, is grabbing headlines with predictions of 55,000% growth potential. Having raised $.51 million during its presale in minutes, it’s being closely watched by experts who see it as the next breakout token alongside top contenders. Why THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is Creating a Buzz 1. Fresh Entry, Massive Upside Being new to the market, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers a rare opportunity to invest before its value skyrockets. Early investors stand to benefit from the kind of exponential returns only seen in the early days of tokens like SOL and XRP. 2. Exceptional Presale Success The presale success of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN , raising $1.5 million almost instantly, is a clear indicator of its high demand and market appeal. Its early momentum positions it as a leader among emerging cryptos. 3. Exclusivity Fuels Demand Unlike XRP, LINK, and DOT, which are widely available across exchanges, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively sold at magacoinofficial.com . This controlled access ensures scarcity, increasing its value for early adopters. How It Stands Against Competitors XRP: Dominates payments but lacks the early-stage growth potential of this new coin. Solana (SOL): Scalable and fast, but its growth is already stabilizing compared to this fresh token. Chainlink (LINK): Strong in decentralized oracles but can’t match the excitement surrounding THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS): An emerging project, but its momentum falls short of this token’s presale success. Don’t Miss This Game-Changing Opportunity With experts predicting up to 55,000% gains, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN is becoming the most talked-about crypto of 2025. Its record-breaking presale, exclusivity, and high-growth potential make it a must-watch token alongside Solana. Secure your tokens now at magacoinofficial.com and join the revolution!

BlockDAG’s presale has raised an impressive $193.5M, selling over 18.3 billion BDAG tokens, with a 2380% increase in value since launch. Meanwhile, Stacks (STX) is strengthening Bitcoin’s smart contract functionality, and Injective(INJ) is driving decentralized trading innovations. While all three projects bring significant advancements, which one is proving to be the most financially rewarding for users? Let’s examine how these three platforms compare in terms of earning potential, real-world usage, and financial incentives. BlockDAG(BDAG) Presale Hits $193.5M and TG Tap Miners Hits 100K Users BlockDAG is one of the most actively discussed crypto projects in 2025. Its $193.5M presale success, paired with a 2380% price surge, has positioned it as a standout early-stage investment. The project’s Layer-1 DAG-based network supports rapid transactions and high scalability, addressing common blockchain limitations. A major draw for BlockDAG is its X1 Miner, which has already sold 15,850 units, providing a steady income stream for users mining BDAG tokens. The TG Tap Miner Game, with over 100,000 active players, allows users to earn BDAG coins by converting in-game points—offering a direct way to accumulate digital assets. Currently, BDAG’s presale is in batch 27, with coins priced at $0.0248. Early buyers benefit from a 5% USDT cashback offer, and with planned listings on major exchanges, the project presents an opportunity for users looking to participate before public trading begins. While Stacks and Injective focus on blockchain infrastructure and DeFi markets, BlockDAG integrates mining, gaming, and direct incentives, giving users multiple earning pathways in its ecosystem. Stacks (STX) – Expanding Bitcoin’s Smart Contract Capabilities Stacks (STX) enhances Bitcoin’s ecosystem by enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) on the network. While Bitcoin remains the most widely adopted cryptocurrency, it was not originally designed for programmable applications—Stacks bridges this gap without compromising Bitcoin’s security. Using the Proof-of-Transfer (PoX) consensus mechanism, Stacks builds upon Bitcoin’s blockchain, allowing developers to create NFTs, DeFi platforms, and decentralized identity solutions. Additionally, STX holders can earn Bitcoin rewards through staking, offering a passive income stream. Despite its strong use case, Stacks relies on Bitcoin’s settlement speed, making it slower than Layer-1 alternatives like BlockDAG. While it holds promise for long-term adoption, its current financial incentives for users remain more speculative compared to BlockDAG’s mining and cashback rewards. Injective (INJ) – A High-Speed DeFi Hub for Zero-Gas Trading Injective (INJ) was introduced in 2020 as a Layer-1 blockchain designed for decentralized finance (DeFi), supporting derivatives trading, lending, and cross-chain transactions. It offers smart contract execution with zero gas fees, making it an attractive option for cost-conscious traders. Backed by Binance and leading investors, Injective raised $10 million in early funding rounds. Its on-chain order book and automated smart contracts have enabled it to gain traction in DeFi markets. As of February 6, 2025, INJ is trading at $19.24, with projections aiming for $75 by year-end. Having previously hit an all-time high of $52.75 in 2024, Injective continues expanding through network upgrades and strategic partnerships. While high-speed DeFi is Injective’s core appeal, its earning potential depends on trading volume. Unlike BlockDAG’s structured rewards from mining and presale bonuses, Injective’s financial benefits primarily come from market fluctuations and staking yields. Final Thoughts Stacks, Injective, and BlockDAG each offer distinct advantages—Stacks expands Bitcoin’s smart contract utility, Injective provides gas-free DeFi, and BlockDAG delivers direct earning opportunities through mining, gaming, and cashback incentives. BlockDAG’s $193.5M presale success, 2380% price growth, and 5% USDT cashback offer clear financial incentives for early participants. While Stacks and Injective hold long-term potential, BlockDAG currently provides the most accessible way to generate crypto rewards before public exchange listings in 2025. With a strong foundation and increasing adoption, BlockDAG continues to push forward, bridging blockchain technology with real-world usability more effectively than its competitors.

40147485,https://nulltx.com/?p=144367,1739178111,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,XRP Price Analysis: Can SEC Resolution & ETF Hype Trigger $5 For Ripple?,https://nulltx.com/xrp-price-analysis-can-sec-resolution-etf-hype-trigger-5-for-ripple/,"Experts in this industry believe Ripple’s XRP could achieve new high price levels because of Ripple’s SEC legal dispute and increasing demand for cryptocurrency ETFs. DXT Exchange gained public recognition because of its innovative trading approach during their current token presale phase, creating distinct investment chances for early backers. Multiple experts anticipate this time will boost Ripple and DTX into leading positions within the crypto sector. Ripple XRP Price Gains Momentum With SEC Ruling Speculations XRP price remains a subject of keen interest because the ongoing SEC versus Ripple court battle defines the cryptocurrency’s market value. The ongoing regulatory fight against Ripple continues to create positive expectations about setting standards for cryptocurrency markets. Expert analysts believe that a positive resolution from the SEC could pave the way for the XPR price to surpass significant market points. The current price of $2.3 for XRP establishes a base, but future market sentiment shifts toward Ripple could boost the company’s status while attracting interest in the banking sector again. Source: CoinMarketCap If Ripple gains legal clarity, it will not only provide confidence to investors but could also encourage partnerships with major financial institutions. These developments will likely boost the XRP price over the long term. Regulatory clarity in Ripple’s ecosystem could trigger explosive growth of its adoption rates because of its recognized efficiency in cross-border payment transactions. The belief that Ripple can expand its financial sector impact finds support from this situation. While Ripple’s short-term performance shows mixed movement, with a 25.22% decline over the past week, many insiders consider this phase a consolidation period for XRP. If the legal case concludes favorably, the market may witness a strong rally, potentially driving the XRP price closer to $5. Ripple’s robust infrastructure and ability to solve real-world problems keep it among the strongest contenders in the crypto space, even as investors focus on other projects like DTX Exchange . DTX Exchange Offers Unique Opportunities During Crypto Market Shifts As crypto markets face changes driven by regulation and market trends, DTX Exchange stands out as an innovative trading platform poised to attract significant attention. The platform enables investors to access blockchain transparency and more than 120,000 available assets, including cryptocurrencies, together with ETFs, stocks, and forex. Several experts predict platforms such as these will become essential for crypto investment growth during the next investment phase. The presale of DTX tokens is a key highlight, offering early access to what some consider one of the best cryptocurrency investment opportunities in 2025. With its current token price set at $0.16 in the public presale, DTX presents a high-growth opportunity for investors looking for upcoming altcoins to watch. The presale phase has already raised $13.5 million, lending credibility to the idea that the DTX Exchange could generate strong market interest. Experts believe that the platform’s unique ability to democratize access to financial markets, previously reserved for institutions, might make it a solid crypto pick to buy for early adopters. One distinguishing feature of DTX Exchange is its provision for up to 1000x liquidity on trading capital, a move designed to support both retail and institutional traders. This feature could make it a preferred choice for those seeking efficiency and speed in their transactions. As more traders explore hybrid platforms, DTX Exchange may gain traction as one of the best altcoin investments for diversifying portfolios. When comparing it to Ripple, insiders note that DTX’s public presale might offer more immediate upside potential, given its low starting price and ambitious roadmap. Ripple and DTX Could Benefit From Growing ETF Hype in 2025 The growing interest in cryptocurrency ETFs is likely to benefit both Ripple and projects like DTX Exchange in the coming years. The institutional market requires simplified financial solutions that Ripple’s cross-border payment framework directly addresses and this alignment will gain visibility if Crypto ETFs advance further. The approval of new ETFs might create fresh market liquidity, which experts predict will benefit Ripple projects by raising XRP prices. DTX Exchange also stands to benefit from the ETF wave, given its wide asset base that includes ETFs alongside cryptocurrencies. This hybrid approach positions it to attract a broad range of investors seeking diversified options in a single platform. Insiders consider this an advantage for DTX, as it provides a future-ready trading environment that could cater to both seasoned investors and newcomers. Conclusion As the XRP price continues to draw attention to Ripple’s ongoing developments, platforms like DTX Exchange are emerging as compelling options for those looking to diversify their investments. Market watchers believe its innovative approach to trading could make it a standout choice among upcoming altcoins. If you’re curious to explore what DTX Exchange has to offer, now is the perfect time to learn more and get involved.

In a recent interview in Seoul, chairman Jung Eun-bo stressed that with South Korea being the “third-largest real cryptocurrency trading country,” delaying crypto ETFs could leave it trailing behind global markets that are already moving ahead. He pointed to the United States, where both futures and spot Bitcoin ETFs are “available and actively traded,” as an example of how other markets are embracing the shift. Jung added that crypto ETFs could bring fresh opportunities to the country’s financial sector. “Cryptocurrency represents a sector capable of generating new value in the financial industry We must not delay the introduction of cryptocurrency ETF trading,” Jung said. As of February 2025, the U.S. market boasts a total of 20 cryptocurrency exchange-traded products, encompassing both spot and futures-based offerings. This includes 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs, 8 Bitcoin strategy ETFs, and 9 spot Ethereum ETFs. Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, the crypto ETF landscape is expanding to include other digital assets. Asset managers have filed applications for ETFs targeting cryptocurrencies like Solana, XRP, and even meme coins like Dogecoin. You might also like: South Korean city to launch its own crypto seizing system for tax evaders Jung’s comments come at a time when South Korea’s financial sector is grappling with various challenges, including a shrinking investor base and what he called “zombie companies”—struggling firms that survive on borrowed funds. He believes that embracing cryptocurrency ETFs could enrich the market by offering investors a safer and more regulated way to access digital assets. According to him, introducing crypto ETFs aligns with his goal of modernizing the financial landscape in the country. Jung also weighed in on regulations, warning that excessive legislation could stifle innovation in the market. He also pushed for easing restrictions on pension fund investments in equities, arguing that overly strict limits on high-risk assets could hurt long-term returns. As previously reported by crypto.news, Jung pushed for exploring cryptocurrency ETFs after South Korea’s stock market was thrown into chaos and saw a mass exodus of investors following President Yoon Suk-yeol’s failed attempt to declare martial law. Speaking at the Securities and Derivatives Market Opening Ceremony 2025, Jung argued that South Korea needs to explore new business sectors. In October, local media reported that South Korean regulators were considering approving crypto ETFs but did not provide a specific timeline. Earlier in the year, the Financial Supervisory Service governor, Lee Bok-hyun, hinted at ongoing discussions on whether to allow spot Bitcoin ETFs in South Korea.

Will Bitcoin (BTC) react to this testimony and the upcoming macroeconomic events? How will this affect the crypto markets? Will Bitcoin Price Hit $100K Before Powell’s Testimony? Powell is set to testify before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday at 10 AM. EST and the House Financial Services panel the following day. This is part of the chairman’s semiannual testimony to lawmakers and is unlikely to push Bitcoin price to hit $100K for numerous reasons. The Fed chairman will likely indicate that the economy is resilient, highlight its dual mandate of maintaining price stability and achieving maximum employment, and take a data-driven approach to reducing inflation. Outside of the short-term volatility, the hearing will not affect BTC’s value . According to Tim Duy of SGH Macro Advisors, the Fed speakers agree that no rate cuts will occur until the second half of the year. However, this outlook might quickly change as the January jobs report came in at 143K, lower than the consensus of 170K. A weaker jobs report might call for rate cuts and could be bullish for Bitcoin and crypto markets, which are risk-on assets. According to Bloomberg economists, “Chair Powell has said the Fed needs to see ‘real progress’ on inflation or some labor-market weakness to consider adjusting rates.” If Powell acknowledges this during the testimony and hints at a rate cut before June 2025, it could catalyze a risk-on behavior and propel Bitcoin price higher. While the jobs data showed weakness , the pickup in average hourly earnings and wages on par with the Fed’s expectations suggests that the central bank might stand its ground on the interest rate decision. The upcoming core CPI print, however, might be able to change this stance. The Bloomberg economists further added. “We think January’s CPI will offer mixed evidence. We expect headline and core CPI inflation both rose 0.3%” If the core CPI comes in much higher than the consensus, it might push the Fed to reconsider its interest rate decision. Under these circumstances, Bitcoin price might kickstart an uptrend and potentially push toward $100K. Nearly $80 Million Shorts Face Liquidation if BTC Price Hits $98K According to data from Coinank , short positions worth $77.38 million on Binance, Bybit, and Okex will face liquidation if the Bitcoin price clears $97,722. This shows that the investors are heavily bearish and are in short positions to capitalize on their expectations. On the contrary, $137 million long positions will be closed if Bitcoin price crashes below $96,174. Bitcoin (BTC) Liquidation Map In the past 24 hours, roughly $247 million positions faced liquidations, highlighting the crypto markets’ overleveraged nature. Interestingly, Bitcoin & Ethereum contributed nearly $90 million to the total liquidations. Bitcoin Price Today: What’s Next for BTC? Bitcoin price today trades at No data found for bitcoin on 1 hour ago on No data found for bitcoin on 1 hour ago after hitting a daily high of No data found for bitcoin on 1 hour ago today after a No data found for bitcoin on 1 hour ago% move on February 10. Bitcoin currently hovers around $97K , the Point of Control (POC), the highest trading volume level since November 2024. This barrier serves as a key support level that has prevented a deeper collapse and explains the recent consolidation. Bitcoin price prediction notes that a reversal here could propel BTC to value area high of $101.5K. However, overcoming this hurdle is critical for the uptrend to resume. Hence, the short-term upside for Bitcoin is capped at $101.5K. BTC/USDT 1-day chart On the other hand, a breakdown of the POC at $97K could trigger a crash to $93.3K, which is a stable support level. However, BTC is unlikely to stop here, and it could revisit $90.9K and $89K. Regardless, expecting BTC to hit $100K before Powell’s testimony is unlikely, but BTC could revisit the key level after this event especially if the core CPI comes in hotter than expectations.

This shows the massive growth in the industry in the past months. The DeFi sector is also growing, with 1Fuel leading in innovations. Most importantly, the launch of the 1Fuel (OFT) presale is ongoing, and it’s already in stage 4. OFT is the native token of 1Fuel and experts think it has a massive potential of delivering more than 500x gains in the coming months. The 1Fuel Presale – A Lucrative Opportunity The 1Fuel presale has already raised $2,047,275.65 for stage 4, with over 196 million tokens sold at $0.018 per token. Investors can buy 1Fuel using Tether (USDT), BNB, BTC, and Ethereum. They can also take advantage of exclusive presale bonuses before the token hits exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. With 97% of tokens still available in Stage 4, investors can secure the lowest possible price before public trading begins. The project’s innovative features and potential market disruption make it one to watch closely. Game-Changing Features of 1Fuel 1Fuel has allocated 500 million for the token presale, representing 50% of the total supply. Experts think 1Fuel could become one of the most profitable tokens because of the features the project has. First, 1Fuel’s integrated mixer ensures that financial transactions remain secure and anonymous. It protects users from unsolicited surveillance by combining transactions with others. This feature is becoming very important in the crypto industry. Also, the 1Fuel project comes with an AI-powered portfolio management tool. This tool analyzes market conditions and tailors investment strategies to maximize returns. From smart trade execution to tax reporting, AI handles the complexities, allowing investors to focus on growth. 1Fuel’s peer-to-peer exchange enables users to trade directly with one another in a secure environment. The decentralized platform provides fast and private transactions for crypto swaps and buying tokens with fiat. 1Fuel addresses security with military-grade cold storage, which keeps assets offline and safe from online threats. Upcoming Crypto Card – Revolutionizing Spending 1Fuel is set to launch its integrated debit and credit cards, transforming how crypto is used in everyday transactions. The card can convert crypto into fiat in real time, enabling users to spend their digital assets anywhere traditional cards are accepted. From buying coffee to booking vacations, this feature bridges the gap between the digital and physical financial worlds. It helps to make crypto more accessible and practical for everyday use. Could 1Fuel Deliver 500x Gains? Experts believe that 1Fuel has the potential to deliver more than a 500x price increase for investors. However, this will depend on many factors, including: F1 Sponsorship: Formula 1 provides massive global exposure. It will help 1Fuel to become a recognized brand in the crypto and tech spaces. Innovative Features: The combination of privacy solutions, AI-powered management, and seamless cross-chain trading will attract investors. Presale Momentum: About 97% of tokens are still available for stage 4 of the presale. So, early investors have the chance to capitalize on future price growth. Real-World Integration: The 1Fuel project is very practical and has real-world applications. The upcoming crypto card will serve as a user-friendly solution for crypto adoption. Final Thoughts 1Fuel’s combination of innovative features, strategic F1 sponsorship, and promising presale momentum makes it very attractive to investors. While a 500x gain is speculative, the project’s trajectory and real-world solutions suggest that it could happen. Early adopters may find themselves well-positioned for massive returns as 1Fuel continues to gain traction.

Ali Martinez has highlighted that the ADA price chart is “showing signs of a potential rebound.” RSI indicator reads 27.88 which means that ADA is currently being oversold in the market. Cardano (ADA) is gearing up for significant gains, according to crypto analyst Ali Martinez. Martinez noted that the technical indicators for the native token of the Cardano blockchain have turned bullish despite a 25% price crash in the past 30 days. Martinez noted that the daily candlestick chart for Cardano (ADA) against Tether (USDT) on Binance is “showing signs of a potential rebound.” The analyst stated that the “TD Sequential indicator” flashes a buy signal for the altcoin as investors are presented with strong entry points. TD Sequential Indicator The TD Sequential indicator is used to identify potential trend reversals. The indicator generates a buy signal when the bearish countdown reaches “9”, suggesting exhaustion of the downtrend.

The surge in bearish bets, up over 40% in just a week and 500% since last November, signals growing pessimism about Ethereum’s short-term outlook. In a recent analysis , The Kobeissi Letter showed that there is a historical pattern between large short positions and sharp price declines. Ethereum Price Loses 37% Following Trump’s Tariff Orders On Feb. 2, Ethereum suffered a steep drop of 37% within 60 hours following former President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement. The analyst compared the event to the infamous 2010 stock market flash crash, noting that over $1 trillion was wiped out from the broader crypto market during the selloff. We saw the effects of this extreme positioning on February 2nd. Ethereum fell -37% in 60 hours as the trade war headlines emerged. It felt almost like the flash crash seen in stocks in 2010, but with no headlines. More than $1 trillion was erased in crypto in HOURS. pic.twitter.com/FuraE9ocoW — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) February 9, 2025 Despite this bearish sentiment, Ethereum briefly saw support from the Trump administration, with Eric Trump recently stating that it was a “great time to add ETH.” However, this optimism failed to reverse the negative trend, as Ethereum remains under pressure. As of now, ETH is trading around $2,650, largely flat over the past 24 hours and roughly 45% below its all-time high from November 2021. In contrast, Bitcoin has significantly outperformed Ethereum in 2024, soaring over 100%, while ETH has managed only a 3.5% gain. This disparity has widened Bitcoin’s market capitalization to six times Ethereum’s, a level not seen since 2020. Ethereum’s struggles amid a recovering crypto market raise concerns over its fundamentals, regulatory uncertainty, and macroeconomic conditions. While the record short positions could lead to further downside, they also increase the chances of a short squeeze if positive developments emerge, potentially triggering a sharp rebound. “This extreme positioning means big swings like the one on February 3rd will be more common. Since the start of 2024, Bitcoin is up ~12 TIMES as much as Ethereum. Is a short squeeze set to close this gap?” Ether Withdrawals from Derivatives Exchanges Hit Highest Level Since August 2023 As reported, the amount of Ether withdrawn from crypto derivatives exchanges has surged to its highest level since August 2023, a development analysts interpret as a bullish sign for ETH’s price. On February 6, Ether’s net outflows from derivatives exchanges reached 300,000 ETH, valued at approximately $817.2 million, with ETH trading at $2,724 at the time. The movement suggests reduced selling pressure as traders close leveraged positions and move assets to cold storage. Last month, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin announced significant leadership changes at the Ethereum Foundation, aiming to prioritize technical expertise and strengthen collaboration with developers in the ecosystem. The announcement, made on January 18 via an X post, outlined a vision to support decentralized application developers while upholding Ethereum’s core principles of decentralization, censorship resistance, and privacy. Buterin emphasized that the Ethereum Foundation will avoid political lobbying or ideological shifts, maintaining its decentralized ethos. The leadership shift follows a challenging year in 2024, during which the Foundation faced criticism over its spending practices, roadmap execution, and personnel policies.

Here’s What It Means,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-xrp-is-in-disbelief-phase-heres-what-it-means/,"CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020), a prominent crypto analyst on X, recently posted an image of the well-known market psychology cycle and suggested that XRP is currently in the “disbelief” phase. XRP recently experienced a notable decrease , and this phase typically follows a market downturn. However, it also precedes a significant bullish trend. CryptoBull’s post generated reactions from XRP investors, ranging from strong optimism to skepticism. Some community members agreed with the assessment, believing that the recent price movements are just the beginning of a much larger rally. However, others expressed frustration, arguing that the market has already peaked and those expecting further gains may be overly hopeful. With all the negativity and recent crash I would say #XRP is in the disbelief phase, which means we have to go so much higher. What are your thoughts? pic.twitter.com/vVzwV14ofg — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) February 8, 2025 Disagreement Over XRP’s Position in the Cycle One of the strongest points of discussion in the comments was whether XRP is truly in the “disbelief” phase or if the market is closer to the final stages of the cycle, such as “anger” or “capitulation.” One user shared his frustration over XRP’s ongoing legal battles, stating , “Been stuck in the anger category for the last four years of this lawsuit. Can’t wait for it to be over.” While many are worried about the lawsuit, some experts suggest the digital asset will reach a new all-time high irrespective of the lawsuit’s outcome . Another user countered the idea that XRP is in the early stages of a new bull run, suggesting instead that the recent surge to $3.39 marked the peak. He stated that XRP is currently in the anger phase, and added , “We thought we were at the start, but reality is we missed it all.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 On the other hand, some investors remain highly bullish on XRP’s long-term potential. One commenter stated , “Any price below $10 is a huge buying opportunity,” reinforcing the belief that XRP remains undervalued despite its recent price movements. Another commenter emphasized that emotions should not dictate investment decisions, writing , “This tech is the future. Either understand that or keep studying, but our emotions are 100% irrelevant.” The Path Forward for XRP The current discussion surrounding XRP highlights a fundamental divide in investor sentiment. While some believe the cryptocurrency is in a prime accumulation phase, others fear that the best opportunities have already passed. However, recent data shows that many large investors are optimistic, as wallets holding over 1 million tokens recently saw a notable increase , pushing XRP accumulation rates above Bitcoin and Ethereum. In financial markets, psychological cycles often play a significant role in shaping investor behavior. If XRP is indeed in the “disbelief” phase, historical patterns suggest a strong uptrend could follow. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

A potential scam token appeared after a promotion from the profile of the President of the Central African Republic, Faustin-Archange Touadéra. The account of Faustin-Archange Touadéra, President of the Central African Republic, pointed to a new X handle for an allegedly official token representing the country. Just hours after the announcement, however, the CAR meme token account was suspended. The new token was even mentioned in a video, where Touadéra made an appearance, but raised suspicions of being AI-generated. To make matters worse, the token received an almost immediate verification from the Jupiter DEX aggregator. Jupiter is investigating the CAR meme token The founder of Jupiter, known as @weremeow, explained that the DEX aggregator wanted to verify the on-chain data of the token first. This is done to avoid copycat tokens, the first level of safety when launching new memes. Jupiter DEX also contacted the team to verify the originating wallet and make sure the mint is tied to the correct asset. The team has not yet given any proof of being part of the Central African Republic’s government or having any official capacity to create a token. ok, looks like we are in touch with the team who deployed the coin and we are able to verify by doing a number of onchain txns live. this includes: – getting them to redo the initially cancellable contract – tracking the key deployer txns from mint to lock – sending them to burn… https://t.co/s01OVymMeE — meow (🐱, 🐐) (@weremeow) February 10, 2025 With the intervention of Jupiter, the team made changes to its tokenization approach, improving some of the project’s parameters. Meme tokens are extremely resilient, and will not freeze trading while waiting for clarity. What is known about the team is they registered a domain name on Namecheap on February 6, after which the platform suspended the domain twice due to reports of fraud. The token itself launched at 1 AM Central African time, an unusual approach. Choosing Pump.fun was also a red flag as a source of initial liquidity. For now, Jupiter negotiated with the team to lock some of the tokens, though a cliff unlock is coming on May 9 for the portion allocated to public distribution. Another contract locks more of the tokens until March 9. The project will set aside some CAR tokens for charity, with another 332.5M CAR for country development. The still anonymous team of the token initially launched a different set of lockup contracts, which were considered incorrect and did not lock a sufficient amount of tokens. After the correction, the CAR token is still closely scrutinized, while traders buy it at their own risk. CAR token remains risky and volatile The asset itself was created through Pump.fun and completed its bonding curve on February 9, raising 85 SOL. The first DEX pair for the CAR token was live for less than 10 hours, but during that time, the asset rallied from $0.001 to a peak at $0.70, later erasing its gains to $0.25. The CAR token went for a fast rally, allowing early snipers and traders to lock in gains of up to $2.5M. | Source: DEXScreener The token’s rally was fast, but the top sniper realized over $497K in profits after selling all of the 53.9M CAR. What is more curious, this sniper made outsized gains, while all others coming later locked in a few hundred dollars. The timing and rapid profit turnover made some doubt that the sniper may be aware of the team’s intentions, or be an insider. Previously, that same insider traded SUNFLOWER and CRIME, among other meme tokens. Beyond snipers, active traders of CAR realized even higher profits of up to $2.5M for the top wallets. Other early buyers sit on unrealized gains of up to $6.6M , though harder to liquidate as the DEX pair contains $3M in locked SOL. Overall, early traders and snipers have liquidated up to $12M from the market, and are sitting on $50M in unrealized gains. While CAR continues to trade and is so far not considered a scam, the early traders or possibly insiders still managed to drain more liquidity from the market. Even with the new set of lockup tokens, CAR remains risky. The team reportedly still controls $17M in unlocked tokens, and can potentially extract more value from the market. Whale buying and selling continued, despite more warnings and red flags being raised for the token. Even whales and larger traders joined the market with the idea to flip the asset. The main CAR liquidity pool also diminished from around $3M down to $2.8M in less than an hour, signaling the token may become even more volatile and crash to a lower range.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. The crypto market’s accumulation phase is setting the stage for major altcoin rebounds, with Wall Street Pepe, Solaxy, and Pepeto emerging as top contenders. Table of Contents The rising stars: Wall Street Pepe, Solaxy and Pepeto Wall Street Pepe: A meme coin for traders Solaxy: Enriching Solana’s future Pepeto: Promising contender in meme coins How high can Pepeto go? Conclusion The crypto market is in a crucial accumulation phase, creating the ideal setup for major altcoin rebounds and explosive pre-sale opportunities. With every market correction, strong projects emerge, especially with increasing institutional adoption and growing political backing, such as Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance. As the next bull run gears up, the question is: which projects will dominate the next rebound? The rising stars: Wall Street Pepe, Solaxy and Pepeto As investors hunt for the most promising pre-sale projects, Wall Street Pepe (WSP), Solaxy (SOLX), and Pepeto (PEPETO) are capturing attention. Wall Street Pepe: A meme coin for traders Wall Street Pepe (WSP) is rapidly gaining traction in the trading community. Designed to unite retail investors into a powerful collective, the project offers market signals, trading calls, and community-driven strategies to maximize returns. With its price already climbing to $0.0003665, WSP has proven its potential, backed by an 18% staking rewards model that keeps engagement high. Solaxy: Enriching Solana’s future Solaxy (SOLX) aims to solve critical issues in the Solana ecosystem, offering unmatched scalability and an optimized blockchain experience. Currently trading at $0.001626, Solaxy’s mission is clear, enhancing Solana’s performance with cutting-edge technology. It will be exciting to see how Solaxy reshapes the blockchain landscape. Pepeto: Promising contender in meme coins While Wall Street Pepe and Solaxy present promising opportunities, Pepeto is in an entirely different league. As the “God of Frogs,” PEPETO is redefining meme coins, integrating advanced blockchain utilities while maintaining a strong, viral appeal. Key features setting Pepeto apart: 387% APY staking rewards – One of the highest in the meme coin space. PepetoSwap – A zero-fee decentralized exchange built for seamless meme coin trading. PepetoBridge – Industry-leading 30-second cross-chain transactions, changing blockchain interoperability. Massive community – Over 65,000+ members, solidifying its grassroots strength. Strong investor confidence – With over $4.1 million raised in its presale, demand is soaring. How high can Pepeto go? According to Techopedia’s latest Pepeto price forecast, the project has a high potential for exponential growth. With its low current presale price, rapidly expanding ecosystem, and high-profile endorsements, including Trump’s crypto stance and Elon Musk’s frog-themed memes, Pepeto is positioned to perform well in the next bull run. Conclusion While Wall Street Pepe has potential listings on BingX, Gate.io, and MEXC, Pepeto is playing in a different arena. Its superior utility, lower entry price, and growing speculation of a Binance listing give it an edge. To learn more about Pepeto, visit the website , X , Telegram , Instagram , and YouTube.

On the other hand, Bitcoin advocates argued that advancements in mining efficiency and energy use will ensure Bitcoin’s sustainability. Meanwhile, the crypto market briefly dipped after Trump’s announcement of new tariffs but quickly rebounded. As a result, analysts are divided on Bitcoin’s future, with some predicting a surge to $700,000 due to liquidity injections, while others expect a correction. Ethereum’s Ultra Sound Money Narrative Gains Strength Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake started a fresh debate between Ethereum and Bitcoin communities after arguing that Ethereum will soon become “ultra sound” money while Bitcoin faces long-term sustainability risks. In a post on X, Drake stated that for Ethereum to regain its “ultra sound” status, either its issuance has to decrease or the amount burned must increase, and he believes both will happen. Ethereum became deflationary after the Merge in 2022, but the trend reversed in April of 2024 after the Dencun upgrade that reduced fees for layer-2 networks and the overall amount burned. After comparing Ethereum’s issuance with Bitcoin’s, Drake pointed out that Bitcoin added 657,000 BTC to supply since the Dencun upgrade, while Ethereum added only about 469,000 ETH. At current prices, the Bitcoin supply increase is worth approximately $63.4 billion, whereas the Ethereum issuance adds up to just $1.23 billion. This means Bitcoin’s supply growth rate of 0.83% per year is 66% faster than Ethereum’s. (Source: X ) Drake placed a lot of emphasis on the fact that Bitcoin’s fixed supply cap of 21 million could lead to long-term security risks, as miners predominantly rely on block rewards for revenue. In fact, 99% of earnings over the past week came from block subsidies, with only 1% derived from transaction fees. He warned that this model could leave Bitcoin vulnerable to security threats, as the cost of a 51% attack, which is estimated at $10 billion and requiring 10 gigawatts of power, could be relatively affordable for nation-states. Ethereum educator Anthony Sassanois is also concerned about this, and criticized Bitcoiners for failing to recognize what he called an “obvious catastrophe” in the making. Bitcoin advocates, however, pushed back against Drake’s opinions. Analyst James Check argued that critics did not consider crucial factors like advancements in energy technology, improvements in mining efficiency, and the economic incentives that drive Bitcoin’s sustainability. He compared Bitcoin’s future transaction fees to the cost institutions pay for secure gold storage, and suggested that as Bitcoin adoption grows, fees will naturally sustain network security. Check also touched on the role of ASIC mining hardware, and mentioned that when miners go bankrupt and sell their rigs at lower prices, new entrants benefit, ensuring the network remains competitive. He also argued that energy developments, particularly in nuclear power and wasted energy utilization, will greatly reduce mining costs. Bitcoin mining can help stabilize energy grids by providing demand response, potentially lowering maintenance expenses for grid operators. Some energy providers might even find it beneficial to mine Bitcoin at a loss to offset infrastructure costs. He dismissed Drake’s claim that buying the necessary power for a 51% attack is relatively easy, and called it an “unserious” assertion that overlooks the complexity of energy markets and infrastructure constraints. Drake acknowledged that Ethereum is not without its own challenges. He shared that excessive staking could reduce ETH’s effectiveness as “pristine” collateral, and systemic risks exist within liquid staking platforms like Lido. To address these concerns, he proposed the “Croissant Issuance” model, which will implement a declining supply issuance mechanism. Under this model, issuance will drop to zero once 50% of ETH is staked, with a peak issuance rate capped at 1% per year to allow the market to find equilibrium. (Source: X) While Ethereum supporters firmly believe in its adaptive economic model and deflationary tendencies, Bitcoin advocates are also still very confident that advancements in technology and incentives will ensure its sustainability well into the future. Bitcoin and Ethereum Bounce Back After Market Dip The crypto market recently experienced a temporary decline after an announcement from US President Donald Trump about new tariffs on aluminum and steel, which only escalated the ongoing trade tensions. According to a report by the Associated Press on Feb. 9, Trump declared that all steel and aluminum imports into the United States will be subjected to a 25% tariff. He also stated that the US will implement reciprocal tariffs against countries imposing high import fees on American goods, and argued that the current trade balance was unsustainable. The announcement triggered a quick reaction and swift declines in the crypto markets. Bitcoin briefly dipped to $94,000 before recovering and climbing back above $97,000, according to CoinMarketCap. Ethereum followed a similar trajectory after falling to $2,537. The overall cryptocurrency market cap fell from $3.15 trillion to $3.10 trillion but was able to regain its ground. Bitcoins price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) According to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , market sentiment stayed in fear territory over the past week at an average score of 44 out of 100. The latest update on Feb. 10 recorded a slight decline to 43, down from 46 the previous day. The uncertainty surrounding US trade policies and their potential impact on global financial markets seems to be contributing to more cautious investor sentiment. Crypto fear and greed index (Source: Binance ) Trump also recently indicated plans to introduce additional tariffs on various sectors, including the European Union, superconductors, oil, gas, steel, and copper. Earlier in the month, he imposed 25% tariffs on major US trading partners Canada and Mexico, along with a 10% tariff on Chinese imports. These actions led to sharp declines in both stock and crypto markets. Estimates suggest that liquidations during this period may have reached as high as $8 billion to $10 billion, according to Bybit co-founder and CEO Ben Zhou. The crypto market rebounded after the planned tariffs on Mexico and Canada were temporarily suspended for 30 days on Feb. 3. However, Trump has not ruled out reinstating these tariffs once the pause period expires. Liquidity Injection Could Boost BTC to $700K Despite the hesitation in the market about crypto’s next move, some analysts are still extremely optimistic. Bitcoin is set to reach an unprecedented $700,000 this cycle due to a massive liquidity injection, according to Bill Barhydt , founder and CEO of crypto asset manager Abra. In a series of X posts on Feb. 8, Barhydt predicted that a surge in liquidity, driven by the new US administration under President Donald Trump, will propel Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to record highs. He described this upcoming market phase as “ cyclical Valhalla ,” and expects it to begin in the first quarter of the year. Barhydt’s base case scenario puts Bitcoin at $350,000, Ethereum at $8,000 and Solana at $900. He attributed this bullish outlook to the administration’s desire for lower interest rates, alongside an urgent need to refinance over $7 trillion in debt. Tax cuts and other economic measures could lead to an influx of liquidity, whether through quantitative easing or similar mechanisms, which will significantly benefit risk assets like cryptocurrencies. He also suggested that the high-end range for these predictions could see values nearly double. Not everyone shares this optimism. Arthur Hayes, former CEO of BitMEX, warned that the new administration will not be an immediate catalyst for continuous price growth. He believes that as the global market realizes that US politics have not changed dramatically, crypto prices could decline to late 2024 levels. Hayes predicted a Bitcoin correction to $70,000–$75,000 before any major upward movement.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-10 09:28:08

Notably, the stagnant price action of the token has left many market participants questioning, despite the positive market developments. Amid this, a top market expert, citing historical trends, predicted a potential pullback in Ripple’s native crypto to $1.4. XRP Price Risks Falling To $1.4 XRP price has remained stagnant over the past few days, raising market concerns. Despite a flurry of positive developments, including XRP ETF gaining traction , the token has struggled to gain momentum, reflecting a cautious stance of the investors. Amid this, a top market expert believes Ripple’s native crypto could see a significant correction based on past price movements. In a recent X post, EGRAG CRYPTO highlighted that in July 2023, XRP surged 230% , followed by two major corrections of 54.65% and 59.73%. Applying the same pattern to the current price cycle, he suggests that a 54.65% drop could push Ripple’s native crypto to $1.54 . Simultaneously, if the crash worsens to the 59.73% decline, it could send the price to $1.37. Meanwhile, the expert noted that these levels mirror past buying opportunities when XRP traded at $0.54 and $0.37. However, he urged investors to watch the price closely, suggesting these crashes might be “excellent buying opportunities.” In other words, despite the gloomy forecast, he deems the potential crash as a buy-the-dip opportunity for investors. Source: EGRAG CRYPTO, X Key Support Levels To Watch While EGRAG CRYPTO hints at a potential crash ahead, another expert has shared a bullish outlook highlighting key support levels for XRP price. In a recent X post, Dark Defender pointed to a crucial Fibonacci level of $2.4467 , suggesting that XRP might be nearing a reversal. According to him, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart indicates oversold conditions, meaning a rebound could be on the horizon. He also noted that $2.33 remains a strong support level for XRP. Source: Dark Defender, X What’s Next For XRP Price? XRP price lost 2% over the past day and traded at $2.43, while its one-day volume surged 40% to $5.49 billion. Notably, the token has touched a 24-hour high and low of $2.49 and $2.32. Besides, the current RSI of the token stood at 39, indicating that the crypto is nearing an oversold condition. XRP Price Chart However, despite that, experts remain bullish given the positive market developments. For instance, the XRP ETF possibilities gain traction with a flurry of players advancing their move to launch the investment instrument. Besides, recently a top lawyer hinted that XRP could be included in the US Strategic Reserve asset, once it hits the $5 mark. Adding to the discussions, several experts have shared bullish outlooks, predicting a potential XRP price surge ahead. Having said that, it appears that despite XRP being on the verge of facing a crash to $1.4, market sentiments remain bullish. Besides, the upcoming correction would also provide more flexibility for the investors to enter at a lower level.

Short Positions Broke a Record!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/wall-street-giants-have-lost-hope-on-this-altcoin-short-positions-broke-a-record/,"The change in customs duty rates initiated by US President Donald Trump has shaken cryptocurrencies to a great extent. While Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins experienced significant declines, the price of Ethereum (ETH) fell by approximately 37 percent in a short period of three days following Trump's tax statements. While the Ethereum price is still in a downtrend, ETH short positions have reached a new all-time high, increasing by 500% since last November. According to The Kobeissi Letter, short positions in Ethereum have reached a new all-time high, increasing by 40% in the past week and by 500% since last November. Wall Street Giants Expect Further Drops in Ethereum! This aggressive increase in short positions signals growing concerns about Ethereum’s near-term stability, with analysts noting that this increase is occurring because the ETH price has been experiencing strong selling pressure in recent weeks. Analysts say investors' Ethereum sentiment is extremely negative, and that short positions are caused by hedge funds. At this point, it was stated that hedge funds were betting heavily on the price of Ethereum to fall further and were aggressively opening short positions, while this increase could increase volatility in the price of ETH. Analysts also noted that historically this was the biggest bearish bet by Wall Street hedge funds on the world's largest altcoin. What is the Critical Level for ETH? As uncertainty about the Ethereum price grows, crypto analyst Ali Martinez said that $2,600 is a critical support level for ETH. The analyst argued that if the $2,600 level holds, Ethereum could gather enough momentum for a significant recovery, potentially sending the price to $3,000 or even $4,000. Another analyst said that such excessive shorting is a sign that Ethereum could be experiencing a major short squeeze. This would occur when short traders would be forced to close their positions and buy back ETH, sending prices sharply higher. With Ethereum currently struggling to cope with a strong downtrend, aggressive short positions are seen as a sign of further volatility. At this point, market analysts are generally warning that unless there is a positive development for Ethereum, ETH could face both market sentiment and technical challenges. *This is not investment advice.

Despite the constant delays, the project sees rising interest, with recent community gatherings in India, Nigeria, and China. What’s New? Instead of launching its long-awaited native token and open mainnet, Pi Network – the cryptocurrency project that claims to enable people to mine digital assets directly from their smartphones – continues to make different announcements. Several months ago, the team assured that the aforementioned milestones would occur once 15 million users pass the necessary Know-Your-Customer (KYC) verifications and successfully migrate to the mainnet. The deadline for that (known as the Grace Period) was set for January 31 but was later moved to February 28. “The KYC and Mainnet migration deadlines for the Grace Period have been extended to February 28, 2025, ensuring Pioneers have additional time and opportunity to secure their Pi,” the developers explained. Another reason behind the extension could be the issues that some users experience when trying to abide by the rules. To ease their efforts, Pi Network issued two key updates last week. The team stated that users with mismatched Pi accounts and KYC names typically face rejection due to ownership verification failure. However, they can appeal to resubmit their application or update their info, though this comes with a penalty of losing part of their Mobile Balance. It is worth mentioning that only those who had their KYC rejected for name mismatches and had a single denied appeal are eligible. Pi Network also allowed minor phone number corrections – up to two digits – to prevent misuse like account transfers or hacks. Meanwhile, the developers aim to launch the Open Network during the first three months of 2025. They said the development could occur before or after the Grace Period ends, urging users to submit their KYC applications and complete migration procedures as quickly as possible. The Growing Community Despite the surrounding controversy and uncertainty, Pi Network continues attracting new members to its community. Over the past several weeks, there has been a surge of gatherings in different countries, such as India and Nigeria. Most recently, the Chinese community also organized a similar event. According to Pi News , this happened in Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, where “a large number of goods were sold out on site using Pi payment.” Other Asian nations where the project is particularly popular are South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, and others. Wu Blockchain reported last year that Pi Network’s users in South Korea surpassed 1.3 million, outpacing the local customer base of major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase.

The project’s goal is to create a decentralized ecosystem that rewards early participation through generous referral incentives and lucrative staking programs. Every referral and stake contributes to a self-sustaining cycle of growth, reinforcing network strength and pushing value higher over time. A key aspect of APC’s strategy is its deflationary mechanism, where unsold tokens are burned at each presale phase. This systematic token burn not only reduces the overall supply but also drives scarcity, which in turn increases the token’s value.

The vision behind APC is both bold and inspiring. It is not just another digital asset; it is a comprehensive ecosystem built on cutting-edge blockchain technology and a community-first approach. The project’s innovative referral system rewards loyal supporters, while its dynamic staking programs offer substantial incentives for early adopters.

At the current stage in Frostburg, APC is available at an astonishingly low price of $0.000054, a figure that has enabled the project to raise over $1 million in under a month. APC’s presale is structured in multiple phases, with each phase featuring a token burn mechanism that permanently eliminates unsold tokens, thereby increasing scarcity and driving the token’s value upward. Market experts are abuzz, noting that a $100 investment today would secure 1,853,703.00 APC tokens, which could eventually grow to an estimated $14,829.62 upon listing. These presale highlights vividly demonstrate why APC is heralded as one of the Top Meme Coin Presales to Buy Now .

China has now imposed 15% tariffs on nearly $14 billion of US exports, hitting key sectors like energy, vehicles, and agricultural equipment and further fueling the trade war. This can be better termed as retaliatory tariff, as in response to President Donald Trump imposing a 10% tariff on Chinese goods. The tariffs to take effect cover liquefied natural gas (LNG), coal, crude oil, and certain vehicles. These measures promise extensive effects on bilateral trade and global markets as investors prepare for increased volatility.

In a February 9 X post , Vought announced the suspension of funding from the Federal Reserve and directed CFPB staff to cease all activities, including investigations, rule-making, and public comments. Funding Halt and Operational Shutdown Vought stated that the CFPB’s current balance of $711.6 million was “excessive in the current fiscal environment,” justifying the decision to reject further funding from the Federal Reserve. “The Bureau’s current balance is more than enough to cover its duties,” he said, labeling the move necessary for budgetary restraint. Established in response to the 2008 financial crisis, the CFPB was designed to protect consumers from abusive practices by financial institutions, including banks and money transfer firms. The agency also handles complaints about U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges. However, Vought’s internal memo instructed CFPB staff to halt all supervision, examination, and investigation activities. Politico reported that staff were told to suspend issuing new rules and guidance while working remotely due to the office’s temporary closure. Controversy and Industry Response The CFPB has faced criticism from the crypto industry and financial oversight advocates alike. In 2023, the agency proposed supervising crypto wallet providers, but it withdrew the idea following industry pressure. Despite this, tech trade groups sued the CFPB last month, alleging the agency had overstepped its legal authority. Vought, who also serves as Director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, played a key role in Project 2025—a conservative initiative aimed at restructuring the U.S. government to give the president greater control. His appointment to the CFPB on February 7 replaced Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent . Dennis Kelleher, co-founder of financial advocacy group Better Markets, condemned the move, accusing Trump of endangering Americans by weakening financial protections. “This is throwing Trump’s own supporters to the financial wolves,” Kelleher said. “It’s a slap in the face to the multi-racial working-class coalition that helped elect him.” The CFPB’s unique funding mechanism, which bypasses congressional appropriations, has long been a target of criticism. Vought described turning off this funding “spigot” as a necessary step to increase accountability.

Most altcoins have had mixed performances over the past day, with BNB retracing hard while SUI is heading north. Litecoin has stolen the show. BTC Defends $95K Slip Last Monday morning was an all-out massacre in the cryptocurrency space following US President Trump’s tariffs against three countries. BTC, which had already dumped from $106,000 to under $100,000 during the weekend, slumped within hours to just over $91,000 to mark a multi-week low. The cryptocurrency bounced off hard, which was somewhat surprising, the skyrocketed to over $102,000 later that day, thus making another ten-grand move within hours. However, it failed to remain in the six-digit price territory and retraced to $96,000 almost immediately. Another attempt to overcome that $100,000 mark was halted on Friday, and BTC was pushed south to a familiar ground – $96,000. The weekend was calmer, but bitcoin dropped once again on Monday morning. This time, though, its losses were stopped at $95,000, and BTC even jumped to $98,000 but couldn’t breach it. As of now, bitcoin trades with a minor daily increase, which has pushed its market cap to over $1.930 trillion on CG. Its dominance over the alts stands strong at 58.5%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView LTC Pumps Binance Coin was the Sunday star of the cryptocurrency market, but its ascent was stopped, and the asset is now down by 5% to just over $600. The other larger-cap alts in the red today include ETH, XRP, DOGE, and XLM. In contrast, SUI has gained over 3% in the past day and sits at $3.2. SOL, TRX, LINK, AVAX, and ADA are also with minor gains. Litecoin has stolen the show today with a 10.5% surge that has pushed it toward $120. APT, TAO, and OM follow suit.

The cryptocurrency surged to $290 in January before retreating to $200 in early February. Despite the pullback, SOL remains within an ascending triangle pattern, a bullish indicator suggesting further gains. If this trend holds, the next target could be $565, contingent on strong market momentum and sustained buyer interest. Can Ascending Triangle Breakout Push Solana Price to $565? Solana price has been forming ascending triangles before each breakout, with Fibonacci 2.618 acting as a key target. Historical trends suggest that every breakout reaches this level before consolidating. The current pattern indicates that the ongoing ascending triangle is more than halfway complete, signaling a potential breakout. Technical analysis points to a possible surge, with the next target projected at $565. Previous instances have followed a similar structure, consistently hitting Fibonacci 2.618 before retracing. If the trend persists, Solana could see another rally, with traders closely watching the breakout confirmation. Analyst Predicts $245 Short-Term Surge in SOL Price Crypto analyst Ali has highlighted a key market trend that could impact Solana’s price movement in the short term. According to a recent liquidation heatmap, a surge in Solana to $245 may trigger a major shift in market positioning, with billions in short positions at stake. The analysis suggests that a break above the $245 price level could lead to widespread liquidations, forcing short sellers to cover their positions. This scenario could create further momentum for Solana, increasing its price in response to forced buy orders. Will Solana Price Hold Above $200 Support Level? As of Monday, February 10, the SOL price hovered around $205, reflecting a 2% gain during the U.S. trading session. The top altcoin has been attempting to regain momentum after recent crypto market fluctuations, with key resistance and support levels coming into focus. Solana price prediction faces resistance at $220, with a stronger hurdle at $250. If bullish momentum strengthens, the price may attempt a breakout toward the $300 psychological level. On the downside, immediate support rests at $190, and failure to hold could open the path for a deeper correction. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a slight bullish crossover. The blue MACD line is moving above the signal line. This suggests growing buying pressure, though the momentum remains moderate. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 56, hovering above the neutral 50 mark. Solana Price Chart: TradingView To sum up, the Solana price remains within an ascending triangle, signaling a possible breakout. A strong push above key resistance levels could fuel a rally toward $565.

While BTC and altcoins continue to struggle with the decline, the long-term rise expectation also continues. At this point, Abra Global CEO Bill Barhydt shared his price predictions for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL) and SUI in his latest analysis. Stating that Bitcoin and altcoins will reach a new peak this year, Bill Barhydt said that he expects Bitcoin to rise to $350,000 in the base scenario. The famous CEO predicted that, apart from Bitcoin, Ethereum could potentially reach $8,000, Solana could reach $900, and Sui could reach $25. The famous CEO added that the upper limit is twice these estimates, and added that in this scenario, Bitcoin could rise to $700,000 and Ethereum could rise to $16,000. Basing his analysis on expected changes in U.S. monetary policy, particularly lower interest rates that he believes will inject more cash into the economy, the famed CEO argued that the U.S. government’s approach to managing its national debt would likely increase liquidity through quantitative easing. Barhydt said he believes lower interest rates will make borrowing more attractive and encourage investment in assets such as Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. “My base case scenario for the current crypto cycle is: Bitcoin – $350,000 Ethereum – $8,000 Solana – $900 Sui – $25 The upper end of the range is approximately 2 times these values. My model is simple. This administration wants interest rates much lower, and they will do whatever it takes to get there. They also need to refinance over $7 trillion in debt. Tax cuts are coming. Whatever way this all happens, there will be a huge liquidity injection. Cyclic Valhalla is coming.” *This is not investment advice.

In a post on X, Aljarrah stated: “If you haven’t figured out that Gold and XRP are the two most critical pillars of the new monetary system, then you don’t know a damn thing about what’s coming.” This bold assertion has sparked discussion among crypto investors and enthusiasts. Many within the XRP community have long speculated about its eventual widespread adoption and integration into global financial systems . However, frustration is evident among long-term holders, with one commenter remarking , “Most of us are getting impatient after holding for all these years.” XRP broke out of a multi-year consolidation in late November, culminating in a multi-year high of $3.39 in mid-January. Things took a turn when tariff threats made by the Trump administration pushed the entire market down , sending XRP below $3 and shaking the confidence of some investors who were excited about the digital asset’s future. However, others believe political and economic shifts are paving the way for significant financial restructuring. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Role in a Digital Financial System XRP has been at the center of discussions regarding cross-border payments, liquidity solutions, and financial interoperability. As a digital asset powered by the XRP Ledger (XRPL), it is designed for fast and low-cost transactions, making it appealing to financial institutions and banks. Some proponents argue that XRP and other digital ledger technology (DLT) assets, will enable the rapid movement of commodities like gold and silver across financial networks, creating a bridge between traditional financial markets and emerging digital economies. XRP and XLM have been pushed as the leaders of the financial revolution and the backbone of a new two-tier monetary system with XRP leading the charge. Alongside XRP, gold remains a trusted store of value, particularly in times of economic uncertainty. Some investors are hedging their bets by accumulating both assets. A community member expressed confidence in this strategy, revealing that he recently purchased more gold and XRP. As central banks and governments move toward asset-backed digital currencies, XRP, and gold will have critical roles in ensuring financial stability.

According to a recent update on Ripple’s official handle, this collaboration marks Ripple’s inaugural venture into Portugal, further expanding its European presence and strengthening financial connectivity between the two nations. Instant Crypto Payments via Ripple Pay By integrating Ripple Pay, Unicâmbio’s corporate clients can transfer funds instantly between Portugal and Brazil. This eliminates the traditional bottlenecks associated with cross-border payments, such as long settlement times, high fees, and reliance on outdated financial infrastructure. Planting the Ripple flag in Portugal today with Unicâmbio, our first Portuguese client and the country’s leading currency exchange provider! Using Ripple Payments, their corporate customers can now move funds near instantly between & . https://t.co/ruOdZnHtAT — Ripple (@Ripple) February 10, 2025 Thanks to strong economic and cultural ties between Portugal and Brazil, this partnership will simplify and reduce the cost of financial transactions between the two countries, making it easier and more affordable for individuals and businesses to send and receive money. Adriana Jerónimo, Executive Board Member at Unicâmbio, emphasized the transformative potential of this partnership: “By leveraging blockchain technology, we’re transforming money movement between the two nations. Ripple’s crypto-enabled payments solution enables near-instant settlement and drastically reduces costs compared to traditional payment channels, delivering real value to our customers.” Ripple’s European Expansion Strategy This partnership is a significant step in Ripple’s European expansion strategy, reinforcing its position as a leader in blockchain-based cross-border payments. Cassie Craddock, Managing Director for the UK and Europe at Ripple, highlighted the importance of this development: “Our partnership with Unicâmbio is a significant milestone in Ripple’s European expansion. Portugal has developed a thriving crypto ecosystem, so we are delighted to open our payment solution to partners there.” Portugal’s crypto-friendly regulatory environment makes it an ideal market for Ripple’s continued growth. This move is expected to accelerate the adoption of crypto payments and blockchain technology in the European financial sector. Building on Existing Success in Brazil Ripple’s collaboration with Unicâmbio builds upon its established presence in Brazil, where it has partnered with Travelex Bank and Mercado Bitcoin: In October 2024, Ripple and Mercado Bitcoin launched a crypto-enabled cross-border payments solution in Brazil. This was initially focused on internal treasury operations between Brazil and Portugal, with plans to expand to corporate and retail customers. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Travelex Bank, the first Brazilian bank licensed by the Central Bank of Brazil to operate in foreign exchange, partnered with Ripple to launch On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), with XRP being used to settle cross-border payments instantly. These developments highlight Ripple’s dominance in Latin America and its growing role in facilitating crypto-driven financial solutions. Implications for Ripple and XRP Ripple’s expansion into Portugal and its strengthening position in Brazil have major implications for Ripple and XRP: Increased Utility for XRP – Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution, which uses XRP as a bridge currency, could see wider adoption as more financial institutions leverage Ripple Pay. If Unicâmbio integrates ODL, XRP’s liquidity and demand could rise significantly. Institutional Adoption – This move reinforces XRP’s potential role in institutional finance. More banks and fintech companies are seeking alternatives to SWIFT, and Ripple’s fast, low-cost payment system provides a compelling option. Potential Price Impact on XRP—While Ripple’s success doesn’t always correlate directly with its price, increased adoption of Ripple Pay and ODL could drive long-term demand for XRP. Historically, major partnerships and regulatory clarity have boosted XRP’s market sentiment. Regulatory Strength—Ripple’s continued expansion of global partnerships strengthens the argument for classifying XRP as a utility token rather than a security. The more jurisdictions that accept Ripple’s technology, the more regulatory legitimacy XRP gains. Ripple’s partnership with Unicâmbio is a major step forward in enabling instant crypto payments between Brazil and Portugal via Ripple Pay. As Ripple expands its European footprint, XRP’s utility could increase, driving more institutional adoption and liquidity. With its growing influence in Latin America and Europe, Ripple reinforces its position as a leader in blockchain-powered payments. XRP could play an even bigger role in the global financial system.

What Will It Affect Bitcoin (BTC)? Here Are the Expectations and What You Need to Know!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/fed-chairman-jerome-powell-will-speak-for-two-days-in-a-row-what-will-it-affect-bitcoin-btc-here-are-the-expectations-and-what-you-need-to-know/,"As Bitcoin and altcoins continue to struggle with declines, another critical week has begun, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell will present on six-month monetary policy to the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, February 11 and Wednesday, February 12. Apart from Powell's critical statements, January CPI data will be released in the US on Wednesday, February 12, and PPI data will be released on Thursday, February 13. On that point, Fed Chair Powell will testify before the Senate Banking Committee at 10:00 AM EST on Tuesday and before the House Financial Services panel the following day. What Is Powell Expected to Say? As expectations rise that Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech could trigger a change of direction in Bitcoin, potentially sending it revisiting $100,000 and ending its six-day consolidation, it’s also interesting to see what Powell will say. Analysts predicted that the Bitcoin price is unlikely to reach $100,000 due to Powell's speech and many other reasons. Market analysts expect the Fed chairman to likely state that the economy is resilient, emphasizing the Fed's dual mandate of maintaining price stability and ensuring maximum employment. Powell is also expected to state that they will continue their data-driven approach to reducing inflation. At this point, analysts think that Powell's speech will not have a major impact on the price of BTC, apart from short-term volatility in Bitcoin. Speaking to Bloomberg, SGH Macro Advisors chief economist Tim Duy said Fed members agreed that interest rates would not be cut until the second half of 2025, but the outlook for interest rates could change quickly if January employment data comes in below expectations. Stating that weaker employment data will bring interest rate cuts back to the agenda, Duy said that this situation could bring an increase for risky assets such as Bitcoin. Will the FED Chairman's Statements Bring a Rise in Bitcoin? Bloomberg economists also explained what is needed for an increase in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices after Powell's statements. “Chairman Powell said the Fed would need to see real progress in inflation or some weakness in the labor market before it would consider cutting interest rates. “If Powell acknowledges progress in his testimony tomorrow and the day after, and hints at a rate cut before June 2025, then that could trigger risk-taking behavior and push Bitcoin prices even higher.” *This is not investment advice.

Because of this, you have the chance to buy Solana (SOL) at a lower price. Dogecoin (DOGE) is also trading lower than usual. This is yet another great buying opportunity. However, the coin at its lowest right now is FXGuys ($FXG). That’s because this new crypto trading platform is still conducting a presale for its native token. This means that you can buy the $FXG token before it blows up after its launch. Continue reading for more details on these three undervalued altcoins! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE The SOL Price is Down Amid a Market Dip Market dips usually give us great buying opportunities. However, you need to know which coins to buy in this case. And one such coin is Solana. Solana has made massive moves in the past few months. Namely, Solana became the go-to memecoin trading platform. Also, Solana is people’s favorite network for transactions due to its low fees and fast speeds. Because of this, SOL has become a huge market player. So, when a dip comes, investors are always keen on buying more SOL. Right now, as the entire market dips, SOL is ripe for the picking. SOL’s price is down over 11% in one week, currently at $198. Buying SOL at these levels can bring you massive returns soon. That’s because Solana still has a long way to go in terms of growth. Memecoin trading isn’t stopping, and Solana will continue to be the most popular solution for this. Also, the Solana community is very active, which will bring more interest. Because of this, experts see the current Solana price dip as a small bump in the road. They expect SOL to get out of this dip soon. They also believe that the SOL price will reach $350 this year. So, buying SOL tokens now will help you make over 70% in returns. Elon Musk Might Help the DOGE Price Rise Soon Elon Musk has been closely related to Dogecoin from the start. Namely, he has helped the Dogecoin price go to new highs a few times. Also, whenever he mentions Dogecoin, the DOGE price starts rising. However, Elon Musk is expected to do much more than just mention Dogecoin soon! Namely, Elon Musk recently introduced X Payments. It’s speculated that he will add DOGE as a currency on X Payments soon. This could boost the DOGE price to incredible highs. That’s because millions of people will use DOGE to buy subscriptions and other paid services on X. Because of this, experts see the current DOGE price dip as a great time to buy. Namely, right now, the DOGE price is down by over 17% on its weekly chart. This Dogecoin dip is largely because of a market-wide downturn. Thus, it presents a great chance to buy DOGE low. Experts foresee a massive rally for the meme coin when Elon Musk adds DOGE as a currency on X. They say that Dogecoin’s price could rise by 300% and more because of this development!

Notably, the meme coin announced by the Central African Republic President Archange Touadéra has crashed from a $0.79 to $0.19 price level as market watchers deem the token to be a rug pull due to unclear tokenomics and details on the project. Let’s delve deeper into the recent developments surrounding the newly launched token that rationalize why market watchers are cautious about this meme-themed asset. Here’s Why CAR Meme Coin Slumps 70% After Launch Notably, the CAR meme coin was unveiled by President Archange Touadéra in an X post on February 10. The President stated that the project is an experiment curated to show how ‘something as simple as a meme can’ drive growth and development in a peculiar way. Source: President Archange Touadéra, X The newly launched meme coin promptly gained significant traction in light of Touadéra being the second president in the world to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender. Further, CoinGape recently revealed that a crypto trader turned a mere $5K into a $12 million profit by betting on the coin within seconds of the President’s announcement. However, the hype was not long-lived, as the meme coin’s price soon crashed amid scam allegations and unclear details on the project. WuBlockchain posted on X that the token’s site is currently inaccessible. Also, CoinGape found that the same site, as revealed in the President’s post, is not accessible as of press time. This saga has presented market participants with severe uncertainty. Jupiter Fonder Sheds Light On The Matter In a series of X posts on February 10, Solana DEX Jupiter founder, popular as meow on X offered vital insights into the CAR meme coin saga. According to the posts, the founder tried to get in touch with the CAR office for additional info on the token. Notably, meow requested the President to change the token’s link on their homepage, as it linked to the Jupiter homepage, and instead wanted them to use the direct ‘token swap link.’ Moreover, the founder revealed that Jupiter also got in touch with the team who deployed the coin. Notably, Jupiter verified the deployment team by doing a number of ‘on-chain txns live.’ However, no off-chain confirmation regarding the project was made, with uncertainty prevailing. The uncertainty comes about whether this project is official from the CAR office, why Namecheap suspended it, and the ownership of the rest of the circulating supply. CAR Price Slumps 70% In the aftermath of the abovementioned developments, the CAR meme coin’s price crashed 75% intraday and is currently resting at $0.1961. The meme coin’s 24-hour low and high were $0.1925 and $0.7927, respectively. Traders and investors remain bearish on the asset amid unclear details on the project. Simultaneously, an official confirmation about the project off-chain could aid in a recovery ahead. The broader crypto market trend also remains bearish at the moment, an alarming cause for the meme coin’s price to take further heat. The uncertainties presented by this newly launched token underscores the dynamic and risky nature of cryptocurrencies.

As Solana and XRP struggle, XYZ surges, drawing attention to its sports-meme fusion and potential dominance in the 2025 bull run. Table of Contents XYZVerse presale showcases rising demand Solana sees downturn Ripple struggles Conclusion As Solana and XRP reach new lows, a lesser-known token, XYZ, is making headlines with a remarkable surge. Amid a general market decline, what is propelling XYZ’s impressive rise? Exploring the factors behind XYZ’s unexpected performance could reveal new opportunities and shifts occurring within the digital currency landscape. This stark contrast raises questions about XYZ’s potential and its impact on the future of digital assets. XYZVerse presale showcases rising demand XYZVerse has emerged as a one-of-a-kind project, combining the thrill of sports with the playful nature of meme coins. Designed for fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, XYZVerse introduces a fresh concept to the crypto space, uniting sports lovers and crypto enthusiasts in search for the next hidden gem. The unique concept developed by XYZVerse has already attracted much interest from the crypto community as 9 out of 15 stages have already been sold, showing strong momentum as the token approaches its Token Generation Event (TGE). The presale structure implies incremental price increases of the XYZ token. At stage 1 it was priced at $0.0001, and now at stage 10, XYZ costs $0.002. The tenth stage will be completed as soon as XYZVerse breaks another milestone of $7.5 million. Around 80% of this target has already been raised. Those who buy XYZ in earlier stages, get the opportunity to secure this asset at a bigger discount. XYZVerse’s roadmap is designed for steady growth. Key milestones include: TGE: Following the completion of the presale, XYZVerse will launch its XYZ tokens. Exchange listings: The project plans to list on major centralized (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX) shortly after the TGE. Community engagement initiatives: With fan-driven events and rewards, XYZVerse aims to foster a tight-knit and active community. Deflationary burn mechanism: Over time, 17.13% of the token supply will be burned. Sports partnerships: The project is actively exploring collaborations with sports organizations. XYZVerse has crafted its tokenomics with long-term growth and community value in mind. A capped supply of 100 billion tokens ensures scarcity as the project gains traction while 15% liquidity reserve enhances stability for trading and market operations. With five presale stages still to go, early-stage buyers have the chance to secure XYZ at competitive prices before it hits major exchanges. Solana sees downturn Solana (SOL) has seen significant price swings lately. In the past week, its price fell by 18.77%, landing within a current range of $182.37 to $234.56. This sharp decline points to short-term bearish pressure. Over the past month, the drop was less severe at 4.19%. Looking at a six-month timeframe, Solana has actually risen by 25.64%. This indicates that despite recent dips, the long-term trend remains positive. Technical indicators provide mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index is at 47.82, which is neutral. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $192.45, slightly below the 100-day average of $202.59, suggesting a potential downturn. However, if the price holds above the nearest support level at $161.36, it could rebound towards resistance at $265.74, an increase of up to 45%. Breaking past that could see it reach the second resistance at $317.93. Conversely, falling below support might lead to further declines toward $109.17. Ripple struggles XRP has seen significant changes in its price recently. Over the past week, the price fell by 26.44%. In the last month, it showed a slight increase of 1.36%. Looking at the past six months, XRP surged by 294%. Currently, the price ranges between $2.29 and $3.04. Technical indicators suggest mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index is at 38.95, which is approaching oversold territory. The stochastic value is 25.24, also indicating the asset may be oversold. The MACD level is -0.0266, pointing to bearish momentum. The 10-day simple moving average is $2.33, while the 100-day average is $2.48, showing a short-term downward trend. If XRP manages to break through the nearest resistance level at $3.50, it could aim for the second resistance at $4.25, representing an increase of about 40%. On the other hand, if the price dips below the nearest support at $2.00, it might test the second support at $1.25, which would be a drop of approximately 45%. The recent price movements suggest that traders should watch these key levels closely. Conclusion SOL and XRP’s decline has put the market in a gloomy state. However, XYZ’s blend of sports and memes fuels a 10x rally, positioning it as the potential lead player in the 2025 bull run. To learn more about XYZVerse, visit the website , Telegram , and X .

Franklin Bi, a general partner at Pantera Capital, noted that there had been a “huge shift” in interest in digital assets from endowments and foundations that just five years ago had reported “minimal participation” in crypto, the report said. Pantera Capital did not respond to CoinDesk's comment request. Bitcoin ( BTC ), the largest cryptocurrency, has soared to about $97,900 from around $7,000 in 2020. As its price has reached new heights thanks to the introduction of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the election of crypto-friendly U.S. President Donald Trump, institutions have started to fear missing out. Emory University, based in Georgia, in October disclosed it had millions worth of Grayscale's bitcoin ETF . The University of Austin announced in May it is raising a $5 million bitcoin fund to contribute to its $200 million endowment and the $4.8 billion Rockefeller Foundation is exploring whether or not to increase its exposure to crypto.

This retreat is likely because of the ongoing altcoin crash, and the ongoing open network launch jitters. Let’s explore some of the potential Pi Network rivals to buy as the odds of the mainnet launch in Q1 being slim. Best Pi Coin Rivals to Buy in Case of a Mainnet Delay There are many potential Pi coin rivals to buy if the developers decide to delay the mainnet. They recently delayed the grace period for the KYC verification to February 28 and insisted that the mainnet launch will happen in the first quarter. In December 2023, the developers had predicted that the launch would happen in 2024. Some of the top Pi Network rivals to buy are Bitcoin, Litecoin, Sui, and Tron. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin is a good Pi Network rival to buy because of its long history of doing well. It jumped from near zero to over $109,000 in about 16 years. With Bitcoin’s supply easing, and with demand from Wall Street rising, there is a likelihood that its price will more than double in the long term. Bitcoin has also formed a bullish flag pattern on the weekly chart, pointing to potential gains ahead. Bitcoin Price Chart Litecoin (LTC) Litecoin is another Pi coin rival to buy. LTC price has soared by over 130% from its lowest level in July last year. The main catalyst for the coin is that the odds of a spot LTC ETF have jumped, meaning that the SEC may go on with the launch. LTC is a Bitcoin hard fork, meaning that the SEC has no reason to deny the approval. A spot ETF may lead to more Litecoin demand, which will push its price from the current $117 to over $200. Sui (SUI) Sui price has surged by over 980% from its 2024 lows and is one of the best-performing layer-1 coins. It has also become a multi-billion dollar coin that has attracted many developers across multiple sectors like DeFi and gaming. Sui is a good Pi coin rival because it has become a bargain again. The chart below shows that its pullback saw it retest the 61.8% retracement point, signaling a potential rebound later this year. A retest of its all-time high would signal a 67% jump from the current level. Sui price chart Tron (TRX) Tron is another Pi coin rival to buy and hold. It has formed a falling wedge pattern on the daily chart, pointing to a 96% surge to its 2024 high of $0.4485. The token is also supported by strong fundamentals, including its strong market share in the stablecoin industry and the fact that Donald Trump has invested in it. More Pi Network Rivals to Buy The other popular Pi Network rivals to buy are Solana, Polkadot, Mina Protocol, Near, and Algorand. These tokens may continue thriving if the value of Pi coin falls after the mainnet launch.

A recent promise to levy a 25% tax on all steel and aluminium coming into the US may continue to have a dampening effect on the US stock market. Bitcoin (BTC) is still struggling to regain $100,000. Tariffs to see widening use Donald Trump’s trade war is spreading. Initially concentrated on Canada and Mexico, two countries bordering the US, and also on China, the President is now considering tariffs on Europe. He said that new tariffs could be imposed on Europe as early as Tuesday or Wednesday. While the tariffs could just be a way for Trump to be able to negotiate deals with other countries from a position of strength, they will have negative effects for US businesses and citizens. Car prices in the US could rise as much as an extra $3,000 according to TD Economics, quoted in a BBC article on the subject. If one looks back on tariffs imposed through history, it is generally the case that the tariffs neither benefit the countries they are levied against, nor the countries that are imposing them. Therefore, it might be expected that these tariff wars could just be short to medium term headwinds for the economies involved. However, if no agreements are reached, and the tariffs do continue into the longer term, this could have quite a depressing effect on the major world economies, leading to a real drag on the growth of these economies. Bitcoin in a local downtrend It’s in the midst of this particular macro-economic environment that Bitcoin is attempting to continue its current bull market. The $BTC price has been in a downtrend since the $109,000 all-time high was achieved on 20 January. A spike down to a local bottom of $91,000 has since occurred, and now it remains to be seen if this downtrend can be broken. $BTC higher high is needed Source: TradingView $BTC is currently battling the resistance at $97,000, with further resistances all the way through to $99,000. A descending wedge has formed on top of the bigger previous wedge, and breaking out here will be the number one priority of the bulls. The downtrend since the all-time high of $109,000 is still in force until the bulls can make a higher high, which would be above $100,200. Failure to achieve this would potentially just lead to another dip down to the descending trendline of the bottom of the wedge, or even the local low at $91,300. Bitcoin range-bound for the rest of February? Source: TradingView The daily chart for $BTC shows the $14,000 range that measures from $92,000 up to $106,000. The next two lows are on the chart at $100,200 and $102,500. Both of these would ideally need to be taken out for the bulls to then have another crack at the top of the range. This achievement might have to wait a while, as all the short-term Stochastic RSIs are currently moving towards the overbought position. That said, the weekly Stochastic RSI is coming down fast and should bottom over the next two to three weeks. This would take us into the beginning of March, and potential renewed upside price momentum. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The ANALOG token is going live on KuCoin, Bitget, MEXC and Gate.io in a move that will enhance exposure to one of the most executing blockchain interoperability projects around. Analog has generated a lot of excitement among Web3 enthusiasts due to its promise of enabling secure, trustless blockchain-to-blockchain communications at a time when the industry is becoming increasingly fragmented. Built using the Substrate SDK, its goal is to become nothing less than the centerpiece of blockchain interoperability, facilitating the network interactions that are a must-have for Web3’s broader adoption. It’s well known that the blockchain industry today is made up of numerous “walled gardens”, or isolated networks that struggle to talk to one another. This has resulted in fragmented user bases in the Web3 industry and a serious lack of liquidity due to the inability to easily transfer digital assets across ecosystems. Analog solves this by giving dApp developers and users a secure way to integrate and navigate across diverse blockchain networks with minimal hassle or fuss. Analog’s key innovation is the Timechain , which is a custom-built Layer-0 network powered by the Proof-of-Time protocol. It serves as both an accountability layer and also a cross-chain communications engine, secured by a diverse and decentralized set of validators, known as “Time Nodes”, that verify transactions and propose new blocks in exchange for rewards. The ANALOG tokens play a key role within the Timechain as its native cryptocurrency. Users can stake ANALOG to help secure the network as validators, use it to pay transaction fees, and also participate in governance, both by proposing changes and voting on those proposals. It helps to incentivize participation while ensuring the integrity of its inter-chain communications. Analog’s overriding mission is to fix liquidity fragmentation within the Web3 industry, enabling value to be transferred across any two blockchain networks or dApps in a seamless, secure, trustless and low-cost way. In doing this, it means dApps and their users will be able to access liquidity from the broader Web3 ecosystem in a single click, similar to the way the HTTP protocol facilitates efficient communication across the entire internet. Having launched its mainnet in December, the simultaneous listing of ANALOG across KuCoin, Bitget, MEXC and Gate.io is a critical milestone that should bring much broader exposure to the project. The token will become available for trade on all four platforms via the ANALOG/USDT trading pair from 11 a.m.. UTC on February 10, with both deposits and withdrawals supported. They will significantly boost liquidity, with early adopters who participated in ANALOG’s public sale, and those who received tokens via its airdrop being able to trade those assets, while everyone else can join the party. Already, Analog boasts a healthy ecosystem that includes more than 380,000 individual users who participated during its testnet phase. ANALOG’s broader availability will also help to accelerate the growth of more than 50 decentralized applications already building on the network, including the likes of Zenswap, Pixelport, Frax Finance, StationX, XYO and Parami Protocol.",Information,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|AIRDROP|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-10 11:56:30

The course is set to launch in December 2025 and is the first project exploring Join-Accumulate Machine (JAM), the new framework conceptualized by Polkadot co-founder Dr. Gavin Wood. Polkadot’s JAM Course A follow-up to the PBA Campus, JAM Tour, and PBA-X, the academy’s four-week entry-level program, The JAM Course is designed primarily for experienced Web3 developers looking to explore The JAM infrastructure. Unlike traditional blockchain programs, The JAM Course emphasizes learning through experience supplemented by various high-level tutorials, joint interactive sessions, and open discussions. Pauline Cohen Vorms, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Polkadot Blockchain Academy, described the program as the ‘next frontier’ for the chain: “JAM represents the next frontier for Polkadot, and this course is a gateway for developers eager to explore its transformative potential. Through this program, participants will not only gain technical expertise but also a deeper understanding of how Polkadot is driving the future of blockchain interoperability.” During the program, participants will work with JAM’s core components, including its Refine, Accumulate, and OnTransfer functions, which are crucial for understanding how the layer can reshape the future of the blockchain. Participants will also explore tools such as the Polkadot Virtual Machine and Polkadot API, both essential to building real-world applications. The Join-Accumulate Machine framework JAM was designed to replace Polkadot’s relay chain by introducing a more flexible and scalable decentralized application (dApp) environment. It supports permissionless code execution, Solidity smart contracts, and roll-up outputs, which let developers integrate computation both on- and off-chain. In turn, this eliminates the need to choose between appchains and smart contracts and offers a unified environment for both.

Later today, Trump is due to impose 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on top of additional metal duties. This market stance ahead of an impending tariff escalation contrasts starkly with the risk aversion observed a week ago, when Trump fired the first tariff shot. Perhaps market participants think he's using aggressive tactics to negotiate trade deals rather than committing to sustained tariffs. This notion has gained traction following lat Monday's decision to suspend tariffs on Mexico and Canada for 30 days, hinting at a more strategic approach to trade negotiations. According to QCP Capital, the current market stability could embolden Trump to take a tougher stance. ""A feedback loop is emerging — President Trump, highly sensitive to market reactions, is facing a market increasingly calling his bluff. This could embolden him further, adding another layer of volatility,"" QCP said in a Telegram broadcast. It will be interesting to see how this develops. There's a social media post doing the rounds that shows record open short positions in the CME-listed cash-settled ether futures. Those shorts are not necessarily outright bearish bets and are likely components of carry trades, where investors hold long positions in ETFs while shorting CME futures. Note that the ETH ETF inflows surged last week. It's possible some of the shorts are investors hedging against long altcoin bets amid concerns over the number of coins and impending large unlocks. Over the weekend, Base member Kabir.Base.eth refuted claims that the sequencer Coinbase had been selling ETH earned as fees, adding a layer of transparency to its operations. In another notable development, Archange Touadéra, president of the Central African Republic, reportedly issued a new memecoin that saw a trader turn $5,000 into an astonishing $12 million in less than three hours, achieving a remarkable return of 2,450x, according to LookOnChain data. Meanwhile, litecoin (LTC) continues to shine as the top-performing cryptocurrency of the past 24 hours, up 9%. On the macroeconomic front, the surge in the U.S. consumer inflation expectations raises concerns about the likelihood of a prolonged pause in Federal Reserve's rate cuts. Plus, the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) is due for release on Wednesday. Stay alert!

The group cited possible roadblocks and requirements before the nominees could function, as well as other factors. Since Donald Trump’s win at the polls, crypto users have anticipated overall current policies, which sparked a positive rally. A recent NYDIG market update informs crypto users of delays that could face Trump’s crypto policies. Greg Cipolara, the group’s Head of Research, explained that despite soaring optimism, change will take a process, especially as some officials still need to be named. In the weeks following his victory, Trump announced several nominations, but they needed to undergo a confirmation process and staff selection. A Republican sweep of the House and the Senate could clear the way for Trump’s nominees, but experts still advocate caution. Furthermore, not all officials have been revealed by Donald Trump, and several key appointments are on the way. However, nominations so far lean towards a pro-crypto administration. “ Key officials still need to be named, those that have been named need to go through the confirmation process, and then once confirmed they need to assemble their staff. The execution of these initiatives may be a matter of priority, with items like geopolitical conflict, the budget and debt ceiling, global trade and tariffs, and immigration perhaps more pressing matters,” he added. Impact of Trump’s Pro-Market Policies Ahead of the United States elections, Trump rolled out his plans for the sector and was perceived as a more crypto candidate. His plans ranged from positive crypto laws , miles away from the present administration’s war on the market, to a strategic Bitcoin reserve. This lured crypto users, leading to a bullish uptick after the polls. The present administration’s war on the market was illustrated by a lack of rule clarity leading to frequent lawsuits. Unlike Trump’s plans to make the country the global Bitcoin capital, these factors were said to drive investment to other jurisdictions. Secondly, a US strategic Bitcoin reserve has triggered a new phase of institutional adoption, leading to significant price gains. Last year, Senator Cynthia Lummis rolled out a bill for the government to purchase one million BTC across 5 years. This will be held for 20 years and used to pay off the national debt, suggesting selling gold reserves to fund the purchase. Weeks after the elections, Bitcoin tapped a new all-time high above $107K before the recent price correction.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Cryptocurrency News|Donald Trump,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-10 12:01:30

Tether Inflow to Exchanges Rises to $2.7 Billion as Bitcoin Drops to $90,000 The surge coincided with Bitcoin (BTC) taking a nosedive to nearly $91,000 as trade war fears rocked global markets. Analysts suggest that the unusually high capital movement was caused by traders depositing additional collateral to cover margin calls and prevent liquidations, as well as opportunistic investors catching the dip to accumulate BTC. “The significant market decline triggered extraordinary capital flows. In particular, USDT net flows to exchanges reached the third-highest level ever recorded, exceeding $2.72 billion. Since the sell-off, Bitcoin has recovered and is stabilizing in the $95,000 to $100,000 range. Stablecoins like Tether and its regulated counterpart USDC remain indispensable to crypto trading by providing liquidity and facilitating quick asset purchases. The latest USDT entry highlights the critical role stablecoins play in times of market volatility, acting as a bridge for traders to quickly react to price movements. Whether the recent surge in Tether deposits signals ongoing buying pressure or cautious repositioning remains to be seen as the market digests macroeconomic developments. *This is not investment advice.

A trading expert has identified a recurring price pattern, suggesting that if historical trends hold, SOL could be on track to reach $565, signaling another major rally for the asset. Solana technical analysis: Fibonacci model targets $565 Notably, Trader Tardigrade has highlighted a recurring trend in Solana’s price movements, where each breakout from an ascending triangle formation has consistently reached the Fibonacci 2.618 extension level. Solana price analysis chart. Source: Trader Tardigrade/ X This pattern has been a reliable indicator of SOL’s price surges, further strengthening the possibility of another upward move. Currently, SOL is in the later stages of yet another ascending triangle. With the pattern now more than halfway complete, traders are watching for a breakout confirmation that could propel SOL toward its next Fibonacci target of $565. Fundamental outlook: VanEck’s $520 Solana price projection Beyond technical indicators , institutional projections further support a bullish case for Solana. Investment firm VanEck has projected that SOL could hit $520 by 2025, citing rising market share in the smart contract platform (SCP) sector as a key growth driver. According to estimates, Solana’s market dominance within the SCP sector is expected to grow from 15% to 22% by the end of 2025. This projection is based on macroeconomic factors, particularly U.S. M2 money supply growth, which has historically shown a strong correlation with crypto market capitalization. Moreover, Solana’s increasing developer adoption, rising DEX trading volumes, and expanding active user base further reinforce this bullish outlook. Based on these factors, VanEck estimates that Solana’s market capitalization could reach approximately $250 billion, translating to a price target of $520 by the end of the year. Regulatory shift and institutional interest boost optimism Adding to the bullish outlook, the SEC’s recent acknowledgment of Grayscale’s Solana ETF filing marks a shift in regulatory tone, potentially paving the way for institutional inflows into the asset. Meanwhile, on-chain data from analyst Ali Martinez highlights Solana’s accelerating adoption, with five million new addresses created daily. This indicates the network’s rapid expansion and increasing user base, further strengthening Solana’s long-term growth trajectory.

It gave the cryptosphere the speed and fees it had craved for so long and blasted open the meme coin party at the start of the year. It’s the perfect counterbalance to the safe, steady OG that is Bitcoin. But what happens when these two crypto behemoths fuse? You get Bitcoin Pepe . The frictionless, stress-free experience of Solana and the unbeatable security of Bitcoin rolled into one. A revolutionary layer 2 built on top of BTC and on 11th February , this project will throw its doors wide open for ICO investing. Investors will be able to get in at the ground level of the future of meme coin trading. Here’s how Bitcoin Pepe will offer boomer security and zoomer gains and could potentially mirror Solana’s early price performance of 1,000X returns. Meet Bitcoin Pepe This self-proclaimed “Solana on Bitcoin” is a BTC layer 2 explicitly created for meme coin investing and trading. It is the first-ever meme-centric ICO on Bitcoin. And this ICO directly challenges the status quo and responds to the desire for better security, permanence, and, most of all, scalability. Make no mistake, it’s coming for chains like Solana and Base, as it aims to be the gold standard L2 for all meme coin trading. Yes, via the PEP-20 token standard, Bitcoin Pepe plans to become the infrastructure powering the next generation of memes. Bitcoin Pepe’s ultimate target is onboarding the next billion users . Which at first seems nuts. But when you consider that Bitcoin Pepe directly addresses a gaping hole in the market by finally giving BTC maxis the power to trade meme coins, plus the wave of retail money set to swarm into crypto, 1 billion users quickly becomes doable. Plus, this unique offer is set to unleash DeFi on BTC. Currently, Bitcoin has over $2 trillion in capital just itching to move. Now imagine if this capital could move freely, Solana style. And with security fit for a government. Base and Solana are about to starve. Bitcoin Pepe is here to steal their lunch. For degens and institutions: Bitcoin Pepe offers 100x Now that we’re entering full-blown crypto silly season , where numbers only go up, Bitcoin Pepe is ready to shine. The smart institutional money jumped on the meme coin train ages ago. Getting in position for the mega pump of 2025. As a guide to how high Bitcoin Pepe could go, consider the fact that the current meme coin daddy chain Solana is up roughly 1,000x from its ICO price. It has served as the perfect pick-and-shovel play any smart investor saw a mile away. Meanwhile, other infrastructure plays in sectors such as AI, like AI16z, have done 100x in a matter of months. Investors want to own the infrastructure, and the coming Bitcoin Pepe presale is how anyone can get in on the first floor for the infrastructure powering the future of meme coin trading and investing. Bitcoin Pepe has already minted 2.1 billion tokens, and 50% will be available to the community when the presale begins. It will feature 30 stages with 5% incremental price leaps meaning early birds will be sitting on 300% returns before it even launches on centralized exchanges. BPEP will be available for the low price of $0.021, and this could be a generational entry. Unlocking $2 trillion in capital via building a BTC native bridge and a scaling solution dubbed ‘Solana on Bitcoin.’ If it mirrors Solana’s early days, this is going to be the ICO that knocks everything out of the park in 2025.

In his recent post on X , Sebastian Siemiatkowski, CEO of Swedish fintech Klarna, revealed plans to integrate crypto into the platform. The announcement comes as the company prepares for a major milestone—its initial public offering in the U.S., expected in April.

He stated that Klarna already serves 85 million users globally, processes $100 billion in transaction volume, and works with over 500,000 merchants. He also highlighted that around 30% of transactions are debit-based rather than credit. Btw all crypto fans. Tell me what we should do with it? We have 85 m users worldwide. 100 bn of volume.

Digital asset investment products recorded inflows of $1.3 billion last week, marking the fifth consecutive week of gains, CoinShares revealed in a blog post on Feb. 10.

This mainnet launch will allow pioneers to monetize their accumulated tokens and developers to showcase their apps to their target audience. The launch will happen over seven years since the developers launched the network, which allowed pioneers to mine tokens on their smartphones. A lot has not been revealed about the mainnet launch, including the date and the price. Speculation is that the Pi coin price will start trading at $3.14, the value of pi. Here are the three reasons why the Pi Network price may crash after the mainnet launch. Pi Network price may drop because of revenge selling The first main reason why the Pi coin price may crash after the mainnet launch is revenge sellng. This is a situation where pioneers who have been mining the token for years decide to sell all their tokens. That’s because these pioneers have endured a prolonged wait for the mainnet launch to happen. They missed the recent crypto price surges in 2021 and in the last three years. Pi Network’s developers have also disappointed them by missing key deadlines. For example, they delayed the know your customer verification or KYC from November 31 last year to February 28. You might also like: LTC jumps over 7% as ETF approval odds rise Tap-to-earn tokens crash after the airdrop The other reason why the Pi con price may crash after the airdrop is that many tap-to-earn tokens crash after their airdrop. Hamster Kombat ( HMST ) has crashed by 90% from its highest level in September last year. Other tokens like DOGS and Notcoin have also dropped. This is notable since Pi Network is a tap-to-earn platform where users accumulate tokens by tapping a button on the app. The only difference is that Pi has created its own blockchain and its ecosystem, including a browser and the Fireside Forum. Tap-to-earn tokens crash afte the airdrop | Source: IntoTheBlock These tokens crash as many users who have accumulated their tokens sell and convert them into fiat currencies. It is not just tap-to-earn tokens that have crashed after the airdrop. Most recently airdropped tokens like Berachain, Wormhole, and zkSync have all plunged after their token launches. As such, many Pi Network pioneers will want to sell early to avoid the mistakes of most tap-to-earn holders. Seasonality to play a factor Bitcoin seasonality per quarter | Source: CoinGlass Further, Pi Network mainnet launch may happen in the last days of the quarter. Historically, the third quarter is usually the second-worst period for cryptocurrencies since it coincides with the Summer season. CoinGlass data shows that the average Bitcoin return in Q2 is 26%, followed by 6% in Q2. Therefore, there is a risk that the Pi coin price will drop if the seasonality aspect works. Newly launched airdrops do well when there is a crypto bull run.

Industry expert Austin King says the real opportunity here is much bigger than most people think. He believes Ripple’s plan to scale XRP could create 1,000x more value than just launching a stablecoin and explains how this vision is already taking shape. At the same time, the Pluto Chain ($PLUTO) project could draw attention as it might improve Bitcoin’s capabilities. It could introduce a hybrid Layer-2 blockchain potentially making Bitcoin transactions faster, cheaper, and boost its scalability. Let’s check out the details. Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction – Can XRP’s RLUSD Initiative Bring a 1,000X Growth Opportunity? Industry expert Austin King says RLUSD on the XRP Ledger has already processed over $300 million in transactions. He explained that many financial teams are working with OMNI to add RLUSD to their products, making way for more adoption. According to King, Ripple’s plan is rolling out step by step – starting with RLUSD and moving toward bigger assets. Recently, Ondo Finance announced plans to bring tokenized treasury bills to the XRP Ledger, which King believes is a big step forward. He says Ripple’s real goal is to bring trillions of dollars from finance onto XRP. As more assets get tokenized, OMNI will help move them across the blockchain, making XRP more useful for institutions. King’s “1,000X opportunity” is much more than just XRP’s growth in the market – it’s about building a system where more tokenized assets lead to more people using XRP. So, the more institutions use XRP, the stronger its position becomes in global finance. How Could PlutoChain ($PLUTO) Greatly Expand Bitcoin’s DeFi Potential? PlutoChain ($PLUTO) might be the solution to one of Bitcoin’s biggest limitations – slow transaction speed. While Bitcoin remains the dominant blockchain force, its 10-minute block time makes it a slow match for fast-moving applications. So, that’s where PlutoChain could step in – as a Layer-2 solution, it offers block times of just two seconds, making transactions feel smooth and quick. Early testnet results look strong, with the network handling over 43,200 transactions per day. To put that in perspective, PlutoChain can process hundreds of transactions in the time it takes Bitcoin to confirm a single block. Beyond speed, PlutoChain might connect different blockchain networks. It could combine Bitcoin’s security with Ethereum’s EVM compatibility, building a smooth and safe environment for developers. This could open Bitcoin to DeFi apps and NFT marketplaces, drawing in users. PlutoChain puts decision-making in the hands of the community, allowing users to vote on major changes instead of relying on executive control. Security is also a priority for the project and it has already undergone regular audits from firms such as SolidProof, QuillAudits, and Assure DeFi, bringing trust in the network. The Takeaway Ripple’s RLUSD initiative could help XRP grow by bringing more real-world financial assets onto the blockchain. Experts believe this strategy may increase adoption and make XRP an important factor in global finance. At the same time, projects like PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could bring new improvements to blockchain technology. By potentially making Bitcoin transactions faster and cheaper, PlutoChain might help expand Bitcoin’s use. ———— This article does not offer financial advice.

The blockchain giant has partnered with Unicâmbio, Portugal’s leading currency exchange provider, to bring crypto-enabled payments to the country. This move expands the cross-border payment service provider’s European footprint and strengthens financial ties between Portugal and Brazil. Ripple Expands Into Portugal With Major Partnership In the latest official blog post, Ripple announced its latest collaboration , marking a major milestone in its global expansion. The company announced that Unicâmbio will leverage Ripple Payments to enable near-instant cross-border transactions between Portugal and Brazil. Cassie Craddock, Ripple’s Managing Director for the UK and Europe, emphasized the significance of this partnership. She stated: “Portugal has developed a thriving crypto ecosystem so we are delighted to open up our payment solution to partners there, By connecting our payment networks in Portugal and Brazil we are facilitating faster, more cost-effective cross-border payments while strengthening the economic bridge between these two major markets. Ripple has over a decade of experience in tokenizing real-world assets, starting with bringing fiat currencies onchain to seamlessly send money across borders.” Meanwhile, this partnership is expected to transform the payment corridor between the two nations. Traditional methods often involve high fees and slow processing times. However, by integrating blockchain technology, Unicâmbio’s corporate clients can now settle transactions in minutes at a fraction of the cost. Strengthening Portugal-Brazil Financial Ties Portugal and Brazil share deep economic and cultural bonds, making this partnership a strategic move for Ripple. Adriana Jerónimo, an executive at Unicâmbio, highlighted the benefits of blockchain in financial transactions. “By leveraging blockchain technology we’re transforming money movement between the two nations. Ripple’s crypto-enabled payments solution enables near-instant settlement and drastically reduces costs compared to traditional payment channels, delivering real value to our customers,” she stated. The partnership further cements Ripple’s influence in Latin America. It builds upon existing relationships with key Brazilian firms, including Travelex Bank and Mercado Bitcoin, the region’s largest crypto exchange. Ripple’s Growing Dominance In The Cross-Border Payments Ripple has been a leader in digital asset infrastructure for over a decade. With over 90 regulatory licenses worldwide, the company continues to expand its financial services. Ripple Payments now supports transactions in more than 90 markets, covering 90% of daily foreign exchange (FX) volumes. The platform has processed over $70 billion in payments, making it one of the most trusted blockchain solutions for global financial institutions. What’s Next For The Blockchain Firm? Ripple has been on the investors’ radar lately. Notably, Donald Trump’s win in the US election has further bolstered its position in the crypto market with the current regulatory shift towards a pro-crypto environment. Simultaneously, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also lauded the latest crypto development in the US, calling it a “big deal” for the industry. In addition, it also fuels speculations over a potential conclusion in the long-running Ripple Vs SEC lawsuit . If this happens, it could further boost the company’s appeal to the market participants. Besides, its native crypto has also gained traction due to several positive developments in the market. Although the price action remains stagnant with predictions coming of a potential XRP price crash , many experts remained bullish on the long-term trajectory of the coin. In addition, the leading players are also advancing to launch an XRP ETF in the US. This also cements Ripple’s position, among others, as a leading blockchain player in the US. Simultaneously, this new partnership indicates that the blockchain firm is not limiting itself to any particular region but also focusing on its global expansion.

This coincides with the Hash Ribbon metric signaling a miner capitulation. Hash Ribbon, is a market indicator, which hints at a local bottom for bitcoin (BTC) and often forms when miners capitulate — when mining costs exceed profitability. According to Glassnode data, miner capitulation began in early February. Bitcoin is down over 4% month-to-date. Historically, when this metric signals capitulation, it has marked local price bottoms. If this pattern holds, bitcoin’s bottom could be around $91,000. The last capitulation signal occurred in October 2024, just before BTC surged 50%. This rise in difficulty is due to bitcoin’s rising hash rate, which hit an all-time high on Feb. 4. Mining difficulty adjusts every 2,016 blocks, targeting an average block time of 10 minutes. As difficulty increases, mining becomes more competitive, placing additional pressure on miners. January’s production data reflects this, with Riot Platforms (RIOT) being the only major public miner to report a month-over-month production increase.",Markets|Bitcoin|Mining Difficulty,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-10 12:20:58

Ripple’s XRP and new projects like Yeti Ouro (YETIO) interest many investors. XRP is smoothing out a little regulation, but YETIO’s mix of P2E and crypto could make it a dark horse for big earnings. XRP’s Turnaround: Regulatory Factors And Price Path XRP’s 300% price uprise post-Nov 2024 election has largely resulted from Trump’s positive actions and rhetoric towards cryptocurrencies. Factors include: Transparent Rules : Settling the SEC lawsuit in 2024 let XRP grow its U.S. partnerships, with deals six weeks after the election beating the total from the prior six months. Support from Big Players : Trump’s directive against central bank digital currencies and focus on private-sector progress matches XRP’s international payment options. Price Swings: XRP, with positive moods, has a minor technical problem. XRP price is currently at $2.39 (Feb 8, 2025)—down 21% in Jan (2025), with outages in its network. Experts say, in case XRP overcomes $3.03 resistance, it will rise to $5.50, but some are concerned that it will fall to $1.95. Recent Trump’s sit-down with Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse suggests policy changes could be in the offing, possibly including XRP in a U.S. reserve digital fund. However, Ethereum’s recent 38% rally and ETF inflows suggest fierce competition. Yeti Ouro (YETIO): The First In Play-to-Earn While XRP deals with price fluctuations, YETIO appears to be a rapid-rising alternative, blending web buzz with gaming use through blockchain. YETIO’s Stage 2 presale has sold more than 65 million tokens with the current stage pricing at $0.017/token. There is also a 10% bonus for buying now. With over 165 million YETIO tokens sold in total, its design to reduce token supply stands out: Limited Number : 1 billion tokens total, with 45% set aside for staking, rewards, and community involvement. Token Burning : A 5% YETIO burn permanently lowers the number of tokens, unlike Ethereum, which increases supply. Audited Security : Smart contracts verified by SolidProof lower risks seen in very small projects. The countdown to Stage 3 has begun with only 6 days remaining until a significnt price increase, causing a major traction to YETIO presale. YETIO’s Gaming System And Growth Boosters Yeti Ouro’s first game, Yeti Go—a racing game using Unreal Engine 5—is coming in Q3 2025, letting players earn YETIO by winning races. This Play-to-Earn (P2E) system connects token demand to how much people play the game, protecting it from wider market changes. Experts predict a 10,000% rise if YETIO becomes as popular as Axie Infinity was in 2021. The game is being created in collaboration with a prestigious game asset creation company whose portfolio includes titles like, Call of Duty, Spider-Man, Dead Space, and The Witcher. Audio composition is handled by Grammy-nominated projects for artists such as Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid. Market Position Of YETIO YETIO’s $17 million market value (at presale) offers big growth potential vs. XRP’s $300 billion value. Looking at how the presale is going, predictions suggest: Short Term : $0.50–$1.70 by end of 2025. Long Term : $5+ by 2026, helped by game releases and getting listed on exchanges. Key Points For Investors XRP: XRP depends on the continued implementation of Trump policies and network improvements. Key XRP price levels: $2.28 (support level) and $3.03 (resistance level). YETIO: High-potential opportunity for gaming and token reward. Removing price volatility through early access in presale, token scarcity, and consumption through P2E could yield high returns. XRP is at a regulatory turning point with the current administration, with possible big growth. However, spreading investments to new projects such as YETIO could protect against market uncertainty. Unlike XRP, YETIO’s perpetual and algorithmic model of timed price increases sustained gain potentials for the long term.

In the past 24 hours, the Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) burn rate skyrocketed by over 807%, according to X announcement from blockchain tracking service Shibburn . More than 20.5 million SHIB tokens were sent to dead-end wallets, permanently removing them from circulation. This marks a significant jump compared to the previous day, with the total burn amount nearly quadrupling. Most of the burn came from two large transactions—one carrying 13.5 million SHIB and another 6.3 million. HOURLY SHIB UPDATE $SHIB Price: $0.00001579 (1hr -0.18% ▼ | 24hr -2.62% ▼ ) Market Cap: $9,303,958,601 (-2.66% ▼) Total Supply: 589,255,603,143,881 TOKENS BURNT Past 24Hrs: 20,530,875 (807.68% ▲) Past 7 Days: 62,766,791 (-94.6% ▼) — Shibburn (@shibburn) February 10, 2025 However, while the daily burn rate surged, the weekly picture tells a different story. Over the past week, SHIB burns actually dropped by around 94.6% compared to previous weeks. Despite that decline, about 62.7 million SHIB tokens were burned in total over the last seven days, which still far exceeds the daily number. You might also like: Shiba Inu, Lightchain AI, and Stellar draw investor interest The goal behind these SHIB burns is to reduce the overall supply of SHIB, which should, in theory, create scarcity and potentially boost its value over time. The idea is simple: with fewer tokens in circulation, demand could eventually push prices higher. In total, SHIB holders have burned 410 trillion tokens since this practice started. Much of that early burn effort was thanks to Ethereum ( ETH ) co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who famously destroyed a massive portion of the SHIB tokens he was gifted. Even with those massive burns, more than 584 trillion SHIB tokens are still circulating, meaning there’s plenty left for the community to tackle if they want to keep reducing the supply. The recent surge in the burn rate could hint at renewed interest in SHIB. Reflecting this optimism, crypto trader $SHIB Knight shared a weekly SHIB price chart with his 467,000 followers, noting that the market may be turning a corner. “The dip is behind us,” he said. “We’re seeing the first green candle on the weekly chart after five straight red ones—this could be the start of a reversal.” $SHIB dip is gone.

The mounting macroeconomic pressures coupled with heightened tariffs are causing even established coins like Ripple and ADA to plunge. As the XRP price and the Cardano price decline, investors are turning towards other valuable coins like IntelMarkets (INTL) for potential gains. Despite prevailing uncertainty, INTL continues to intrigue investors with its ambitious $9M presale target. But can INTL surpass Ripple and ADA to become the next big altcoin before 2026? Continue reading to find out. Ripple Struggles to Gain Bullish Momentum Amidst Legal Troubles The Ripple (XRP) seems to be struggling for the past year, as it navigates legal troubles with the SEC. The XRP price briefly surged during early January due to a positive sentiment owing to Trump’s presidency. However, the Ripple (XRP) failed to maintain this positive movement. As of now, the XRP price is hovering around the $2.40 mark, declining by almost 19% between 1 February and 8 February. Experts attribute this recent downtrend to ongoing legal issues with the SEC. Additionally, XRP Ledger halted block production temporarily, which also fueled uncertainty around Ripple. Source: CoinMarketCap However, despite ongoing regulatory challenges and rising uncertainty in the market, analysts project hope for the altcoin. Cboe recently sent the proposal for approval of four new XRP ETFs, which is expected to cause a surge in the XRP price soon. But currently, uncertainty prevails around the XRP price, causing experts to voice concern for the future of Ripple. During this time, investors are eyeing INTL a high-utility coin with a $9M presale target before 2026. Cardano (ADA) Plunges Despite ETF Launch As the XRP price declines significantly, the Cardano Price seems to be behaving similarly. Although the broader crypto market remained bearish, analysts predicted a positive movement for ADA following the new ETF release. However, despite the positive predictions, ADA failed to realize the expected gains. As of now, the Cardano price is hovering around the $0.69 mark, declining by more than 25% between February 1 and February 8. Source: CoinMarketCap Experts attribute this downward trend in the Cardano price to the recent dumping by Cardano whales. Recently, the selling pressure for ADA coins skyrocketed as Cardano whales dumped 330 million ADA tokens. Analysts believe that this dumping and ongoing trade wars collectively contributed to the drop in the Cardano price. Although experts believe that the Cardano price could potentially recover soon, its current technical indicators like Momentum 10 and MACD (12,26) point towards continued bearish movement. During this time, investors are enticed by other projects like IntelMarkets, a promising coin that could show the potential to surpass Ripple and ADA. IntelMarkets (INTL) Stuns Investors with a $9M Presale Target IntelMarkets is a revolutionary AI-backed platform that aims to automate trading. INTL aims to democratize access for novice and seasoned investors alike. For this purpose, the platform is implementing an innovative tool called Intell-M. This feature could collect meaningful metrics from 10,000 different data platforms to help users execute a successful trade. Apart from this, IntelMarkets prioritizes user security and believes in taking proactive action. That's why, INTL is coming up with Route X21. This is a signature quantum proofing protocol that could safeguard users against cyberattacks from quantum computers. In addition to this, INTL is poised to raise over $8.1 million from its $9M presale target which could prove its credibility. INTL believes in incentivizing its users, therefore the platform is offering governance rights and up to 30% discounts on trading fees for its presale investors. With uncertainty looming around the XRP price and the Cardano price, experts believe this could be the best time to invest in a promising project like IntelMarkets. Early investors stand to benefit from not only enticing perks but also a 50% bonus by using the code “REVAMP”. With the next presale round approaching, now might be the ideal time to grab INTL at a bargain before it takes off after launch. Final Thoughts The crypto market is surfing rough currents right now. The decline in the XRP price and the Cardano price has urged investors to consider alternative trading platforms like IntelMarkets (INTL).

The price of XRP saw a brief uptick at the beginning of January, fueled by optimism linked to Trump’s presidency. Nevertheless, this positive trend couldn’t be sustained by Ripple (XRP). Currently, the XRP price hovers around $2.40, having dropped approximately 19% from February 1 to February 8. Experts attribute this recent decline to the continuous legal challenges with the SEC. Additionally, a temporary halt in block production on the XRP Ledger has further added to the uncertainty surrounding Ripple.

However, ADA has not achieved the expected gains despite these optimistic forecasts. Currently, Cardano's price stands at around $0.69, having fallen over 25% from February 1 to February 8. Source: CoinMarketCap Experts suggest that this downward trajectory for Cardano can be attributed to recent sell-offs by Cardano whales. There has been a significant increase in selling pressure, with Cardano whales offloading 330 million ADA tokens. Analysts believe that this sell-off, coupled with ongoing trade tensions, has driven Cardano's price down. While experts are optimistic about the potential recovery of Cardano's price, its current technical indicators like Momentum 10 and MACD (12,26) signal a continued bearish trend.

Noting that high launch prices could lead to poor graphics performance, the celebrity advised projects to create a wealth-building journey for their users instead. “To all shitcoin founders: Work with your market makers and exchange partners to open the market at lower prices. For example, the BERA chart is ugly, but the project is not terrible, it just started with a very high price.

The altcoin has dropped 65% from its ATH of $0.00002825, recorded two months ago. Over the past week, PEPE fell by more than 40% due to a substantial selloff. However, here are three reasons that suggest a potential reversal and 110% rally is likely for Pepe Coin price. Pepe Coin Price Eyes Major Rebound as Short Liquidation Looms PEPE price has experienced a sharp decline after a wave of selling pressure wiped out sell-side liquidity. This downturn resulted in a significant price drop, pushing the asset to lower levels as large holders exited their positions. However, with sell-side liquidity now exhausted, market dynamics may shift toward a potential short squeeze. Traders anticipating further declines could face liquidations, fueling a swift price rebound. yo @MaxBecauseBTC r u ready to blow up some bears? $PEPE pic.twitter.com/azMyFdSGvo — VΣGΣƬΛ (@VegetaCrypto1) February 9, 2025 Cryptocurrency markets often exhibit high volatility, particularly when major players offload their holdings. The recent decline in meme coins reflects broader market sentiment, but a reversal could be on the horizon. If buy-side liquidity strengthens, it may trigger a rapid recovery, leading to a possible 110% rally. The liquidation of short positions could accelerate this upward momentum, drawing renewed interest from market participants. Oversold RSI May Hint at Reversal Pepe Coin Price could be on the verge of a strong rebound as key indicators suggest a potential surge. One major factor driving this outlook is the recent price decline, which pushed the Relative Strength Index (RSI) into oversold territory. Currently, on the 24-hour chart, the RSI is at 32, nearing an oversold region. Such conditions have often signaled a trend reversal, sparking renewed buying interest and fueling a swift recovery. Market analysts point to past instances where similar RSI dips preceded substantial price rebounds, adding weight to this bullish projection. PEPE Price Key Support Holds: Is a 110% Rally Ahead?

With Strategy having influenced other global companies – led by Tokyo-based Metaplanet Inc ., and India’s JetKing – the supply of Bitcoins for sale will continue to decline exponentially. Moreover, more investors are speculating on the inevitable adoption of Bitcoin by nation-states , led by the United States. Ultimately, Bitcoin price will follow Gold price action in the near future fueled by institutional investors. Furthermore, Bitcoin price has established a solid support range between $91k and $108k. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Trump on Sunday said he will introduce 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports into the US, on top of existing duties, with reciprocal tariffs later in the week applicable to all countries. The rhetoric and spike in inflation expectations could breed downside volatility with a key indicator that foresaged a move above $100,000 for bitcoin, when it traded under $70,000, turning bearish on Sunday . Crypto majors remained little-changed in European afternoon hours Monday, with U.S. futures Dow and S&P 500 up 0.46% ahead of the New York open. Bitcoin, ether, XRP, Solana’s SOL and dogecoin (DOGE) were up under 1% in the past 24 hours, while BNB Chain’s BNB lost 4.5% after a Sunday rally. Tariffs introduce economic uncertainty by potentially escalating trade wars, which can lead to market volatility — such events tend to impact bitcoin and the broader crypto market as investors tend to move away from risk assets to safer investments. Some traders say ether could be further impacted as sentiment for crypto fades down, adding to an already tumultuous year for the asset which saw a widely-watched bitcoin-ether ratio drop to 2021, indicative of a fallout for ETH and preference for BTC. A drop in ETH may further spell bad news for related beta bets such as memecoin dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum-based DeFi tokens, which tend to mirror the movements of the parent asset. “The rise of BTC vs everything else is the most evident in comparison with ETH, which is seeing record short-interest and FUD with the 2nd largest token being down -23% YTD vs a +2.5% gain in BTC,” Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “At the risk of sounding like a broken record, but a lack of L1 catalysts and narrative leadership will likely continue to weigh on Ethereum in the foreseeable future,” Fan added. “Ethereum has been hit particularly hard as ETH reversed its entire pump from late November last year, unwinding any gains to holders,” shared Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, in a Telegram message. Due to expectations of increased inflation, investors are betting on only one interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve this year, casting a grim outlook for risk assets including crypto.” Meanwhile, traders at Singapore-based QCP Capital expect crypto markets to flip-flop in the coming weeks as Trump’s words continue to impact markets. “A feedback loop is emerging—President Trump, highly sensitive to market reactions, is facing a market increasingly calling his bluff. This could embolden him further, adding another layer of volatility,” the firm said in a Monday broadcast message. “BTC volatility now skews in favor of puts until April, reflecting a lack of upside catalysts,” it ended.",Markets|Ether|Dogecoin|Trump,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|MARKET|ETH|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-10 13:40:26

40155434,https://crypto.news/?p=14335229,1739195173,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/40155434.jpeg,Here’s why the Sui Price may pump 65% soon,https://crypto.news/heres-why-the-sui-price-may-pump-65-soon/,"Sui has entered a technical bear market after falling nearly 40% from its highest level this year. The Sui ( SUI ) token has dropped to $3.25, down from its all-time high of $5.36, bringing its market capitalization to $9.8 billion. The recent decline mirrors the performance of other altcoins that have erased some of their fourth-quarter gains. Layer-1 tokens such as Solana ( SOL ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and Polkadot ( DOT ) have also entered bear market territory, each falling over 30% from their peak. Despite the decline, there are several reasons why Sui could rebound by 65% and retest its all-time high of $5.36. One key factor is Sui’s growing presence in key sectors of the crypto industry. For example, DeFi Llama data shows that Sui has become the sixth-largest blockchain in the decentralized exchange industry. Protocols in its ecosystem handled over $2.28 billion in transactions in the past seven days, bringing the total volume to $65 billion. The leading platforms in the network include Cetus, Bluefin, DeepBook, and Turbos. You might also like: Hyperliquid price prediction: How high will HYPE token go? Sui has also become the ninth-biggest chain in crypto in terms of its total decentralized finance assets. Its DeFi TVL has moved to over $1.45 billion, making it bigger than other blockchains like Avalanche, Cardano, and Polygon. Additionally, Sui is working to establish itself in the gaming sector. The network is preparing to launch Sui Play, a gaming console that will feature hundreds of games. 🚨PLATFORM ANNOUNCEMENT🦾🤖🚨 We’re excited to announce that we will be building the future of gaming with @SuiNetwork as a launch partner on the #SuiPlay0X1 gaming device 💥 @SuiPlay SuiPlay0X1 will offer a complete Dark Machine gaming experience in the palm of your hands 👋… pic.twitter.com/l2uAKZtzUX — Dark Machine (@DarkMachineGame) February 8, 2025 Sui price forecast SUI price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the Sui token peaked at $5.36 earlier this year before plunging to $2.34 last week, following a broader altcoin sell-off triggered by Trump’s tariffs. This bottom level coincided with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level, a key support area derived from the golden ratio in the Fibonacci sequence. Sui has also formed a falling wedge pattern, a common bullish reversal indicator. This pattern consists of two descending and converging trendlines, with a breakout typically occurring when the lines are about to converge. As a result, Sui is likely to rebound and potentially retest its all-time high of $5.36, which would represent a 65% increase from its current level. However, a drop below the support level at $2.35 would invalidate the bullish outlook.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As investors realize how lucrative RCO Finance’s AI features are, they rush into the RCOF token presale to catch this project before it launches. Table of Contents The RCO Finance token presale breaks tradition Next-level trading with the AI Robo Advisor Conclusion Most major altcoins struggle to make gains. However, the RCO Finance (RCOF) token presale has been thriving. The demand for RCOF hasn’t stopped, with the token presale surpassing $13 million recently. This shows just how excited investors are about the RCO Finance token presale. And what makes them so excited? The answer is RCO Finance’s AI features. This SolidProof audited platform has created AI features that is expected to help users consistently make huge profits. The RCO Finance token presale breaks tradition While most DeFi presales require investors to wait until after launch to access their services and/or products, the RCO Finance token presale is different. This token presale allows investors to see exactly what they’re getting before they invest, showing transparency from the get-go. In that spirit, RCO Finance has launched its Beta Platform already, even though its token presale is still running. This allows anyone to see exactly what the Beta Platform offers. The Beta Platform provides an intuitive and easy-to-use interface. It also enables access to over 120,000 assets in one place, simplifying the trading and investing experience. Moreover, it allows users to manage multiple crypto wallets from the same dashboard, eliminating the need to juggle multiple platforms. Plus, RCO Finance upholds DeFi principles by operating as a non-KYC platform, ensuring all users get privacy and anonymity. This feature has attracted thousands of investors to the RCOF token presale, with new ones joining daily. You might also like: Ethereum lags behind Bitcoin but is expected to reach $14K, boosting RCOF to new high Next-level trading with the AI Robo Advisor Another primary reason behind the massive interest in the RCO Finance token presale is the AI Robo Advisor.

In other words, it creates the perfect plan for them. This means beginners can now confidently join the trading/investing markets, while pros can improve their strategies and profit more. To do this, the AI Robo Advisor asks about each user’s financial goals, risk tolerance, and market preference. It then blends this data with technical analysis, historical trends, and current market data. So, in the end, it crafts a sophisticated, tailored, and data-driven strategy for every user. The AI Robo Advisor also digests real-time financial information from sources like Bloomberg and Reuters and injects them immediately into users’ strategies. This allows them to trade in line with the market and catch every new market move, change, and fluctuation.

Conclusion The RCOF token presale is currently in Stage 5, with RCOF selling for $0.1. This price could rise to $0.4-$0.6 when the token presale ends. When RCOF fully launches, experts say that even more demand will flow in and that RCO Finance will become the market’s leading AI-powered platform. With that in mind, they say that RCOF’s price will rise by 1,000x by mid-2025, and even more in the months and years to come.

While ETH remains under $2,700, it has sparked hopes of a bigger recovery with stablecoin inflows. Ethereum (ETH) drew in a large share of inflows, with both stablecoins and ETF buying. The activity increased on a weekly basis as ETH dipped to a lower range, and signaled that there were funds available to “buy the dip.” ETH traded at $2,641.81, after another day of relative strength for Bitcoin (BTC), down from its recently recovered level above $2,800. In the case of Ethereum, buying was slightly more active than the acquisition of BTC as traders started accumulating more tokens near the lower price range. ETH drew in $793M on a weekly basis, while BTC purchases reached $407M. Is ETH returning to bullish sentiment? The recent ETH accumulation happens at a time when the token broke to new lows against BTC, sinking to 0.027 BTC. At the same time, smart money bought the dip, with some buying near last week’s lows of $2,080. The behavior of whale buyers reflects the current smart money sentiment, which is much more bullish than retail traders. $ETH Sentiment CROWD = Bearish 🟥 MP | #SmartMoney = Bullish 🟩 #Ethereum Check out sentiment and other crypto stats at https://t.co/HQDyBNuzek #Crypto #Marketprophit pic.twitter.com/XTfV8BpbRx — Market Prophit (@MarketProphit) February 10, 2025 The sentiment recovery arrives after ETH traders capitulated, clearing the way for a new price direction. During past price capitulations, ETH saw significant exchange outflows, while boosting accumulation. The latest market correction led to a peak outflow of ETH from exchanges and into accumulation wallets. Another 476K ETH flowed into ETH accumulation addresses as of February 6, with more signs of buying and holding. The balance of ETH on accumulation addresses is near peak values, holding 19.28M ETH . The trend of adding tokens to self-custody wallets accelerated in December but went vertical in the past few weeks. Ethereum inflows into accumulation addresses reached a record, leading to accelerated inflows into accumulation wallets. | Source: Cryptoquant The reason for this is that ETH has been in an accumulation zone, and whales can afford to buy the dip. At the same time, sentiment for ETH was near an all-time low, given the sluggish price performance and the uncertain direction of the Ethereum Foundation . In the past three months, the Ethereum ecosystem saw the biggest inflows and outflows, by virtue of carrying some of the most active bridges. The chain retained over $736M in new liquidity out of the gross inflows of $15B. Is ETH due for a short squeeze? One key source of ETH price predictions is an eventual short squeeze after traders bet on an ongoing price slide. The expected price move is based on the CFTC CME cash-settled ETH derivatives. The trend of shorting ETH on mainstream markets started in the past few months and has built up based on ongoing market pessimism. The short positions on the mainstream markets are also not as easily attackable as those on purely crypto exchanges. Despite the expectations for a breakout, there may be more attacks against long positions. Long positions are at nearly 70%, against 30% shorts, and the short-term expectation is for more of the long trades to be shaken out. Ethereum derivatives also hover at a lower open interest, at $11.12B. Centralized exchanges can host inflows from Wintermute and other market makers, who can sway ETH prices and liquidate derivative positions. ETH is traded more cautiously and does not necessarily signal an imminent breakout or a short squeeze. On mainstream markets, hedge funds and other entities may be making a bet on a global liquidity crunch, which could affect ETH. The size of the bets is also relatively small compared to the ETH market, with little immediate potential to affect the price. Traders also noticed increased activity from the wallets of market makers, who have enough ETH to cause liquidations on long positions. Activity by Wintermute has affected Ethereum and other assets, as the market maker shifted coins to exchanges to sell and then bought back near the new lows. In these conditions, ETH leveraged trading may be extremely risky, as traders have made claims of market manipulation. Wintermute itself showed bullish expectations for Ethereum, predicting a return to prices above $3,500. The market maker thus becomes a part of the whale accumulation trend, possibly preparing for higher prices in 2025.

While transaction fees are a known challenge, gas fees specifically have emerged as one of the most significant hurdles for blockchain users. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, solutions are emerging to address these challenges. Among them, JetBolt (JBOLT) stands out with its disruptive Zero-Gas Technology—a key innovation that tackles one of crypto’s most pressing problems: gas fees. With more than 320 million tokens flying off the shelves, there is a strong response from both crypto whales and coin enthusiasts. Will JetBolt bring in the next generation of cryptocurrencies? Let’s uncover the secrets behind this trailblazing crypto and discover how the community responded to JetBolt. The Strain of High Gas Fees on Crypto Users Gas fees have been a persistent issue across multiple blockchain networks. As more users and transactions flood platforms like Ethereum and Solana, gas fees surge, especially during peak demand. This creates a barrier for smaller crypto users and developers, who may find themselves paying high gas fees for simple transactions. In some cases, the gas fees of a transaction can exceed the value of the token being transferred, deterring people from fully participating in the ecosystem. Despite efforts by blockchain projects to address this issue—whether through Layer-2 solutions or changes in consensus mechanisms—gas fees remain a challenge that impacts the user experience. JetBolt’s Zero-Gas Tech: How it Works Enter JetBolt, which offers an innovative solution to this longstanding problem. Built on the Skale blockchain, JetBolt’s game-changing Zero-Gas Technology ensures crypto users can now enjoy the benefits of blockchain tech without the constant worry of paying for gas fees. The key to JetBolt’s gas-less infrastructure lies in the unique capabilities of the Skale blockchain. Skale’s architecture focuses on scalability, processing a high volume of transactions at lower costs. By using EVM-compatible chains, JetBolt ensures that developers have access to Ethereum-compatible environments without the burden of gas fees. At the time, this technology could allow developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) without worrying about gas fees eating into their users’ funds. This makes JetBolt a more accessible blockchain for various Web3 applications, from social platforms to NFTs, GameFi, and beyond. Staking and AI Utility: Enhancing User Engagement and Ecosystem Growth Through JetBolt’s innovation in eliminating gas fees entirely, this upstart altcoin is able to deliver more features than traditional new coins. JetBolt combines two powerful elements—staking and AI utility—to provide unique advantages to every crypto user. Staking on JetBolt goes beyond simple token holding. By combining staking with active engagement, users can unlock higher rewards through the platform’s innovative Proof of Attendance and Worth (PAW) protocol. This unique SocialFi mechanism rewards active and consistent stakers on JetBolt’s platform. Implementing a dual-reward system encourages ongoing user engagement, fostering a more dynamic and vibrant blockchain environment. On the AI front, JetBolt integrates advanced AI tools to help users navigate the Web3 space with ease. The AI aggregates and categorizes market trends, snippets of trending crypto news, and stories based on sentiment analysis. Complementing this smart AI feature is JetBolt’s daily newsletter, providing a sleek solution to crypto enthusiasts on the go. Community Response: JetBolt’s Growing Momentum and User Base JetBolt has gained significant traction within the community, with over 320 million tokens now in the wallets of crypto whales and blockchain enthusiasts. This overwhelming response underscores JetBolt’s appeal, as users recognize the advantages of its innovative Zero-Gas Technology. Early movers have also benefitted from Alpha Boxes , purchasing up to 25% bonus tokens on their large purchases during the ongoing presale. The excitement surrounding JetBolt is palpable, with many in the crypto space eager to see how this next-gen entrant will drive innovation and opportunities for users and developers. As engagement continues to rise, JetBolt’s momentum shows no signs of slowing down. Conclusion—How JetBolt’s Zero-Gas Tech Leads The Way JetBolt’s groundbreaking Zero-Gas Technology offers a significant step forward in addressing one of the most persistent challenges in the crypto space. By making blockchain transactions more affordable and accessible, JetBolt can deliver a lower barrier of entry, particularly for newer crypto enthusiasts. At the same time, developers may be able to create more engaging decentralized applications. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, JetBolt’s approach could become the new solution for scalable and efficient networks.

Stellar’s Struggles in the Crypto Market Stellar (XLM) saw price declines in the first week of February 2025. This aligns with the fluctuations recorded in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. XLM’s price performance is similar to that of Aptos (APT). Its price declined by 14.80% in the past seven days, from $0.390 to around $0.331. According to CoinGecko, It is underperforming the global cryptocurrency market, dipping by 1.50%. It is also bearish and underperforms similar smart contract platform tokens, which dropped by 6.40%. On the other hand, Stellar also experienced a -14.10% drop in price. From CoinGecko, XLM’s price was within $0.390 on February 2nd. However, it has declined to around $0.331 as of February 9th. Expert analysis shows that Stellar is experiencing more declines than similar cryptocurrencies. During the same period, its market cap has reduced from nearly $12 billion to less than $10.2 billion. Given these challenges, Stellar holders are exploring alternative investments like 1Fuel for better returns. What is 1Fuel and Why is it Attracting Investors? 1Fuel is a blockchain project known for its Formula 1 sponsorship and innovative crypto solutions. One reason it is attracting Stellar holders is its privacy. 1FUEL’s integrated mixer helps anonymize transactions and shields users from unwarranted surveillance. The presale, currently in Stage 4, has already raised $2,047,275.65 by selling over 196 million tokens at $0.018 per token. You can pay using Tether (USDT), BNB, BTC, or Ethereum. The project offers several attractive features that make it appealing to Stellar holders: Exclusive Presale Bonuses: Early investors receive bonus tokens with each purchase. This will serve as an incentive before the official token launch on exchanges. Lowest Token Price: During the presale, investors can secure 1Fuel at the lowest possible price. However, the token price is expected to increase by more than 20x after launch. Secure Cold Storage Solutions: One of the standout features is integrated cold storage. This ensures that investors’ assets are kept offline and protected from online threats. Cross-Chain and P2P Transactions: 1Fuel’s wallet allows for seamless, one-click cross-chain transactions and secure peer-to-peer trading. Conclusion With Stellar struggling amid market downturns, the 1Fuel presale offers an attractive opportunity for investors. By entering the presale, it offers diversification and potentially high returns at the same time. Its Formula 1 sponsorship, secure storage solutions, and exclusive presale bonuses position it as a promising project in the crypto landscape. While a 20x return is not guaranteed, the project’s innovative features and growing investor interest make it one to watch closely.

The initial coin offering of XYZVerse has surpassed $6 million, capturing the interest of investors and enthusiasts alike. This unexpected surge prompts questions about its influence on PEPE’s price predictions. What factors are driving this excitement, and why is XYZVerse becoming the focal point of crypto discussions? $XYZ Targets 99,900% Growth, Unlocking G.O.A.T. Status XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game. With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project. What sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth. Fueled by the sports mentality , the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors and rocket to the moon on Elon Musk’s mission. $XYZ is on its way to the winner’s podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price.

The $XYZ presale is already smashing through stages with the speed of a champion’s knockout blow. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! From Meme to Millionaires: The Rise of PEPE Coin PEPE is the latest star in the world of cryptocurrencies. Launched on Ethereum, it’s a deflationary memecoin inspired by the famous Pepe the Frog internet meme created by Matt Furie. Pepe the Frog became a global sensation in the early 2000s, and now PEPE coin aims to ride that wave of popularity. Unlike other complicated projects, PEPE keeps things simple. There’s no tax on transactions, and the team is clear that this coin has no utility beyond being a meme. It’s all about fun and tapping into the community spirit that has made other coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin so popular. In late April to May 2023, PEPE took the crypto world by storm. Its market cap soared to $1.6 billion, making early holders millionaires overnight. This explosive growth ignited what some call a “memecoin season,” with many new meme-based coins launching and experiencing wild price swings. The PEPE roadmap is ambitious, aiming for listings on major exchanges and a “meme takeover.” Whether PEPE is an attractive investment now depends on your appetite for risk and belief in the power of memes. With the upcoming Bitcoin halving cycle, some enthusiasts hope for a new bull run that could lift PEPE to new heights. But as with all cryptocurrencies, especially meme coins, the market is unpredictable. Conclusion While coins like PEPE are promising, XYZVerse stands out as the first all-sport memecoin, merging sports enthusiasm with meme culture and aiming for massive growth.

33767162,[object Object],1739196047,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Crypto News Weekly Recap: Trump’s Tariff War, the Rise of AI Meme Coins, and New P2E Games",https://bitcoinist.com/weekly-recap-trumps-tariffs-ai-meme-coins-p2e-games/,"We’re back with our weekly crypto recap. If Trump’s presidency means one thing, it’s that there’ll be no shortage of crypto news. This past week, the newly inaugurated president (along with his immediate family and friends) continued to make headlines in crypto circles. We also witnessed noteworthy developments in AI and gaming. Here’s a recap of what happened in crypto recently: Trump’s tariffs shook the crypto and stock markets Eric Trump says buy the dip as $ETH lost over 20% in value Trump established the first federal wealth fund, and Lummis hinted it could hold $BTC Musk proposed moving all US Treasury operations onto the blockchain Google announced a $75B AI investment plan while its stock dropped 10% Crypto gamers anticipate three exciting new projects Now, let’s zoom in a little. 1. Trump’s 25% Tariffs Shake Up the Market The crypto market faced turbulence, with Bitcoin ($BTC) briefly touching $92K after Trump announced 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports. Canada immediately imposed a counter-tariff, whereas Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum took a more cautious approach. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index entered the Fear zone for the first time since October 2024 and hasn’t yet recovered. The impact rippled through traditional markets as well, with the S&P 500 futures dropping 1.9% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 1.5%. However, there may be more strategic depth to Trump’s tariffs threats than immediate market reactions suggest. Specifically, it could be an attempt to weaken the dollar while maintaining low yields, thus forcing countries to shift from short-term dollar reserves to long-term Treasury bonds. 2. Eric Trump Endorses $ETH in an Attempt to Recover WLFI Portfolio Eric Trump appears to be his father’s main crypto advisor, as evident from his involvement with World Liberty Finance (WLFI) and the official $TRUMP meme coin. Last Monday, the presidential son tweeted ‘ it’s a great time to add $ETH ’ as the token dipped some 20% (on the back of Trump’s tariff war, that is). $ETH’s price subsequently rose from $2.3K to $2.7K. Eric Trump’s $ETH advocacy makes sense given WLFI’s substantial holdings of the asset. The company purchased over $100M in $ETH and $WBTC in January and an additional $5M $ETH last week. With an average $ETH purchase price of $3.3K, WLFI currently faces an unrealized loss of approximately $31M. 3. Trump Creates a Sovereign Wealth Fund, $BTC in Focus Trump signed an executive order to establish America’s first federal sovereign wealth fund . Senator Cynthia Lummis then tweeted it’s a ‘₿ig deal,’ with the Bitcoin ₿, possibly hinting at an upcoming $BTC investment. Unlike traditional strategic reserves that focus on stable assets, sovereign wealth funds have the flexibility to diversify into more dynamic investments – like crypto. This approach would mirror Norway’s sovereign wealth fund strategy, which already has indirect $BTC exposure through investments in companies like MicroStrategy. While Alaska and Texas have been successfully operating state-level sovereign wealth funds for some time, this is an uncharted territory for the federal government. 4. Musk Wants to Move the $1.5T US Treasury on the Blockchain Musk raised eyebrows with his proposal to put the US Treasury on the blockchain – all $1.5T of it. We’re talking about a blockchain that would handle everything from social security checks to federal employee paychecks. In line with the D.O.G.E mission, this would make Treasury management more efficient and enhance transparency, as you could track every dollar the government spends. However, many are skeptical about the idea. Either way, this transition would force over 3M federal employees to start using blockchain technology and push crypto adoption to levels never seen before. 5. Google’s ‘Small’ $75B AI Investment Rattles Wall Street Google CEO Sundar Pichai plans to invest $75B in AI , which he called a ‘small expenditure.’ It’s clear that AI is taking center stage in Google’s strategy, especially given how much of the company’s $95B revenue last year was tied to AI-related services. While Google’s yearly revenue increased 12%, Wall Street seemed jittery about this spending plan, which sent Alphabet Inc. shares down 10%. However, Google has no other option to stay ahead of the Silicon Valley AI race. Microsoft isn’t far behind with its $80B AI infrastructure plan. Meta and Amazon are also pouring substantial resources into AI. Capital inflows into the AI sector mean that AI meme coins and AI agent tokens might see more upside this year. 6. New in Crypto Gaming: Super Bowl NFTs, GTA 6, StepMania In other crypto news, Mythical Games launched a Super Bowl promotion for NFL Rivals, its NFT mobile football game. The two-week event features 30 new player cards from the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles. Meanwhile, streamers Adin Ross and FaZe Banks plan to create a crypto-focused custom server for the upcoming GTA 6. However, they might face challenges given Rockstar Games’ 2022 ban on crypto and NFTs in GTA Online servers. In other crypto game news, a new move-to-earn (M2E) fitness app, StepMania, is now available on Telegram. It takes inspiration from StepN, a 2021 M2E game that attracted 5.6M users with its unique mechanic and sneaker NFTs. 7. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) Could Benefit From the AI Race and Trump’s Policies Trump’s pro-crypto strategy, shared by Eric Trump and Elon Musk, is bullish for the entire altcoin sector. That’s particularly true for AI tokens like MIND of Pepe ($MIND) in light of the current Big Tech AI race. MIND of Pepe is a self-sovereign agent that runs on Ethereum. It can analyze market data, deliver exclusive insights to its token holders, engage in discussions on social media, and even launch its own projects (including crypto games). Currently on presale, one $MIND token costs $0.0032924, but the price will increase in 14 hours. The project has raised $5.6M so far, and early adopters have staked 859B tokens at a 407% APY. After $MIND hits the ground running and lists on DEX, it could surge 10X , especially now that Eric Trump has endorsed the Ethereum ecosystem. This Week in Crypto – The Low Down This week, all eyes are on Trump’s crypto agenda and the AI sector. The effect of federal policy decisions on market movements is undeniable, so we can only hope the upcoming days will bring good news. Uncertainty forces investors to seek utility-focused projects like MIND of Pepe . Its data-backed market insights and ability to autonomously launch new projects make it one of the best presales in 2025 . As always, however, be sure to DYOR and keep a cool head. The current crypto market is extremely volatile, so diversify your portfolio and only invest as much as you can afford to lose.",Altcoin News|Crypto News,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-10 14:00:47

Analysts Weigh In,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/how-high-can-dogecoin-go-if-bitcoin-hits-1-million-analyst-weighs-in/,"Long a wild card in the crypto scene, Dogecoin (DOGE) has been riding the waves of excitement, community passion, and even Bitcoin’s price swings. Related Reading: $350K Bitcoin? Crypto Investment Firm CEO Predicts Massive Surge Speculation on the potential price pinnacle of Dogecoin is growing given Bitcoin’s present price hovering at $96,000-97k, and some analysts predicting a whopping $1 million valuation over the next decade. The Course Of Bitcoin Towards $1 Million Several business analysts, including Jack Dorsey and Robert Kiyosaki, have noted Bitcoin’s possible price ascent to $1 million by 2030. Echoing this view, investment company Bernstein thinks that the flagship cryptocurrency might reach the mark by 2033. Should this occur, the market capitalization of Bitcoin would surpass $20 trillion, therefore outpacing the present value of gold. Founder and CEO of publicly traded Wall Street Bitcoin miner IREN (NASDAQ: IREN), Daniel Roberts contends that rising institutional adoption combined with Bitcoin’s better qualities as a digital store of value might propel the value of the cryptocurrency to unprecedented levels. “If you consider Bitcoin’s historical price trajectory, I’d be surprised if we’re not at a $1 million by 2030 given the traction of ETFs and institutional buying now,” Roberts forecasted, quoted by Livewire Markets. The ascent of Bitcoin to this astronomical level most certainly will start a market-wide frenzy. Historically, altcoins have trailed behind BTC and frequently show even more percentage increases. Many think Dogecoin would see even more extreme climb if Bitcoin skyrocketed by 900% to $1 million. Historic Performance Of Dogecoin Vs. Bitcoin Originally developed as a joke, Dogecoin has outperformed the rise in many bull markets of Bitcoin. Bitcoin has risen by over 100% over the past year; Dogecoin has flown by over 200%. This tendency implies that, should another parabolic run take place, Dogecoin might beat Bitcoin in the percentage department. A 940% gain in accordance with Bitcoin’s expected rally at its present price of $0.25 would drive Dogecoin to about $2.60. But considering the Dogecoin’s track record of surpassing expectations, several experts feel a $10 price tag is not out of the question. Market Development And Meme Coin Mania Given Bitcoin’s leading stake, the larger crypto market might explode to over $40 trillion even if the market value of Bitcoin approaches $20 trillion. This would create an atmosphere where meme coins like Dogecoin, which depend on retail buzz and community support, might achieve a record-shattering price explosion. Related Reading: Final Dip? Dogecoin Correction Could Precede A Record Surge—Analyst In past cycles, speculative trading, celebrity sponsorships, and social media trends have often drove Dogecoin’s price behavior. The meme coin is more erratic than others since the participation of people like Elon Musk has traditionally set off fast DOGE price increases. Reasonable DOGE Expectations By 2030 Although other forecasts—like those of Telegaon—suggest that Dogecoin might reach between $13 and $18 by 2030—these projections remain hypothetical. DOGE would probably need more utility, more acceptance in payments, and continuous retail interest to approach double digits.

There have been countless startups on the Web3 side, all claiming to be the one to make it happen. But mainstream blockchain payments just aren’t here yet. Why is that? Is it a problem with the crypto community, the mainstream’s understanding of what crypto is? The business community and their hesitancy to accept a new payment type? Well…yes. It seems to be all of that, which is why this seemingly incredible technology hasn’t caught on. The question then is, what can we do to fix this? The good news is that we’ve seen some of the more spectacular failures and can learn from them. We know some of the fears, misunderstandings, and incentives that drive the behavior of consumers and businesses. Let’s focus on these and see if blockchain payments are ready to serve this market. It turns out that more and more blockchain payment platforms have elements of what it will take, and the decentralized payment system Nimiq may just have all the pieces. Blockchain Payments Should Be Great. Why Aren’t They? The promise of blockchain payments is really incredible. Fast, easy, borderless, tiny fees, and secure accounts. What’s not to like? Well, there are a few other problems that hamper these features, and there are a few other big issues that prevent customers from experiencing the benefits. There are a growing number of blockchain platforms that are developing more seamless payment processes that mimic the debit/credit card. Some even have a card as the primary transaction device. This goes a long way to reach those who like the traditional use of cards, because it acts in many ways just like another card. But this also is the problem. Many people who use traditional payment cards and are comfortable with the system simply aren’t looking for anything new. They like this system, it works for them. And the vast majority have knowledge on crypto from what they have heard from mainstream media sources. These sources aren’t necessarily providing false information, but they are focused on topics like crypto scams, the price of Bitcoin (without explaining how that might affect the average person), and the “crypto bro” stereotype. This doesn’t leave a lot of goodwill for an approachable payment system with real benefits. Businesses too have been hesitant toward crypto payments. While the crypto card, when partnered with a traditional banking company, can act with a business’ current system, that doesn’t help if the people don’t want those cards. Why would businesses care about crypto payments? Because the fees for traditional card payments is about 3%, which can make or break a business’ profit margin. If you asked a business if they would like to get rid of this 3% weight around their neck, they would clearly be interested. This is the key benefit of blockchain payments for businesses, so the crypto community needs to make the setup for payments more beneficial and cheaper than the card fees they currently pay. Finally, you have people who are somewhat interested in trying a new payment type, either out of curiosity, a distrust of traditional systems, or because they are already involved in crypto. This group is growing but not enough to push the mass adoption for payments. However, if you combine this group with the average customer, and show them real benefits of switching, then you might be able to make real change. Since many people sign up for rewards programs, this might be easier than we think. The focus of selling the crypto payment idea should focus on these rewards. The average customer doesn’t care about security and doesn’t care about low fees. This is because the average customer already feels secure with their traditional payments, and is accustomed to not paying fees when they use their card (after all, that fee is paid by the business). What will drive change is offering enough of a reward to overcome the discomfort the average person will undergo when switching to crypto payments. This, and ensuring that the security and fees are as good as traditional methods. Making the Change As mentioned above, the non-profit and open-source project Nimiq might be closest to making this happen, for a few key reasons. First, they have all the necessary elements in place. The platform is secure, it has gas abstraction to simplify and minimize fees, and its potential for scalability is set to go. Because it has a Proof-of-Stake algorithm meant for payment functionality, it can give 1-second confirmations and over 1,000 TPS. Again, while the Web3 crowd might be impressed by these metrics, the average consumer won’t be. That’s okay though, because the experience they will have will at least match the convenience of traditional payments, and that is an absolute must for paving the way to adoption. What consumers will care about, however, are the rewards and what it takes to get them. Many marketing studies show that we as humans are incredibly fickle about signing up for new things, even when they have rewards. It has to be very easy and quick, or we will bail. Nimiq boasts a less than 20 second onboarding time, which could actually be its greatest advantage. After all, people can’t get excited about blockchain benefits if they never complete the sign-up process. Once they do, however, Nimiq has a few other tricks that will help consumers in the short term, and will help scale up the network in the long term. Most notable of these is a high yield staking program, of up to 15% APY. This is a massive return compared to traditional savings accounts, and is easy to understand since many of the concepts are similar to CDs or other investment instruments. In the long run, the system’s ability to create censorship resistance, and the fact that it includes an in-wallet node, the network will become significantly more robust the more it grows. Rather than straining under its infrastructure, like traditional banks who grow too quickly, the network was made to grow fast. As users join easily, see the rewards quickly and clearly, and experience a secure and convenient process, mass adoption of crypto payments finally has a chance to succeed.

With the bull run here, investors are keenly eyeing exciting options. Well-known names like DOGE and SHIB lead the pack, capturing the attention of both crypto enthusiasts and casual investors. PEPE and BONK also remain popular, drawing interest with their playful origins and vibrant communities. Emerging on the scene is a new contender with significant potential, Mission Briefing: Agent A.I. Known as “The Meme Spy Who Mooned Me,” Agent A.I. is set to make its mark by challenging and redefining the role of artificial intelligence in the meme sector. This project, often humorously described as a Pepe in disguise, aims for massive growth, hinging on community support and strategic plans. Stay tuned to discover how these memecoins are poised to influence the market. Agent A.I. Merges AI Functionality with Viral Meme Coin Appeal Agent A.I. is a new cryptocurrency project that combines AI-driven functionality with the viral appeal of meme coins , two of the most prominent trends today . Interest in AI-driven crypto projects has skyrocketed, with blockchain-based AI solutions gaining more attention from investors. But not all AI tokens are created equal—many simply use “AI” as a marketing buzzword without offering real value. Where Agent A.I. Fits in the Crypto-AI Boom In contrast, Agent A.I. aims to blend AI innovation with blockchain utility , while also calling out projects that fail to live up to their AI claims. This approach helps Agent A.I. stand out in an increasingly crowded space. Agent A.I. is designed to be an intelligent and adaptive platform . According to its developers, the project’s AI framework can: Analyze massive datasets in milliseconds to improve decision-making Scale up processing power to match top cloud platforms Continuously refine its performance, learning and adapting over time. The development team behind Agent A.I. is focused on expanding both AI capabilities and blockchain integration, ensuring the technology evolves alongside the crypto market. A Smart Presale Strategy for Early Investors Agent A.I. has decided to go with a community-driven presale model, giving early supporters access to the project at the best prices . The presale has a structured, multi-stage approach, designed to reward early adopters with big discounts: At stage 1, the $AGNT token costs $0.003333333. It will go through 28 stages and reach $0.151515152 by the end of the presale. Those who buy at the first stage get a huge 98% discount . This pricing strategy means that the earlier you invest, the bigger the discount . Secure Your $AGNT Before the Next Price Increase What Makes $AGNT a Compelling Investment Choice Agent A.I. combines two of the most attractive elements in today’s crypto market : AI-driven innovation and meme coin virality. The project’s focus on real AI capabilities and community-driven growth positions it as a standout among new crypto launches. With a limited presale supply and increasing price tiers, $AGNT offers early investors the potential for significant returns as adoption grows. The Agent A.I. Community is Growing – Join the Mission Now! Dogecoin in 2025: Is the Memecoin Ready for a Rebound? Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency that started as a joke in 2013, has come a long way. With its Shiba Inu dog logo, it became a fun and friendly alternative to more serious coins like Bitcoin. Its creators wanted to make digital currency accessible and less intimidating. Technically, Dogecoin is based on Litecoin and uses the Scrypt algorithm for mining. There’s no limit to how many coins can be made, which is different from Bitcoin’s capped supply. This means new Dogecoins keep entering the market. Transactions are quick, making it practical for everyday use. Back in May 2021, Dogecoin hit an all-time high of $0.7376. This surge was driven by social media buzz and celebrity support, notably from Elon Musk. However, it lost much of its value afterward. By 2025, it hasn’t returned to those heights, but it still holds a place in the crypto world. Predictions about Dogecoin’s future vary. Some experts think it could reach around $0.94 by 2030, while others are less optimistic. Competition from other coins like Litecoin and Shiba Inu adds to the challenge. Whether Dogecoin is an attractive option now depends on your view of its potential. Its strong community and fast transactions are positives. But as with all cryptocurrencies, it’s important to research and consider the risks before getting involved. Shiba Inu’s Journey: Will SHIB Soar Again in 2025? Shiba Inu, launched in 2020, began as a meme coin aiming to ride Dogecoin’s hype. It quickly gained attention from figures like Vitalik Buterin and Elon Musk. Built on Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard, SHIB became popular for payments and investment. The creators expanded SHIB’s utility by launching a decentralized exchange and NFT projects. These attracted more users, setting SHIB apart from other meme coins by providing actual use cases beyond being just a joke. After soaring in 2021, SHIB’s price settled between $0.00001 and $0.00002, showing less volatility. By 2025, SHIB has continued building its ecosystem with a metaverse, games, and merchandise, laying the foundation for potential growth. With its expanded infrastructure, SHIB may be well-positioned in the current market. A new crypto bull run could bring in users to its platforms. However, competition from new meme coins could challenge SHIB if it doesn’t keep evolving. Some analysts predict SHIB could appreciate significantly, possibly reaching new highs, though this would require substantial buying. Long-term forecasts see growth potential, but as always, the crypto market is unpredictable. From Meme to Market: The Rise of PEPE Coin In the early 2000s, Matt Furie’s cartoon frog, Pepe, became an internet sensation. This beloved meme has now leaped into the world of cryptocurrency as PEPE, a deflationary token on the Ethereum network. Embracing simplicity and fun, PEPE has captured the hearts of crypto enthusiasts worldwide. PEPE is known for its straightforward approach. The project’s goals are humorously outlined in three phases: Meme, Vibe and HODL, and Meme Takeover. There’s no complex jargon or unrealistic promises—just a strong community rallying behind a familiar face. This genuine appeal has set PEPE apart in a crowded market. By 2025, PEPE has experienced significant price movements. Its journey to an all-time high in December 2024 showcased the power of community-driven tokens. While the token saw a notable price correction afterward, the enthusiasm around it remains palpable. PEPE’s volatility reflects the dynamic nature of meme coins and their reliance on market sentiment. In the current market cycle, PEPE stands alongside giants like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Its potential lies in its ability to stay relevant and keep the community engaged. The meme coin season has highlighted PEPE’s unique position, capturing attention with its nostalgic roots and straightforward mission. Looking ahead, experts have shared varying perspectives on PEPE’s trajectory. Some believe in its continued rise due to technical indicators and market trends. Others suggest caution, noting potential seller pressures. Regardless, PEPE’s story is a testament to how a simple meme can evolve into a significant player in the crypto world. Bonk (BONK): The Meme Coin Shaking Up Solana in 2025 Bonk (BONK) is a meme coin on the Solana blockchain. Unlike many that run on Ethereum, BONK uses Solana’s speed and low costs. It’s mainly used for payments between users, aiming to boost liquidity on Solana. Since its launch in December 2022, BONK’s price soared along with SOL. It offers an alternative to popular meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Its growth reflects the search for faster, cheaper blockchain solutions. By 2025, BONK has shown impressive growth. Its market cap increased significantly, surpassing expectations. This rise mirrors the wider acceptance of Solana-based projects and interest in innovative tokens. Looking ahead, experts have mixed views. Some, like Subhash Chandra, are bullish, believing the next crypto bull market will lift BONK higher. Others, like Peter Henn, are cautious due to the anonymity of its founders and a basic white paper. Long-term predictions suggest BONK could continue rising. Some forecasts see it reaching new highs by 2030, depending on market trends and adoption. As always, investors should stay informed and weigh the risks. Conclusion DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and BONK have been influential in the memecoin market, but their short-term potential appears limited. Their initial surges may have plateaued, making significant immediate gains less likely despite the ongoing bullish trend. In contrast, Agent A.I. introduces a fresh opportunity by directly challenging counterfeit AI tokens. With a capped supply of 5 billion tokens and a community-driven presale offering substantial early discounts, it positions itself for considerable growth.

With key U.S. data ahead, traders are on edge — will BTC hold support or break lower? Table of Contents Bitcoin faces uncertainty A big week for economic data Volatility ahead? Bitcoin faces uncertainty Bitcoin ( BTC ) is treading on shaky ground as it struggles to reclaim six figures, with investors bracing for key economic data that could dictate the market’s next move. On Jan. 20, Bitcoin soared to a record $109,114, coinciding with Donald Trump ’s inauguration as the 47th U.S. president. Since then, it has dropped about 11%, trading at $97,300 as of Feb. 10. Trump’s latest tariff talk has added to market volatility. On Jan. 9, he signaled that a 25% blanket tariff on steel and aluminum imports was on the table, alongside “reciprocal tariffs” on every country. Trump 25% import tariff of Steel and Aluminum will impact these countries https://t.co/TGTjtZfDkT pic.twitter.com/PPko6bUJFw — David Lee (@DavidLe76335983) February 9, 2025 A formal announcement is expected as early as Feb. 11 or 12, with steel tariffs possibly taking effect even sooner on Feb. 10. On Feb. 1, the U.S. imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% on Chinese goods, rattling global financial markets — including crypto. While sentiment somewhat stabilized after a temporary rollback of these tariffs, markets remain fragile, awaiting clarity on the next steps. Another concerning sign is that MACD 12,26, a widely used momentum indicator, has turned negative for the first time since October 2024. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence measures the difference between two moving averages — the 12-day and 26-day Exponential Moving Averages — to track momentum shifts. The last time MACD turned negative was in April 2024; it stayed that way for about six months. During that period, Bitcoin fell from $64,000 in late Apr. to $49,000 by August 2024, a 23% decline, before the trend finally reversed. BTC price chart with MACD indicator | Source: crypto.news Now, with macro risks piling up and key economic data set for release, could Bitcoin regain its strength and push back toward six figures, or is a deeper correction ahead? A big week for economic data Bitcoin’s fate this week hangs in the balance as a flurry of key economic data approaches. With inflation numbers, labor market updates, and Federal Reserve signals all set to drop in the coming days, investors are on high alert. Each data point has the potential to shift market sentiment, influence rate expectations, and dictate the next big move for risk assets, including crypto. CPI inflation report Markets will get their first major macro trigger at 8:30 a.m. ET on Wed., Feb. 12, when the Consumer Price Index report for January is released. CPI, a key inflation gauge, measures the cost of living and is closely watched by investors. Analysts anticipate that consumer prices increased by 2.9% year-over-year, the same rate as in December. Meanwhile, core CPI, which excludes the more volatile food and energy prices, is predicted to ease slightly to 3.1% from 3.2% in December. On a month-to-month basis, the overall CPI is projected to dip to 0.3% in January, down from 0.4% in December. However, core CPI is believed to have risen to 0.3% from the previous 0.2%. CPI inflation swaps for January currently point to a 2.9% increase in headline CPI, aligning with analysts’ expectations. However, if the actual figure falls below these expectations, markets might price in additional rate cuts from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which could lead to a weaker dollar and may also boost riskier assets, such as Bitcoin. On the other hand, if inflation remains persistent or exceeds expectations, it could prompt the Fed to slow or pause its easing cycle. This outcome would likely weigh on the performance of risk assets, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Powell’s testimony holds the key All eyes will be on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as he testifies before Congress on Feb. 11-12, offering the latest insights into monetary policy. The hearing, hosted by the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, is part of the Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to Congress, where Powell will address economic conditions, inflation, and interest rates. Markets are watching for any hint about the Fed’s next move. Since September 2024, the central bank has cut rates by 100 basis points, bringing them to 4.25%-4.50% as inflation cooled from its 2022 highs. However, Powell has cautioned that the fight against inflation isn’t over. If he signals a slower pace of rate cuts, the U.S. dollar could strengthen, putting pressure on Bitcoin. Conversely, any indication that cuts may accelerate could drive bullish momentum for crypto and stocks. Jobless claims and producer prices The next key data release arrives on Thu., Feb. 13, with the initial jobless claims report and the Producer Price Index. Jobless claims will offer a fresh look at the labor market. The latest data from the last week of January showed initial claims rising to 219,000, above expectations, while continuing claims climbed to 1.88 million. The figures suggest a slight softening in the job market, consistent with expectations that higher rates are slowing economic activity. At the same time, PPI data will provide insight into wholesale inflation, which often signals future consumer price trends. If producer prices continue cooling, it could reinforce the view that inflation is easing, strengthening the case for additional Fed rate cuts. However, if PPI comes in higher than expected, markets may see it as a sign that inflation risks persist, prompting a more cautious outlook. Retail sales and consumer strength The final major data point arrives on Feb. 14 with the release of U.S. retail sales figures. Consumer spending is a key driver of economic growth, and the report will indicate whether households are cutting back or continuing to spend despite higher interest rates. A slowdown in retail sales could signal weakening economic conditions, strengthening the Fed’s case for additional rate cuts—potentially benefiting Bitcoin. Conversely, if spending remains strong, it may suggest that inflationary pressures persist, making the Fed more cautious and keeping liquidity tighter, which could cap crypto’s upside. Volatility ahead? Crypto analysts are sizing up Bitcoin’s next move as a key week unfolds, with economic data and Fed’s signals set to shake up market sentiment. Michaël van de Poppe remains firmly in the bullish camp, suggesting that Bitcoin could test $105,000 this week and possibly break into new all-time highs before the month is over. Good start of the week for #Bitcoin , which likely leads to a strong green week. I won't be surprised that we'll test $105K this week and have a new all-time high in February. pic.twitter.com/J2jRLwcQ9i — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) February 10, 2025 His optimism hinges on macro conditions aligning in Bitcoin’s favor — meaning inflation needs to show further cooling, and Powell must leave the door open for rate cuts to come sooner rather than later. If markets sense that liquidity conditions will ease faster than expected, Bitcoin could swiftly reverse its recent losses and climb back toward six figures. But not everyone is convinced that the market is ready for another leg up just yet. Analyst Decode warns that $91,000 is a key level to watch, and if Bitcoin fails to hold it, the drop could be fast and steep, dragging prices into the $70,000 before any meaningful recovery. Bitcoin Alternate Count – What happens if 91k breaks? It's definitely good to sit down and challenge your own bias, and this is therefore my current alternate idea. Below 91k I think we would see a fast precipitous drop into the 70s, but, I don't think it would be a sign that… https://t.co/LFMGI68kpM pic.twitter.com/FAKlj2ANQY — Decode (@decodejar) February 9, 2025 While he doesn’t believe the bull cycle is over, he suggests that Bitcoin may be in for an extended and more complex move rather than a straight shot upward.

However, the market outlook still remains bullish for the mid-term. By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The USDT Paired Chart On the USDT pair, the asset has recently broken below a large rising wedge pattern after failing to climb above the $3.5 resistance zone. The $3 level is also lost now, as the price is consolidating around the $2.5 mark. Yet, while a deeper correction toward the $2 level is probable, the overall trend remains bullish as long as XRP is trading above its 200-day moving average, currently located around the $1.3 mark. The BTC Paired Chart The price action on the XRP/BTC pair’s daily chart is very similar to that of the USDT pair, as the market has dropped below the ascending channel demonstrated on it and is likely to decline toward the 2,000 SAT, with the RSI indicating that momentum is bearish. Yet, as long as the 200-day moving average remains below that level, Ripple will probably appreciate in value against Bitcoin.

Many investors have watched the ups and downs of Pepe with keen interest. Recent reports show that the coin may have reached its peak and the future looks uncertain. At the same time, smart investors are now turning to a new token called Remittix. Remittix offers a practical fix for slow, high-cost international payments. Its strong performance and clear purpose have led many experts to call it one of the best cryptos to buy. Its current DeFi coin price is attractive and early returns have been very strong. PEPE: What the Price Prediction Suggests Pepe once grabbed attention with wild price jumps. However, recent figures show that the Pepe price has come under pressure. Some experts now predict that Pepe may soon hit a plateau at a $100 billion market cap. The coin has seen large swings and many investors worry about its sustainability. Market data shows that the Pepe price has dropped by nearly half in some recent periods. Investors are looking at the PEPE Price Predictions to see how the coin might perform next. News highlights that many holders are rethinking their positions. Some large traders have sold off significant amounts, which has added to the downward pressure. This change has left many wondering if Pepe can recover to its past glory. While Pepe has had its moment of fame, the current price trends make it a less attractive hold. For this reason, the Pepe price predictions are quite modest. For those who want steady long-term gains, other tokens like Remittix look to hold more promise. Remittix: The New Altcoin with 200x Potential Remittix has caught the eye of investors as a token with real-world use. Remittix tackles the problem of slow and costly international payments. It offers a system that speeds up transactions and cuts costs. Instead of relying on extra steps that traditional banks require, Remittix uses blockchain to connect payments directly with local banks. The project has already sold over 450 million tokens during its ongoingICO, which shows strong early support. Its current DeFi coin price sits at about $0.0567. Many experts believe Remittix could deliver returns that multiply its value by up to 200x. This bold promise has made it a hot topic among those who search for the best crypto to buy. Remittix does more than offer a quick fix; it provides a solution that can ease international payments, making them quicker and cheaper. Remittix does not stick to the usual story of tokens that only look good on paper. The team behind it has built a platform that cuts out many steps found in traditional financial systems. For example, instead of waiting days for a transfer to complete, Remittix can help send funds in a matter of hours. This improvement could boost global trade by making it easier for businesses and individuals to send money across borders. The project also puts a strong focus on security. The team has completed careful tests on its smart contracts. They locked liquidity pools and team tokens for three years. These steps give investors confidence in the token's long-term prospects. Remittix shows that a token built to solve real problems can perform well. Its practical use and clear benefits stand out in a busy market. As more people use digital payments, the need for fast, low-cost transfers grows. Remittix meets this need with a system that is simple to use. Its design makes it easy for anyone to send money internationally without dealing with high fees or delays. This clear benefit has caught the attention of many and it explains why Remittix is seen as a rising star with the potential to turn a 200x return into reality. The latest trends show that while Pepe may hit a $100 billion market cap this cycle, its current price weakness leaves many investors cautious. The recent drop in Pepe price and the underwhelming Pepe price prediction suggest that many may soon move their funds elsewhere. At the same time, Remittix offers a real solution to a major global problem. Its ability to cut down the cost and time of international payments makes it a promising token for the future. With a current DeFi coin price of around $0.0567 and 450 million tokens sold in its ICO, Remittix has attracted strong early support. Many experts now call Remittix one of the best cryptos to buy for long-term growth. Its promise of potentially 200x returns sets it apart as a token with both high potential and clear practical use. Investors looking for steady growth and real-world impact may find that Remittix is the token to watch as global payments shift toward faster, cheaper solutions.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/japan-is-preparing-to-recognize-cryptocurrencies-as-financial-products-here-are-the-details/,"Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) is preparing to reclassify crypto assets as financial products, aligning them more closely with traditional securities. Japan to Recognize Crypto as Financial Product, Consider Tax Cuts and Bitcoin Spot ETFs The proposed regulatory overhaul is expected to include tax cuts and the long-awaited approval of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Under the new framework, the current tax rate on crypto gains, which can be as high as 55%, could be reduced to 20%, bringing it into line with the taxation of equity investments. Separately, the FSA is considering lifting the current ban on Bitcoin spot ETFs, a move that could boost institutional investment in digital assets. Timeline for Reform The formal policy announcement is expected to be made in June 2025, with legislative changes expected to be made during the 2026 regular session of the National Diet. If approved, these reforms would mark a significant shift in Japan's approach to cryptocurrency regulation and make the country one of the most crypto-friendly jurisdictions globally. The proposed changes could have a major impact on Japan's crypto ecosystem by attracting both retail and institutional investors by providing a more favorable tax environment and new investment products such as Bitcoin ETFs.

This time, it was President Trump’s announcement of a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum that sent ripples through the markets, creating a brief period of uncertainty. The move came as traders were already on edge, awaiting Jerome Powell’s testimony and the release of the highly anticipated Consumer Price Index (CPI) data Tariff Concerns and Potential Sanctions on Japan Fuel Market Uncertainty QCP Capital traders pointed out that with Mexico and Canada being among the top three suppliers of steel and aluminum to the U.S., the new tariffs have raised concerns about the recent delay and could spark fresh trade tensions. Adding to this, Trump’s comments about potential sanctions on Japan—after the U.S. blocked Nippon Steel’s attempt to buy U.S. Steel—have added more uncertainty to the situation, leaving markets uneasy. Tariffs create economic uncertainty, which results in investros moving away from riskier assets like crypto. Some traders predict ether (ETH) could face more losses, as the bitcoin-ether ratio drops and investors favor BTC. This could also hurt related assets like dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum-based DeFi tokens. Commodities held steady, while Asian stocks saw a small decline. Meanwhile, Bitcoin briefly fell to $95K before making a quick rebound. QCP highlighted that this move seems driven more by market sentiment rather than any real shift in risk appetite. With Bitcoin’s volatility now favoring put options until April, signaling that there’s a lack of bullish catalysts in the market. More Volatility Ahead? Furthermore, it highlighted that a feedback loop is starting to form, as President Donald Trump, known for his sensitivity to market reactions, now faces a market that’s questioning his decisions. This could push him to act more boldly, adding to the market volatility. This growing uncertainty, along with Bitcoin’s volatility and market reactions, suggests that traders should be prepared for more fluctuations ahead. The next few weeks could bring key events that will influence both global markets and crypto assets. Besides, as inflation concerns grow, investors are anticipating only one interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve this year, casting a gloomy outlook for risk assets like crypto.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|TRADING|ASIA|COMMODITY|REGULATION|BUSINESS|DOGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-10 15:36:40

Dogecoin Price Sends Meme Fans to Rival Utility Coin For Stability,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/miss-gary-gensler-dogecoin-price-sends-meme-fans-to-rival-utility-coin-for-stability,"Gary Gensler brought strict regulations that some believe limited the growth of the crypto industry. However, there’s optimism now that the crypto regulatory landscape could shift in favor of more innovation. Amidst this shift, DTX Exchange , an emerging utility token, is gaining attention which has already raised over $13.5 million in its public presale and is available for $0.16 per token. Meanwhile, the Dogecoin price has been declining, prompting many meme coin enthusiasts to seek out more stable alternatives like DTX instead of DOGE. Let’s find out how the new administration could change the crypto market. Dogecoin Price Decline: Is It Time for Investors to Look Elsewhere? DOGE was initially launched as a meme-inspired cryptocurrency which was the leading market sentiment. However, now Dogecoin price is trading around $0.25 with a significant decline of 25% in the last 30 days. This sharp decline has raised concerns among DOGE holders about the future of the project. Source: CoinMarketCap The resignation of former SEC Chairperson Gary Gensler had the market thinking about its future. But even with high optimism, the crypto market, including DOGE, hasn't been able to meet expectations. Technically, the Dogecoin price has seen a decline which is also indicated by moving averages that indicate a strong selling pressure for DOGE. One of the major causes of concern for DOGE is its lack of fundamental backing. This lack of value could make it highly susceptible when the market shifts toward innovative projects. As a result of the Dogecoin price, meme coin fans are moving their funds into utility tokens like DTX Exchange. DTX Exchange: A Stable Alternative After Gary Gensler Departure As the Dogecoin price continues to fluctuate, more investors are looking for stable, utility-driven platforms like DTX Exchange . This platform is a rising star that focuses on providing a secure, high-speed, and user-friendly environment for crypto trading. While meme coins like DOGE thrive on sentiment, DTX Exchange could offer a more stable approach and makes it an attractive option for those seeking reliability. DTX Exchange is built on the VulcanX blockchain which is designed to handle over 200,000 transactions per second. This ultra-fast transaction speed means you can execute trades and transfers without delays, even during peak market activity. Moreover, this feature is beneficial for traders who need to make quick decisions in a volatile market. Security is also an important part of DTX. The wallet that DTX will provide is the Phoenix wallet which will have quantum-proof technology to protect users’ assets. With increasing concerns over cybersecurity in the crypto space, this added layer of protection sets DTX apart from many other platforms. DTX Exchange Presale Attracting Investor Interest DTX Exchange’s presale has been a resounding success, raising over $13.5 million and attracting numerous registered wallets. Currently, the project is in stage 8 of public presale and is the last chance for investors to get DTX tokens for just $0.16 before it surges in price. According to the DTX roadmap, the project is set to be launched in over 41 countries in Q1 of 2025 at a $0.20 listing price. The current presale momentum is mainly because of DTX’s unique hybrid model that combines the security of centralized exchanges with the speed and transparency of decentralized platforms. Conclusion While meme coins like DOGE have had their moments, the volatility and lack of fundamental backing leave many searching for stable alternatives, especially with Gary Gensler now out of the picture. With the Dogecoin price not being able to recover, emerging tokens like DTX Exchange with its strong presale success and innovative features are attracting meme coin enthusiasts. This project potentially stands out as a better alternative for investors who want to move beyond the hype of meme coins.

Dogecoin's Drop Drives Meme Fans to a More Reliable Coin,https://bitzo.com/2025/02/missing-gary-gensler-already-dogecoins-drop-drives-meme-fans-to-a-more-reliable-coin,"Gary Gensler implemented tough regulations that some argue stifled the crypto industry's growth. However, there is now hope that the regulatory environment will shift to encourage more innovation. Amidst these changes, the DTX Exchange , a new utility token, is catching the eye of many, having already accumulated over $13.5 million during its public presale, with tokens priced at $0.16 each. At the same time, Dogecoin's price is on the decline, leading many enthusiasts of meme coins to seek more stable options like DTX rather than sticking with DOGE. Let's delve into how the incoming administration might transform the crypto landscape. Dogecoin's Price Slide: Should Investors Consider Other Options? Dogecoin started off as a joke-inspired cryptocurrency, capturing the market's humorous side. But now it's trading near $0.25, having dropped 25% over the past month. This steep fall has made DOGE investors worried about the project's future. Source: CoinMarketCap With the former SEC Chairperson Gary Gensler stepping down, the market has been contemplating its future. Despite the optimism, the crypto market, including DOGE, hasn't lived up to expectations. Technically, the falling Dogecoin price is highlighted by moving averages pointing to strong selling pressure for DOGE. A significant issue for DOGE is its lack of underlying value, making it vulnerable when the market leans towards innovative projects. Consequently, fans of meme coins are shifting their investments to utility tokens such as DTX Exchange. DTX Exchange: A Reliable Choice in the Post-Gensler Era With Dogecoin's price instability, more investors are gravitating towards stable, utility-focused platforms like DTX Exchange . This up-and-coming platform emphasizes a secure, fast, and user-friendly trading experience. Unlike meme coins like DOGE that rely on market sentiment, DTX Exchange offers a steadier alternative, making it appealing to those seeking consistency. Built on the VulcanX blockchain, DTX Exchange can process over 200,000 transactions per second. This incredible speed ensures that trades and transfers occur without delays, even during high market activity, which is crucial for traders needing to make rapid decisions in volatile conditions. Security is a priority for DTX as well. The Phoenix wallet, which DTX provides, features quantum-proof technology to safeguard users' assets. Given the growing worries about cybersecurity in the crypto world, this added security measure distinguishes DTX from other platforms. DTX Exchange Presale Drawing Investor Attention The presale of DTX Exchange has been exceptionally successful, amassing over $13.5 million and attracting numerous registered wallets. Currently, the project is in the eighth stage of its public presale, offering a final opportunity for investors to acquire DTX tokens at $0.16 before prices climb. As per the DTX roadmap, the project aims to launch in over 41 countries in Q1 2025, with a listing price of $0.20. The presale's momentum is largely due to DTX's distinctive hybrid model, blending the security of centralized exchanges with the speed and transparency of decentralized platforms. Conclusion While meme coins like DOGE have enjoyed their time in the spotlight, their volatility and lack of solid foundation leave many investors searching for more stable options, particularly with Gary Gensler no longer in the picture. As Dogecoin's price struggles to rebound, emerging tokens like DTX Exchange, with its robust presale performance and innovative features, are attracting the attention of meme coin enthusiasts. This project could stand out as a superior choice for investors looking to move past the meme coin hype.

While both coins bring unique attributes to the table, Pepeto is swiftly taking the lead, largely due to its active presale phase, offering investors a golden opportunity for early entry. Wall Street Pepe has positioned itself as a platform for traders, featuring tools such as alpha calls, trading signals, and staking rewards. The presale has already sold out, signaling strong demand, and an official exchange listing is on the horizon. However, for new investors, this means limited buying opportunities until $WEPE becomes publicly available. Meanwhile, $PEPETO remains in presale, presenting investors with a low-cost entry before a potential price surge. With a robust ecosystem designed for long-term sustainability, Pepeto offers an attractive investment opportunity for those looking to get in early. Pepeto’s Momentum: A New Era for Meme Coins Dubbed the “God of Frogs,” Pepeto is capturing widespread attention due to its strong branding and powerful ecosystem. With a presale price of just $0.000000109 , $PEPETO provides an accessible entry point for investors seeking massive returns. The project offers a zero-fee exchange, an innovative cross-chain bridge, and an attractive staking mechanism with a remarkable 387% APY. These features make Pepeto a strong competitor in the meme coin space. One of the primary drivers of Pepeto’s growth is its rapidly expanding community. The project has amassed over 65,600 followers and continues to gain traction daily. Its creative utilities, engaging marketing strategies, and dynamic narrative have made it one of the most talked-about meme coins. Adding to the excitement, Pepeto is gearing up to launch PepetoSwap, a zero-fee exchange designed to tackle common issues such as high transaction costs and liquidity fragmentation in the meme coin market. Additionally, its cutting-edge cross-chain bridge technology will improve blockchain interoperability, setting new standards for efficiency and convenience. Is Pepeto the Next Big Binance Listing? While Wall Street Pepe is aiming for listings on platforms such as BingX, Gate.io, and MEXC, Pepeto is setting its sights even higher. With immense community engagement, growing momentum, and speculation that an ex-founder of Pepe is backing the project, excitement around $PEPETO is soaring. The token’s 420T supply mirrors that of the original Pepe, reinforcing its credibility and appeal. With a combination of cutting-edge technology, affordability, and viral momentum, Pepeto stands as a strong candidate for a Binance listing. If this milestone is achieved, it could significantly reshape the meme coin market, setting a precedent for future projects. Conclusion: Pepeto Takes the Lead in the Meme Coin Race As competition heats up in the meme coin sector, Pepeto is proving to be a standout contender. With a rapidly growing ecosystem, strong community backing, and a potential Binance listing on the horizon, it offers a compelling investment opportunity. For those seeking the next major breakout in the crypto space, Pepeto remains a top choice.

While Tron focuses on high-speed transactions and decentralized applications, Stellar prioritizes seamless cross-border payments, and Ozak AI integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain for enhanced efficiency and automation. In this analysis, we examine the potential trajectories of these three cryptocurrencies and what investors can expect in the upcoming bull run. Tron (TRX) Price Analysis With a downsloping 50-day moving average, TRON is currently in a bearish trend on the 1-day chart. Its 200-day moving average is sloping upward, suggesting a bullish trend. The RSI is neutral, indicating price stability. TRX is predicted to rise by 5%, reaching $0.285889 with a bullish sentiment. Stellar (XLM) Price Analysis Stellar is following a bearish trend on the 1-day chart, which has a 50-day MA as resistance. It has a 200-day MA, which is sloping upwards, indicating a very strong trend and may act as support. RSI is neutral. XLM can be expected to rise by about 5% at $0.466177 with a bullish sentiment. Ozak AI is gaining popularity with its tokenomics and its features, which are attracting investors’ attention globally. The token of OZ is speculated to hit its $1 target before the end of 2025, while the project is relatively near funding, having already raised upwards of 750k and sold 52,773,977 $OZ tokens in its ongoing 3rd presale phase. Youtube embed: How To Buy $OZ Tokens in Presale? This is the Next 100X Crypto What Investors Can Expect in the Next Crypto Bull Run As the crypto market starts to heat up, most investors look into great use cases and solidly founded coins like Tron, Stellar, and Ozak AI. Each holds a different place in the crypto ecosystem, and understanding their potential during the next bull run is crucial for informed investment decisions. Tron (TRX) Tron has had high transaction throughput and generally low fees, which makes it one of the more popular coins for dApps and smart contracts. During the next bull run, scalability and a strong ecosystem could position Tron as an interesting alternative to Ethereum for both developers and enterprises. A significant upside to the price of TRX could be driven by increased use of DeFi and dApp ecosystems. Stellar (XLM) Stellar is well-positioned for further expansion in the use of blockchain technology within the financial world as it focuses on cross-border payments. The unique partnership that Stellar has forged with major financial institutions and recent integrations into real-world payment systems place XLM in a very good position for a breakout during the bull run. Its low transaction fees and fast settlement times are likely to attract more financial institutions, hence giving XLM a solid growth trajectory. OZAK AI is relatively new in both the AI and crypto worlds. It combines aspects of artificial intelligence with blockchain for decentralized AI services.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting interest for its practical DeFi applications, offering decentralized solutions for lending and borrowing. Unlike assets that rely solely on speculation, MUTM aims to provide lasting value through a well-organized ecosystem that incorporates peer-to-peer lending, a stablecoin, and a buy-and-distribute system to maintain price stability. Currently in its initial presale phase at a price of $0.01, MUTM offers early investors a chance to acquire tokens before prices rise throughout 11 presale phases, ultimately reaching $0.06 at the launch. Analysts are optimistic about the token's potential for growth after listing, viewing it as an undervalued candidate that could challenge established projects like XRP and Solana. Insights into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a formidable force in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, offering a more organized and utility-focused approach than many speculative ventures. The platform provides a versatile system for lending and borrowing, enabling users to supply liquidity for earnings or obtain loans without liquidating their assets. It supports both peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, giving users the flexibility to choose between automated borrowing agreements or personalized dealings with other users. One of Mutuum Finance's standout features is its planned stablecoin, which will be collateral-backed and issued on the Ethereum network. This stablecoin is designed to improve borrowing options within the platform while ensuring price stability. Unlike conventional lending systems where stablecoin liquidity depends on centralized reserves, Mutuum Finance promotes transparency by allowing users to mint stablecoins against their deposited assets. Security is a top concern, with smart contracts slated for an audit by a reputable firm. Mutuum Finance is now in its first presale stage, with tokens priced at $0.01. The final presale stage will see the launch price set at $0.06, making early investment a cost-effective strategy. Demand is on the rise, with over 7 million tokens sold and more than $70,000 raised, as investors take advantage of the favorable pricing. To promote long-term price stability and minimize market fluctuations, the project has implemented a buy-and-distribute mechanism. Part of the fees generated from lending and borrowing activities is used to buy MUTM tokens from the market. These tokens are then distributed among mtToken stakers, encouraging long-term holding and gradually decreasing the token supply. This strategy helps sustain buying pressure and supports a more stable price path after launch. An additional benefit for early investors is the upcoming beta release of Mutuum Finance's platform, set to coincide with its exchange listing. This launch ensures that the token will have immediate practical use, allowing users to engage with the lending and borrowing features from the outset. Having a working product available at launch reduces uncertainty and builds investor trust. To thank early supporters and enhance community involvement, Mutuum Finance is running a $100,000 giveaway. Participants can join by following the project's official channels and fulfilling specific tasks. With a clear plan, a steadily growing base of early backers, and a solid use case in DeFi, Mutuum Finance presents one of the most attractive opportunities in the market. While XRP and Solana continue to be well-established, MUTM is positioning itself as an undervalued option with noteworthy potential. As its presale gains momentum, those acquiring tokens now could see significant returns as the project moves toward full-scale implementation.

Despite a court dismissal last month, early Bitcoin ( BTC ) miner James Howells is considering purchasing the landfill where he believes his lost cryptocurrency, now worth over £620 million ($768 million), is buried. The Newport, South Wales, resident sought a court order to excavate the site or receive $609 million in compensation from the Newport City Council. Howells’ claim revolves around a hard drive that his former partner allegedly discarded in 2013 at the landfill. The device is said to contain 7,500 BTC, which Howells mined in 2009 when Bitcoin was new and traded for mere pennies. The computer engineer has repeatedly petitioned or sued Newport authorities for access to the site, offering the council a share of the fortune in return. The landfill contains over 1.4 million tonnes of waste, but Howells asserts that his drive is likely buried within a 100,000-tonne area, citing an investigation conducted by a team he hired. You might also like: $750m in the trash: Judge rejects man from retrieving Bitcoin from landfill In response, Newport City Council asked the High Court to dismiss Howells’ claims, arguing that local laws grant the government rights over any property that enters the landfill. Judge Andrew John Keyser KC ruled against Howells, stating that his claims were insufficient and that too much time had passed. Authorities also plan to close the site during the 2025-2026 financial year and convert sections of it into a solar farm. Howells expressed shock to the BBC upon hearing the news, “especially since it claimed at the High Court that closing the landfill to allow me to search would have a huge detrimental impact on the people of Newport,” he said. According to the report , Howells is considering escalating the case to the Supreme Court and has not ruled out purchasing the landfill outright. He believes the lost funds could reach a $1.2 billion valuation by 2026 if Bitcoin continues its uptrend.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) and digital assets had an excellent finish in 2024, with increasing usage, adoption, and investor interest growing throughout the year. So, what’s in store for 2025? You might also like: Mind the data gap: DeAI requires more diverse datasets | Opinion Bitcoin has now taken the main stage. Interest from individuals, corporate entities, and governments is now on a substantial uptrend. With talks of countries such as El Salvador, Bhutan, and now the United States expanding strategic Bitcoin reserves and asset management firms acquiring 10s of billions of dollars in new Bitcoin ETF subscriptions, interest from investors remains in 2025, but we “err on the side of caution” as bitcoin gets increasingly popular and loud from investors and pundits. Historically speaking, Bitcoin is closer to a halving cycle at the top than the bottom. This four-year cycle has played out nearly perfectly from the lows seen in 2022. With Bitcoin up over 500% from these levels, are cryptocurrencies entering an overbought phase of the market in 2025? Are the promises of strategic reserves from nation-states enough to keep the market buoyant in 2025? The world is getting increasingly digital. Demand for sovereign, digital money outside the purview of world governments remains attractive as an alternate store of value. Beyond trading, the ownership of blockchain-based assets such as BTC, Ethereum ( ETH ), and others provides owners with the freedom to transact at will, where users have confidence in each coin’s respective monetary policy and vision for the future. Artificial intelligence and autonomous agents remain a key theme for digital assets in 2025. Can AI agents open bank accounts and pass know-your-client checks at traditional banks? Do banking services fulfill the needs of AI agents to conduct transactions in the digital economy in an efficient manner? The answers to these questions are a resounding “no” today—and we believe digital assets are synergistic to AI and will fill these voids. In 2025, we expect that AI agents and other autonomous systems will continue to utilize digital assets just like we humans have since the genesis of Bitcoin. These systems will transact freely between one another and perhaps invent new trust systems on top of blockchains altogether. The possibilities begin to look boundless as both man and machine inch closer towards achieving singularity. To put it differently, human investors will now need to consider utilizing or competing against AI or machine-based investors in the years to come, putting an emphasis on the sheer magnitude of this shifting market landscape. To us, this is something to be both excited about but also cautioned about. Digital asset markets are very reflexive to new anticipated changes in demand. Given the promise of a strategic Bitcoin reserve from the largest economy in the world, the United States, it’s no surprise that the price of Bitcoin has remained buoyed since incoming president Donald J. Trump made these comments in July 2024. Now, with his inauguration complete, investors are doubting whether something like a strategic reserve of Bitcoin is actually possible. Since these facts have been priced in for over six months now, we remain cautiously optimistic about the price of Bitcoin throughout 2025, as we attribute much of the second half of 2024 upmove as being driven by this anticipation. Meanwhile, other smart contract platforms, such as Ethereum or Solana, are well-suited to capture the synergies of AI. By nature, smart contract platforms are “turing-complete” systems, each with their own native coding languages. We foresee these networks not only attracting more AI-based capital for transaction execution but attracting AI-based technological innovation. In 2025, we expect that AI systems will create novel on-chain inventions of their own, solidifying smart contracts as the go-to systems for AI creativity. Increasing interoperability between smart contact networks and AI remains a core focus of our research efforts in 2025. Investors’ eyes will remain fixated on the U.S. Federal Reserve in 2025 as anticipated interest rate cuts have been put in question. A hawkish Fed will certainly impact market liquidity and demand for digital assets as the U.S. dollar gains in strength and attention. We anticipate that 2025 will be a balancing act between dollar demand and persistent innovation, which we are seeing in digital asset markets. Despite anticipated U.S. dollar strength, digital assets still remain outside the scope and control of global governments, and while on-chain economies are not always directly correlated to nation-state economies, investor preferences certainly are—and this will be a key theme to watch in 2025 as nation-state adoption of bitcoin and other digital assets begins to take hold.

As the weekend approaches, investors are looking for the best meme coins to join this week. Three of the many options stand out: Arctic Pablo Coin , Shiba Inu, and Pepe Coin. Each offers a distinct narrative and value proposition, making them worthy considerations for both novice and seasoned crypto enthusiasts. Arctic Pablo Coin: Embark on a Mystical Journey with Promising Returns Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) isn’t just another meme coin; it’s an invitation to an epic adventure. Imagine a daring explorer named Arctic Pablo traversing uncharted icy terrains on his trusty snowmobile, uncovering mystical $APC coins. These tokens symbolize more than just currency; they represent a bridge between myth and reality, offering holders a chance to be part of a thrilling narrative. What sets Arctic Pablo Coin apart is its unique presale structure. Instead of traditional stages, the presale is divided into “locations,” each representing a new chapter in Pablo’s journey. Arctic Pablo has reached Frostburg, the 9th phase of its expedition, with the token priced at $0.000054. Early investors have a golden opportunity here. With a launch price set at $0.008, there’s a potential for over 14,725.93% ROI from the 9th stage to the launch. An investment of $500 would yield approximately 9,268,515 APCs, which could escalate to $74,148.12 upon listing. Arctic Pablo Coin also boasts a deflationary mechanism. Unsold tokens are burned weekly during the presale, and any remaining tokens post-presale will also be burned, enhancing scarcity and value. Additionally, investors can dive into a staking program offering a dazzling 66% Annual Percentage Yield (APY).

It is one of the best new meme coins to join this week . Shiba Inu: The Canine-Themed Powerhouse with a Robust Ecosystem Shiba Inu (SHIB), often dubbed the “Dogecoin killer,” has established itself as a formidable player in the meme coin arena. Launched in August 2020, SHIB quickly gained traction, partly thanks to its vibrant community and the allure of its canine mascot. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, Shiba Inu has developed a comprehensive ecosystem. This includes ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange that allows holders to trade and stake their tokens, and the Shiba Inu Incubator, which fosters innovation within the community. Additionally, the project has ventured into the NFT space with “Shiboshis,” a collection of 10,000 unique NFTs. Currently, SHIB is trading at approximately $0.00001513, with a market capitalization exceeding $7.82 billion. While the token has experienced volatility, its dedicated community and continuous development efforts have contributed to its resilience. Recent initiatives, such as integrating Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) into its protocols, aim to enhance network security and give users more control over their digital identities. Shiba Inu presents a compelling option for investors seeking a meme coin with an established presence and a growing ecosystem. Its ongoing projects and active community engagement suggest potential for sustained growth. Pepe Coin: The Frog Meme Phenomenon with Surging Popularity Inspired by the internet meme “Pepe the Frog,” Pepe Coin (PEPE) has emerged as a notable contender in the meme coin market. Launched in April 2023, PEPE capitalized on its meme origins to build a strong community and achieve impressive market performance. 2024 Pepe Coin outperformed several of its peers, recording a year-to-date increase of 440.74% as of September 5, 2024. This surge was accompanied by significant trading volumes, with real volume peaking at over $3 billion earlier in the year. Currently, PEPE is trading at approximately $0.000000001167. The token’s market capitalization is around $3.04 billion, reflecting its rapid ascent in crypto. Analysts have noted that PEPE’s price movements often exhibit high volatility, presenting both opportunities and risks for investors. While Pepe Coin does not boast an extensive ecosystem like some of its counterparts, its appeal lies in its strong community and the cultural resonance of its meme. For those looking to ride the wave of meme coin hype, PEPE remains a fascinating choice. Conclusion: Which of the Best Meme Coins to Join This Weekend Stands Out?

BlockDAG, XRP, Hedera, Stellar, and Kaspa are all attracting attention due to strong investor interest, significant upgrades, and practical demand. Whether it's due to increasing adoption or revolutionary technology, these altcoins are proving their potential to excel. The key question remains—which altcoin will make the biggest impact this year? Let’s explore further. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): A Blockchain Leader Aiming for 2025 Dominance BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out as a top altcoin to consider for 2025, primarily for its innovative solutions to scalability and speed. Unlike conventional blockchains that face bottlenecks, BlockDAG's DAG-based framework enables simultaneous block confirmations, facilitating rapid transactions with negligible fees. This cutting-edge technology positions it as a formidable competitor to giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum, while ensuring robust security through the GhostDAG protocol. However, it's not just the technology that has BDAG in the spotlight. Its presale has shattered expectations, bringing in over $193.5 million and soaring 2380% in value even before listing on exchanges. With more than 170,000 investors already involved, both major investors and small traders see its long-term promise. As BDAG nears its eagerly awaited mainnet debut in 2025, the ecosystem is poised to grow into Web3 applications, DeFi, and enterprise-grade solutions. With momentum on its side, early investors still have a unique opportunity to invest before BDAG's value skyrockets on major exchanges. 2. XRP (XRP): A Payment Solution for Institutions XRP, Ripple's native token, powers a blockchain-based payment network designed for efficient, cost-effective cross-border transactions. Its high efficiency has made it a preferred choice among banks and financial institutions. With Ripple's legal issues subsiding, speculation about XRP ETFs has increased, potentially drawing significant institutional investments. Moreover, rumors about XRP being part of a U.S. crypto reserve further enhance its appeal. Given its solid fundamentals and growing adoption, XRP continues to be one of the top altcoins for 2025. Currently trading at $2.41, it reflects strong market confidence in its long-term viability. 3. Hedera (HBAR): Growth Driven by Institutional Investments Hedera (HBAR) offers a next-gen alternative to blockchain with its Hashgraph technology, delivering unparalleled speed, security, and low transaction costs. It is increasingly popular among enterprises for applications in finance, supply chain, and tokenization. Recent enhancements to its mainnet have led to a 27-day high in HBAR inflows, indicating strong investor trust. The launch of a stablecoin by Philippine banks on Hedera further underscores its practical adoption. With rising institutional interest, HBAR remains a leading altcoin for 2025. Currently, HBAR is trading at $0.2376 after a slight uptick. 4. Stellar (XLM): A Dominant Player in Crypto Payments Stellar (XLM) is a decentralized payment system crafted for effortless, low-cost cross-border transactions. Its increasing use by banks, remittance services, and fintech companies solidifies its position as a top altcoin for 2025. With more financial institutions adopting Stellar's blockchain for practical applications, analysts foresee a possible rise above $0.50. As transaction volumes increase, XLM's fundamentals stay robust. Currently, Stellar is priced at $0.3305, showcasing growing market confidence in its future role in global finance. 5. Kaspa (KAS): A Trustworthy Proof-of-Work Blockchain Kaspa (KAS) is a high-speed proof-of-work cryptocurrency that employs the BlockDAG protocol, allowing multiple blocks to be mined simultaneously for enhanced scalability. Its fast transactions and low fees place it among the leading altcoins for 2025. With Marathon Digital actively mining KAS and the upcoming Crescendo hard fork expected to boost efficiency, the momentum is increasing. As institutional interest rises, Kaspa's market presence strengthens. Currently, KAS is trading at $0.0883, showcasing its resilience. Conclusion: Which Altcoin Will Have the Greatest Impact? With numerous options in the crypto world, identifying the top altcoins for 2025 boils down to their real potential. XRP is gaining traction through institutional interest, Hedera is experiencing increased adoption with real-world applications, Stellar remains significant in international payments, and Kaspa is establishing itself as a cutting-edge PoW network. Yet, BlockDAG outshines the others. Its presale of over $193.5 million, 170,000+ investors, and a 2380% price increase before exchange listing highlight its significant potential. With unparalleled scalability and an anticipated mainnet launch in 2025, BDAG is poised to be a leading contender.",More News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|XRP|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-02-10 15:45:49

Experts Say This AI Altcoin Could Hit Another 10x Faster,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/dogecoin-at-320-experts-say-this-ai-altcoin-could-hit-another-10x-faster,"Dogecoin, the meme coin loved by millions, has seen its price drop 28% this month, but experts think a comeback could be closer than expected. Observers are now comparing its potential to a new AI altcoin, IntelMarkets, which is already turning heads in presale. With DOGE aiming for $3.20 and IntelMarkets offering self-learning trading bots, traders are weighing which project could deliver bigger gains. While DOGE relies on its loyal community, IntelMarkets’ tech-focused approach—backed by MIT experts and Fortune 500 investors—is drawing attention as one of the best new cryptos to buy. Dogecoin Momentum Sparks $3.20 Speculation Dogecoin is currently trading at around $0.25, down 24% over the past week, but experts think a major rebound could be on the horizon. Analysts point to historical patterns where DOGE surged after breaking key resistance levels, similar to its 2021 rally. With a market cap of $37 billion, it remains a favorite among meme coin enthusiasts, and recent developments like ETF speculation add fuel to the fire. Source: CoinMarketCap Some trend-watchers believe this could be a second chance for those who missed the Dogecoin 2021 rally. Bitwise’s filings for a Dogecoin ETF have boosted optimism, suggesting institutional interest could push this coin toward its all-time high of $0.73 and beyond. Technical charts show DOGE consolidating near the $0.30 support level, with experts predicting a breakout above $0.35 could trigger a parabolic move. If Dogecoin mirrors its 2018 cycle, some strategists believe it could reach $1.50 by mid-2025 and eventually $3.20. Social media trends and celebrity endorsements, like Elon Musk’s past support, also play a role. While DOGE faces short-term volatility, its strong community and growing payment utility keep long-term hopes alive. Doge’s Growth Trajectory Challenged by Intelmarkets While Dogecoin eyes a potential 10x rally, experts say IntelMarkets might achieve this growth faster. Currently, in its ninth presale stage, IntelMarkets has raised over $8.1 million, with tokens priced at $0.082 before rising to $0.091 in the next round. Backed by Fortune 500 investors and MIT experts, this AI-powered platform combines self-learning trading bots, dual-chain functionality, and 1000x leverage—features experts call groundbreaking for retail traders. With over 100,000 data points analyzed in real-time by IntelMarkets’ AI bots, they are adapting strategies faster than human traders. Unlike Dogecoin, which relies on community hype, IntelMarkets focuses on tech-driven solutions like quantum-resistant security and a decentralized AI marketplace. Industry insiders consider INTL one of the best new cryptos to invest in, with predictions of a 50x surge post-launch. Its presale traction suggests it could outperform DOGE’s growth, especially as traders seek projects blending AI with DeFi. Dogecoin Community Strength Meets IntelMarkets AI Innovation Dogecoin’s loyal community has been its backbone, driving initiatives like charity fundraising and merchant adoption. However, IntelMarkets is gaining attention by offering tools that even DOGE holders find appealing. For example, its dual-chain design lets users trade on Ethereum for DeFi access or Solana for low fees—a flexibility experts say could attract crypto veterans exploring new DeFi projects. Whether the Dogecoin can be set up for a strong recovery is the issue auditors have been asking. Its price hinges on social trends, even more now, with President Donald Trump’s recent tariff implementation, which caused changes in the memecoin sector. It is yet unclear if investors will find the experts' bullish predictions about the Dogecoin price appealing. In contrast, IntelMarkets provides tangible utility through AI-driven trading. Features like auto-adjusted risk parameters and real-time sentiment analysis cater to both beginners and experts. This balance positions INTL as a top crypto to invest in, especially with presale buyers getting early access to its ecosystem. As Dogecoin aims for $3.20, IntelMarkets’ tech-first approach could redefine what investors expect from altcoins, making it a strong contender among top crypto coins. Conclusion While Dogecoin works toward its $3.20 target, specialists believe IntelMarkets could offer faster growth with its AI-driven trading tools. Experts suggest its presale, already backed by millions, might be a rare chance to invest early in what some call the next big leap in crypto tech, outperforming its growth.

There's now a buzz around comparing it to a new AI altcoin, IntelMarkets, which is already making waves in its presale. As DOGE sets its sights on $3.20, IntelMarkets is intriguing traders with its self-learning trading bots. While Dogecoin leans on its dedicated fanbase, IntelMarkets is capturing attention with its tech-driven strategy, supported by MIT specialists and Fortune 500 backers, making it a standout choice among emerging cryptos. Dogecoin's Current Drive Fuels $3.20 Projections Dogecoin is trading around $0.25, having dropped 24% over the last week, but many experts foresee a significant rebound soon. Analysts highlight past trends where DOGE surged after crossing key resistance points, reminiscent of its 2021 climb. With a market value of $37 billion, Dogecoin continues to be a favorite among meme coin supporters, and factors like ETF speculation are adding momentum. Source: CoinMarketCap Some market followers see this as a second opportunity for those who missed Dogecoin's 2021 boom. Optimism has been fueled by Bitwise's Dogecoin ETF filings, suggesting that institutional interest might drive the coin to its previous peak of $0.73 and further. Technical analyses indicate DOGE stabilizing near the $0.30 support zone, with predictions that surpassing $0.35 might initiate a steep climb. If Dogecoin follows its 2018 pattern, some strategists anticipate it could hit $1.50 by mid-2025 and eventually $3.20. Social media buzz and celebrity endorsements, such as Elon Musk's past advocacy, also contribute. Although DOGE faces short-term fluctuations, its robust community and increasing use in payments sustain long-term optimism. Dogecoin's Path to Growth Contends with IntelMarkets While Dogecoin aims for a possible 10x jump, experts suggest IntelMarkets might achieve this acceleration more swiftly. Now in its ninth presale phase, IntelMarkets has garnered over $8.1 million, with tokens priced at $0.082 before moving to $0.091 in the upcoming stage. Supported by Fortune 500 stakeholders and MIT authorities, this AI-enhanced platform merges self-adaptive trading bots, dual-chain capabilities, and 1000x leverage—features experts describe as revolutionary for retail investors. With IntelMarkets' AI bots analyzing over 100,000 data points in real-time, they refine strategies more rapidly than human traders. Unlike Dogecoin, which thrives on community enthusiasm, IntelMarkets prioritizes technology-centric solutions such as quantum-resistant security and a decentralized AI marketplace. Industry insiders regard INTL as a top new crypto investment, predicting a 50x increase after launch. Its presale success indicates it could surpass DOGE's growth, particularly as investors look for projects that meld AI with DeFi. Dogecoin's Community Strength Meets IntelMarkets' AI Advancements Dogecoin's dedicated community has been instrumental, supporting activities like charitable donations and merchant adoption. Yet, IntelMarkets is drawing attention by providing tools even appealing to DOGE enthusiasts. For instance, its dual-chain framework allows trading on Ethereum for DeFi access or Solana for reduced fees—a flexibility that experts believe could attract seasoned crypto users exploring new DeFi ventures. The question of whether Dogecoin is poised for a robust revival is one that analysts are pondering. Its value is increasingly tied to social dynamics, especially following President Donald Trump's recent tariff actions, which have shaken the memecoin sphere. Whether investors will embrace experts' optimistic Dogecoin forecasts remains uncertain. Conversely, IntelMarkets delivers concrete value through AI-powered trading. Features like automatically adjusted risk parameters and real-time sentiment assessment cater to novices and seasoned traders alike. This balance positions INTL as a premier crypto investment, with presale participants gaining early entry to its ecosystem. As Dogecoin strives for $3.20, IntelMarkets' tech-centric approach could reshape investor expectations for altcoins, making it a fierce contender among leading cryptocurrencies. Conclusion While Dogecoin aims for its $3.20 mark, experts suggest IntelMarkets might offer quicker growth through its AI-enhanced trading capabilities.

XRP’s latest crash and Shiba Inu’s struggle to keep up with the bull run prove that not every big-name token is built for sustained growth. While some traders hope for a recovery, seasoned investors are already looking ahead. The smart money isn’t chasing past hype—it’s hunting for the next 30x opportunity before the rest of the market catches on. Right now, two altcoins— DTX Exchange and SUI—are making serious moves, and they’re shaping up to be the breakout plays before XRP and SHIB even get back on their feet. XRP Takes a Hit as Network Issues Shake Investor Confidence XRP's price took a major hit, dropping 21% after a ledger halt disrupted block production. For an asset that has long been a favorite among institutional investors for cross-border payments, this technical issue has raised serious concerns about Ripple's network stability. Some traders are even doubting Ripple's long-term prospects in light of the most recent setback, particularly in light of growing regulatory pressure. Despite some optimism from analysts suggesting that XRP remains a long-term bet, short-term price action tells a different story. The sentiment has shifted, and a quick recovery doesn’t seem likely as market uncertainty grows. Shiba Inu’s Supply Concerns and Whale Moves Cast Doubt on a Breakout Shiba Inu (SHIB) has had its fair share of hype cycles, but the latest trends show a slowing burn rate, liquidity concerns, and massive whale transfers shaking investor confidence. A recent 15 trillion SHIB transfer has sparked speculation, with some fearing a sell-off while others see whale accumulation. Despite the hype, Shibarium has yet to deliver real impact, and SHIB is struggling to keep up with the broader bull run. Meanwhile, Chainlink (LINK) and Toncoin (TON) show stronger fundamentals and healthier supply metrics, while SHIB's oversupply issue lingers. Without a major burn or breakthrough, SHIB risks fading as traders shift focus to more promising assets. The Hidden Gems Poised for a 30x Breakout DTX Exchange, with its unified trading ecosystem, and Sui, a high-speed Layer-1, are two under-the-radar plays that traders are watching closely. Sui - The Layer-1 Built for Speed and Scalability Sui’s been making noise with its parallel execution model, letting it process transactions faster than most chains choking under load. That’s why it’s gaining traction in DeFi, gaming, and NFTs, where speed actually matters. Built on Move, it’s designed to handle smart contracts more efficiently than Ethereum, but it’s still got a lot to prove. The tech is there, but in a crowded Layer-1 space, adoption and real-world use will decide if it’s the real deal—or just another hype cycle. A Fair Launch, Real Utility—DTX is Built Different DTX exchange isn’t just another crypto exchange—it’s bridging crypto, stocks, forex, and ETFs under one roof. No more jumping between platforms just to trade different assets. Plus, with a fair launch model, there’s no VC manipulation or whale dumping, meaning retail traders actually get a fair shot. That’s the kind of setup that builds long-term value, not just short-term hype. With a listing price of $0.20 and a current presale price of $0.16, early investors are already positioned for 40% gains before launch. More importantly, its high-speed testnet (200,000 TPS) and growing adoption (600,000+ wallets) signal real demand. Final Thoughts In the war between meme coins and utility tokens, altcoins with real use cases are taking the throne—and DTX Exchange is leading the charge. XRP’s struggles and SHIB’s fading hype prove that legacy tokens can’t rely on old narratives forever. DTX is different—a fair launch, cross-market trading, and a 200,000 TPS blockchain put it leagues ahead of speculative plays. Sui brings speed, but adoption is still a question mark.

40158831,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=127470,1739202777,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Justin Sun Explains USDD 2.0 in a Live Stream, Highlights HTX’s Unique Edge",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/justin-sun-explains-usdd-2-0-in-a-live-stream-highlights-htxs-unique-edge/,"SINGAPORE, Feb. 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — On February 5, Justin Sun, Global Advisor of HTX and founder of TRON, joined the leading crypto exchange HTX for an X Spaces session titled “Explore USDD with Justin Sun”. During the session, Sun provided an in-depth explanation of USDD (Decentralized USD) 2.0, the latest version of the USDD stablecoin, and answered audience questions. The session garnered significant interest from the crypto community, with over 12,000 concurrent listeners at its peak. USDD 2.0: Pegged 1:1 with USD, Backed by Multiple Stability Mechanisms Launched on January 25, USDD 2.0 is an upgraded decentralized stablecoin on the TRON network. Sun emphasized that despite the dominance of USDT and USDC, the market still lacks a truly trustless and fully decentralized stablecoin with no censorship and freezing of assets, which is why he championed USDD. To maintain its 1:1 peg to USD, USDD 2.0 utilizes stability mechanisms, including over-collateralization, a liquidation and auction model, risk management and real-time monitoring, a Peg Stability Module (PSM), and decentralized governance. The PSM is a critical component. It allows users to quickly swap USDD for other stablecoins at a 1:1 ratio with nearly zero gas fees. This significantly reduces arbitrage risks and promotes price stability, even during market fluctuations. USDD’s over-collateralization model further enhances its stability and minimizes risks. To mint USDD, users must provide collateral assets like TRX or USDT. Due to TRX’s strong market liquidity and ecosystem support, and USDT’s established stability, the value of the collateral consistently exceeds that of the minted USDD. As of 8:30 AM UTC on February 6, the total collateral backing USDD was nearly $130 million, representing an over-collateralization ratio of 1.23x. Sun summarized, “ If you are unsure about USDD, just think of it as a mirrored proxy of USDT.” 20% APY on USDD Staking—Backed by Decentralization Sun emphasized that USDD can be swapped 1:1 for USDT at any time, with no limit, making it as easy to use as USDT on TRON—but with the potential for higher returns. Currently, Tier T1 of USDD staking offers a 20% APY, fully subsidized by TRON DAO. HTX Earn also offers a limited-time 20% APY bonus for its USDD Flexible product. Since the bonus was introduced, subscribed assets for the product increased nearly tenfold. Users can stake USDD on HTX or JustLend DAO and enjoy a guaranteed 20% yield. Users can also borrow USDD using their USDT holdings and then stake the borrowed USDD for additional potential returns. (Disclaimer: This is not an investment advice.) According to official data, $1,380,822 USDD tokens have been deposited to the LendSave Vault contract (TDrc3zH9wWufmQJyS7QLxBYH8GS27drW5N). Addressing community concerns about the security and sustainability of the 20% yield, Sun stated, “Consider the value proposition of a decentralized stablecoin on TRON. There’s $60 billion worth of USDT on TRON. If you believe in a truly decentralized alternative, you understand USDD’s potential value.” Regarding use cases, Sun explained that USDD is designed to support the functionalities that USDT cannot fully provide on the TRON network. He also announced upcoming partnerships with centralized exchanges. HTX and Poloniex may soon support USDD used as margin in futures trading, and integrates USDD into one-click USDD swaps, and USDD-powered SmartEarn. Discussions are also underway with other crypto institutions regarding further USDD integration. HTX’s Growth: $HTX Set to Be Listed on Major Regulated Exchange Sun also announced that $HTX will soon be listed on a major regulated exchange. Efforts are underway to further enhance its utility, giving it a competitive advantage over other centralized exchanges. He reaffirmed that HTX’s listing strategy focuses on identifying promising projects, with all new token listings based on independent research, and also speed. HTX’s agility has allowed it to stay ahead of the curve in the crypto market over the past two years. Looking ahead, HTX will focus on the AI sector, with potential AI-driven projects in development.

XRP's recent downfall and Shiba Inu's battle to maintain momentum during the bull market show that not all renowned tokens are built for lasting success. While some traders cling to hopes of a rebound, savvy investors are already eyeing the future. The wise move isn’t to chase old trends—it's to search for the next 30x opportunity before the wider market picks up on it. Currently, two altcoins— DTX Exchange and SUI—are making notable strides, positioning themselves as frontrunners before XRP and SHIB manage to recover. XRP Faces Turmoil as Network Problems Erode Trust XRP saw its value plummet by 21% following a ledger halt that interrupted block production. This technical hiccup has raised significant concerns about Ripple's network stability, especially for a token long favored by institutions for cross-border transactions. With increasing regulatory scrutiny, some traders are questioning Ripple's long-term viability after this latest challenge. Although some analysts remain optimistic about XRP as a long-term investment, the immediate price movements paint a different picture. Market sentiment has shifted, and a swift recovery appears unlikely amid growing uncertainty. Shiba Inu's Oversupply and Whale Activity Raise Questions About Growth Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen its share of hype, but recent patterns highlight a declining burn rate, liquidity issues, and significant whale transactions unsettling investor confidence. A recent movement of 15 trillion SHIB has fueled speculation, with some worried about a sell-off and others seeing it as whale accumulation. Despite the buzz, Shibarium has yet to make a significant impact, and SHIB is lagging behind the broader bull market. In contrast, Chainlink (LINK) and Toncoin (TON) exhibit stronger fundamentals and healthier supply metrics, while SHIB's oversupply problem persists. Without a substantial burn or breakthrough, SHIB risks losing traction as traders look to more promising investments. Unveiling the Hidden Gems Set for a 30x Surge DTX Exchange, offering a comprehensive trading ecosystem, and Sui, a high-speed Layer-1, are two under-the-radar contenders drawing significant attention from traders. Sui - A Layer-1 Prioritizing Speed and Scalability Sui is making waves with its parallel execution model, allowing it to handle transactions more swiftly than many other chains struggling under heavy loads. This feature is why it's gaining popularity in DeFi, gaming, and NFTs, where speed is crucial. Built on Move, Sui is designed to manage smart contracts more efficiently than Ethereum, but it still has much to prove. The technology is promising, but in a competitive Layer-1 landscape, widespread adoption and practical use will determine if it’s a lasting player or just another temporary sensation. A Transparent Launch, Genuine Utility—DTX Stands Out DTX exchange is more than just another crypto platform—it's uniting crypto, stocks, forex, and ETFs under one roof. No more juggling different platforms to trade various assets. Additionally, with a transparent launch model, there's no venture capital manipulation or whale sell-offs, giving retail traders a fair chance. This approach is geared towards building long-term value, not just riding on short-term excitement. With an initial listing price of $0.20 and a current presale price of $0.16, early investors are already seeing potential 40% gains before the official launch. More crucially, its high-speed testnet (200,000 TPS) and increasing adoption (over 600,000 wallets) indicate real demand. Concluding Insights In the clash between meme coins and utility tokens, altcoins with practical applications are taking the lead—and DTX Exchange is at the forefront. The difficulties faced by XRP and SHIB's diminishing excitement show that established tokens can't depend on outdated narratives indefinitely. DTX sets itself apart with a fair launch, cross-market trading capabilities, and a 200,000 TPS blockchain, placing it far ahead of speculative alternatives. Sui offers speed, but its adoption remains uncertain.

In February, DTX Exchange was quickly emerging as one of the best altcoins for those looking for a solid investment. With PEPE and Dogecoin price declining at a rapid rate, traders are backing the viral token, DTX, in hopes of higher returns. This project is currently in public presale with each token priced at $0.16. Let’s find out why investors are shifting their focus now. The Dogecoin Price Declining Quickly Due to Market Sentiment The Dogecoin price has seen a significant drop recently, leaving many investors wondering about the reasons behind the decline. As of 7th February 2025, the Dogecoin price is trading above the $0.250 support level with over 25% decline in value on the 30-day chart. This decline in the Dogecoin price is mainly because of the mix of market sentiments and the lack of solid use cases for Dogecoin. Source: CoinMarketCap In 2021, after the sudden price surge in the Dogecoin price, it became one of the best altcoins in the market but that is in the past as investors are now moving more toward utility tokens. The latest data also shows that the Dogecoin price is vulnerable to market sentiment shifts and without any news developments or catalysts, Dogecoin may continue to face challenges. This has caused DOGE investors to move their funds into stable and potentially the best altcoin in February, DTX Exchange. Why PEPE is Struggling to Hold Its Position in the Market In 2024, PEPE was one of the best altcoins as it surged over 15,000% in a matter of months. But since then PEPE hasn’t been able to keep the momentum going and has been down by over 65% from its all-time-high value of $0.000028. One reason for this downturn is that PEPE, like other meme coins, lacks a clear user case or utility beyond being a fun, speculative investment. Source: CoinMarketCap On the technical front, PEPE is moving towards a downtrend with RSI in the neutral zone and almost all of the moving averages indicating strong selling pressure. Due to this reason, investors are moving their funds into DTX Exchange as it has the potential to offer higher returns. DTX Exchange: Potential Best Altcoin to Watch in February With PEPE and Dogecoin price declining indicates a market shift from meme coins to real-world utility tokens like DTX Exchange . It is now emerging as a strong contender for the best altcoin in February 2025. One of the key features that sets DTX Exchange apart is its high-speed transaction capabilities. Built on the VulcanX blockchain, DTX can handle over 200,000 transactions per second for quick trade execution even during peak times. Additionally, DTX offers a range of advanced trading tools such as real-time market analysis, price alerts, and advanced charting options to ensure that traders have all the resources they need to make informed decisions. The platform will also provide an automated investment manager to help long-term investors handle recurring buys and DCA when the market dips. For beginners, DTX will provide copy-trading features so that new traders can copy trades from the most successful traders and make significant profits even during their initial days. Another reason why DTX Exchange could become one of the best altcoins is its quantum-proof security features and access to 120,000 assets including crypto, forex, ETFs, and more. This emerging project has been generating significant buzz with its highly successful presale, raising over $13.5 million till now (Feb 7). The project has already attracted a large number of investors which shows the high investor confidence. However, the public presale has now entered the last stage which is stage 8 and tokens are available at the lowest price of $0.16 for early investors. Final Thoughts As the crypto market shifts towards more stable tokens after a decline in the Dogecoin price and of many other meme coins, DTX Exchange is gaining traction and is emerging as a strong contender for the best altcoin in 2025. With its impressive presale success, advanced features, and strong investor interest, DTX offers a rather promising alternative to meme coins like DOGE and PEPE.

In February, DTX Exchange is swiftly gaining recognition as a leading altcoin for those seeking a reliable investment. As the prices of PEPE and Dogecoin experience a sharp decline, traders are betting on the viral token, DTX, aiming for better returns. This project is currently in its public presale stage, with each token priced at $0.16. Let's explore why investors are now turning their attention to it. Dogecoin's Price Plummets Amid Shifting Market Sentiment Recently, Dogecoin has faced a steep price drop, prompting investors to question the factors driving this downturn. As of February 7, 2025, Dogecoin is trading just above the $0.250 support level, reflecting a more than 25% decline over the past 30 days. This fall is largely attributed to changing market sentiments and Dogecoin's lack of substantial use cases. Source: CoinMarketCap Back in 2021, Dogecoin's sudden price surge made it one of the market's top altcoins. However, investors are now gravitating towards tokens with more practical applications. The latest data indicates Dogecoin's vulnerability to market sentiment changes, suggesting it may continue to face difficulties without news developments or catalysts. This shift has prompted DOGE investors to redirect their funds towards DTX Exchange, which is considered a more stable and potentially top-performing altcoin for February. Reasons Behind PEPE's Market Position Struggles In 2024, PEPE was among the leading altcoins, skyrocketing over 15,000% in just a few months. However, it has since struggled to maintain its momentum, dropping more than 65% from its peak value of $0.000028. A contributing factor to this decline is PEPE's, like other meme coins, lack of a clear purpose or utility beyond being a speculative, entertaining investment. Source: CoinMarketCap Technically, PEPE is trending downwards, with its RSI in a neutral zone and nearly all moving averages indicating strong selling pressure. As a result, investors are shifting their funds to DTX Exchange, which shows promise for delivering higher returns. DTX Exchange: A Promising Altcoin to Follow in February The downturn in PEPE and Dogecoin prices suggests a market transition from meme coins to tokens with real-world utility, like DTX Exchange , which is now emerging as a strong candidate for February 2025's top altcoin. DTX Exchange stands out due to its high-speed transaction capabilities. Utilizing the VulcanX blockchain, DTX can process over 200,000 transactions per second, ensuring swift trade executions even during peak times. Furthermore, DTX provides a suite of advanced trading tools, including real-time market analysis, price alerts, and sophisticated charting options, equipping traders with the necessary resources to make well-informed decisions. The platform will also include an automated investment manager to aid long-term investors in managing recurring buys and dollar-cost averaging during market dips. For newcomers, DTX offers copy-trading features, allowing them to replicate the trades of successful traders, thereby achieving notable profits even in their early trading days. Another reason DTX Exchange is poised to become a leading altcoin is its quantum-proof security features and access to a vast array of 120,000 assets, including cryptocurrencies, forex, ETFs, and more. This up-and-coming project has been generating substantial attention, with a highly successful presale that has raised over $13.5 million as of February 7. The project's ability to attract a large pool of investors indicates high investor confidence. However, the public presale is now in its final stage, stage 8, with tokens available at the lowest price of $0.16 for early investors. Concluding Thoughts As the cryptocurrency market pivots towards more stable tokens following declines in Dogecoin and other meme coins, DTX Exchange is gaining momentum and emerging as a formidable contender for 2025's best altcoin. With its impressive presale achievements, cutting-edge features, and significant investor interest, DTX presents a compelling alternative to meme coins like DOGE and PEPE.

BitLemons is reshaping blockchain gaming with a revenue-driven model, attracting investors after its $1 million seed round. Table of Contents BitLemons gains traction Stacks tumbles despite Bitcoin integration TRON shows signs of life Conclusion While Bitcoin-focused platforms show mixed results, the new GambleFi project is enriching the gaming sector. BitLemons (BLEM) continues to attract smart money following its $1 million seed funding round, with its revenue-generating platform setting new standards in blockchain gaming. BitLemons gains traction In a market dominated by theoretical solutions, BitLemons stands apart by delivering real revenue today. With comprehensive security audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof, plus substantial institutional backing, this new platform is transforming the $450 billion gaming industry through proven blockchain solutions. BitLemons’ smart To learn more about BitLemons, visit the website and socials . approach combines transparent gaming with sustainable tokenomics, allocating 30% of GGR between strategic buybacks and community rewards. This creates an ecosystem where immediate profit generation meets long-term value creation. Stacks tumbles despite Bitcoin integration Stacks (STX) faces significant pressure with a 6.11% decline to $0.92, despite its innovative approach to Bitcoin smart contracts. While the platform’s Proof-of-Transfer mechanism and Clarity programming language show promise, market sentiment suggests growing skepticism about adoption rates. Although Stacks aims to enhance Bitcoin’s functionality through DeFi and NFT capabilities, the substantial price drop indicates investors may be seeking platforms with more immediate utility and revenue generation. TRON shows signs of life TRON (TRX) demonstrates strength with a 4.54% gain to $0.23, as its high-throughput blockchain continues attracting developers and users. The platform’s focus on digital content distribution and entertainment applications has created a robust ecosystem for decentralized application development. However, questions remain about TRON’s long-term sustainability and ability to maintain momentum in an increasingly competitive smart contract landscape. Conclusion While blockchain platforms compete for theoretical supremacy, BitLemons is quietly changing the gaming industry with immediate revenue generation. Unlike promises of future utility, BitLemons offers tangible value through its operational platform and transparent reward structure.

This delay, he argued, “caused a lot of the price damage,” leading to Bitcoin’s prolonged weakness throughout most of 2022. It was not until March 2024 that Bitcoin once again surpassed $60,000. However, Scaramucci believes that today’s crypto market benefits from a Trump White House implementing “propitious, decent, middle-of-the-road regulation.” You might also like: Bitcoin ETPs now represent over 7% of BTC’s market capitalization Making up for lost time? Scaramucci pointed to several near-term catalysts that could help Bitcoin recover lost ground. He highlighted growing interest from university endowments, including Emory University, which disclosed a stake in Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF in late 2024, while the University of Austin is considering launching a Bitcoin investment fund. Additionally, Scaramucci suggested that a Bitcoin strategic reserve fund in the U.S. “will likely happen at a small level.” Contrary to popular belief, he noted that the U.S. strategic reserve holds nearly 30 different assets, and Bitcoin is “an asset the country will want to own.” Meanwhile, he added that sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East are “quietly” building crypto positions.

Dogen is emerging as a surprising contender. Ethereum is poised for major developments. Solana continues to impress with its speed and scalability. Examining these assets could offer valuable insights into current trends and future possibilities in cryptocurrency. Alpha Meme Coin DOGEN Off to the Moon After Its Major Listing Event DOGEN, which has recently captured the interest of the crypto community with its bold narrative of the strongest meme coin for alpha males , was listed on February 4th. The listing comes at the perfect timing as the crypto market is on the brink of a massive bull run supported by favorable geopolitical factors. Affectionately dubbed “DOGE on steroids” by one community member, DOGEN is poised to replicate the success of popular meme coins such as Dogecoin, which has seen a whopping 66,000% increase compared to its launch price . Those who bought $DOGEN during the presale got it at a bargain price. However, it is not too late; $DOGEN remains a good value and its price is predicted to increase from here. Community-Driven with Real Value DOGEN isn’t just a fad; it’s a growing movement with a team dedicated to building a strong community of alpha leaders who are ready to take over the market. This token offers real value, including exciting campaigns and exclusive benefits for early adopters. DOGEN is a chance to be part of something big. The community-driven presale strategy has enabled DOGEN to raise $5.5 million in initial funding and amass a large community of nearly 20,000 DOGEN fans . This provides a strong foundation for the token to start its mission to the moon successfully. The $DOGEN private presale has concluded, and the token can now be purchased with SOL on major cryptocurrency exchanges. DOGEN is heading to the moon! Join the mission and don’t miss out! Ethereum: A Versatile Blockchain for Decentralized Applications Ethereum is a blockchain that supports smart contracts and decentralized applications. It uses Proof-of-Stake, which helps with security and energy efficiency. Ethereum introduced ERC-20 tokens, widely used for various purposes like governance and utility. The network relies on its native coin, ETH, for transactions and rewards. Upgrades like the Merge in 2022 and future improvements such as sharding aim to make the network scalable and affordable. ETH serves as both a tradable asset and collateral in financial systems. Historical trends and market cycles suggest Ethereum has growth potential, with future price predictions indicating significant value increases. This makes the coin an interesting option for those analyzing blockchain technology and its applications. Solana and the Role of SOL in Blockchain Technology Solana is a blockchain platform designed for scalability and supporting decentralized applications. It uses architectural choices to enable faster transactions and flexible programming options. Its native coin, SOL, plays a key role in its operations. SOL powers transactions, runs programs, and rewards participants in the network. The platform focuses on high capacity without using sharding or second-layer solutions. This approach aims to draw developers and investors seeking to build or support high-activity projects. SOL’s value is tied to the platform’s adoption and its ability to host growing applications. The performance and adoption of Solana’s blockchain can influence market interest in SOL during different market conditions. Conclusion Ethereum and Solana remain significant but may offer less short-term potential. DOGEN, tailored for those pursuing excellence, targets 700% growth by the end of its presale, with possibilities for thousand-fold returns this altcoin season. Emulating successful tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN is fostering a community of leaders and provides real benefits with exclusive perks for early supporters.

Currently, Shiba Inu is priced at $0.000015 and DOGE at $0.25, both struggling to gain traction due to external pressures hindering their growth potential. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a new altcoin offering practical utility with its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models, is gaining traction. Unlike Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, which primarily thrive on hype and are susceptible to market fluctuations, Mutuum Finance offers passive income opportunities, liquidity incentives, and a structured presale model. The MUTM token is currently priced at $0.01 during the first phase of its presale, with the price set to rise gradually until it reaches a launch price of $0.06. Designed for stability and growth, Mutuum Finance aims to hit $1 before Shiba Inu and Dogecoin as investors look for secure and profitable alternatives in the crypto space. Mutuum Finance Presale Attracts Investors Rapidly Mutuum Finance ’s presale is gaining significant traction, with Phase 1 moving swiftly as investors rush to acquire MUTM tokens at the initial price of $0.01. To date, over $258,000 has been raised, and more than 458 holders have joined, indicating a growing demand. As the price is set to increase in subsequent phases, launching at $0.06, early investors stand to gain 600% before the token becomes available on the open market. While meme coins depend on hype, Mutuum Finance is engineered for sustainable growth. The platform reinvests its profits by repurchasing MUTM tokens from the market and redistributing them as rewards to holders. This creates consistent buying pressure, elevating the price and ensuring long-term benefits for investors. What Sets Mutuum Finance Apart? Mutuum Finance is a non-custodial platform for lending and borrowing, allowing users to maintain full control over their funds while earning passive income. Lenders can deposit their crypto into liquidity pools to earn interest, while borrowers can obtain loans by providing collateral, without needing to sell their assets. The platform offers two lending models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Utilizes liquidity pools to offer optimal interest rates and enhance capital efficiency. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Facilitates direct asset transactions, ideal for riskier assets like meme coins without affecting the platform’s overall stability. Users have the flexibility to choose between fixed or variable borrowing rates, catering to both conservative and high-risk traders. Security is paramount for Mutuum Finance. The platform is preparing for third-party audits and has made its code open-source, ensuring complete transparency. This approach enhances credibility and trust for investors, unlike many projects that lack accountability. Holding MUTM is not just about potential price appreciation; it also offers passive income. The platform's buyback system distributes a portion of profits to long-term holders, providing ongoing rewards. Furthermore, Mutuum Finance plans to expand onto multiple blockchains (EVM and non-EVM), boosting liquidity and attracting a broader user base. Steps to Invest Before Price Increases Purchasing MUTM during the presale is straightforward. Investors need a MetaMask or Trust Wallet with ETH, USDT, or BNB. By visiting the official presale portal, they can select their investment amount, confirm the transaction, and hold onto their tokens until the presale concludes. With exchange listings on the horizon, getting in early could be transformative. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a revolutionary financial platform offering tangible utility, long-term stability, and growth potential. While meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) face challenges from economic shifts and regulatory pressures, MUTM’s structured presale, deflationary model, and passive income opportunities position it as a strong candidate to reach $1 first. As investor interest grows and the project develops, Mutuum Finance is establishing itself as a secure and rewarding alternative in the crypto market. For those seeking to capitalize on early-stage gains and long-term value, MUTM presents an opportunity not to be missed.

At the turn of the year Binance, the largest crypto exchange by trading volume, held 622,192 BTC across third-party custody and exchanges balances. On Feb 1, that figure had shrunk to 618,563 BTC. Customer net balances, in contrast, grew from 575,296 BTC to 615,816 BTC, meaning the rate of collateralization fell to 100% from 108% . Balances of Tether's USDT stablecoin also fell, dropping about $25 million as customer balances rose $2.6 billion. The motive for the shift in reserves remains unclear, and Binance did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment. The exchange might be reallocating funds to generate a return on investment instead of over-collateralizing, and it's worth noting that Binance remains in a healthy financial position. At current prices it holds $160 billion worth of 34 crypto assets listed on the report, all of which are held at a 1:1 or greater ratio against user balances. Exchanges began posting proof of reserves in response to the FTX collapse in November 2022 . That was prompted by a weak balance sheet comprising illiquid altcoins, eventually leading to, in effect, a bank run where the exchange couldn't fulfill user withdrawals.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/japanese-investment-firms-value-increased-46-times-compared-to-us-based-strategy-firm-here-are-the-details/,"The stock price of Japanese investment firm MetaPlanet, often compared to U.S.-based Strategy, has increased 46-fold in the past year. Japan's 'Strategy' Shares Soar 46x in a Year Amid Bitcoin Investment Boom The rally was fueled by Bitcoin’s recent surge, which gained momentum following Donald Trump’s election victory and subsequent pro-crypto stance. MetaPlanet's stock performance ranks best among 1,576 companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's Standard Market. With a 46-fold gain, it has become one of the best-performing stocks globally, eclipsing the 4.6% rise in the Standard Index and the 7.3% rise in the broader TOPIX index. MetaPlanet has undergone a dramatic transformation over the years. Originally founded in 1999 as a music CD company, the company shifted its focus to the hospitality and dining sector in 2013. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted its business, pushing the company into negative equity in 2022. A year later, it rebranded as MetaPlanet and dedicated itself entirely to Bitcoin investing and holdings. MetaPlanet had 1,762 BTC (about $171 million) as of the end of 2024, according to a statement it made on January 28. The company aims to increase its Bitcoin holdings to 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025 and 21,000 BTC by 2026. To fund these purchases, it plans to issue 21 million new shares with adjustable strike prices. *This is not investment advice.

Shiba Inu is currently trading at $0.000015 and DOGE at $0.25, struggling to gain momentum as these external factors limit their growth potential. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a new altcoin offering real utility through its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models, is gaining momentum. Unlike Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, which rely on hype and are vulnerable to economic shifts, Mutuum Finance provides passive income opportunities, liquidity incentives, and a structured presale model. MUTM is currently priced at $0.01 in the first phase of its presale. This price will increase gradually across the presale to hit a launch price of $0.06. Mutuum Finance is designed for stability and growth. This positions it to reach $1 before Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, as investors seek secure and rewarding alternatives in the market. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Traction as Investors Rush In Mutuum Finance ’s presale is picking up serious momentum, with Phase 1 moving fast as investors jump in early to secure MUTM tokens at $0.01. So far, over $258,000 has been raised, and more than 458 holders have already joined, signaling growing demand. With the price set to increase in the next phases and launch at $0.06, early buyers will get a 600% gain before the token even hits the open market. Unlike meme coins that rely on hype, Mutuum Finance is built for long-term growth. The platform reinvests its profits by buying back MUTM tokens from the market and redistributing them as rewards to holders. This creates steady buy pressure, pushing the price while ensuring long-term investors keep benefiting. What Makes Mutuum Finance Different? Mutuum Finance is a non-custodial lending and borrowing platform, meaning users stay in full control of their funds while earning passive income. Lenders can deposit crypto into liquidity pools to earn interest, while borrowers can take loans by putting up collateral, without having to sell their assets. The platform also features two lending models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Uses liquidity pools to optimize interest rates and improve capital efficiency. Peer-to-peer (P2P): Allows direct asset transactions, perfect for riskier assets like meme coins without disrupting the platform’s overall stability. Users can also choose between fixed or variable borrowing rates, making it flexible for conservative and high-risk traders. Security is a priority for Mutuum Finance. The platform is set to undergo third-party audits and has made its code open-source, ensuring full transparency. Unlike many projects that lack accountability, this adds credibility and trust for investors. Holding MUTM is about price growth and also about earning passive income. The platform’s buyback system redistributes a portion of profits to long-term holders, providing ongoing rewards. In addition, Mutuum Finance is set to expand across multiple blockchains (EVM and non-EVM), increasing liquidity and attracting a wider user base. How to Get In Before Prices Rise Buying MUTM in the presale is simple. All investors need is a MetaMask or Trust Wallet with ETH, USDT, or BNB. By heading to the official presale portal, they can select their investment amount, confirm the transaction, and finally hold onto their tokens until the presale ends. With exchange listings coming soon, getting in early will be life-changing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a game-changing financial platform with real utility, long-term stability, and growth potential. While meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) struggle against economic shifts and regulatory pressures, MUTM’s structured presale, deflationary model, and passive income opportunities make it a strong contender to reach $1 first. As investor interest surges and the project grows, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a secure and rewarding alternative in the crypto market. For those looking to capitalize on early-stage gains and long-term value, MUTM presents an opportunity that shouldn’t be overlooked.

40159244,https://finbold.com/?p=236302,1739203773,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,Crypto trader predicts 50% XRP crash,https://finbold.com/crypto-trader-predicts-50-xrp-crash/,"For anyone who purchased the token while it was trading near its multi-year center of gravity near $0.50, XRP became a major portfolio winner in late 2024. Specifically, after spending most of the bull market around the 50-cent mark, the cryptocurrency soared starting in early November and found itself at a new all-time high (ATH) near $3.31 on January 17, 2025. The rise ensured that investors who purchased as little as $1,000 worth of the token as late as November 1 would have, just under a month ago, had $6,490.19. Still, XRP’s performance has since proved less stellar, and though it remains 13.69% in the green year-to-date (YTD) with a February 10 price of $2.41, the exact same investment would be worth a substantially lower $4,725.49. XRP 6-month price chart. Source: Finbold Why XRP might be headed for a 52% crash The situation gave rise to speculation on where XRP might go next and if it could find even higher highs in the long-anticipated ‘altseason.’ A cryptocurrency trader known as Harold_123 on TradingView shared his assessment earlier in February, thus perhaps shocking some investors with a forecast that the token might collapse as much as 52% in the coming weeks. Given the press time XRP price of $2.41, such a downside would mean that the cryptocurrency might trade as low as $1.16 in the near term. XRP price forecast. Source: Harold_123 & TradingView The prediction, however, also provides a silver lining. Specifically, it is based on the similarities between the token’s late 2024 and early 2025 rally and its last complete bull cycle, enjoyed in 2017. The trader noted that the rally in both cases came after a protracted ‘triangular consolidation’ followed by a breakout. Should the similarities persist, XRP might face the aforementioned correction in the near term. Again, looking at the historical performance, such a collapse would not signal the final crash of the cycle. Instead, the trader noted that after spending some time at a depressed price, the token is likely to head to new highs, with one speculative value seeing it soar to $26, per the established Fibonacci values. Could XRP enjoy an even greater rally in 2025? The forecast is partially in line with other analysts’ predictions. For example, Ali Martinez made an X post in early December, opining that $8.40 is a high XRP is likely aiming for but that there is also a compelling case for a surge all the way to $48.12. Still, it is worth pointing out that the predictions so far have been based on differing forms of technical analysis, an assumption the cryptocurrency will probably perform comparably to its past cycles, and the momentum driven by Gary Gensler’s resignation from the SEC. XRP’s more recent performance may have invalidated some of the hopes and analyses, while the regulatory-driven momentum is also, at press time, dubious: though Gensler’s resignation confirmation sent the token soaring , the cryptocurrency is 22% below where it stood when he actually vacated his role as the SEC Chair on January 20.

The low cap crypto gaming sensation Rollblock (RBLK) is also poised for phenomenal 1000x returns as it disrupts the enormous gaming niche and witnessed a 600% surge in new users last month. Here's why its revenue-sharing model is turning heads… Rollblock (RBLK) Revenue Share Scheme A Huge Win For Token Holders Rollblock ( RBLK ) recently smashed through the $10 million milestone in its early-stage presale offering, as December saw a 600% spike in new registrations for this revolutionary DeFi gaming site. Rollblock is out to revolutionize the $500 billion gaming sector by removing a major pain point for the industry. For years now, gamers have been put off by having to trust a centralized platform to honor their bids faithfully. Thanks to Rollblock and its practice of securely recording all transactions onto the Ethereum blockchain, gamers now have the upper hand and can verify everything for themselves with zero need for trust. Holding RBLK opens up huge benefits for investors, from free spins and VIP areas to staking rewards of up to 30% APY. This is thanks to the incredible Rollblock profit-sharing mechanism that takes up to 30% of the platform's operating revenue and reinvests it each week by buying up RBLK on exchanges. 60% of these tokens are permanently burned to reduce the circulating supply, while the remaining 40% is distributed to die-hard community members in the form of staking rewards. Stage 10 tokens are currently flying off the shelves at $0.053 as the $RBLK price prepares for another hike in the coming days. BlockDAG (BDAG) Brings DeFi Speed To Bitcoin’s Decentralized Ecosystem BlockDAG has managed to combine the security and decentralization of Bitcoin with the unparalleled scalability and speed of directed acyclic graph (DAG) technology. BlockDAG has raised an incredible $186 million as investors have been piling in, drawn by BlockDAG's high-speed blockchain and low transaction fees, as well as the recently launched X1 crypto mining app. This aims to make crypto mining accessible for all by removing the high barriers to entry associated with the industry. BlockDAG's price will soon rise from $0.0248 as it is set to launch across 10 crypto exchanges in the coming months. Kaspa (KAS) Should Stage A Turnaround Soon Kaspa has been in a clear downtrend lately, falling by 20% in the last week to reach $0.095. In the recent crypto crash, Kaspa fell to $0.076 and began to make a recovery. However, Kaspa has since dropped by 12% in the last 24 hours and fallen to 44th place in the crypto top 50. Many remain bullish on Kaspa thanks to its proof-of-work consensus mechanism and its impressive speed and scalability. Kaspa also uses DAG technology to process multiple blocks simultaneously. If Kaspa can find support in the coming days, a return to the key price point of $0.11 looks likely before launching to new highs. Rollblock’s ROI Cannot Be Underestimated BlockDAG and Kaspa are hugely innovative projects that will likely pump impressively during the next altcoin season. However, Rollblock ($RBLK) stands to turn a complete industry on its head and as such could easily rally up to 1000x this year as it scales to become a gaming behemoth. Stage 10 RBLK tokens will soon sell out, causing its price to rise yet again from $0.053. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!
