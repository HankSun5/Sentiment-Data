Bitcoin (BTC) has reached new highs before retracing slightly, but investors’ interest in the flagship crypto keeps growing. Ethereum (ETH) has shown mild recovery. At the same time, more people are buying and selling NFTs. However, total sales are down. Bitcoin Reaches New High, Then Falls Bitcoin recently touched a new all-time high of $111,000 before slipping to $108,000. This drop is partly caused by market worries about a 50% tax increase on imports from the EU. Ethereum also rose to $2,700 this week but is now back to over $2,500, according to CoinMarketCap data. The total crypto market is now worth $3.42 trillion, which is higher than last week’s $3.29 trillion. This means more people are investing in crypto, even though NFT sales are slightly lower. NFT Sales Drop, But Participation is Rising. NFT sales dropped by 0.05% this week to $129.8 million. Ethereum is still the top NFT network with $29.6 million in sales, 26.22% less than last week. Wash trading also dropped to $2 million. Even with lower sales , more people are active in the NFT market. NFT buyers increased by 61.18% to 443,548. Sellers went up by 31.87% to 199,129. Total NFT trades also rose by 15.39% to 1,697,343. Avalanche and Polygon See Big Growth While Ethereum still leads in total NFT sales, Avalanche has taken second place with $22.3 million, a jump of 202.92%. Polygon is third with $21.3 million, growing by 45.98%. These chains are becoming strong players in the NFT space. Bitcoin NFTs fell to fourth place with $18.2 million, a 21.85% drop. Solana is now seventh, with $6.4 million in sales, a 26.36% decrease. Meanwhile, more people are buying NFTs on different chains. Avalanche had the most significant buyer growth at 79.08%, followed by Bitcoin at 72.98% and Solana at 71.09%. Furthermore, there has been a big shake-up in Non-Fungible Token collections. XSY Deposit on Avalanche is now the top NFT collection with $22.1 million in sales. However, most of this comes from just one buyer and seller. Courtyard on Polygon is second with $14.4 million in sales, up 23.23%. DMarket is third with $8.8 million, up by 7.07%. Bitcoin’s BRC-20 NFTs are now fourth with $6 million, dropping by 15.78%. Guild of Guardians Heroes is fifth with $5.9 million. CryptoPunks is sixth with $4.8 million in sales. It fell by 30.94%, as it now has fewer trades, fewer buyers, and fewer sellers than before.

This update enhances the network’s appeal for large-scale investors by streamlining infrastructure, increasing security, and enabling more efficient staking and withdrawals. While Ethereum strengthens its position as a blockchain leader, another innovative project is gaining traction in the blockchain and AI sector. Say hello to Ruvi AI, a cutting-edge platform that merges blockchain security with the intelligence of AI to tackle complex problems in today’s industries. Ruvi AI Redefines Blockchain Innovation Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,724.68 and has just released its Pectra upgrade which improves native staking for institutions. This makes the network more attractive for big players by simplifying infrastructure, increasing security and making staking and withdrawals more efficient. While Ethereum is strengthening its position as a blockchain leader another project is gaining traction in the blockchain and AI space. Say hello to Ruvi AI, a platform that combines blockchain security with AI to solve complex problems in today’s industries. Ruvi AI Redefines Blockchain Innovation Ruvi AI is going to disrupt healthcare, finance and logistics by combining the best of AI analytics with blockchain transparency. The goal is to create tools that make better decisions, simplify operations and drive real world impact. The Beta is live and users can access advanced tools for business workflows. Ruvi AI is listing on its first exchange and more to come. This means the platform is serious about getting its solutions out there and establishing itself in the tech world. Presale Success Means Confidence Ruvi AI has already captured the attention of early adopters through its presale. The Phase 1 presale was $0.01 per token and sold out in 2 weeks. Investors who got in early have already seen their token value increase by 50% as the price has risen to $0.015 in Phase 2. Analysts are bullish on Ruvi AI’s long term and many are projecting a $1 token soon after listing. This is a strong sign of confidence in Ruvi AI’s approach. Investment Opportunities Ruvi AI is offering presale bonuses for investors. Here’s what’s on offer: VIP 2 50,000 tokens during presale gets a 40% bonus and adds 20,000 tokens to total 70,000 tokens. This is a $750 investment at $0.015 per token. At listing price of $0.07 the investment would be worth $4,900 and if Ruvi AI reaches $1 per token the value would be $70,000. VIP 3 100,000 tokens gets a 60% bonus and adds 160,000 tokens. A $1,500 investment would be worth $11,200 at listing price of $0.07 and $160,000 if the token hits $1. VIP 5 500,000 tokens gets a 100% bonus and doubles to 1,000,000 tokens. At listing price of $0.07 this is $70,000 and at $1 per token it would be $1,000,000. Building a Community Ruvi AI’s roadmap is not just about technology; it’s about building a community of supporters and contributors. Through a leaderboard program the project rewards engagement: Top 10 contributors get 500,000 tokens each which would be worth $500,000 at $1. Top 50 contributors get 250,000 tokens which would be worth $250,000 at $1. Top 100 contributors get 100,000 tokens which would be worth $100,000 at $1. This encourages active participation and a collaborative ecosystem that benefits all. What’s Next Ruvi AI’s achievements so far show just how much it can shake up the intersection of blockchain and AI. That’s clear from its live Beta platform, its successful presale-and where it’s headed with those upcoming exchange listings. That makes it a project to watch in the tech innovation space. Right now, at $0.015, Ruvi AI is offering early supporters a pretty compelling reason to get in on the ground floor. With a confirmed listing price of $0.07 and the potential to reach $1 per token, the potential for growth is huge. Ethereum leads the way in blockchain advancements with updates like Pectra but Ruvi AI is showing how blockchain and AI can work together to create solutions that are both scalable and efficient.

While the world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, reached a new all-time high, LTC failed to capitalize on the injection of bullish momentum into the crypto market. However, a prominent crypto expert has come forward with a claim that Litecoin might be the most undervalued asset in the market at the moment. Interestingly, the altcoin’s price seems set to enjoy a period of strong bullish impetus over the next few months. Here’s Why LTC Price Could Be Set For An Extended Rally Chartered Market Technician Tony Severino has put forward an exciting prediction for the price trajectory of Litecoin in the coming months. According to the crypto expert, the digital asset could be preparing for an extended bull rally of at least 1,000% — and up to 2,000% — price growth. Related Reading: Traders Pile In: Bitcoin Open Interest Hits All-Time High As Price Nears $112K This bullish projection is based on the movement of the Stochastic Oscillator on the 3-month LTC price chart. The Stochastic Oscillator is an indicator used in technical analysis to gauge price momentum and pinpoint potential trend reversals. The indicator is usually represented by two lines: %K and %D. %K is a faster line while %D is a smoothed moving average of %K, and they both oscillate between 0 and 100. When the Stochastic Oscillator falls below 20, it implies an oversold market; while values above 80 often indicate an overbought market. According to Severino, the Litecoin 3-month Stochastic is approaching the 50 mark, which signals rising bullish sentiment for the altcoin’s price. The indicator failed the last time it attempted to cross this level in 2021. However, the successful breach of this 50 mark is still historically significant, as it has marked the start of substantial bull rallies in the past. For instance, the altcoin’s price grew by 4,900% when the Litecoin Stochastic crossed the level in 2017. Severino noted that it is highly unlikely for the price of Litecoin to surge by nearly 5,000% from its current level if the Stochastic Oscillator crosses the 50 level. Nevertheless, the market expert believes the asset’s price could rise by at least 1,000% and up to 2,000% by the end of 2026. Finally, Severino mentioned that the Litecoin price is in an interesting place, with the asset being one of the most undervalued crypto assets at the moment. Litecoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of LTC stands at around $96, reflecting an over 5% decline in the past 24 hours.

The event was held for holders of his meme coin, who collectively spent $148 million just to attend. Guests were promised access, luxury, and a moment with Trump. What they got instead was bad food, weak security, and a brief fly-by appearance from the president himself. According to CNBC , it was a night that left many attendees frustrated — and some outright angry. Among the 220 people who showed up were crypto figures like Sandy Carter from Unstoppable Domains and former NBA star Lamar Odom, who used the occasion to promote his own token, $ODOM. Trump showed up, said a few words, and left in a helicopter without greeting most of the room. One guest, 25-year-old Nicholas Pinto, said , “He didn’t talk to any of the 220 guests — maybe the top 25.” Pinto added that he had nothing to drink besides Trump-branded wine or water. “I don’t drink, so I had water. My glass was only filled once,” he said. As for the food? “The food sucked,” he said plainly. Guests ignored, wallets tracked, and complaints everywhere The top 25 wallets were promised a special reception and tour. But others like Pinto — who was driven there in a Lamborghini by his dad — left unimpressed and hungry. Trump only stayed 23 minutes, gave a quick speech recycling old crypto lines, then flew off without taking pictures or answering any questions. Pinto noticed that phones were not locked in RFID pouches and said security became an afterthought once Trump was gone. “Once Trump left, they didn’t really worry about anything else,” he said. Inside the ballroom, guests flaunted money. “Richard Mille watches weren’t even rare,” Pinto said. “I saw at least 16 people wearing them.” But he said the energy was off. “Lots of people didn’t even hold the coin anymore. They were checking their phones during dinner to see if the price moved.” Outside the gates, about 100 protesters gathered. One of them was Senator Jeff Merkley, who showed up to support a new bill with Chuck Schumer. The bill — called the End Crypto Corruption Act — aims to stop presidents and high officials from profiting off crypto ventures while in office. Protesters held signs saying “Crypto Corruption” and “Trump is a traitor.” Inside the event, the #1 holder of the $TRUMP coin was Justin Sun, the Chinese-born crypto billionaire. Justin holds over $22 million in the $TRUMP token and $75 million in World Liberty Financial’s token. He’s currently facing SEC fraud charges, although the case has been paused. Justin didn’t seem worried though. “As the top holder of $TRUMP and proud supporter of President Trump, it was an honor to attend the Trump Gala Dinner,” he posted. “Thank you @POTUS for your unwavering support of our industry!” The chaos around the dinner added fuel to what’s becoming a mess on Capitol Hill. Representative French Hill, a Republican from Arkansas, said the Trump family’s involvement in meme coins is “making his work in Congress harder.” Hill is one of the lawmakers behind the GENIUS Act, a bill designed to finally regulate stablecoins. But now, with Trump’s name tied to controversial tokens, he says the gala was “a distraction from the good work we need to do.” The GENIUS Act now faces a serious risk. Senator Josh Hawley added a clause that would limit credit card late fees, which banks hate. It’s now being called a poison pill that could kill support for the whole thing. While the gala was happening, Senate Democrats said they would push for new rules blocking US presidents and top officials from profiting off crypto — a direct challenge to USD1, a stablecoin linked to Trump and launched this spring. If the bill collapses, the damage could go global. JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Citi are reportedly in early discussions about building a US digital dollar. Their plan is to compete with Tether, which now dominates 60% of global crypto transactions. But those banks are waiting for legal clarity. If the GENIUS Act doesn’t pass, the US could lose momentum in the international crypto race.

Data from leading European alternative asset manager CoinShares revealed that inflows into Ethereum hit $205 million, marking a major increase from the previously reported $1.5 million. James Butterfill, a researcher at CoinShares , explained that the new development might be directly tied to Ethereum’s recent Pectra upgrade and the recent appointment of a new co-executive director as part of its leadership reshuffling process. “Ethereum was the standout performer, with US$205m in inflows last week and $575 million YTD, indicating renewed investor optimism following the successful Pectra upgrade and the appointment of new co-executive director Tomasz Stańczak,” The researcher wrote. Meanwhile, the broader cryptocurrency market saw inflows hit a staggering $785 million the previous week. The new metric, significantly topping outflows recorded earlier in the year, particularly between February and March, suggests that the market has been recovering steadily. Notably, year-to-date cryptocurrency inflows (YTD) have hit an impressive total of $7.5 billion. Despite the new figures marking a drop from last week’s total inflow of $882 million, the United States remarkably outperformed Hong Kong and Germany, which saw inflows totaling $24.2 million and $86.2 million, respectively. Acknowledging the mild decline in Bitcoin inflows recorded in the last week, CoinShare’s James Butterfill made the following assertion in the report: “Bitcoin attracted $557 million in inflows, a decrease from the prior week, likely due to continued hawkish signals from the US Federal Reserve. Short-bitcoin products saw a fourth consecutive week of inflows, totaling $5.8 million, reflecting investor positioning amid recent price gains.” With last week’s development reflecting five consecutive weeks of positive inflows, it remains to be seen how much the positive sentiment can grow and how much the current trend could influence price action for Bitcoin and altcoins alike.",Ethereum|News|Ethereum News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-24 21:04:41

However, according to the analyst, a key signal that a bearish formation is in play could be if the 21 exponential moving average (EMA) experiences a bearish cross with the 33 Simple moving average (SMA) on the weekly chart. “The top was in, and we’re heading into a bear market. Many will still believe we’re advancing, but that cross signals a major trend shift.” He asserted. Taking a step further, the analyst outlined key historical trends validating a potential bearish outcome for the altcoin. In May 2018 and November 2021, the crosses mentioned above were observed on the XRP chart, after which an 87% and 72% drop in price value was recorded. If the average cross movement is considered, the analyst sees the next major drop sending XRP down by 79.5% from the bearish cross point. Conversely, the analyst highlighted other bullish possibilities, stating that the aforementioned bullish patterns displayed in XRP’s technical chart could trigger another price rally for the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This anticipated bull run could send XRP way ahead of its $3.84 all-time high and instead place the asset at a never-before-seen price value of $27 . “Based on these bullish signals, I believe XRP could see another major pump—similar to the 1600% move—this time pushing us toward around $27 from the current level.” The analyst wrote. Despite recording a 5% decline in price value over the last week, XRP has managed to sustain momentum above $2.

With Ethereum and Avalanche also showing positive momentum amid recent news, the crypto market is heating up and Solana has hit $176, reflecting renewed confidence and setting the stage for a breakout summer—and MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the standout presale of 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Explosive Presale, 50% Bonus, and 9,800% Upside CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to dominate early-stage watchlists, with Stage 8 live and record buy volume as investors rush to secure positions before listings. The project’s scarcity-driven model, capped supply, and HashEx-audited contracts provide a secure foundation for growth. Analysts are forecasting up to 9,800% upside, with on-chain data showing skyrocketing wallet activity and repeat buyers signaling strong conviction in the project’s long-term trajectory. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the clear standout for early-stage returns . Early participants can now use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% bonus on token purchases, making MAGA even more attractive for those targeting transformative gains. Solana (SOL): Bullish Momentum and Technical Strength Solana has surged from $100 to $176 since April, with technical indicators like RSI and MACD signaling sustained momentum and possible further gains. Analysts predict a potential move toward $200–$210 if bullish sentiment holds, especially as network activity and DeFi TVL continue to rise. Even with this strong performance, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers higher-multiple upside for early investors. Ethereum (ETH): Surge in Capital Inflows and Price Momentum Ethereum recently saw a dramatic 8.2% price surge in 24 hours, reaching $3,850 as trading volume spiked by 35% to $18.5 billion. This influx is attributed to institutional interest and a broader risk-on sentiment in tech markets, with ETH now testing resistance at $3,900. While Ethereum remains a core holding for DeFi and Web3, its near-term upside is steady compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Avalanche (AVAX): Ecosystem Growth and Price Outlook CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Avalanche is trading around $24–$25, with bullish patterns and strong DeFi activity hinting at continued growth. Analysts see AVAX potentially reaching $30–$56 in a bullish scenario, but its trajectory is steadier than the presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which stands out as the top pick for outsized returns . Conclusion Solana’s rise to $176 and the surge in Ethereum and Avalanche are impressive, but the real excitement is in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearing completion, a 9,800% upside forecast, and the PATRIOT50X 50% bonus still available, MAGA is the breakout contender for 2025.

The first batch of brain chips is expected to arrive in late 2025. The company, incorporated in 2019, published its first blog post about the new brain chip, positioning itself as a new competitor to Elon Musk’s Neuralink. Starfish stated that the custom electrophysiology chip will interact with multiple brain regions simultaneously. This means that the chip will read and write to connected parts of the brain, making it possible to help people with neurological disorders. Starfish is making a miniaturized brain chip Most existing brain chips are fairly bulky. Each side usually measures more than 5 mm (about the width of two stacked pennies) and may reach 10 mm or more per side. In addition, such chips consume a high power of 10s of milliwatts (mW). Starfish stated that the upcoming brain chip will be miniaturized, making it much smaller than expected. The chip will have physically small dimensions of 2 x 4 millimeter (mm) and a 0.3 mm-pitch Ball Grid Array (BGA) package. A BGA is simply a type of chip carrier used for integrated circuits (ICs). In terms of power consumption, the chip will operate at an ultra-low power range. During normal recording of brain spikes, the chip will consume a total of 1.1 milliwatts (mW). This is equivalent to powering a single LED or a low-power temperature sensor. By having a tiny chip that consumes ultra-low power, Starfish aims to reduce the surgical impact of brain implants. Other features include recording neural spikes and local field potentials (LFPs), which are the slower, smoother voltage fluctuations in the brain. Moreover, the chip will stimulate the brain by sending tiny electric pulses that go positive and then negative, known as biphasic pulses. The chip will also include 32 electrode sites that interface directly with brain tissue. It will record from 16 of these sites simultaneously. Each active channel samples at 18.75 kHz to capture rapid neural spikes and waveforms with high precision. There will be one current source for stimulating any pair of electrodes. Also, the brain chip will monitor impedance and measure voltage transients onboard. It will process data digitally, detect spikes in real-time, and transmit relevant data over low-bandwidth wireless links. The chip will be fabricated using TSMC’s 55 nm process for optimal size and efficiency. Starfish announced that it is “interested in finding collaborators for whom such a chip would open new and exciting avenues.” The company is looking for people who work in fields like wireless communications or people who design custom implanted neural interfaces. However, any person who believes the brain chip is useful to their field of work is welcome to collaborate. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Yet among these giants, a new coin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is turning heads with its explosive potential. The fifth phase of Mutuum Finance presale continues as this high-growth altcoin sells at $0.03 and has collected $9.1 million. The next stage of the presale will boost MUTM’s price to $0.035 while attracting more than 11,000 investors. This phase’s investors will receive a 100% profit when the launch price reaches $0.06. For investors looking beyond SOL, ETH and XRP, MUTM could be a pivotal play in the 2025 crypto boom. For investors searching for the best altcoin to buy now, MUTM is shaping up to be one of the top cryptocurrencies to watch. Ethereum, Solana, and XRP Gear Up for 2025 Altcoin Season Surge Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Ripple’s XRP all enter 2025 with a lot of steam behind them, each one backed by niche fundamentals that will catalyze massive gains during the next altseason. Ethereum, currently trading at approximately $2,496, will probably break through the $10,000 mark with scaling enhancements like Pectra that cut through inefficiencies in its network. Solana, trading around $166, is rapidly emerging as a fast, inexpensive network powering DeFi and meme coins, and that’s where bullish projections believe it has a chance to break out to $500. XRP, in the meantime, remains an anchor for cross-border payments, and regulatory news in its favor can finally push it up to $5 from its current position at $2.35. While these giants prepare for liftoff, new tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are picking up steam with the capability of outperforming in ROI. A DeFi Giant on the Rise Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 11,000 investors have joined the presale funding to support the project which has received $9.1 million in total. Mutuum Finance’s price has currently reached $0.03 in Phase 5 even though investors anticipate a 16.67% price increase in Phase 6 which will generate considerable profit potential. Analysts forecast MUTM to surge beyond $5 in upcoming months when it launches at $0.06 because its distinctive lending approach meets rising market requirements thus making it an underappreciated yet promising DeFi resource. The Dual-Model System for Enhanced DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts. The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi. Driving Community Growth with Investor Rewards To attract more community members Mutuum Finance implements profitable incentive programs at an aggressive pace. The program will use $100,000 to give ten investors $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and the referral system gives rewards to users who bring in new investors to the platform. The platform gives early supporters exclusive benefits including VIP-exclusive updates to enhance their connection with the platform. Mutuum Finance is quickly gaining momentum with over $9.1 million raised and 11,000+ investors buying in at $0.03 during its presale. With a projected 100% profit at the $0.06 launch price and a forecasted surge beyond $5, MUTM presents a compelling alternative to Ethereum, Solana, and XRP in the 2025 altcoin season. Its innovative dual lending model combines automated liquidity pools with direct peer-to-peer loans, maximizing yield and decentralization. Backed by strong community incentives and transparent governance, Mutuum Finance is well-positioned to outperform established players and capture significant market share in the coming months.

Cardano is now inching toward $0.76, signaling renewed confidence among investors, but it is MAGACOIN FINANCE that is rewriting the playbook for early-stage success in 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Unprecedented Presale Momentum and 13,000% Upside CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing the imagination of the crypto community, with Stage 8 attracting record participation from both retail and institutional buyers. The project’s innovative tokenomics—a fixed supply, rigorous audits, and a compelling narrative—are setting a new benchmark for presale projects. Early backers can leverage the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code to secure a 50% bonus, amplifying the appeal for those seeking exponential gains. Analysts are now pointing to a potential 13,000% upside, fueled by robust on-chain activity and a rapidly expanding investor base. In a market hungry for innovation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the frontrunner for outsized early-stage returns . Cardano (ADA): Testing Resistance and Building Momentum Cardano is trading just shy of $0.76, with technical indicators hinting at a possible breakout if buying pressure persists. Recent developments in the ecosystem, including new DeFi integrations and partnerships, are bolstering sentiment. While ADA’s fundamentals remain solid, its growth trajectory is more gradual compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which continues to set the pace for early-stage excitement. XRP: Institutional Interest and Price Resilience XRP is holding steady above $2.35, supported by ongoing regulatory progress and growing institutional interest. Market watchers are eyeing a potential move toward $2.85–$3.40 if bullish trends continue, with some forecasts even suggesting higher targets by year-end. Despite its strong position, XRP’s upside is outpaced by the dynamic growth and presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE, making MAGA the preferred choice for those seeking rapid appreciation. Bitcoin (BTC): Stability and Institutional Backing Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of the crypto market, trading above $110,000 with strong institutional backing and ETF inflows. Analysts anticipate a potential push toward $115,000 if current momentum holds, but the scale of BTC’s market cap means its growth is now more measured. In contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a unique opportunity for investors to participate in a project still in its formative stages, with far greater upside potential. Hedera (HBAR): Steady Progress and Future Prospects Hedera is consolidating near $0.21, with technicals indicating a period of stability after recent gains. Analysts are optimistic about a move toward $0.25–$0.30 in the coming months, but the pace of growth is expected to be steady rather than explosive. For those seeking the next major breakout, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the clear leader for high-growth early-stage investments. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion Cardano’s approach to $0.76 and the steady performance of XRP, Bitcoin, and Hedera are noteworthy, but the spotlight is firmly on MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearing completion, a 13,000% growth path, and the PATRIOT50X 50% bonus still available, MAGA is the breakout opportunity of 2025.

Crypto community sounds alarm about Ledger phishing letter scam Industry executives and crypto community members are raising the alarm about a new phishing scam in the form of physical letters sent to crypto holders made to look like communication from the Ledger hardware wallet company.

Judge overturns fraud convictions in Mango Markets exploit case A US federal judge has vacated key fraud and manipulation convictions against Avraham Eisenberg, the trader at the center of the case involving a $110 million exploit of the decentralized exchange Mango Markets. On Friday, US District Judge Arun Subramanian ruled that the evidence presented at trial failed to support the jury’s conclusion that Eisenberg made materially false representations to Mango Markets. The decision vacates Eisenberg’s convictions for commodities fraud and market manipulation and acquits him of a third charge, significantly weakening the government’s case. Eisenberg, a self-proclaimed “applied game theorist,” was convicted in 2024 for artificially inflating the price of Mango’s MNGO token by over 1,300% in a matter of minutes and using the resulting gains as collateral to withdraw $110 million in crypto assets from the platform.

After reaching a 24-hour high of $3.9599, the pair encountered strong resistance, triggering a sharp pullback. SUI’s rejection has led to a notable 6.64% decline over the past day, raising questions about whether SUI can stabilize or if further downside is ahead. SUI Uptrend Peaks At $4.20 Before Sharp Reversal MAB’s recent analysis highlights that from May 20 to May 23, SUI experienced a clear uptrend, marked by consistently higher highs and higher lows. The steady upward movement peaked around the $4.20 level, reflecting strong bullish momentum during that period. Related Reading: SUI Preparing For Another Leg Up – Is $5 The Next Target? However, shortly after reaching its peak, SUI faced a sharp reversal. Large red candles appeared on the chart, indicating heavy selling pressure and a rapid loss of value. This sudden downturn from the recent highs caught many by surprise, with profit-taking triggering fears in the market. Volume analysis further supports this narrative. There was a notable spike in volume at the peak and during the sell-off, showing strong market participation in the decline. Currently, trading volume remains elevated at around 462.57 million USDT, which indicates continued activity. SUI is now testing a critical support zone between $3.6000 and $3.6500. A break below this area might pave the way for further losses, pushing the price down to the 24-hour low near $3.5233 or even lower. Market Sentiment: Fear Or Opportunity? Crypto Man MAB elaborated on the market dynamics by pointing out clear bearish signals alongside potential bullish opportunities. He noted that the sharp decline from the $4.20 peak and the inability to maintain levels above $3.8000 signal that bearish momentum is dominating. This is supported by the 7-day performance, which shows a 5.62% drop, underscoring the prevailing short-term weakness. Related Reading: SUI Hype Grows As Price Action Points To A Rally: $4 Level In Focus On the bullish side, the analyst pointed out that if the crucial $3.6000 support level holds firm, there could be a rebound toward $3.8000, a previous resistance turned into a support level. This support could encourage SUI buyers to re-enter the market, setting the stage for upward movement. Looking beyond the immediate fluctuations, the analyst emphasized that the 30-day gain of 20.29% and the 90-day gain of 5.90% reflect an overall positive trend for SUI. Despite recent setbacks, this suggests that a sustained recovery remains possible if buying pressure strengthens. To sum up, he highlighted that SUI stands at a crucial crossroads, and a drop below the $3.6000 support could lead to additional downside pressure. However, a strong bounce from this zone might pave the way for a recovery supported by increasing volume, whereas growing volume on a decline would reinforce the bearish outlook.

45058615,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=734277,1748126574,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45058615.jpeg,"Dubai picks XRP Ledger for real estate tokenization as 3,000 investors register",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/dubai-picks-xrp-ledger-for-real-estate-tokenization-as-3000-investors-register/,"More than 3,000 investors have registered for Dubai’s flagship real estate tokenization program. Mahmoud AlBurai, a senior executive at the Dubai Land Department (DLD), disclosed this in a post on LinkedIn. According to AlBurai , the massive number of participants who have joined the waitlist highlights their interest in the project. The real estate tokenization project is the first in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. With the pilot launched on March 16, the DLD partnered with Prypco Mint and Ctrl Alt to tokenize ownership deeds of real estate properties owned by the government. The department now plans to offer fractional ownership of these properties to investors. Presently, only holders of an Emirates Card, i.e., official residents of the United Arab Emirates, can participate in the program. Despite the eligibility limit, many investors have shown interest in the project. This is likely because several regulators are playing key roles in the actualization of the project. Beyond the DLD, the Dubai Future Foundation, Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), and the Central Bank of UAE are also involved, giving potential investors confidence in the project. While the project remains in the early stages, DLD already has big projections. In its earlier announcement, it predicted that it could become a $16 billion market by 2033, noting the effectiveness, transparency, and accessibility that blockchain could enable for the real estate market. Dubai picks XRPL to tokenize real estate assets Interestingly, Dubai chose Ripple’s XRP Ledger as the blockchain for tokenizing the deeds. According to AlBurai, XRPL is the pilot phase network. This has led to speculations as to whether XRPL would be the only choice or if it plans to expand to other networks. For now, the choice of XRPL represents a momentous milestone for the blockchain network. While it has seen minimal activity compared to other major smart contract networks, its use for the project represents an opportunity to show its ability for tokenization. Ripple has been actively pushing for tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) on XRPL. Last year, it invested $5 million into a tokenized money market fund on XRPL by UK-based firm Abrdn while investing $10 million into tokenized US treasury bills by OpenEden after the platform launched on XRPL. With real estate tokenization entering the mix, XRPL looks poised for more institutional adoption. Ripple recently secured a payments provider license from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) and has started onboarding institutions into its payments service, which is enabled through XRPL. UAE could emerge as a leader in real estate tokenization Meanwhile, the DLD Tokenization Project, while still in the pilot phase, could allow the UAE to become a pioneer in the real estate tokenization sector. While tokenization of RWA has become one of the most exciting sectors globally, most financial institutions and regulators are currently focused on tokenization of financial products such as securities and bonds. This means that the real estate sector has seen limited tokenization efforts, allowing Dubai to dominate with its Real Estate Tokenization Sandbox. So far, the UAE has seen about $3 billion worth of real estate assets tokenized, according to local reports . Interestingly, regulatory involvement in the Dubai real estate tokenization efforts could also prove to be an advantage after a recent lawsuit by the US Securities and Exchange Commission against real estate tokenization company Unicoin executives. The SEC alleged in the lawsuit that Unicoin, which claimed to own several tokenized estate properties, did not own any of the assets and inflated their value. It added that the firm also misled investors about returns and exaggerated sales. With the lawsuit likely to shake investors’ confidence in the tokenized real estate sector, a government-backed project with regulatory support from several agencies could be an alternative to private projects.

Ethereum is steadily climbing, while Bitcoin’s robust rally above $111,000 is fueling optimism across the board. In this environment, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE and established assets such as XRP are emerging as top contenders for outsized gains—offering strategic entry points for those willing to act before major catalysts unfold. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Unrivaled Presale Momentum and 10,500% Upside JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly establishing itself as the breakout presale of 2025 , drawing unprecedented demand from both retail and institutional investors. With over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearing completion, the project’s capped supply, audited contracts, and viral political narrative are driving a surge in participation. Early backers can now use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code to secure a 50% bonus on token purchases, amplifying the opportunity for transformative gains. Analysts are projecting up to 10,500% upside, with some models even suggesting a $1 valuation by year-end if momentum continues. In a market hungry for innovation, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the clear leader for early-stage returns. Ethereum (ETH): Steady Climb and Institutional Adoption Ethereum is trading between $2,400 and $2,900, with bullish technicals and ongoing upgrades supporting its long-term outlook. The network’s recent Layer 2 expansion and anticipation of ETF approvals are fueling institutional interest, with analysts forecasting a potential move toward $4,000–$6,000 by late 2025. While Ethereum remains a core holding for DeFi and Web3, its near-term upside is steady compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Regulatory Clarity and Price Resilience XRP is consolidating above $2.30, buoyed by regulatory clarity, CME futures speculation, and significant whale accumulation. Analysts forecast a move toward $2.41 in June, with some bullish scenarios targeting $5 and beyond if ETF approvals and adoption accelerate. Despite its strong fundamentals, XRP’s growth trajectory is steady—underscoring why MAGACOIN FINANCE is the preferred choice for those seeking rapid appreciation. Bitcoin (BTC): Institutional Strength and Price Range Bitcoin is trading above $111,000, with analysts predicting a range of $110,000–$115,000 for May and potential highs of $140,000 if bullish momentum sustains. Institutional inflows and ETF demand are reinforcing BTC’s dominance, but its upside is now more measured—making MAGACOIN FINANCE the clear destination for investors targeting higher-growth opportunities. Litecoin (LTC): Steady Performance and Market Position Litecoin is trading near $82, with recent volatility following news of a delayed ETF decision. Analysts expect LTC to reach up to $92.69 in May, but its growth is gradual and its market position remains subdued compared to the explosive presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which continues to set the standard for early-stage excitement. CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE Conclusion Ethereum’s steady gains and XRP’s bullish momentum are noteworthy, but the real excitement is in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearing completion, a 10,500% upside forecast, and the PATRIOT50X 50% bonus still available, MAGA is the breakout contender for 2025. Bitcoin and Litecoin provide stability, but for those seeking the next crypto supercycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands as the defining early-stage opportunity.

While Bitcoin and Injective maintain their appeal among institutional players, market participants are increasingly drawn to the dynamic potential of early-stage projects—with MAGACOIN FINANCE at the forefront. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Surge, Whale Activity, and 50% Bonus JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE is commanding attention as its Stage 8 presale progresses, amassing over $8 million in contributions. The initiative’s capped supply, rigorous auditing by HashEx, and compelling narrative are driving unprecedented engagement. Traders are noting accumulation patterns that echo previous cycle breakouts, while analysts project returns between 25x and 35x, with some models even suggesting up to 18,500% gains if current trends persist. Early supporters can access a 50% token bonus via the exclusive PATRIOT50X code, further enhancing MAGA’s allure for those pursuing rapid appreciation. Each new phase sparks heightened activity and enthusiasm, solidifying MAGACOIN FINANCE as the community’s breakout contender for the coming year . Bitcoin (BTC): Institutional Demand and Market Leadership Bitcoin continues to anchor the market, hovering near $111,500 amid robust institutional inflows and optimistic technical signals. Forecasts indicate BTC could test $121,000 by late May, yet its more stable trajectory is prompting savvy participants to diversify into high-growth alternatives—where MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the preferred choice for outsized returns. XRP: Steady Performance and Shifting Trader Focus XRP remains resilient at $2.37, consolidating after recent advances. While regulatory clarity and ETF speculation keep sentiment positive, short-term volatility has led to a rotation of interest among holders. Many are now directing attention and capital toward early-stage ventures such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is rapidly becoming the most talked-about opportunity in online trading circles. Ethereum (ETH): Technical Rebound and Community Sentiment Ethereum has rebounded to $2,489, reflecting a 4% intraday gain and signs of renewed momentum. Despite its strong fundamentals and institutional adoption, ETH’s appreciation is outpaced by the excitement surrounding MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is now the focal point for traders seeking the next major breakout. Injective (INJ): Consistent Growth and Emerging Trends Injective trades near $17.74, with analysts predicting a rise to $18.56 in June as DeFi activity expands. Although INJ’s growth is steady, its presence in trading discussions is overshadowed by the surging popularity of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which continues to dominate as the most trending asset across crypto communities. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Trading forums are agog with MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has overtaken XRP and Ethereum in both conversation and sentiment. With Stage 8 nearing completion, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst projections up to 18,500% ROI, MAGA is the undisputed early-stage standout for 2025.

According to a report from SCMP citing HSBC official statements, the settlement service allows the conversion of bank cash deposits into digital tokens on the blockchain. This will allow the bank’s corporate customers to make real-time payments using US Dollars (USD) and Hong Kong Dollars (HKD). The service is expected to reduce the cost of client transactions and ensure that payment can happen within a shorter period and at all times. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) supported the initiative through its Supervisory Incubator for Distributed Ledger Technology. Speaking on the achievement, HSBC’s global head of domestic and emerging payments for global payments solution, Lewis Sun, said it can improve payments and cash management. Sun said: “Tokenised deposits, when supported by regulated financial institutions, can offer a safe and fully compliant approach to improving payments and cash management for [companies].” The service already has its first user, with Alibaba affiliate Ant International using it for an instant fund transfer. Ant noted in a separate press release that the pilot test of the product using Ant’s blockchain-based global treasury management platform, the Whale. HSBC integrated the experience from the pilot testing into the tokenized deposit service before the full launch. Currently, the service is only available in Hong Kong, but HSBC plans to expand it to other countries in Asia and Europe by the year’s second half. Big banks are embracing tokenization Meanwhile, the launch of the tokenized deposits is only another step in the long-term tokenization plan for HSBC. The bank launched gold tokenization as far back as 2023 and plans to use the blockchain network and technologies to create a new digital transfer and settlement infrastructure. Part of its planned use cases include digital currency settlements and other forms of tokenization. The bank has been exploring various uses of digital ledger technologies with initiatives such as tokenized bonds, the Orion blockchain platform, and several others. However, it is not alone; several other major banks and financial institutions have identified tokenization as the next frontier for the financial markets. Institutions such as BlackRock, JP Morgan, Visa, Mastercard, and others are all exploring the incorporation of tokenization into payments and financial markets. Several banks, including Bank of America, Euroclear, and Italian Central Bank, also recently tapped Solana as a tokenization layer after developer R3 partnered with Solana Foundation to connect its private blockchain Corda to the public network. The massive interest in the sector from every stakeholder, both traditional institutions and fintech companies, explains why researchers predict it could be worth $30 trillion by 2030. Hong Kong status as digital finance hub increases Meanwhile, HSBC’s choice of Hong Kong to launch the tokenized deposit service highlights how the city has become a major hub for global financial innovation. Hong Kong has been active in its efforts to attract financial technology and digital assets companies with regulatory clarity and government-banked initiatives. Unsurprisingly, the tokenized deposit service is a product of one of such initiatives, with HSBC being one of the key participants in Phase 2 of the city’s e-HKD Pilot Program. The program focuses on banks experimenting with how tokenized fiat currencies can be used in digital asset transactions. The bank has also been involved in HKMA projects such as mBridge and Ensemble. Interestingly, Hong Kong also recently passed a Stablecoin bill that expands its regulatory framework for digital assets by requiring all stablecoin issuers to get a license from the HKMA. The government claims that the new law, which is expected to come into force this year, will provide financial stability while encouraging innovation.

As the summer bull run of 2025 approaches, the spotlight is on SUI and Solana . Which of these cryptocurrencies holds the key to maximum gains? The answer could shape investment strategies in the coming months. Dive in to discover which coin is poised for significant growth. SUI’s Rapid Surge with Attractive Trading Levels SUI experienced a notable 44.75% gain over the past month and a solid 12.53% increase over the last six months. The coin's price behavior changed from slow and steady movements to a pronounced surge recently, indicating a rise in buyer interest and active trading participation. This shift from modest growth to a rapid upward trend highlights the evolving dynamics in its market performance. Currently, SUI’s price fluctuates between $2.19 and $4.34, with support at $0.88 and resistance at $5.19. Bulls maintain strength within this range, but mixed momentum signals suggest caution. Trading strategies could involve buying near the support level and targeting exits as the price approaches resistance while closely monitoring to mitigate risk. Solana Price Trends and Key Levels Over the last month, Solana showed strong upward movement with a 20.92% price gain, while over the past six months it experienced a downturn of nearly 29.28%. Price activity has been volatile, with significant positive movement in the short term counterbalanced by longer downturns. Historical data suggests periods of rapid recovery followed by marked corrections, emphasizing a fluctuating pattern in the coin’s performance. Current trading shows Solana in a range between $109.63 and $171.27. Immediate resistance stands at $194.93, with a secondary level at $256.57, while support appears at $71.65 and then at $10.01. Indicators like a 64.57 RSI combined with a slight negative momentum hint at cautious bullish control. Trades within these levels may favor buyers if prices hold above support and clear resistance is eventually breached. Conclusion SUI has shown solid performance and has promising technology, while SOL has a robust track record and strong community support. SUI may offer higher growth potential due to its innovative solutions and newer presence. SOL remains a reliable choice with established infrastructure and partnerships. Diversifying investments between both could balance the portfolio. Final decisions should align with individual investment goals and risk tolerance.

Amid this market downturn, popular market analyst CasiTrades has stated that XRP lies in danger of a further decline should a particular support level fail. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Above Key Prices – Data Points To $2,900 Level As Bullish Trigger XRP Must Avoid Crash Below $2.25 – $2.26 As Bitcoin prices reached a new all-time high in the past week, XRP followed suit, reaching as high as $2.45 before experiencing a price rejection driven by negative macroeconomic pressure due to the new international tariffs by the US Government. In the day, XRP price notably declined by over 5% from $2.45 to $2.33 before finding some stability to enter a sideways movement as seen in the last few hours. According to CasiTrades, XRP’s rejection aligns with a 1:1 Fibonacci extension of the corrective C-wave pattern in the Elliott Wave Theory, signaling the possible exhaustion of the previous relief rally seen earlier in the week. Notably, the analyst warns that XRP’s decline may lead to a retest of “major structural support” at the $2.25 – $2.26 price zone, which aligns with the Fibonacci retracement level 0.382. CasiTrades explains that Fib 0.382 has represented a key technical price level over the past six months. Therefore, a price break below this level could trigger deeper corrections, forcing XRP’s price as low as $1.55 – $1.90, a price move that would wipe out all price gains that have been recorded since the crypto market uptrend resumed in early April. However, if the $2.25 – $2.26 support zone holds, such market resilience could trigger a new price rally to around $2.70 and beyond. Thereafter, XRP is likely to return to the local peak of the current bull run at $3.84.

However, the altcoin is up by 9.77% in the past month, reflecting that the majority of new market entrants are still in profit. In other positive news, Volatility shares launched an XRP futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) on May 22. It is a 1x fund, indicating that it would track the daily performance of XRP futures contracts with no leverage. With a total market cap of $233.58 billion, XRP remains the 4th largest cryptocurrency and third-largest altcoin in the market.

Aptos (APT): Price Consolidation and Future Potential Aptos is consolidating around $4.09, with forecasts suggesting a trading range of $2.79 to $5.38 for May 2025.

Yet the fact that almost everyone can name a digital coin shows that Singapore’s trading scene is maturing. Singaporean Investors are increasing their XRP holdings.👇 https://t.co/ydq9PGwmXj pic.twitter.com/aK9H85ZVwb — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 22, 2025 XRP Ownership On The Rise Based on reports from Milieu Insight Market Research, XRP saw one of the strongest gains among altcoins. It now represents 17% of crypto holdings in Singapore, up from 14% last year. Ethereum grew even more, climbing from 41% to 48%. Solana ticked up from 17% to 19%, while Dogecoin rose only 1 point, from 18% to 19%. Still, XRP’s 3-point boost hints at growing trust in its payment-focused design. Monthly Investments Varied Widely Investors in Singapore are not all spending the same amount each month. About 57% put in less than $500. Another 29% contribute between $500 and $1,000. Only 10% dedicate more than $1,000 each month to steadier “dollar-cost averaging.” Those figures suggest that most people treat crypto as a side play rather than a full-time career. Stablecoin Trends And RLUSD Stablecoins are also part of the mix. Roughly 46% of respondents said they own—or once owned—these US-pegged assets. Of that group, 21% hold them now, while 25% have moved on. Eighty-three percent prefer USD-pegged coins. In that context, Ripple’s new RLUSD has reached a $310 million market cap in just a few months. Ripple’s APAC managing director, Fiona Murray, said the coin is not just for trading but also for cross-border payments and DeFi work.

Businesses worldwide had no choice but to quickly change how they manage supply chains, plan pricing, and choose global partners. Companies relying on overseas factories had to pass the new costs on to customers, find new suppliers in other countries, or figure out how to work with a confusing and constantly changing tariff system that made every shipment more expensive and difficult to track. Many businesses realized that their old systems weren’t fast or smart enough to handle all the changes because tariff laws could now shift overnight and expose their operations to risks they couldn’t predict. AI has become a lifeline for companies to understand their supply chains, reduce their tariff exposure, and find new ways to cut costs. Trump started a trade fight, and companies turned to AI Donald Trump’s administration introduced tariffs that made global trade more tense and unpredictable for companies that had spent decades building international supply chains. The Trump tariffs affected electric vehicles and batteries , while others targeted raw materials, machinery, consumer electronics, and simple goods like textiles and furniture. Since the US customs system has more than 20,000 product categories, each one could face a different rate or rule depending on the country of origin and trade status. This uncertainty forced companies to go back and analyze thousands of product categories, track long Harmonized Tariff Schedule codes, and figure out which parts of their inventory were now affected. Businesses quickly needed smarter tools to read tariff schedules, track product codes, analyze costs, and react instantly to customs office updates. So, they turned to artificial intelligence to survive a new era of fast, deep, and unpredictable tariffs. Companies turned to AI to keep up with tariffs Companies discovered that AI could read huge volumes of complex documents, connect the dots across departments, and react faster than human teams ever could. Salesforce created a powerful AI agent that could instantly scan and understand the US. Harmonized Tariff Schedule (4,400 pages) for businesses to identify every possible product category and associated duty. Kinaxis used AI to let businesses run live supply chain simulations that showed what would happen if they changed one part of their operation. This way, companies will know how to keep production running while lowering costs and avoiding new tariffs. Wipro combined traditional machine learning with new generative AI systems to quickly analyze global trade routes, supplier locations, shipping lanes, and tariff exposure. The system would then recommend how to reroute cargo, switch to cheaper vendors, or adjust sourcing strategies so businesses could stay flexible and competitive even as the rules kept shifting. These AI systems took over work that was simply too large, fast, and complex for human teams to manage independently. These tasks include tracking new trade policies as they happened, scanning global supplier data for vulnerabilities, modeling what-if scenarios for cost impact, and suggesting better decisions that balance speed, savings, and compliance. A lifeline for big companies, but what about everyone else? Large corporations have the money, talent, and data to train AI tools properly. AI made them flexible and intelligent enough to respond instantly to changing trade rules and protect their profit margins in ways that older systems or manual processes simply couldn’t match. But many small businesses don’t have enough money to buy AI tools, hire experts to build custom models, or collect the clean, real-time data AI systems need to work properly and deliver useful insights. AI is often portrayed as magic, but the truth is that it’s only as good as the data it works with. If a company can’t afford clean, updated, and well-organized data about its products, suppliers, logistics, and costs, then even the best AI system won’t be able to deliver the results that big businesses already see. AI has become a lifeline in this context, helping companies navigate unpredictable policies. But the deeper question going forward is whether this lifeline will also act as a ladder, giving smaller businesses and under-resourced players a way to climb into the future, or whether it remains just a crutch for the most powerful to keep their lead while others fall further behind.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) checks all those boxes, quickly earning its place among the best cryptocurrencies to invest in today. Unlike many tokens that rely solely on hype, MUTM delivers a robust DeFi platform designed to maximize yield opportunities while maintaining security and scalability. The project has hit phase 5 of its presale after selling out phase 4 at a higher pace than expected. MUTM will be launched officially at $0.06. The next phase prices will spike by 16.67% to $0.035. The tokens are available at $0.03, with listing at $0.06, offering early investors up to 100% potential returns. MUTM is rapidly taking center stage, with over $9.1 million raised and attracted more than 11,000 investors. With its competitive entry price and promising roadmap, MUTM is capturing attention as a top crypto to buy now, poised to challenge established giants and lead the next wave of decentralized finance innovation. Investors looking for the best crypto to invest in today should keep a close eye on MUTM as it gears up for major growth in 2025. Phase 4 Sold Out, MUTM’s Ascent Is Only Beginning The presale is in phase 5 with Phase 4 totally sold out. The tokens are available at $0.03, and listing for $0.06, early investors are looking at up to 100% potential returns. MUTM is rapidly taking center stage, with over $9.1 million raised and attracted more that 11,000 investors. As Phase 5 is in , the token price will rise to $0.035 in the next phase, providing current participants with a 16.67% profit. A Smarter DeFi Model: Hybrid Lending for a New Era Mutuum Finance stands out through its dual approach to crypto lending, which integrates Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) allows users to put stablecoins like USDT into smart contract liquidity pools and automatically earn passive income. In contrast, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) allows lenders and borrowers to communicate directly without intermediaries, with the ability to adjust loan terms and privacy advantages. This is a hybrid solution that provides more decentralization and flexibility but at the same time has strong yield opportunities, while liquidity providers receive over 10% today in passive return. Trust and Transparency: Stable, Audited, and Made to Last Mutuum Finance isn’t just innovating, it’s building trust. The platform’s smart contracts are open-source and undergoing rigorous audit by Certik. In addition to the native token, a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin is being developed, which circumvents the vulnerabilities of algorithmic stablecoins that have toppled other DeFi initiatives. The project is set to build a USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum network as one of the main features in the Mutuum Finance roadmap. Security and transparency are fundamentals of the ecosystem. Fostering Growth with $100K Giveaway and Gamified Community Tools To turbocharge adoption, Mutuum Finance is actively incentivizing its early adopters. Already underway is a $100,000 giveaway, where ten participants will receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens. Running in tandem is a gamified leaderboard, displaying and rewarding the top 50 token holders, to encourage greater investment and continued participation. This is supported through a referral program, a new level of grassroots expansion in this rapidly growing community. Mutuum Finance has raised over $9.1 million from 11,000+ investors, offering tokens at $0.03 with a launch price of $0.06—delivering up to 100% returns. The upcoming price increase to $0.035 provides an additional 16.67% profit for current buyers. Combining a unique hybrid lending model with Certik-audited smart contracts, MUTM ensures strong yields and security. With a $100,000 giveaway and active community rewards, Mutuum is set to lead DeFi growth into 2025. Don’t miss the chance to be part of this rising project.

While Bitcoin and Solana remain key holdings, the spotlight is increasingly turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP—two assets now seen as top contenders for 10,200% upside scenarios in 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Momentum, 50% Bonus, and 10,200% Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the standout early-stage opportunity of 2025, drawing both retail and institutional attention. The project’s unique blend of scarcity-driven tokenomics, audited contracts, and viral narrative is fueling record demand. Stage 8 Live: Over $8 million raised, with each presale stage filling faster than the last as investors rush to secure positions before price discovery. 50% Bonus with PATRIOT50X: Early buyers can use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% token bonus, amplifying potential returns. Analyst Targets: Industry experts forecast returns of up to 10,200%, with some models suggesting even higher upside if current momentum holds. With these catalysts, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now the go-to allocation for those seeking transformative early-stage gains. Ethereum (ETH): Bullish Technicals and Institutional Adoption Ethereum is trading between $2,400 and $2,900, with technical indicators signaling a possible breakout above $2,700 toward $2,800–$2,900 if momentum sustains. The Parabolic SAR and RSI both suggest renewed buying interest, while institutional adoption and Layer 2 growth underpin ETH’s long-term outlook. While Ethereum remains a core asset, its upside is now outpaced by the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin (BTC): Market Anchor and Capital Rotation Bitcoin is trading above $110,000, with institutional inflows and strong market structure reinforcing its dominance. Analysts see BTC potentially reaching $115,000 or higher if bullish momentum continues. As Bitcoin’s pace steadies, traders are diversifying into high-growth altcoins—where MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the top choice for outsized returns. Solana (SOL): Technical Strength and DeFi Surge Solana is consolidating between $158 and $175, with a breakout above $175 potentially leading to a retest of $183. The network’s high throughput and expanding DeFi ecosystem continue to attract users and developers. While Solana’s outlook is positive, its upside is more gradual compared to the presale-driven momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Stellar (XLM): Steady Growth, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Stellar is projected to trade between $0.65 and $0.80 in 2025, with technicals and institutional interest supporting long-term gains. While XLM’s fundamentals are strong, its near-term upside is less dramatic than the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which continues to set the standard for early-stage excitement. Conclusion Ethereum’s bullish chart patterns and Bitcoin’s stability are noteworthy, but the real excitement is in MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP—where early-stage momentum and analyst forecasts up to 10,200% ROI are drawing smart capital. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and strong community engagement, MAGA is the breakout contender for 2025.

The Russian technology entrepreneur will deliver his keynote speech remotely via livestream despite the travel ban, according to the Human Rights Foundation (HRF.) The Oslo Freedom Forum is organized by the Human Rights Foundation (HRF), a non-profit promoting freedom of speech and democracy globally. HRF founder Thor Halvorssen said the decision was disappointing, adding that it was a shame the French courts had banned Mr. Durov from attending an event where his voice was so critical. He has been the subject of legal investigation in France since August 2024. Durov was arrested while trying to leave the country at Le Bourget Airport near Paris. French prosecutors charged him with complicity in distributing child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and refusal of assistance to law enforcement. Telegram reportedly refused more than 3,000 law enforcement requests to provide evidence connected to criminal content. Following his arrest, the entrepreneur was released on 5 million euro bail . But the court laid down conditions. He has been ordered to stay in France and report to police twice weekly. Durov has said in court filings that the accusations are unfounded. He said that while Telegram has an EU-based legal representative to handle law enforcement requests, his company cooperates with such requests whenever possible. In a public post, Mr. Durov said that his detention was unconstitutional. He added that Telegram was not a lawless zone and that the company was committed to improving moderation while protecting privacy and free speech. Yet the court denied him permission to travel to Oslo. Judges ruled that the threat of him absconding was “high.” Durov claims pressure to censor political content on Telegram Telegram’s founder has claimed the French government has pressured the app to censor political content. Durov threw down a gauntlet in mid-May 2025 in a surprising maneuver. He said French intelligence chief Nicolas Lerner personally instructed him to ban conservative political content ahead of Romania’s upcoming presidential election. The meeting supposedly occurred at the Hôtel de Crillon in Paris, a grand luxury palace in the city. He said Lerner had asked him to “mute” voices of Romanian opposition on Telegram. In a post on Telegram, the tech entrepreneur said that democracy cannot be defended by denying people the right to express their opinions. The allegations have been denied by France’s DGSE (Directorate-General for External Security), under Lerner’s command. Officials said their discussions with Durov only touched on threats such as terrorism and child abuse material, not political content. But the assertions set off an uproar online. Public figures, including the tech mogul Elon Musk and the whistle-blower Edward Snowden, rallied to Durov’s defense, saying the episode is part of a broader pattern of Western governments attempting to clamp down on online speech. Supporters defend free speech amid Durov case Durov’s supporters say the French charges are calculated for political reasons. They caution that holding platform founders responsible for internet users’ posts could threaten internet freedom. One digital rights advocate said that if tech executives are going to be jailed every time they refuse to remove content that governments want taken down from social media, then no one is safe. Others say platforms like Telegram need to do more to remove illegal content and safeguard vulnerable communities. Durov says Telegram strikes the correct balance. He said that they did not censor protesters in Russia, Belarus, or Iran and that they would not start doing so in Europe. Having Durov present, even virtually, is key to conversations around digital rights, according to the Human Rights Foundation. For now, he remains in France, fighting legal charges and what he claims is Europe’s shift toward political censorship.

While Bitcoin and Hedera (HBAR) remain key portfolio anchors, the most strategic capital is now flowing into MAGACOIN FINANCE—a presale project with forecasts of up to 33x returns and growing community momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Strategic Entry, 50% Bonus, and 33x Upside 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming the breakout presale of 2025, with Stage 8 live and over $8 million raised as demand accelerates. The project’s capped supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral narrative are fueling unprecedented buy activity. Participants can unlock a 50% bonus using the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code, amplifying the appeal for those targeting exponential gains. Analysts are projecting returns of 25x–35x, with some models suggesting even higher upside if current momentum continues. With each stage, MAGACOIN FINANCE is securing its place as the go-to allocation for traders seeking the next crypto supercycle . XRP: Accumulation and Bullish Setup XRP is consolidating between $2.35 and $2.60, with technical indicators signaling a potential breakout if bullish sentiment returns. Analysts forecast a move toward $2.65–$2.85 in the near term, and some models target $3.40 if volume picks up. Recent data shows large investors accumulating significant holdings, reflecting strong confidence in XRP’s long-term value. While XRP’s fundamentals remain robust, the most aggressive capital is now rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for outsized returns. Hedera (HBAR): Steady Growth and Ecosystem Strength Hedera is trading near $0.25, with technicals and forecasts indicating a possible move to $0.29–$0.30 in the coming months. The network’s partnerships and enterprise adoption underpin its long-term outlook. However, HBAR’s growth trajectory is steady compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which continues to set the standard for early-stage excitement. Bitcoin (BTC): Institutional Demand and Market Stability CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST Bitcoin is trading above $110,000, with institutional inflows and strong market structure reinforcing its dominance. Analysts see BTC potentially reaching $118,000–$131,000 in the near term, but its upside is now more measured compared to the presale-driven momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Conclusion XRP’s accumulation phase is a strong vote of confidence, but the real excitement is in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearing completion, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 33x ROI, MAGA stands as the breakout contender for 2025.

The AI token continues to prove a favorable investment, reporting a monthly gain of 36.20% following the resurrection of the crypto bull market. Interestingly, a market analyst with the X username Cryptododo7 and popularly known as Plan D has stated FET is likely headed for green days with a forming bullish pattern. Related Reading: Litecoin Monthly Close Above Key Resistance Could Ignite 30% Rally – Is A Breakout Coming? FET Bulls Gear Up For Major Price Rally In an X post on May 23, PlanD shared a technical analysis on the FET market using an hourly trading chart from TradingView. Based on the presented chart, FET’s price action in the past two years has formed a bull flag pattern, hinting that the altcoin is on the edge of a breakout. The bull flag is a typical bullish pattern that signals the potential continuation of an uptrend after a brief period of consolidation. It consists of a flagpole, which represents a strong upward price movement as seen in 2024 when FET’s price surged by 1,400% from $0.20 to $3.00. Following this price rally, there is the flag/pennant, which is a small downward or sideways price movement resembling a flag on a pole. This consolidation is seen between 2024 and 2025, when FET retraces from its market top at $3.00 to below $0.25. Thereafter, there is the price breakout, which represents the moment a token’s price crosses above the flag’s upper boundary, signaling a continuation of the upward trend. While FET currently trades at $0.84, the upper boundary of the bull flag stands at $1.71. If the market bulls are able to command a decisive price close above this price mark, FET is tipped to produce a price rally similar to the length of the initial flagpole. Based on this calculation, PlanD predicts FET to hit a price target of $9.33, representing a potential 1,050% gain on the present market prices. Related Reading: Stealth Bitcoin Bull Run Ahead: Fidelity Says Do Not Blink FET Price Prediction At the time of writing, FET is trading at $0.85, reflecting a market gain of 11.75% in the past seven days. Notably, the token’s trading volume is up by 51.46%, indicating a strong market participation that could support a further market gain.

While ETH’s consolidation signals stability, the real action is unfolding in early-stage projects—none more so than MAGACOIN FINANCE, where presale momentum and community support are rapidly intensifying. With Solana, Aptos, and Bitcoin also in focus, traders are recalibrating for the next wave of growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Accelerating Presale, 50% Bonus, and 35x+ Potential JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly establishing itself as 2025’s most dynamic presale, with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral narrative are fueling record demand from both retail and institutional investors. Key highlights: Scarcity-Driven Model: Only 100 billion tokens, with 45% allocated to presale, creating a strong supply squeeze as demand rises. 50% Bonus: Early buyers can use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% token bonus, amplifying upside ahead of the $0.007 listing target. Analysts are projecting 25x–35x returns, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% if momentum continues. With every stage, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s trendline is steepening—making it the cycle’s breakout contender before listings ignite true price discovery . Ethereum (ETH): Sideways Action and Steady Inflows Ethereum is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, with technicals hinting at a possible breakout above $2,700 if bullish sentiment returns. Institutional inflows remain robust, and analysts expect ETH to test $2,800–$2,900 in June. While ETH remains a foundational asset, its near-term upside is now more measured compared to the rapid acceleration seen in MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana (SOL): Bullish Structure and Upside Potential Solana is trading between $158 and $175, with a breakout above $175 potentially leading to a retest of $183 and even $200 if momentum persists. The network’s high throughput and expanding DeFi ecosystem continue to attract capital, but the most aggressive traders are now rotating into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper returns. Aptos (APT): Quiet Growth, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Aptos is trading around $4.09, with forecasts suggesting a range of $2.79 to $5.38 for May 2025. While APT’s fundamentals remain solid, its near-term upside is less dramatic compared to the explosive presale-driven momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin (BTC): Macro Anchor and Capital Rotation CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Bitcoin is holding above $110,000, with strong institutional support and technicals pointing to a possible move toward $115,000 if momentum holds. As BTC’s growth steadies, more investors are rotating into high-upside altcoins—where MAGACOIN FINANCE is now leading sentiment and capital flows. Conclusion Ethereum’s sideways movement is providing a stable backdrop, but the steepest trendline belongs to MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 35x–50x ROI, MAGA is the breakout name to watch as Q3 approaches.

In a message to his millions of followers on X (formerly Twitter), he cautioned that many are still poor due to neglect of fundamental financial truths. The message was simple: Learn money laws, avoid fake money, and save with real assets like Bitcoin. Kiyosaki’s post , “ARE YOU BREAKING the LAWS?, called out the people who violated two important laws of money : Gresham’s Law and Metcalf’s Law. Gresham’s Law reads, “Bad money drives good money out of circulation.” He said that when governments make new fiat currency – which Kiyosaki refers to as “fake money” – it loses worth. https://twitter.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1926364887904587821 In return, smart investors bury or shelter their fortune in things with actual, enduring value. For Kiyosaki, these assets are gold, silver, and Bitcoin. He emphasized that saving in dollars or other fiat currencies doesn’t make sense, pointing out that people essentially save in something that loses value daily. He questioned why anyone would save “fake money” and urged his followers to save what he called “good money”—decentralized assets that cannot be printed at will. Kiyosaki contrasted successful companies like FedEx and McDonald’s — powerful because they create strong networks and smaller operations like “Mom Pop Burgers” that fail because they lack the network advantage. Kiyosaki stated that Bitcoin is a network, so he invested in it. He warned that many cryptocurrencies lack strong network support and are likely poor investments. He advised people to follow the laws of money and invest in assets that gain value through the strength of their networks. Major financial players invest in Bitcoin Kiyosaki is not the only one who has faith in Bitcoin’s potential future. The biggest Wall Street players are also buying in. Among the biggest names is Michael Saylor, founder and chairman of Strategy Inc., who has emerged as one of Bitcoin’s loudest corporate advocates. This week, Saylor’s outfit acquired an additional 7,390 BTC to its tropospheric holdings. The total purchase cost $764 million, bringing the company’s total amount to 576,230 BTC, worth over $62 billion today. Saylor’s average purchase price is $69,726 per Bitcoin. In that post, Kiyosaki quotes Saylor’s advice to “only invest in things a rich person will buy from you,” highlighting their shared belief that Bitcoin has evolved beyond a fringe asset. He noted that some of the most influential figures in finance now view it as a legitimate and serious store of value. Both men believe Bitcoin is a bulwark against inflation and misguided government monetary policy. As central banks keep printing money and global debt rises, they think Bitcoin will grow more valuable. Kiyosaki says BTC has a bright future Kiyosaki has been forecasting huge Bitcoin gains for years now. He reiterated his bold price target earlier this year: $500,000 per BTC. He thinks soaring inflation, ballooning debt, and economic uncertainty will lead more people to store value in Bitcoin. And he’s not alone. Other financial pundits also project strong growth for the crypto giant. Bitcoin has recently rallied to a new all-time high of $111,970.16 before its first small pullback. As of this writing, Bitcoin is priced at $107,424, according to CoinMarketCap . Even as prices have soared, analysts say the recent surge in trading activity indicates a robust demand from institutions and everyday investors. There are even a few spot Bitcoin ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) now, enabling folks to invest in BTC without learning how wallets and keys work. Meanwhile, nations and central banks struggle to cope with inflation, banking collapses, and their devaluing money. According to Kiyosaki, these challenges further bolster the case for Bitcoin.

In this environment, MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Cardano are emerging as the new favorites, each offering unique catalysts for exponential growth. Solana and Sui round out the watchlist, but the real momentum is building around presale-driven MAGA, where analysts see up to 15,000% upside on the horizon.

The token’s fundamentals remain robust, supported by regulatory clarity and real-world adoption. Yet, while XRP’s upside is strong, its growth curve is outpaced by the presale-driven surge of MAGACOIN FINANCE, making MAGA the preferred choice for those seeking rapid appreciation. Cardano (ADA): Double Bottom and New Bullish Trend Cardano is now in the early stages of a new bullish trend, with a double bottom pattern confirmed in May and price targets ranging from $0.66 to $1.88 for the year.

While BTC’s dominance remains unchallenged, breakout momentum is now fueling bullish projections for MAGACOIN FINANCE and Solana—each offering a unique path to outsized returns. XRP, SEI, and Cardano round out the watchlist, but the spotlight is firmly on MAGA and SOL as the next leaders of the crypto market. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Surge, 50% Bonus, and 13,800% Potential CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the breakout presale of 2025, with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearing completion. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling unprecedented demand from both retail and institutional investors. Key highlights: Scarcity-driven model: 100 billion tokens, 45% allocated to presale, creating a powerful supply squeeze. 50% bonus: Early buyers using the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code secure a 50% token bonus before the $0.007 listing target. Analysts are projecting 35x–50x returns, with some models suggesting up to 13,800%–18,500% upside if momentum continues—making MAGA the top early-stage opportunity for the next cycle . Solana (SOL): Technical Strength and Institutional Confidence Solana is consolidating between $158 and $175, with technical indicators pointing to a possible breakout above $175 toward $183 and beyond. Analysts across the board are forecasting a move to $200–$500 in 2025, with some bullish scenarios targeting as high as $1,000 if ETF approval and ecosystem growth deliver. The network’s high throughput, low fees, and expanding DeFi ecosystem are attracting both users and developers, but the most dramatic growth potential is now unfolding in early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP, SEI, and Cardano: Steady Growth, MAGA Steals the Spotlight XRP: Trading between $2.10 and $2.42, with analysts forecasting a move toward $2.41–$2.85 in the near term. SEI: Expected to reach $1.03–$1.07 by year-end, with forecasts suggesting steady but less explosive growth compared to MAGA. Cardano: Cardano is trading near $0.85, with bullish scenarios targeting $1.20–$1.50 by month’s end if momentum holds. While these assets offer solid fundamentals and steady growth, none match the explosive presale-driven momentum and analyst projections now surrounding MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin (BTC): Macro Anchor and Capital Rotation Bitcoin is currently trading above $112,000, with technical support at $110,000 and a projected range of $113,000–$140,000 for May and June if bullish momentum sustains. Institutional inflows remain robust, but as BTC’s upside moderates, more investors are rotating into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper returns. EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Conclusion Bitcoin’s breakout above $112,000 is setting the stage for a summer of altcoin momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE and Solana are emerging as the leaders of this new cycle, with MAGA’s presale drawing 13,800% ROI forecasts and Solana’s technicals hinting at fresh highs. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst confidence at record levels, MAGA is the breakout contender for 2025.

Wallets remain an insurance policy, says Wood “So ETFs for those who want the convenience, I don’t think, will lose a lot of their luster,” she said. “But they will be a stepping stone into wallet-based.” Wood reiterated the extra layer of protection that crypto wallets provide: “These are insurance policies against something going wrong in the traditional world.” Bitbo data suggests that there are around 200 million active Bitcoin ( BTC ) wallets worldwide. Meanwhile, the trading week ending May 23 saw approximately $2.75 billion inflows into US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs , coinciding with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22. Cathie Wood spoke to ETF analyst Eric Balchunas at Solana Accelerate on May 23. Source: Solana Since spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in the US in January 2024, approximately $44.49 billion in inflows have been recorded, according to Farside data. Meanwhile, spot Ether ( ETH ) ETFs have seen approximately $2.77 billion in inflows since launching in July 2024. Wood said that spot Ether ETFs were “less successful than people were expecting” because the US Securities and Exchange Commission did not allow staking . On May 21, the SEC delayed its decision on Bitwise’s application to add staking to its Ether exchange-traded fund. However, Wood still views Ether as the entry point for new investors to familiarize themselves with smart contracts before exploring other cryptocurrencies, such as Solana ( SOL ). “So they might start in the smart contract world with Ether, but once they study the technology, and follow the developers, and see the uptake by consumers, I think they will get there,” Wood said. Related: ‘We are worried about a recession,’ but there’s a silver lining — Cathie Wood Wood said that the launch of US President Donald Trump’s memecoin, Official Trump (TRUMP), in January on the Solana network may have caused investors to be skeptical of Solana. “Institutions and you’re saying 60-year-olds…I think they might be a little turned off by what happened with the Trump memecoin,” Wood said. Just days after its launch on Jan. 17, TRUMP slid around 50% after the president made no crypto-related “day one” executive orders . “I mean, that might scare them,” Wood said. Her comments came in response to ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reiterating the point that Bitcoin is “so easy” to explain to a “boomer or adviser” as being digital gold, but other cryptocurrencies “are tougher.” Wood said she is still finalizing her Solana price target and will share it once her research is complete. In April, ARK raised its “bull case” Bitcoin price target from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by the end of 2030 , primarily driven by institutional investors and Bitcoin’s increasing acceptance as “digital gold.” Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-25 03:20:22

Whales are making decisive moves—accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE, Solana, and XRP—while Bitcoin’s strong foundation sets the stage for the next wave of exponential gains. With analysts now forecasting up to 47x returns for MAGA, the window for early entry is rapidly narrowing. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Inflows, 50% Bonus, and 47x Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is cementing its status as 2025’s breakout presale, with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearing completion. On-chain data confirms a game-changing 72.95 ETH whale buy—valued at $133,743—marking the largest single early-stage crypto purchase of the year. Key highlights: Scarcity-driven model: 100 billion tokens, 45% allocated to presale, creating a powerful supply squeeze. Institutional-grade confidence: Whale purchases signal calculated, long-term positioning before public listings. 50% bonus: Early buyers using the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code secure a 50% token bonus before the $0.007 listing target. Analysts are projecting 35x–47x returns for MAGA, with some models suggesting even greater upside if listing momentum accelerates. As each stage fills, MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting the pace for early-stage gains before listings ignite the next phase of price discovery. Bitcoin (BTC): Macro Momentum and Whale Accumulation Bitcoin is trading at $106,342, just shy of its all-time high of $109,114. On-chain data shows supply on exchanges at its lowest since 2018, with whales pulling BTC into long-term storage—a sign of growing confidence in higher future prices. Institutional inflows remain robust, and analysts now target $125,000–$150,000 by year-end if momentum holds. Solana (SOL): Whale Bets and Ecosystem Growth Solana is consolidating around $172, with whales recently investing millions in ecosystem meme coins and core SOL positions. Technicals point to a possible breakout toward $200, with analysts forecasting $240–$260 if bullish trends persist. Whale activity is a clear vote of confidence in Solana’s continued rise. XRP: Accumulation Phase and Bullish Outlook XRP is trading at $2.42, with whales accumulating over 94 million tokens in recent days—worth more than $230 million. Analysts forecast a move to $2.85–$3.40 in the coming weeks, with $5.50 possible by year-end if ETF approvals and adoption accelerate. The number of large XRP wallets is rising, signaling growing influence from major investors. Avalanche (AVAX): Steady Growth, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Avalanche is priced at $24.72, with analysts projecting a bullish scenario of $56.83 for 2025. While AVAX’s fundamentals are solid, its near-term upside is overshadowed by the explosive presale-driven momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Conclusion Bitcoin’s strong base at $108,000 is anchoring the market, but the most aggressive capital is flowing into MAGACOIN FINANCE , Solana, and XRP. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 47x ROI, MAGA stands as the breakout contender for Q3 2025.

While ETH’s consolidation signals stability, the real action is unfolding in early-stage projects—none more so than MAGACOIN FINANCE, where presale momentum and community buzz are rapidly intensifying. With Solana, Aptos, and Bitcoin also in focus, traders are recalibrating for the next wave of growth. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: Accelerating Presale, 50% Bonus, and 35x+ Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly establishing itself as 2025’s most dynamic presale, with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral narrative are fueling record demand from both retail and institutional investors.Key highlights: Scarcity-Driven Model: Only 100 billion tokens, with 45% allocated to presale, creating a strong supply squeeze as demand rises. Community Surge: Over 20,000 holders and growing, with social buzz and presale trackers consistently ranking MAGA as a top pick. 50% Bonus: Early buyers can use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% token bonus, amplifying upside ahead of the $0.007 listing target. Analysts are projecting 25x–35x returns, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% if momentum continues. With every stage, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s trendline is steepening—making it the cycle’s breakout contender before listings ignite true price discovery. Ethereum (ETH): Sideways Action and Steady Inflows Ethereum is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, with technicals hinting at a possible breakout above $2,700 if bullish sentiment returns. Institutional inflows remain robust, and analysts expect ETH to test $2,800–$2,900 in June. While ETH remains a foundational asset, its near-term upside is now more measured compared to the rapid acceleration seen in MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana (SOL): Bullish Structure and Upside Potential Solana is trading between $158 and $175, with a breakout above $175 potentially leading to a retest of $183 and even $200 if momentum persists. The network’s high throughput and expanding DeFi ecosystem continue to attract capital, but the most aggressive traders are now rotating into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper returns. Aptos (APT): Quiet Growth, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Aptos is trading around $4.09, with forecasts suggesting a range of $2.79 to $5.38 for May 2025. While APT’s fundamentals remain solid, its near-term upside is less dramatic compared to the explosive presale-driven momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin (BTC): Macro Anchor and Capital Rotation Bitcoin is holding above $110,000, with strong institutional support and technicals pointing to a possible move toward $115,000 if momentum hold. As BTC’s growth steadies, more investors are rotating into high-upside altcoins—where MAGACOIN FINANCE is now leading sentiment and capital flows. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion Ethereum’s sideways movement is providing a stable backdrop, but the steepest trendline belongs to MAGACOIN FINANCE.

As ADA consolidates above key support and eyes a push toward $0.85–$0.90, traders are looking for the next big rotation. While legacy tokens like Solana, Bitcoin, and TRUMP remain in the spotlight, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the high-conviction early-stage play—charting new support zones and capturing analyst attention with 35x ROI projections. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Surge, 50% Bonus, and 35x Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming 2025’s breakout presale, with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral narrative are fueling unprecedented demand.Key highlights: Scarcity-driven model: 100 billion tokens, 45% allocated to presale, creating a powerful supply squeeze.

Analysts are forecasting 25x–35x returns, with some models suggesting up to 3,500%–14,200% upside depending on entry stage and bonuses. As each stage fills, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out fresh support zones and positioning itself as the next cycle’s breakout opportunity. Cardano (ADA): Bullish Channel and Supply Shock Cardano is trading at $0.79, with strong support at $0.75 and bullish momentum building. Analysts are watching for a move toward $0.85–$0.90 in the near term, with some forecasting a breakout to $1.20 if resistance is cleared. Massive ADA withdrawals from exchanges and an ascending channel on the charts are fueling optimism for a supply shock-driven rally. Solana (SOL): Technical Strength and Institutional Confidence Solana is consolidating between $158 and $176, with a breakout above $175 potentially leading to $183 and beyond. Technical indicators remain bullish, and analysts forecast a possible move toward $200–$212 in the coming months. While Solana’s fundamentals are robust, the most dramatic growth potential is now unfolding in early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin (BTC): Macro Anchor, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Bitcoin is trading at $111,466, with forecasts suggesting a range of $110,000–$115,000 for late May. Institutional inflows remain strong, but as BTC’s upside moderates, more investors are rotating into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper returns. TRUMP Coin: Volatility and Speculative Appeal TRUMP coin is trading near $13.00, with a forecasted range of $9.50–$14.00 for May 2025. While its meme-driven appeal attracts speculative capital, its upside is overshadowed by the structured presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Conclusion Cardano’s strength above $0.75 and Solana’s bullish structure are impressive, but the most compelling early-stage momentum is in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 35x ROI, MAGA stands as the breakout contender for 2025.

Bitcoin has remained stuck at $108,000, while Ethereum remains at $2,500, and the market cap of all cryptocurrencies was at $3.39 trillion. This article looks at the top 3 cryptocurrencies to watch this week and the catalysts that will drive them. While many of them will be in the spotlight, the most notable ones are Cetus Protocol (CET), Aergo (AERGO), and Monero (XMR). Monero (XMR): Will it retest an all-time high? The first cryptocurrency to watch this week will be Monero, the biggest privacy token in the crypto industry. It will be in the spotlight because it has largely defied gravity in the past few months as it separated itself from the pack. Data shows that Monero token has jumped in the past seven consecutive weeks and it is not losing momentum. It jumped by 20% last week, after jumping by less than 5% a week earlier. Monero price has also retested the important resistance level at $400, a strong performance for a coin that bottomed at $99 last year. This surge has happened as investors embraced privacy coins following the end of Tornado Cash sanctions earlier this year. Analysts now believe that the end of these sanctions will help it receive more exchange listings since most of them delisted them a while back. Technically, Monero price has entered the markup phase of the Wyckoff Theory. This phase comes after the accumulation one that has little price action. It is characterized by high demand than supply and is then followed by the distribution. Therefore, the path of the least resistance for the XMR price is bullish, with the next point to watch being at $515, up by 27% from the current level. A drop below the support at $350 will invalidate the bullish outlook. Monero price chart | Source: TradingView Aergo (AERGO): in focus after a key vote Aergo token came in the spotlight in April as it jumped from a low of $0.050 in April to a high of $0.7158, a 1,355% surge that pushed its market cap to over $150 million. This rally happened after some popular exchanges like Coinbase, Upbit, OKX, and Bitget listed it. Aergo will be in the spotlight this week after a recent vote by the community members, who opted for the House Party Protocol. They agreed to launch it on Arbitrum instead of the Optimism Stack. The developers noted that Arbitrum was better suited because of its smarter resource management, ecosystem maturity, DeFi synergy, and network effect. Technically, Aergo price will be in focus because it has formed a falling wedge pattern, pointing to a potential rebound this week. If the pattern works well, the Aergo token may surge from $0.1590 to $0.2500. Aergo price chart | Source: TradingView Cetus Protocol (CET): What next after the hack? The other top crypto to watch will be Cetus Protocol, the biggest player in Sui’s network. Cetus will be in focus as the network was hacked last week, with hackers draining over $223 million. $162 million of these funds were stopped. Cetus noted that it was pursuing two approaches, including an on-chain vote by the Sui community to authorize the recovery of the frozen $162 million. This vote initially failed as Sui took a neutral stance. The developers also aim to reach a whitehat agreement with the hackers to recover the other funds. It is highly unlikely that the hackers will return the cash, and taking legal action against them will likely not work. Therefore, Cetus Protocol will be in the spotlight this week as investors wait for any new developments from the company.

As, Donald Trump’s announcement of a 50% tariff on the European Union , effective June 1, has reignited concerns. Despite this looming threat, ADA’s price has remained stable, indicating that the market has adjusted to such sentiments, with investors showing less volatility. Some experts even suggest that ADA’s current consolidation pattern may lay a healthier foundation for a potential breakout toward the $1 range. Additionally, this week, Messari released its Q1 report, highlighting some positive metrics despite Cardano’s financial challenges. The report indicates that the community remains resilient, focusing on long-term growth and stability. Keep reading to know more. Analyst Says Cardano Price Aims $1 Cardano’s price has been caught in a lengthy consolidation phase within a falling channel, largely influenced by ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and other countries . This trade climate pushed ADA price down to the $0.50 mark in April. However, a turning point came in mid-April when ADA began to recover, climbing to the upper boundary of the channel and reaching $0.85 in May. This rebound was fueled by a decrease in trade tensions, particularly after the UK signed a significant deal . However, recent tensions with EU resurfacing has left many investors worried, but knowing the threat ADA price has not fallen beneath key EMA’s, and until it doesn’t break key supports the bullish views remain intact. More to its price, a deep analysis of this week has been at the center of attraction. According to technical analysis from Dan Gambardello, the Cardano price action displays a markedly different pattern compared to its previous bull market cycle. He says, unlike the last cycle where ADA experienced a single dip after exiting the bear market before going parabolic, the current consolidation shows a more methodical approach with repeated pump and consolidate phases. This extended consolidation period is a “coiling” effect. He feels that Cardano price could smash $1 , if it meets all bullish conditions. Gambardello notes that this coiling behavior is not limited to Cardano price. The extended sideways movement has allowed for healthier price support levels, in other altcoin’s too. Additionally, Analyst Dan Gambardello uses Ethereum as a roadmap for altcoin performance. He noted that ETH is currently testing a multi-cycle trend line that has historical importance for the entire altcoin sector. Ethereum breakout would cause an altcoin move. It would be a more favorable time for tokens like Cardano crypto that have consolidated and formed technical bases in this extended build-up phase. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Bitcoin Ethereum and XRP Price Are Down Today? What Traders Need to Know Now , Cardano’s Report By Messari: Total Stablecoin Market Cap & ADA’s Treasury Balance Increased In a recent report, by Messari said that Cardano’s performance during Q1 2025 was tough. It revealed that its quarter was filled with challenges. As its native token, ADA price, took a hit, which led to a decline in its circulating market cap. Despite these hurdles, Cardano still made significant strides in governance, like the activation of the Plomin Hard Fork was the biggest accomplishment. Interestingly, the report further highlighted that, while the ADA price volatility affected its most of the market sentiment, but the commitment to staking still remained remarkably stable. The stats showed that the total staked ADA saw only a slight decrease of 1%, settling at 21.6 billion ADA. In contrast, some metrics performed exceptionally like the stablecoin market, messari said that it expanded by 30% to reach a market cap of $30.1 million. This increased was largely driven by the popularity of fiat-backed options like USDM, IUSD, USDA, and others. Additionally, Cardano’s treasury balance showed resilience, increasing by 5% quarter-over-quarter to 1.7 billion ADA. However, the U.S. dollar value of the treasury took a hit, dropping 19% to approximately $1.1 billion. Overall, while Cardano faced financial challenges, its governance advancements and stable staking commitment highlight the community’s ongoing dedication to the platform’s future. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Possibly. Analysts like Dan Gambardello suggest ADA is in a “coiling phase”—a bullish consolidation that may lead to a breakout. However, a confirmed move above $0.85 with strong volume is key before targeting $1. Can Cardano (ADA) break out of the current consolidation and surpass the $1 mark? If so, when? A breakout is possible if bullish conditions align, potentially leading to a $1 mark. While exact timing is uncertain, some analyses point to this happening in the coming days or weeks. What are the broader implications of the U.S.–EU trade tension on the crypto market in general? Renewed trade tensions can increase market volatility, as seen with Bitcoin’s recent dip. Crypto markets often react to such macroeconomic events, acting as risk assets. Is now a good time to accumulate ADA, or should I wait for confirmation of a breakout or breakdown? Some analysts see the current consolidation as a healthy foundation for growth, suggesting accumulation. However, it’s wise to consider personal risk tolerance and market indicators for confirmation.

Opinions vary, truth is singular",https://crypto.news/bitcoin-harmful-environment-opinions-vary/,"The level of Bitcoin mining energy consumption is on par with that of some countries. This statement is often mentioned as one of Bitcoin’s main drawbacks, as consumption takes its toll on the environment. However, Bitcoin advocates argue that things are not that simple, and in some ways, Bitcoin is an eco-friendly technology. How come, and who’s right? Proof-of-work The Bitcoin network is protected from spam attacks with a mechanism known as “proof-of-work.” The earliest installment of this algorithm was created by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor in 1993, long before Bitcoin’s emergence. The essence of this mechanism is the requirement to make calculations (do the “work”) in order to get permission to cast a transaction (originally, to send an email). Transaction validation requires performing calculations to filter out bad actors. The network rewards them with bitcoins that haven’t been in circulation to incentivize validators. That’s how bitcoins are “mined;” that’s why the validation process is called “mining.” In the early days of Bitcoin, mining wasn’t demanding. Anyone could mine it using a regular PC. However, as the demand for Bitcoin grew, the mining difficulty increased, requiring more and more energy to complete the math tasks. These days, mining operations have an industrial scale. Mining farms occupy extensive facilities of devices created for the only purpose–to crack Bitcoin puzzles at the highest speed possible (to solve the puzzle before the rest of the miners and get the reward). By 2018, the Bitcoin network’s energy consumption reached a level comparable to Nigeria and Denmark. Bitcoin’s environmental impact Bitcoin mining operations impact the environment in four main directions: Mining has a carbon print Mining consumes much water Mining consumes much electricity Mining creates electronic waste Based on all of these metrics, Bitcoin has a serious impact on the environment. These metrics indicate that Bitcoin consumes as much electricity and water and leaves as much harmful waste as in some countries. While it may be hard to comprehend what it means when you read that Bitcoin consumes as much power as Poland, you may zoom in and see the equivalents of each Bitcoin transaction’s impact. It pictures a much more vivid picture. According to Digiconomist , one Bitcoin transaction consumes over 1,100 kW/h (as much as an average U.S. household in 38 days), consumes 17,500 liters of fresh water (as much as a backyard swimming pool), creates over 280 grams of electronic waste (more than 1.5 iPhones 12), while the carbon emissions amount to 620kgCO2 (as much as 1.3 million transactions of VISA or watching 11.7 years of videos on YouTube). Statista provides similar estimations . More than that, gold mining is less harmful to the environment than BTC mining if we compare the amount of BTC and the amount of gold with the same value expressed in USD. Although no precise date is associated with these estimations, the articles seem to rely on data revealed in 2023 or earlier. Tesla cited environmental impact as the reason for stopping support for Bitcoin payments in 2021, shortly after the launch of this option. Ethereum transitioned from proof-of-work to a greener proof-of-stake algorithm in 2022. Read more: Tesla to Halt Bitcoin Payments due to ‘Environmental Concerns’ Fossil fuels power most mining facilities. Various sources evaluate the use of fossil fuels to power Bitcoin mining at a range from 50 to 90 percent. What Bitcoin advocates say… First, the Digital Assets Research Institute denies that the data and articles about Bitcoin’s environmental harm are correct. According to this study, flawed 2018 research suggesting the high environmental harm of Bitcoin was quoted thousands of times until 2024. Accurate articles amounted to only 2% of all pieces on the topic. DARI’s paper claims that 2022 was marked by a shift toward more rigorous coverage of Bitcoin’s environmental impact theme. As the environmental impact of mining is a serious problem, various mining operations began to look for ways to greener Bitcoin mining, and the search was successful. The 2020s initiatives saw companies using the excess power for Bitcoin mining instead of wasting this power and the resources spent on its production. a NYC bathhouse is mining bitcoin and using the excess waste energy to heat their pools. or, in other words, they're heating their pools as they would ordinarily do, and monetizing the excess power that exists as a byproduct of that process. this is demonstrably a carbon… pic.twitter.com/V0VeDwBicy — nic carter (@nic__carter) June 22, 2023 Another way to make Bitcoin mining greener is to rely on renewable resources. For instance, Ethiopia is using its Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam for clean Bitcoin mining. The 2024 studies show that, lately, Bitcoin mining has played a positive role in reducing CO2 emissions, becoming the straight opposite in terms of environmental impact. Although some companies already boast they are carbon-neutral Bitcoin mining operations, most enterprises only admit to reducing energy consumption. As no institution that studies Bitcoin’s environmental impact has all the info about mining operations, we don’t have all the data regarding CO2 emissions associated with mining. We can’t say how much the pollution level dropped in the last couple of years. Pierre Rochard of Riot Platforms appeared in a video in which he meters the CO2 level in the mining facility using a special device. It drew some criticism as some users pointed out that the emissions are not coming from the mining devices but are associated with excessive electricity production. Dude, the CO2 concern is supposed to be related to energy generation to power the CPUs, not the CO2 emission of the CPU themselves. — Snake Sanders (@snake_sanders1) April 10, 2023 Another line of defense used by some Bitcoin advocates is comparing Bitcoin’s environmental impact to that of the banking system, indicating that bank transactions are not more eco-friendly than Bitcoin. This argument may have made sense if Bitcoin were to replace the banking system, but this is not happening. Who’s right? Although the Bitcoin mining industry is far from eco-friendly, various participants seek ways to make it greener or even reduce CO2 emissions through Bitcoin mining so that mining would have a negative carbon footprint. According to a recent report by MiCA Crypto Alliance, 70% of the Bitcoin network will be powered by sustainable energy by 2030. To conclude this, we may state that certain mining operations are green while others are not. However, an eco-friendly trend is on the rise.

Let’s break down what’s happening on the charts right now and what could be in store for XRP in the short and medium term. Short-Term XRP Price Action XRP recently experienced a mild pullback, following the broader crypto market’s cooling trend. The price dropped below a key retracement level but managed to find solid support around $2.30 — a level analysts had been closely watching. This price area between $2.30 and $2.34 served as a safety net, with XRP bouncing off its lower boundary. However, if the price begins closing daily candles below $2.30, and fails to quickly reclaim it, the chances of further decline increase. In that case, the next important support lies around $2.10 to $2.15. Is the Bullish Trend Still Intact? Despite recent pullbacks, the broader trend for XRP remains bullish for now. The price continues to form higher highs and higher lows, a classic sign of an uptrend. What the market is seeing right now is more of a temporary pause in that bullish momentum. As for resistance, immediate pressure sits at $2.44, while a more important resistance zone stretches from $2.55 to $2.62. Overcoming these levels would be a crucial step for bulls to regain control. A Possible Inverse Head and Shoulders Forming? Interestingly, if XRP continues to pull back towards $2.10–$2.15 and bounces from there, it could lay the groundwork for a massive inverse head and shoulders pattern on the daily chart. This classic bullish formation often signals a major trend reversal if confirmed. At the moment, this pattern isn’t confirmed — it’s only a possible setup to monitor. But if it does take shape and XRP manages to break above the golden pocket retracement zone afterward, it could open doors to a powerful rally. In fact, if the pattern plays out fully, analysts predict XRP could aim for targets beyond $3, potentially setting new all-time highs. Source: TradingView One scenario that some analysts are considering involves a five-wave decline structure already unfolding from the recent high. If this plays out, XRP could be working on a Wave 2 retracement now, before potentially heading lower again to test major support levels. Micro-resistance levels to watch in this scenario include the $2.35 to $2.44 range. A rejection here could keep downward pressure intact in the coming sessions.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-25 04:57:35

While XRP’s technical momentum and regulatory clarity keep it in the headlines, the real rotation is unfolding into early-stage tokens—especially MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is now leading analyst forecasts with up to 39x upside potential. With Ethereum and Injective also on the radar, Q3 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal period for strategic portfolio shifts and breakout gains. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Surge, 50% Bonus, and 39x Potential CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing the spotlight as the breakout presale of 2025 , with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full. Its capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling unprecedented demand from both retail and institutional investors. Key drivers: Scarcity-driven model: 100 billion tokens, 45% allocated to presale, creating a powerful supply squeeze. 50% bonus: Early buyers using the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code secure a 50% token bonus before the $0.007 listing target. Analysts are projecting 25x–39x returns, with some models suggesting even higher upside if momentum continues. As each stage fills, MAGACOIN FINANCE is solidifying its reputation as the top early-stage opportunity for the next cycle. XRP: Bullish Breakout and Institutional Catalysts XRP is trading near $2.45, supported by regulatory wins, ETF speculation, and robust whale accumulation. Technical indicators show a breakout setup, with analysts forecasting a move toward $2.85–$3.40 in the near term and $5.50–$7.00 by year-end if momentum persists. While XRP’s growth is steady, the most aggressive capital is rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper upside. Bitcoin (BTC): Macro Strength and Capital Rotation Bitcoin is holding above $111,000, with institutional inflows and ETF demand fueling its recent all-time highs. Analysts see BTC potentially reaching $118,000–$131,000 in the coming weeks, but its ROI from current levels is more measured—prompting many investors to seek higher multiples in altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Injective (INJ): Steady Growth, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Injective is trading near $13.17, with price forecasts suggesting a move toward $16.02 by year-end. While INJ’s fundamentals are solid, its near-term upside is less dramatic than the explosive presale-driven surge of MAGACOIN FINANCE. EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Ethereum (ETH): Stability and Ongoing Adoption Ethereum remains a cornerstone, consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900. Analysts expect ETH to target $2,800–$2,900 in the near term, but the most dramatic growth potential is now unfolding in early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Conclusion Bitcoin’s strength and XRP’s momentum are impressive, but the most compelling action is unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 39x ROI, MAGA stands as the breakout contender for Q3 2025.

The listing came with up to 20x leverage and over 40 collateral options, marking a major step forward for the project. But despite this big news, Pi’s price has struggled to find stability. Earlier this month, PI briefly rallied to $1.60, but has since fallen and is currently trading near $0.76. $PI @PiCoreTeam perpetual futures now live with up to 20x leverage Why choose Kraken Pro futures: 40+ collateral options 360+ markets Open PI perp https://t.co/NHHpKobugb *geo restrictions apply pic.twitter.com/aiJrJRbxW4 — Kraken Pro (@krakenpro) May 23, 2025 A lot of this has to do with the token’s complex situation around regulations and the way it was launched. Like many crypto projects, Pi Network has taken steps to avoid direct regulatory scrutiny by handling its coin issuance in a careful, sometimes confusing way. Pi Network Price Prediction PI Network has broken out of a falling wedge pattern after dropping 50%, showing signs of recovery. The next key level to watch is $0.84 — if it breaks above this, it could confirm the breakout and open the path to targets at $0.96, $1.20, and 1.57. Some predict Pi could rally to $5 in the future, which sounds unbelievable at first since it would give it a market cap of over $30 billion. But because there’s so little liquidity, it’s technically possible for its price to spike much higher than expected in the short term, especially if the team is actively managing supply and demand. Much of Pi’s future price action will depend on its upcoming roadmap milestones. The Pi Network website lists dozens of them, including plans to let users migrate more of their Pi coins to the mainnet and convert Fireside tokens into Pi coins. These moves could either release more coins into the market or tighten supply even further, both of which would affect the price.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-25 05:27:32

ETH is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, while Solana trades in a tight range near $170, both supported by bullish technicals and growing institutional adoption. Yet, the real buzz is building around MAGACOIN FINANCE—a presale altcoin whose community growth and upside projections are dominating analyst conversations. Avalanche (AVAX) also remains on the radar, but MAGA is rapidly emerging as the must-watch contender for outsized returns.

Community surge: Over 20,000 holders, with presale trackers and analyst dashboards ranking MAGA as the #1 presale of the year. 50% bonus: Early buyers using the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code secure a 50% token bonus before the $0.007 listing target. Analysts are projecting 35x–50x returns as a conservative estimate, with some models suggesting up to 11,000%–18,500% upside if momentum continues. As each stage fills, MAGACOIN FINANCE is solidifying its reputation as the breakout early-stage opportunity of 2025. Ethereum (ETH): Steady Gains and Bullish Structure Ethereum is trading between $2,400 and $2,900, with technical indicators pointing to a possible breakout toward $2,800–$2,900 if bullish sentiment holds. The network’s resilience, Layer 2 growth, and institutional adoption continue to support ETH’s long-term outlook, but its near-term upside is now more measured compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana (SOL): Bullish Momentum and Institutional Confidence Solana is consolidating around $170, with analysts watching for a breakout above $175 to retest $183 and potentially reach $240–$260 later this year. While Solana’s fundamentals are robust and its ecosystem continues to expand, traders seeking sharper returns are increasingly rotating into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Avalanche (AVAX): Quiet Strength, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Avalanche is forecasted to move between $17.7 and $91.1 in 2025, with a bullish reversal expected as key support levels hold. While AVAX’s fundamentals are strong, its near-term upside is less dramatic than the presale-driven surge of MAGACOIN FINANCE. EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Conclusion While Ethereum and Solana maintain steady momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is registering the heaviest community surge and most dramatic growth potential. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 11,000% ROI, MAGA stands out as the breakout altcoin to watch for 2025.

With over 13% gains in May 2025 alone and institutional ETF inflows piling in, the king of crypto is pulling markets into a bull run. That means altcoin season is back on. As BTC blazes a trail, traders are eyeing new breakout stars, and it’s not just XRP this time. SUI brings speed and DeFi strength, while Remittix (RTX), the $0.07 PayFi disruptor, is delivering instant crypto-to-fiat payments, minus the legal baggage. If you missed the last bull run, find out why this could be your second shot. Bitcoin price hits $111K, enters uncharted territory The Bitcoin price smashed through $111,000 on May 22, 2025, its highest ever, after months of consolidation. Institutional demand , led by firms like Strategy and advocates like Michael Saylor, has transformed this rally from retail hype into institutional validation. Source: CoinMarketCap With a market cap now at $2.21 trillion, Bitcoin’s dominance is reinforced by regulatory clarity , bank adoption (JPMorgan included), and looming legislation like the GENIUS Act. As macroeconomic tensions ease and lawmakers embrace crypto frameworks, Bitcoin’s breakout signals more than momentum, it reflects a maturing asset class finally embraced by the financial establishment. XRP gets Wall Street boost with new ETFs XRP just became more accessible thanks to two new ETFs, XRPI and XRPT , now trading on Nasdaq. These funds let everyday investors tap into XRP without needing a crypto wallet, private keys, or a crypto exchange. XRPI mirrors XRP’s price 1:1, ideal for simple investing. XRPT offers 2x daily exposure, aimed at more aggressive traders. Both ETFs are backed by XRP futures, making it easier to trade through regular brokerage accounts. This move follows rising demand for regulated crypto products and brings XRP closer to the mainstream. While convenient, investors should still be cautious as XRP’s price can swing fast. SUI’s secret sauce: powering real-world assets and web3 with blazing speed SUI is emerging as a powerful XRP substitute, offering real-time, secure blockchain data integration through partnerships with OMG Assembly and Microsoft Fabric . Its support for Soulbound Tokens enables tokenization of real-world assets like commodities and private credit, an evolution of XRP’s original use case. Source: CoinMarketCap With a stablecoin supply exceeding $1 billion and seamless Web3 development via Move and zkLogin , SUI powers scalable DeFi apps on a Layer 1 chain. As seen on the chart above, in May 2025, its price surged nearly 30%, peaking near $4.2 and stabilizing around $3.8, signaling strong institutional interest and long-term viability in global finance and payments. Remittix: the crypto-to-fiat game changer giving xrp a run for its money Remittix stands out as a next-gen substitute for XRP, built to deliver what XRP promised: instant, borderless payments, while fixing key flaws. Its core offering allows users to convert 50+ cryptocurrencies into 30+ fiat currencies instantly and send them to any bank account worldwide. The recipient doesn’t even need to know it originated from crypto, making it seamless for real-world adoption. What makes Remittix even more compelling is its flat-fee model, with no hidden FX or wire transfer charges. It runs on the Ethereum blockchain (ERC20), is fully audited with zero issues, and operates with a peer-to-peer architecture that removes middlemen and central control. Transactions are recorded immutably, ensuring total transparency. Security and autonomy are central to its design. High-grade encryption, combined with user-controlled funds, means no custodial risk. Remittix doesn’t just match XRP, it upgrades the model. Altcoin season is official. Are you ready? Altcoin season isn’t coming, it’s here. With Bitcoin blazing into uncharted territory above $111K, the ripple effects are lighting up the rest of the market. XRP may be back in the spotlight, but fresh contenders like SUI and Remittix are stealing the show. If you’re looking for the next big breakout, the timing might be perfect.

Rennick says Bitcoin will go to $1 million but is a “Ponzi Scheme” “Bitcoin will ultimately go to $1 million dollars. Why because it’s a Ponzi scheme whereby BlackRock will pump more and more dollars into a supply constrained product,” Rennick said. “What exactly will this product produce?” Rennick said. He added that Bitcoin ( BTC ) will produce “absolutely nothing” and Australia “needs real engineers not financial engineers.” Source: Gerard Rennick Bitcoiners across the world were quick to respond to Rennick’s comments. The Australian Bitcoin Industry Body (ABIB) said Rennick’s remarks about “Bitcoin reveal a deep misunderstanding.” The ABIB added: “This matters, because misunderstanding leads to misrepresentation. And misrepresentation leads to bad policy.” Unchained podcast host Laura Shin said , “You also can’t eat the internet, so do you oppose that too?” Bitcoin Marathon team lead Jimmy Kostro said , “This is definitely going to age well. Please enlighten us with more of your deep and nuanced understanding of Bitcoin.” Source: Coinvision Rennick responded to the criticism and said he doesn’t “need to explain anything.” “It’s pathetic how the Bitcoin community needs reassurance from a politician - the very people they claim they want to be free from,” Rennick said. The Bitcoin community has frequently spoken out when prominent individuals have expressed anti-Bitcoin views.

Prominent crypto analyst VirtualBacon, just shared that he might finally buy XRP , but only if a few key signs play out. So, what’s making him consider XRP now, after all these years? Watching the XRP/BTC Ratio VirtualBacon isn’t basing his decision on XRP’s dollar price. Instead, he’s watching how it performs against Bitcoin (XRP/BTC). Further he points out that the XRP/BTC chart has been showing weakness since 2017, forming a long downtrend. But recently, something interesting has developed, the chart is showing signs of a rounded top with strong support at 0.000022 BTC. I’ll buy $XRP when this happens I’ve never held $XRP . But that might be about to change. One key signal is setting up and if it triggers in the next 3–6 months, I’ll finally add $XRP to my portfolio. Here’s what I’m watching — VirtualBacon (@VirtualBacon0x) May 24, 2025 If this level breaks and XRP drops another 20–23%, he believes it will enter the “value zone,” between 0.000017 and 0.000019 BTC. That’s where he plans to buy, around the $1.80 price level. VirtualBacon’s Trade Plan According to VirtualBacon, this is the cleanest XRP setup he’s seen in two years. His plan looks like this: Wait for XRP/BTC to drop 20–22% Enter around the $1.80 price zone Watch for a breakout in the BTC ratio Likely timeframe: next 3 to 6 months He’s not rushing in. Instead, he’s preparing in advance, ready to act when the signal is clear. Why XRP Could Revive Other Coin This trade isn’t only about making gains. VirtualBacon believes a breakout for XRP could revive other older coins that have been forgotten in recent years like Cardano, Stellar, HBAR, Algorand, and XDC. Unlike Ethereum and Solana, which have gained strong reputations with institutions and retail respectively, XRP has always stood out for one reason, mass recognition.

The trade, one of the largest ever on the platform by a single trader, had a liquidation price of $105,179. Trader Cuts Losses After Bitcoin Dips on Hyperliquid Wynn began his Bitcoin long position with $830 million on May 21, trimming $400 million in profits the same day. By May 22, the trader increased the position back up to $1.1 billion as BTC crossed $110,000 and gained nearly $40 million in unrealized profits. He later sold 540 BTC for $60 million, securing a $1.5 million profit. Source: Hyperdash.info The crypto trader confirmed on X that he “cut his losses” on closing his highly leveraged long positions. Before going all in on Bitcoin, James Wynn had closed a long position on PEPE for a profit of $25.19 million. Bitcoin was cruising to new all-time highs this week before it dipped on Trump’s 50% tariff announcement on all EU imports. The leading cryptocurrency saw a local bottom at $107,431 on late Saturday. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $108,238. Hyperliquid Sees One of Biggest Trades by a Single Trader The decentralized crypto exchange Hyperliquid saw one of the biggest trades by a single trader when James Wynn opened a long position that reached $1.25 billion. This long bet signifies a shift among traders as trust in DEXs increases. The native token of the exchange HYPE saw its demand rise as the price increased to $34.64, up 4.2% in the last 24 hours.

He also says XRP will take only a few months to reach $10 to $20. According to the pseudonymous pundit, the current XRP price, hovering around $2.35, is significantly undervalued when considering its long-term potential. He believes that, in the coming years, XRP could reach as high as $1,000 per coin. In a recent post on X, BarriC declared that the token remains a “steal” at anything below $3, pointing to what he views as an eventual major price shift. $XRP will become very expensive to buy in the next few months and the next few years Right now, you can accumulate $XRP below $3 And somehow that’s considered a failure When $XRP skyrockets over the next few months and hits $10-$20 per #XRP That’s the new all time high… — BarriC (@B_arri_C) May 17, 2025 While XRP has recorded a year-over-year increase of 356%, outperforming assets like Ethereum, Solana, and BNB, BarriC acknowledged the growing sentiment that the asset’s progress since early 2025 has been underwhelming. However, he remains optimistic that XRP is nearing a turning point. “XRP Below $3 Is a Failure”? Not for Long, Says BarriC BarriC maintains that current doubts about XRP’s performance are misplaced. He highlighted that despite its multi-hundred percent annual gains, many market participants remain skeptical due to the token’s sideways movement over recent months. BarriC expects this sentiment to shift sharply if XRP reaches new highs during the next altcoin rally. He forecasts a short-term move to $10 and then $20 per coin, marking what he believes will be XRP’s new all-time high range. He also warned of a possible retracement after hitting those levels: “we will see an approximate 50% market dip into the bear market,” he noted. Should that happen, he believes prices in the $5 to $10 range would still represent strong value and remain higher than where XRP currently trades. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 These projections form part of his broader thesis that XRP is undergoing a major transformation in how it is perceived and utilized. BarriC Foresees Utility-Driven Path to $1,000 Valuation Looking further ahead, BarriC outlined a bold vision where XRP becomes a key player in global financial infrastructure. He envisions banks and major financial entities adopting the token for routine transactions and cross-border payments. Barric argues that if XRP is adopted widely for global settlements, demand will increase substantially and drive the price toward $1,000 per coin . In his view, such a valuation would be accompanied by reduced price swings, positioning XRP as a utility-based asset rather than a speculative one. He believes this transformation could occur within the next decade. His long-term outlook relies on the assumption that Ripple’s partnerships with central banks , financial service providers, and liquidity firms will continue to grow and deepen. These relationships, he argues, could form the foundation of a more utility-centered value model for XRP. Lofty Price Targets Face Skepticism Despite BarriC and others’ strong convictions, many market analysts remain skeptical. Critics point out that reaching a $1,000 price target would require a price increase of over 42,000% from current levels. More importantly, XRP would need to command a total market capitalization of approximately $58.5 trillion—a figure that exceeds the GDP of most major economies. Nevertheless, support for long-term projections like BarriC’s continues to gain traction within segments of the XRP community. Advocates believe that the asset’s utility and ongoing development will eventually validate these ambitious goals, even if it takes another 10 years or more.

45070439,https://timestabloid.com/?p=68405,1748154511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Is Now Exposed to the Wall Street Financial World. Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-is-now-exposed-to-the-wall-street-financial-world-heres-the-latest/,"A significant development in the digital asset investment landscape has been announced by crypto enthusiast Kenny Nguyen, who shared on social media that Robinhood has launched access to a leveraged XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). The investment product, known as the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF, is now available on the Robinhood trading platform. Nguyen calls this an initial step toward broader institutional adoption and integration of XRP into mainstream financial markets. According to the screenshot shared, the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF, ticker symbol XXRP, is currently trading at $37.86. It has recorded a daily gain of $0.59, equivalent to a 1.63% increase, with an overnight surge of $1.03 or 2.80%. This is the 1st step to major adoption with accredited investors & financial institutions. XRP is now exposed to the wall street financial world. They are ready to load their bag when Spot XRP ETFs kick in full gear. The 2nd step is ETFs approval, so get ready for 6/17/25. https://t.co/jIsWphJ5sc — Kenny Nguyen (@mrnguyen007) May 23, 2025 The ETF is designed to offer 2x leveraged exposure to the daily price movement of XRP, allowing investors to potentially amplify their gains or losses based on the performance of the underlying asset. The fund’s current daily trading volume is 418,931, suggesting significant retail and possibly institutional interest. Robinhood Lists Leveraged XRP ETF Launching Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF on Robinhood represents a substantial growth in the availability of crypto-related financial products to a broader investor base. Teucrium is a regulated issuer primarily known for its commodity ETFs. Its entrance into the XRP market via a leveraged fund signals expanding legitimacy for XRP within the U.S. financial system. The listing on Robinhood, a platform popular with retail and institutional users, enables increased access to XRP-focused trading strategies through a regulated environment. Kenny Nguyen’s Statement on Institutional Readiness In his tweet, Kenny Nguyen highlighted the larger implications of this listing, stating, “This is the 1st step to major adoption with accredited investors & financial institutions.” According to Nguyen, this move exposes XRP to the Wall Street financial ecosystem. He indicated that this milestone may prompt institutional participants to begin building positions ahead of the launch of spot XRP ETFs. Anticipation Builds for June 17, 2025 Nguyen concluded his post with a hint toward a future development he described as the next major phase for XRP, writing, “The 2nd step is ETFs approval, so get ready for 6/17/25.” While no official confirmation has been issued regarding a scheduled decision date for a spot XRP ETF approval, the statement suggests expectations within the community that regulatory progress may occur on or around that time. Growing Legitimacy in Regulated Markets Robinhood’s decision to list a 2x leveraged XRP ETF expands XRP’s accessibility and positions it more prominently within the regulated investment space. While leveraged ETFs carry inherent risks and are generally intended for short-term trading by experienced investors, their presence on major retail platforms can also serve as a precursor to more conservative products. If regulatory agencies approve a spot XRP ETF, it would further confirm XRP’s evolution from a digital asset associated with retail speculation to a structured financial instrument recognized by institutional markets. Nguyen’s tweet underscores the growing alignment between the digital asset ecosystem and traditional finance. With this first step now active on Robinhood, the crypto market’s eyes will likely turn to the next milestone Nguyen referenced—potential ETF approval by mid-2025.

As a result, the appetite among participants, developers, and enterprises for high-utility crypto projects is rising. Whether it’s reducing settlement friction, increasing data transparency, or powering permissionless financial applications, only a handful of projects are truly shaping the next era of Web3.One of the most talked-about opportunities right now is Qubetics (TICS) —a protocol that is combining real-world utility with powerful token economics to stand out in a crowded market. With features tailored for enterprise-grade adoption and one of the most robust presales in progress, Qubetics is making a clear case as one of the top cryptos to buy this month . Alongside it, well-established projects like SUI and Optimism continue to deliver high-performance capabilities that attract developers and Web3-native communities alike. This article offers an expert-level breakdown of all three. Qubetics (TICS): Seamless Cross-Border Transactions with 100x Infrastructure Upside Qubetics is fast becoming the go-to infrastructure for instant, secure, and cost-efficient cross-border transactions, bringing a layer of practical utility that many Layer-1s lack. At the core of its architecture is a smart, high-speed engine that bypasses the inefficiencies of SWIFT networks, centralized intermediaries, and slow international remittance systems. A mid-sized tech consultancy in Berlin needing to pay its freelance teams in Vietnam and Argentina. Using Qubetics, the company can execute multi-currency payments in seconds, with full on-chain verification, minimal fees, and no dependence on local banks or fiat exchanges. A decentralized gaming studio in South Korea can issue automated revenue shares to content creators in Europe via smart contracts—without ever dealing with wire transfers or intermediaries. Even NGOs can use the Qubetics protocol to transparently distribute international funding to field offices across multiple regions. These real-world cases demonstrate how Qubetics solves the operational bottlenecks faced by both global businesses and independent professionals. In an increasingly borderless economy, this type of value flow technology is not optional—it is essential. Combined with Qubetics’ broader features like wallet integrations, chain interoperability, and compliance options, its use case appeal continues to expand. Its growing presale traction has further cemented its reputation among the top cryptos to buy this month , attracting attention from early adopters across multiple regions. Qubetics Presale Details and Analyst Projections Qubetics is currently in Stage 35 of its ongoing crypto presale . Over 513 million $TICS tokens have already been sold to more than 26,900 holders, helping the protocol raise $17.3 million. The token is currently priced at $0.2785, presenting a unique window for early buyers to secure access before full network launch. Analysts closely tracking Qubetics expect the token to outperform based on its expanding utility. If $TICS reaches $1, participants could see 258% ROI. Projections for $5, $6, $10, and $15 indicate potential returns of 1,694%, 2,053%, 3,489%, and 5,284%, respectively. These scenarios are grounded in market demand for interoperable cross-border infrastructure and the protocol’s maturing technical roadmap. With growing real-world integration potential and a rapidly scaling community, Qubetics is a leading contender for those targeting high-impact blockchain projects this month. SUI: High-Performance Infrastructure for Scalable Web3 Applications SUI is a purpose-built Layer-1 blockchain developed by Mysten Labs, designed to optimize for throughput, scalability, and low-latency user interactions. Its unique architecture is built on the Move programming language and leverages parallel execution to offer sub-second finality—making it especially attractive for dApps requiring high responsiveness such as Web3 games, digital identity systems, and microtransaction platforms. A defining feature of SUI is its object-based data model, which treats on-chain data as programmable assets. This gives developers the ability to design more dynamic and responsive smart contracts with lower overhead. For instance, a decentralized social platform built on SUI can customize content interaction rules in ways that aren’t possible with account-based systems like Ethereum. SUI’s native token plays a pivotal role in governance, transaction fees, and validator incentives. It also fuels on-chain storage, giving developers efficient tools for long-term dApp maintenance. The platform supports both community and enterprise deployment, with partnerships spanning gaming studios, DeFi protocols, and digital collectibles ecosystems. Developer activity on SUI is accelerating, with its testnets and mainnet drawing significant engagement due to the ease of integration, cost-efficiency, and performance optimization. With a clear roadmap, developer-friendly infrastructure, and a strong focus on real-time user experience, SUI continues to serve the needs of both professional dApp builders and newcomers seeking rapid onboarding. As one of the most technically advanced Layer-1 chains currently in deployment, SUI holds strong weight among the top crypto platforms to track or accumulate this month. Optimism: Ethereum Layer-2 Built for Cost Efficiency and Ecosystem Growth Optimism is a rollup-based Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, offering reduced gas fees and increased transaction throughput while maintaining full Ethereum security. By using optimistic rollups, it offloads computation and data storage from Ethereum’s main chain, drastically reducing congestion without compromising decentralization. Optimism is particularly appealing to developers building consumer-facing dApps, DeFi platforms, and NFT marketplaces. It allows for Ethereum compatibility with significantly lower costs, enabling teams to retain EVM tools and smart contracts without rebuilding architecture from scratch. The network’s retroactive public goods funding model sets it apart. Community contributors are rewarded based on their impact after they’ve delivered value—fostering a unique incentive layer that motivates open-source development and decentralized innovation. As a result, Optimism’s ecosystem has expanded rapidly, including integrations with Chainlink, Uniswap, Synthetix, and hundreds of other projects. Optimism also introduced the OP Stack, a modular framework for creating customizable Layer-2 and Layer-3 chains. This has opened new opportunities for enterprise-grade solutions and regional rollups that need specific compliance, fee structures, or throughput requirements. From a broader perspective, Optimism is helping Ethereum scale without sacrificing user or developer experience. Its success represents a future where applications remain decentralized but operate with the speed, affordability, and interface quality expected in mainstream products. For those focused on Ethereum-native scalability solutions, Optimism is an essential part of this month’s buy list. Final Thoughts With the crypto landscape constantly expanding, clarity around the value of infrastructure projects is more important than ever. Real utility, ecosystem expansion, and protocol resilience are the new benchmarks for identifying promising assets—and this month, three platforms clearly rise to the top. Qubetics leads with its powerful cross-border transaction system, combining on-chain finality, security, and global utility under one banner. Its presale success and token projections highlight growing conviction across the blockchain community. The platform’s practical relevance, especially for enterprises and professionals needing interoperable financial rails, gives it unmatched upside potential heading into the next market phase. SUI delivers elite performance and execution speed with its object-centric design, opening doors for gaming, social, and DeFi use cases. It is an ideal choice for those who value high throughput and programmable smart asset logic. Optimism, meanwhile, remains the most accessible and scalable Ethereum Layer-2, offering developers the familiarity of EVM with the benefit of low-cost, high-throughput architecture. Its incentives and open infrastructure model position it as a leader in decentralized development and Ethereum’s broader roadmap. For participants aiming to act on the top cryptos to buy this month, Qubetics, SUI, and Optimism offer not just speculative potential, but lasting impact through innovation.

Mega Whale Wynn Bet $1.25B on It,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-to-121k-next-week-mega-whale-wynn-bets-1-25b-on-it/,"After recently hitting a new all-time high, Bitcoin (BTC) has retraced to the $108,000 level. Still, one whale is betting billions that the number one cryptocurrency will defy the chaos caused by U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest tariff bombshell and rocket to $121,000 within days. The $1.25B Gamble High-stakes trader James Wynn, known for his jaw-dropping leverages, has doubled down on a $1.25 billion BTC long position with 40x leverage, despite a rollercoaster week that saw his unrealized losses briefly hit $321 million. “THE SWINGS ARE INSANE,” Wynn tweeted Thursday after clawing back to a slim profit. “WHALES WANT ME GONE!!!” According to market tracker Lookonchain, his liquidation price is $105,180, which, at Bitcoin’s current value, is just a 3.5% dip away from total wipeout. However, the razor-thin margins seem not to have affected the trader’s bullishness, proclaiming a target for BTC in the coming week. “$118k – $121k next week,” he posted on X Saturday morning, doubling down even as volatility surged. Not long after, he returned to the social platform, sharing a screenshot showing $4.2 million in unrealized profit on one of his trades, which had earlier been $59 million underwater. “Built different,” the self-described meme coin maxi flexed. Can the Market Keep Up? But not everyone is buying the hype. Analyst Daan Crypto Trades called Wynn’s trade “insanity,” arguing that closing even a fraction of his position could shift Bitcoin’s price. “Every 1% BTC candle equals a $10M PNL swing,” he warned. Another pseudonymous market watcher, Innerdevcrypto, speculated that Wynn’s public bravado might be a play for clout. “That liquidation price is too close,” he pointed out. “I wonder if there is not some ulterior motive to him doing this.” To add fuel to the fire, President Trump’s latest tariff threats, including a 50% import tax on EU goods and a 25% Apple-specific levy, have shaken global markets. Bitcoin slipped over 3% on Friday, briefly dipping to around $107,600, with crypto intelligence platform Santiment warning the development had caused traders to change strategies to “holding and ‘hoping for the best.’” Meanwhile, Lookonchain revealed that Wynn had dumped his ETH and SUI longs, burning $5.3 million in losses, to go all-in on BTC. That kind of conviction, or recklessness, depending on your point of view, has set the stage for what is sure to be an interesting new week.

Then came the cooldown. Prices dropped, attention faded, and critics resurfaced. But Cardano kept building, in silence, with purpose. Now, a new wave of optimism is emerging, and this time, it’s powered by AI. Crypto enthusiasts are turning to ChatGPT to simulate possible futures based on market cycles, adoption rates, and historical benchmarks. One scenario is turning heads: Cardano hitting $7 by 2026, potentially breaking into the top five cryptocurrencies by market cap. It’s a bold projection, but not without basis. With major upgrades like Hydra and Mithril rolling out, and long-term ambitions across developing nations, Cardano’s fundamentals are aligning with the kind of growth story AI models love to explore. So, how realistic is this $7 price tag? And what would it take for ADA to go from quiet contender to crypto heavyweight? Let’s break it down, one data point at a time. Cardano’s quiet climb: can ADA hit $7 and crack the crypto top 5? Back in 2021, Cardano reached its all-time high of about $3.10, cementing its place as one of the major players in crypto’s last bull market. Fast forward a few years, and many investors are asking: if the next cycle mirrors the last, could ADA double or even triple that high? A $6 to $9 price tag doesn’t seem so far-fetched, especially in a market where momentum is everything. ADA monthly price movement. Source: CoinMarketCap Price alone doesn’t tell the whole story, though. Market cap is where the real battle for top-five status happens. With around 35 billion ADA in circulation, a $7 price would give Cardano a market cap near $245 billion. That’s serious territory, enough to rival the likes of Binance Coin or even make Ethereum glance over its shoulder, depending on how the broader market evolves. But hype won’t carry it there. Cardano has been quietly rolling out major upgrades, Hydra for scaling, Mithril for fast syncing, and smart contract improvements that open doors to DeFi and real-world use. Founder Charles Hoskinson has long championed adoption in Africa and government partnerships, and if even a fraction of those plans stick, Cardano could capture an entirely new wave of users and developers. Source: ChatGpt The idea of ADA hitting $7 by 2026 isn’t some wild guess. It’s a speculative model many are playing with, including through tools like ChatGPT. Feed in historical data, layer on market growth assumptions, and account for rising adoption, and suddenly, that future doesn’t feel so distant. Still, it’s important to separate simulation from certainty. AI can model outcomes, but the market has the final say. Cardano’s path to $7 depends on more than code, it hinges on community, trust, and real-world impact.

Garlinghouse emphasizes the ETF’s pivotal role in bridging traditional finance with the burgeoning crypto industry. Ripple’s CEO argued that ETFs institutionalized the crypto industry Speaking on Ripple’s “Crypto in One Minute” podcast episode, Garlinghouse explained two key reasons behind the increasing momentum for crypto ETFs. First, he claimed ETFs offered a direct trading option for institutional investors. Before these exchange-traded funds, investors could only trade through exchanges or self-custody, and ETFs changed that. He commented, “This was really the first time you had institutions be able to go on Wall Street and trade directly in crypto.” He added that ETFs allow capital previously excluded to enter the market through a familiar and regulated structure, enabling institutional investors to avoid the complexities and risks of self-custody and centralized exchanges. Second, he argued that ETFs are institutionalizing the crypto industry, changing perception among traditional investors. He even cited Bitcoin ETFs as evidence, hinting that investors view these crypto products as legitimate asset classes similar to gold ETFs. So far, multiple institutions have submitted filings to the US Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC), seeking approval for their XRP, Litecoin, Solana, and Dogecoin spot ETFs. Many crypto analysts believe the SEC will most likely approve spot XRP ETFs next. According to Polymarket, traders are placing the probability of a Ripple spot XRP ERF being approved in 2025 at 83%. CME’s head of crypto products, Giovanni Vicioso, agreed that interest in XRP has risen, adding that market participants are seeking regulated derivatives tied to a broader array of digital assets. Garlinghouse’s comments are making the rounds on social media, with many lauding his ability to articulate how game-changing the crypto ETFs’ on-boarding of institutions could be. These developments come as the crypto ETF market matures in a defining moment for embedding digital assets into traditional financial systems. Volatility Shares introduced Ripple-backed XRP Futures ETF Recently, Volatility Shares launched its XRP Futures ETF. According to their SEC filing on May 21, the ETF will indirectly invest in the future of the Ripple-linked token via its Cayman Islands subsidiary. The new product, $XRPI, will also invest at least 80% of its net assets in XRP-linked instruments, including futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Volatility Shares is preparing to release a 2x XRP futures ETF, designed to deliver twice the daily returns of XRP by providing double leveraged exposure to XRP futures. Teucrium already launched a 2X XRP ETF in April and trades roughly $35 million daily. Seeing Teucrium’s success, Balchunas believes there will be good demand for Volatility Shares 2X XRP ETF. John Deaton argues Ripple executives could be excellent picks for a crypto Mount Rushmore Lawyer John Deaton believes some of Ripple’s executives could make the cut for a crypto Mount Rushmore for their contributions to the crypto industry. Deaton explained that Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb could be a perfect pick for the crypto Mount Rushmore for his efforts in creating XRP and the XRP ledger. Ripple CTO David Schwartz also caught the lawyer’s attention for his work in developing the XRP ledger and an early patent predating blockchain technology. Deaton also mentioned Ripple CEO Brad GarlingHouse for launching the RLUSD stablecoin and acquiring Hidden Road . Also on Deaton’s list were the anonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. He argued that Buterin makes a list for introducing smart contracts and decentralized applications. Deaton also named Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell, and Custodia Bank founder Caitlin Long as potential candidates. Strategy CEO Michael Saylor is also in the running list for leading his company in building its Bitcoin reserve. So far, Strategy holds 576,230 BTC. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The second should help Pioneers reset their passwords in a more secure and efficient way if needed. New Apps The blog post begins by laying out the five new applications that will be available in the Mainnet Ecosystem Interface, which, according to the team, signals “continued growth across the Pi app landscape.” The first is a snake game app, perhaps influenced by the iconic snake game in the early Nokia phones from two decades ago. The second is an e-commerce app, while the rest are focused on information about the PI token. All applications met the network’s standards for quality, completeness of functionalities, evaluation of utility, and compliance with the overall ecosystem guidelines and policies. The team emphasized the importance of these standards, as not all Mainnet-ready applications are and will be listed on the Mainnet if they don’t meet all of them. The five applications in question are already available for users worldwide. Such additions should boost developer confidence that their projects could be next in line as the ecosystem “becomes a more attractive and rewarding space to build in.” Account Recovery There have been a few complaints online about the account recovery process, which some claimed was not secure enough. The team has addressed those issues by implementing a new process that should provide clarity and straightforwardness. If a user (Pioneer) has set up a “trusted” email, they will receive a password reset link, which is the new addition to the already existing methods. This option should make account recovery “more accessible and reliable while ensuring security since email recovery is simpler and cheaper for users, and reliable in general, e.g., no dependency on local telecommunications carriers.” For more information on the overall Pi Network ecosystem and latest developments, you can check this article .

Bold Call From Bybit Executive,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-125k-by-end-of-q2-bold-call-from-bybit-executive/,"Bitcoin could climb higher before June wraps up, if today’s momentum holds. According to Shunyet Jan, Head of Derivatives at Bybit, the world’s second-largest crypto exchange, a move to $125,000 by the end of Q2 is on the table. That’s a jump of about 16% from current levels near $108,000. It’s a bold call, but Jan ties it to clear rules, steady fund flows and a sliding US dollar. Related Reading: Investors Pour $2.75 Billion Into Bitcoin ETFs As Price Skyrockets Bitcoin: Bold Price Forecast Jan set the $125,000 target in a market update on Thursday. He argues that if big players keep buying, Bitcoin can make that climb from roughly $108,100 today to $125,000 in five weeks. It’s a tight window. The weeks ahead will matter most as prices test new highs and traders look for clues on follow-through. Bybit’s Head of Derivatives Predicts Bitcoin Could Reach $125K by End of Q2 — WF (@WhaleFUD) May 24, 2025 Three Main Drivers Regulatory clarity tops Jan’s list. Based on reports, the new GENIUS Act gives stablecoins defined rules, which could help banks and funds feel safer about crypto. He also mentions spot Bitcoin ETFs. These funds have pulled in fresh capital, offering a straight path for institutions to own Bitcoin. Finally, Jan points to a weaker US dollar. When the dollar dips, Bitcoin often shines as an alternative store of value, his view goes. Altcoin Outlook Mixed While Bitcoin gets the green light, Jan warns that smaller tokens may struggle. He says high interest rates and global uncertainty might limit gains for Ethereum and other major altcoins. If money slows or risk appetite wanes, altcoins could lag behind Bitcoin’s rally. Traders aiming beyond BTC may need to pick their spots more carefully. Other Expert Predictions Jan’s view isn’t alone. Scott Melker, host of The Wolf of All Streets podcast, thinks Bitcoin could hit $250,000 by December 31, 2025. He notes BTC’s volatility has fallen from about three times that of the S&P to under two times. On another front, Adam Back of Blockstream sees an even steeper climb to between $500,000 and $1 million per coin this cycle. Michael Saylor, CEO of Strategy, adds that recent hiccups below $150,000 are tied to short-term holders exiting. He says longer-term investors are moving in through spot ETFs and corporate buys.

A surprise hawkish move from the Federal Reserve or a fresh regulatory twist could sway prices just as much as demand. If Bitcoin breaks toward $125,000, it would mark a major milestone. But as always, timing matters nearly as much as price targets.

Yet, as the market’s attention sharpens, early-stage capital is rotating into Ethereum and MAGACOIN FINANCE—two assets now highlighted for their explosive upside potential in the next cycle. Bitcoin, XRP, and Litecoin round out the list of key names to watch as Q3 2025 approaches. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Surge, 50% Bonus, and 10,600%+ Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the breakout presale of 2025 , with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling unprecedented demand.Key highlights: Scarcity-driven model: 100 billion tokens ensures a supply squeeze as demand intensifies. Secure and transparent: HashEx-audited contracts and rapid community growth. 50% bonus: Early buyers using the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code secure a 50% token bonus before the $0.007 listing target. Analysts are projecting 25x–35x returns, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% upside if momentum continues. As each stage fills, MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting the pace for early-stage gains before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. Ethereum (ETH): Bullish Structure and Institutional Inflows Ethereum is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, with technicals pointing to a potential breakout above $2,700 if bullish sentiment holds. The network’s resilience and growing institutional adoption are fueling optimism, with price forecasts for June targeting $2,700–$2,900. While ETH remains a core holding, its near-term upside is now being matched by the rapid acceleration of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin (BTC): Macro Anchor and Capital Rotation Bitcoin is trading above $108,000, with strong institutional demand and technical support at $107,000–$111,000. While BTC remains the market’s foundation, its upside is increasingly seen as more measured, prompting many investors to diversify into high-growth altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Volatility and Rotating Capital XRP is consolidating between $2.35 and $2.65, with analysts forecasting a move to $2.80–$3.40 if momentum returns. However, short-term volatility and profit-taking pressure have led many traders to seek sharper returns in early-stage projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. Litecoin (LTC): Bullish Signs, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Litecoin is holding above $90, with technicals suggesting a bullish continuation toward $100–$110. While LTC remains a reliable hold, its upside is less dramatic than the explosive presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion Solana’s bullish setup and Ethereum’s resilience are impressive, but the most dramatic growth potential is now unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE . With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 10,600% ROI, MAGA is the breakout contender for Q3 2025.

John Woeltz, 37, was arraigned on Saturday in Manhattan criminal court following his arrest on Friday. He stands accused of holding a 28-year-old Italian man captive for weeks inside a luxury townhouse in Soho, reportedly rented for $30,000 per month. According to police reports cited by The New York Times, the victim arrived in the US on May 6 and was allegedly abducted by Woeltz and an accomplice. The attackers are said to have stolen the man’s passport and electronic devices before demanding the password to his Bitcoin ( BTC ) wallet. When he refused, the suspects allegedly subjected him to prolonged physical abuse. Source: Mario Nawfal Related: Violent crypto robberies on the rise: Six attacks that targeted investors Crypto victim beaten, electroshocked The victim described being beaten, shocked with electricity, assaulted with a firearm and even dangled from the upper floors of the five-story building. He also told police that Woeltz used a saw to cut his leg and forced him to smoke crack cocaine. Threats were also reportedly made against his family. Photographic evidence found inside the property, including Polaroids, appears to support claims of sustained abuse. The victim managed to escape on Friday and alert authorities, leading to Woeltz’s arrest. Woeltz was charged with four felony counts, including kidnapping for ransom, and entered a plea of not guilty. Judge Eric Schumacher ordered him to be held without bail. He is expected back in court on May 28. A 24-year-old woman was also taken into custody on Friday in connection with the incident. However, she was seen walking freely in New York the next day, and no charges against her were found in the court’s online database. Authorities have yet to clarify the relationship between the suspect and the victim or whether any cryptocurrency was ultimately stolen.

You really don’t want to see that breakout get stuffed. And the moment we closed below $60,000, I was like, ‘Okay, this is kind of [messed up].” Source: DonAlt/YouTube After Bitcoin failed to hold $60,000 in November 2021, BTC witnessed a multi-month downtrend that drove the crypto king to prices below $20,000. Now, DonAlt is warning that Bitcoin might be in a similar position as it struggles to convincingly take out its last resistance at $110,000. “And you can argue the same here. I don’t necessarily think $104,000 is good enough, but it would be an early warning sign if we start losing it. And then you can make the comparison easier. And then a little bit of a better warning sign, I think, is around $100,000, where we start getting into danger territory. And then if we start dipping down there, all bets are off, and then time to run probably.” Source: DonAlt/YouTube At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $107,590.

The platform is scheduled to go live by the end of June and aims to function as a retail-oriented equivalent of “Hidden Roads,” a firm known for serving institutional players in digital asset markets. Curated Clip Maybe it's XRP Ledger, @FlareNetworks , Ethereum, or @SuiNetwork , and bring that yield back to you on the #XRP Ledger. An end-of-June launch, @moremarketsxyz will be the ""Hidden Roads"" for the #XRP retail users. More to follow! pic.twitter.com/G3dTVjcZff — Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) May 23, 2025 Yield Generation Across Multiple Blockchains The video, labeled as a “Curated Clip” by Crypto Eri, features Tutar explaining the core mission of MoreMarkets. He describes the service as a bridge for retail users to access yield opportunities by deploying idle XRP into various blockchain environments. These include the XRP Ledger, Flare Networks, Ethereum, and Sui Network. According to Tutar, the yield generated from these sources is returned to users directly on the XRP Ledger. A Platform Geared Toward Everyday Investors Tutar emphasizes the accessibility of the platform for retail investors. He notes that the system is designed for individuals who may contribute as little as $10 or $50 worth of XRP. The process involves routing the digital assets into markets that offer reliable yield generation, with a strong focus on security, auditability, and transparency. He confirms that MoreMarkets conducts thorough vetting of the protocols and networks it engages with. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Team Experience and Broader Strategic Vision In the conversation, Crypto Eri positions MoreMarkets as a solution tailored to the average retail user, contrasting it with Hidden Roads, which she suggests operates primarily in the institutional space. Tutar concurs that while Hidden Road has been active in servicing Ripple and other institutions, MoreMarkets will serve a distinct segment. He adds that MoreMarkets draws on the expertise of a team with experience at companies like Neoprotocol and financial institutions, including Deutsche Bank and Nomura. According to Tutar, the platform’s use of the XRP Ledger as a settlement layer for yield distribution represents a key innovation. By integrating with various blockchain ecosystems for yield generation and centralizing yield delivery on the XRP Ledger, MoreMarkets intends to offer a streamlined experience for retail participants. With the projected launch set for the end of June, further updates from MoreMarkets are anticipated. Crypto Eri concludes her tweet with “More to follow,” indicating that additional information will be shared in the coming weeks.

Many altcoins have posted notable gains on a weekly scale, led by HYPE, while SUI and XRP have retraced the most from the larger caps. BTC to $108K It all began last Sunday evening when BTC broke out of its weekend calmness and shot up from $103,000 to almost $107,000. It faced immediate resistance there and was pushed south on Monday. The scenario repeated once again as the business week progressed, but the bulls took complete control of the market on Wednesday. After a minor pullback, the cryptocurrency went hard on the offensive in the afternoon and jumped past $109,100 to market a new all-time high. The bears were quick to intercept and drove bitcoin back down to $106,500, but that was another short-lived correction. By Thursday morning, BTC had resumed its run and skyrocketed to almost $112,000 (on Pizza Day) to register a new all-time high. More volatility ensued on Friday when US President Trump recommended new tariffs against the EU, and bitcoin slipped by several grand almost immediately. It now trades at around $108,000 after a quiet weekend , but it’s still 4% up weekly. Its market cap remains close to $2.150 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is above 61%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Volatile Alts The altcoins seem to be led by a new megastar: HYPE. Its price charted a new all-time high on Friday, and even a compromised Hyperliquid X account couldn’t halt its momentum. It’s up by 30% on a weekly scale and has become the top performer. AAVE follows suit with a 19% weekly jump, while XMR is third with a 17.7% such increase. PEPE and BCH are next in line. In contrast, SUI has dropped by 5% since this time last Sunday, and XRP has slipped to $2.3 after a 2.8% weekly decline. The total crypto market cap has shed around $30 billion since yesterday and is down to $3.5 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

After recovering from previous market turbulence, SOL is once again climbing the charts, recently trading at $166, with bullish analysts projecting a potential breakout to $1,000 in the next bull cycle. But while SOL promises long-term strength, its high price tag limits explosive short-term returns. That is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters the picture. With still an entry price, Mutuum Finance just requires a little push to deliver massive returns, making it among the best new cryptos in which to invest today. Mutuum Finance presale is currently in stage 5 of presale after selling out of the fourth one. Its presale has raked in more than $9.1 million, adding over 11,000 holders. Investors are rushing in at $0.03 before the token jumps 16.67% to $0.035. Today’s investors are set for a 100% return on investment when the project finally comes out at $0.06. Solana’s Road to $1,000: Can the Top Altcoin Deliver a 6x Gain in 2025? Solana (SOL), currently at $166 and still one of the best cryptos to invest in as we go deeper into 2025’s bull trend, has ultra-fast transactions and scalable blockchain. Solana weathered the recent market corrections and came back stronger than ever. Analysts now predict a potential jump to $1,000 based on renewed developer activity, DeFi expansion, and increased institutional appetite. While this kind of move would be well over a 6x return, it suggests confidence in Solana to close the gap with Ethereum in terms of utility and speed. For investors looking for even greater upside possibility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is just starting to make waves at much lower prices. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows Its groundbreaking two-way lending model has made Mutuum Finance take center stage as far as speedy adoption by users is concerned. That more than 11,000 investors have invested $9.1 million in the presale is a testament to the success of the project. MUTM token will cost $0.035 in Phase 6 which means its price is set to appreciate by 16.67%. That presents investors with an opportunity for high returns. Through both market demand and strong lending approaches, MUTM is an intriguing DeFi project that could be worth $1 after launch. DeFi with a Hybrid Lending Approach Mutuum Finance is unique in that it combines both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. Through the P2C model, users are able to accrue passive income through USDT liquidity pools, reaping the advantage of automated lending by smart contracts. On the other hand, the P2P model facilitates direct-to-peer transactions without the involvement of an intermediary, giving users complete control over their funds. By hybridizing these two models, Mutuum Finance enhances security, efficiency, and decentralization, which is a perfect offer for DeFi investors seeking high-yielding alternatives. Rewarding Early Investors and Growing the Community Mutuum Finance is encouraging people to join by offering attractive rewards. Ten lucky users will be given $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and by inviting friends to join, users can earn as more rewards. While Solana (SOL) aims for a 6x gain to $1,000, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers potentially greater short-term upside with a presale price of just $0.03. Over 11,000 investors have contributed $9.1 million, and with the price set to rise 16.67% soon, early buyers can lock in 100% ROI at launch. MUTM’s unique dual lending model and growing community position it as a promising DeFi contender ready to surge toward $1 or beyond. Don’t miss your chance to join the MUTM presale before prices increase. Secure your tokens now and be part of the next DeFi breakthrough.

To get a forward-looking perspective, we asked Google’s Gemini AI to provide a price prediction based on current trends, legal factors, and market cycles. Gemini has high expectations for XRP, projecting that the digital asset could reach between $3.50 and $6.00 by late 2025, depending on several key conditions. Key Drivers Behind Gemini’s Forecast Gemini emphasizes that the end of the Ripple-SEC case is central to a bullish scenario. The AI notes that this development will increase investor confidence and push XRP’s price above $3 again. XRP has not reclaimed this level since its decline in early February, and both parties have now reached an agreement and are trying to get the court’s approval . The second driver is the anticipated regulatory clarity. Gemini expects more well-defined crypto regulations to emerge by the end of 2025 under Donald Trump’s administration. In this context, XRP may benefit because of its already-defined use case in global cross-border payments. Third, Gemini factors in market cycles. If Bitcoin maintains an upward trend, historical patterns suggest that altcoins like XRP often follow in the latter stages of a bull run. This correlation could support higher XRP valuations, especially if positive sentiment in the broader market persists into late 2025. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Gemini also considers the potential impact of the continued adoption of Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) platform. Greater institutional use of these services may validate XRP’s practical utility and could help justify a valuation closer to the upper end of the prediction, around $6.00. A New All-time High for XRP The upper range of Gemini’s prediction is much higher than XRP’s all-time high of $3.84, suggesting that the asset could experience the exponential growth the community has been eager to see for years. While the outlook is optimistic, Gemini also outlines a bearish scenario. If the SEC case is not resolved soon or if there is a broader downturn in the cryptocurrency market, XRP’s price could fall short of the projected range. In such cases, Gemini estimates that XRP could trade within a lower range of $1.50 to $2.50. While the current price remains lower than many expect, a favorable market could help XRP reach the new all-time high that Gemini predicted.

While ETH’s consolidation signals stability, the real action is unfolding in early-stage projects—none more so than MAGACOIN FINANCE, where presale momentum and community buzz are rapidly intensifying. With Solana, Aptos, and Bitcoin also in focus, traders are recalibrating for the next wave of growth. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: Accelerating Presale, 50% Bonus, and 35x+ Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly establishing itself as 2025’s most dynamic presale, with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral narrative are fueling record demand from both retail and institutional investors.Key highlights: Scarcity-Driven Model: Only 100 billion tokens, with 45% allocated to presale, creating a strong supply squeeze as demand rises. Community Surge: Over 20,000 holders and growing, with social buzz and presale trackers consistently ranking MAGA as a top pick. 50% Bonus: Early buyers can use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% token bonus, amplifying upside ahead of the $0.007 listing target. Analysts are projecting 25x–35x returns, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% if momentum continues. With every stage, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s trendline is steepening—making it the cycle’s breakout contender before listings ignite true price discovery. Ethereum (ETH): Sideways Action and Steady Inflows Ethereum is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, with technicals hinting at a possible breakout above $2,700 if bullish sentiment returns. Institutional inflows remain robust, and analysts expect ETH to test $2,800–$2,900 in June. While ETH remains a foundational asset, its near-term upside is now more measured compared to the rapid acceleration seen in MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana (SOL): Bullish Structure and Upside Potential Solana is trading between $158 and $175, with a breakout above $175 potentially leading to a retest of $183 and even $200 if momentum persists. The network’s high throughput and expanding DeFi ecosystem continue to attract capital, but the most aggressive traders are now rotating into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper returns. Aptos (APT): Quiet Growth, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Aptos is trading around $4.09, with forecasts suggesting a range of $2.79 to $5.38 for May 2025. While APT’s fundamentals remain solid, its near-term upside is less dramatic compared to the explosive presale-driven momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin (BTC): Macro Anchor and Capital Rotation Bitcoin is holding above $110,000, with strong institutional support and technicals pointing to a possible move toward $115,000 if momentum hold. As BTC’s growth steadies, more investors are rotating into high-upside altcoins—where MAGACOIN FINANCE is now leading sentiment and capital flows. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion Ethereum’s sideways movement is providing a stable backdrop, but the steepest trendline belongs to MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus , and analyst forecasts up to 35x–50x ROI, MAGA is the breakout name to watch as Q3 approaches.

Following Bitcoin’s surge past $111,000. Farina compared potential returns from Bitcoin to those from XRP. He emphasized that buying Bitcoin at current levels and expecting it to reach $500,000 would yield only a 355% gain, whereas buying XRP at $2.40 and seeing it rise to $100 would result in a 4,066% gain. “Make the right choices,” he concluded, suggesting that while Bitcoin may seem like a good option, a critical look at both assets shows that XRP will give much better returns. Let’s do some math: Buy BTC at $110K, it goes to $500K → ~355% gain Buy XRP at $2.40, it goes to $100 → 4,066% gain Make the right choices!

He argues that most crypto holders do not own a full Bitcoin and are unlikely to see life-changing returns from the asset at current prices. According to Farina, “Most investors don’t even have $10,000 in their bank accounts,” and buying BTC now provides limited growth potential compared to alternative digital assets. This limited growth is clear when comparing both assets, as a recent analysis showed that XRP has grown 490% since 2022 , while Bitcoin has risen by only 10%. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Manipulation Concerns and Utility-Based Alternatives Farina argues Bitcoin’s surge is driven by propaganda and low liquidity, not real demand. He claims manipulation via Tether (USDT) skews prices, and public celebration over Bitcoin reaching six figures is misplaced, as most investors won’t benefit. Farina highlights XRP, XLM, HBAR, and Algorand as better risk-reward plays, citing their real-world utility and lower market caps. He notes XRP’s rise from $0.50 to $2.40 as a strong example. He believes buying XRP at current prices is a no-brainer , and contrasts its growth with Bitcoin’s 30% gain during the same timeframe, despite significantly higher volatility and far lower upside. Questioning Bitcoin’s Long-Term Viability Farina questions Bitcoin’s long-term viability, citing high fees, poor scalability, and criticism from institutions like the IMF and ECB. He claims utility-based assets like XRP and XLM have more potential. He recalls selling his car to invest in Bitcoin at $16,000, only to cash out at $64,000 for a 4x return. He says those gains were modest compared to his returns from XRP bought at lower prices. For new investors, he sees limited upside and advises focusing on undervalued projects with real-world use , not hype-driven legacy assets, as Bitcoin’s big gains have been in the past.

Unilabs (UNIL) , a new altcoin, is slowly gaining momentum and may challenge Ethereum’s dominance in 2025. Powered by advanced AI and innovative DeFi investment strategies, Unilabs offers smart, automated portfolio management. This offering, coupled with other rewards and perks, could make Unilabs one of the best DeFi projects in the market. Binance Coin (BNB) Targets $700 Resistance The Binance Coin price has been retesting the $680 level in the past few days but bulls have held their ground. The cryptocurrency is currently starting an uptrend on the weekly chart. Its value has soared by 5.3% in this timeframe. Going forward, the Binance Coin price could climb to $700 based on technical analysis. Technical indicators such as the RSI show that buying pressure is high, supporting more upside. Rose Premium Signals in a recent post on X said the Binance Coin price chart was strong. The expert predicts the Binance Coin price is about to enter discovery. If this happens, the BNB price could climb to $743 and $789 in the next few weeks. Another expert, BATMAN said the Binance Coin price has formed a bullish flag and is waiting for a breakout. The analyst expects the Binance Coin price to soar to $700 when this happens. Analyst Forecasts Uptrend For Ethereum (ETH) Rose Premium Signals tweeted recently that the Ethereum price has broken from a descending trendline. It has also turned the former resistance zone at $2,000-$2,200 into a strong support. As long as the Ethereum price stays above this breakout zone, Rose Premium Signals says its value might climb higher. The analyst believes the Ethereum price is gearing up for the next leg up. They posted three potential targets which are $3,063, $3,566, and $4,201. At the moment, CoinMarketCap data indicates the Ethereum price has risen on the weekly timeframe by 4.5%. Meanwhile, the head of research at OnchainHQ, Leon Waidmann revealed that the Ethereum network has witnessed massive growth. The number of weekly active addresses has been above 15 million. Also, over 564k addresses are active on multiple chains. This ecosystem growth could push the Ethereum price to new levels in the months ahead.

Physical phishing tactics mark a shift from online-only attacks, raising new concerns for crypto security. Fake Ledger Live apps are targeting macOS users with trojanized malware designed to steal recovery phrases. A new phishing scam is targeting crypto holders through traditional mail, with scammers impersonating hardware wallet maker Ledger and sending fake letters urging users to “validate” their wallets or risk losing access to funds. BitGo CEO Mike Belshe was among the first to flag the attack, sharing an image of the fraudulent letter, which included a QR code — likely linked to a phishing site designed to steal private keys. Crypto Scammers Turn to USPS in Shift to Physical Phishing Attacks The letters have reportedly been delivered via the United States Postal Service (USPS), signaling a shift in tactics from digital to physical social engineering. Troy Lindsey, another recipient of the letter, warned others on social media: “These are all scams. Do not fall for any of these.” I got the same one last week I took and had @grok analyze it. These are all scams do not fall for any of these!! pic.twitter.com/ZFNpQpujqA — Troy Lindsey (@TroyandOlga) May 24, 2025 The warning echoes growing concerns about phishing schemes that leverage physical credibility to trick crypto users into exposing sensitive data. The attack comes amid a rise in crypto-related phishing cases. In April, $330 million in Bitcoin was stolen from an elderly victim, a heist confirmed by blockchain investigator ZackXBT. He linked the crime to individuals operating from a scam call center in Camden, UK. Meanwhile, Coinbase disclosed earlier this month that it was the target of a ransom attempt after customer support contractors leaked user data. The attackers demanded $20 million, which the exchange refused to pay. While Coinbase stated that no private keys or account access were compromised, the leaked data included names and contact information. TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington criticized the exchange , warning that breaches of this kind could lead to real-world harm for exposed customers. Fake Ledger Live Apps Target macOS Users Last week, cybersecurity firm Moonlock warned that a wave of malware attacks targeting macOS users is exploiting trust in Ledger Live, a popular crypto wallet management app. Moonlock warned that malicious actors are using trojanized clones of Ledger Live to trick users into entering their recovery phrases through convincing pop-ups. “Within a year, they have learned to steal seed phrases and empty the wallets of their victims,” the team stated, noting a major evolution in the threat. One of the primary infection vectors is the Atomic macOS Stealer, a tool designed to exfiltrate sensitive data such as passwords, notes, and crypto wallet details. Moonlock discovered it embedded across at least 2,800 compromised websites. Once installed, the malware quietly replaces the genuine Ledger Live app with a fake one that triggers fake alerts to harvest seed phrases. The moment a user enters their 24-word recovery phrase into the phony app, the information is sent to servers controlled by the attacker.

The new Galileo testnet introduces a host of improvements over its predecessor, including a 70% boost in network speed. The V3 testnet moves 0G closer to its mainnet launch, which will form a decentralized AI operating system for an array of data-intensive applications. Galileo gives dapp developers a clear idea of the sort of scalability and performance they can look forward to, including throughput of up to 2,500 TPS. We spoke with Funder and CEO of 0G Labs, Michael Heinrich, to better understand Galileo. Galileo notably boasts a 70% performance boost, achieving up to 2,500 TPS with an optimized CometBFT consensus. Can you elaborate on the specific technical enhancements made to achieve this throughput increase compared to V2? We learned a lot during the course of running Newton, our V2 testnet. The unprecedented demand from users to access Newton took us by surprise, but proved to be a blessing in disguise since it allowed us to identify chokepoints and develop solutions to overcome these. These findings have been incorporated into Galileo, which is better engineered to prevent mempool congestion and has greater bandwidth to avoid maxing out resources during peak times. With Galileo, we’ve rebuilt our testnet from the ground up, incorporating the latest EVM standards and enhancing the consensus efficiency with BLS signature to deliver a sleeker, more modular, and altogether more scalable network that can handle anything that’s flung at it. So far, all the benchmarks point to Galileo being streets ahead of its predecessor: from inference workloads to modular memory systems, it’s effortlessly handling it all, aided by more RPCs and compute to cope with high demand. The V2 testnet saw impressive traction with 2.5 million unique wallets and 350 million transactions. How is the 0G team planning to leverage Galileo’s strengths to further engage the developer and user community, and what feedback from the V2 testnet shaped Galileo’s development? We actually saw more than 5M wallets, we’re fortunate to have so many users already onboarded and engaging with 0G in various ways, be it as developers, infra partners, or end users. Because their attention is already invested in the 0G ecosystem, having the majority of them accompany us to Galileo has been smooth. From the perspective of regular users, we’re confident that the improved faucet system will ensure fair test token distribution, allowing everyone to participate on an equal basis. On V3, they’re going to encounter a much faster chain that’s capable of handling anything that’s thrown at it. Coupled with the capabilities that devs have at their disposal, now Galileo is running the Ethereum Engine API and is fully Pectra compatible, and we’re confident that we’ll be able to lure more EVM developers into the fold. In an early test 0G has already hit 2GB per second in data throughput (and multiples more coming), and compute and the service marketplace are also running better than ever in terms of benchmarks, it’s an exciting time to be building on 0G and we can’t wait to see which direction different developer teams move in now they have all these powerful tools at their disposal. How many subsequent testnets are planned before mainnet launch, and will Galileo’s state be retained so that applications built on it can be easily migrated to subsequent testnets and eventually mainnet? Given we re-architected Galileo completely, this will be the final testnet before 0G’s mainnet release, so developers and users alike can be confident that the V3 experience will be very close to what they’ll encounter on mainnet. We will add more features like infinite scalability and increasing the speed per shard to 10,000 tps. From a user perspective, what are some reasons to play around with the Galileo testnet and what are some of the tasks and experiences available on V3 for non-technical users to discover? Everyone loves new, and there’s a lot that’s new on Galileo and that will be of interest to ordinary users almost as much as to developers. It’s a chance to get a feel for what the next generation of smart contract chains is capable of in terms of performance, familiarize themselves with a network they’ll soon be using in a live environment, and there may also be additional incentives for claiming some testnet tokens and experimenting with sending transactions and interacting with dapps. Whether you’re passionate about DeFi, AI, DePIN, DeSci or some other onchain vertical, there are a lot of things taking shape on Galileo that will be relevant to your interests.

The move reignited bullish momentum across the market, with traders and analysts now turning their focus to what could be the next phase of this cycle. Related Reading: Tron Bulls Regain Control – On-Chain Data Shows Fresh Buying Pressure Despite the aggressive push higher, on-chain data suggests the market remains healthy. Top analyst Darkfost highlighted that net realized profits are still within normal levels for a bull run. According to his analysis, profit-taking is not a sign of weakness—it’s a necessary part of market structure during uptrends. “This is what keeps investors engaged and prevents parabolic exhaustion,” he noted. The recent price action points to a potential shift in market dynamics, as Bitcoin breaks out of its post-halving consolidation phase. With weekly support forming above $105K and realized profit metrics staying in check, bulls are eyeing higher levels. If this momentum holds, the $112K rejection may only be a short-term hurdle. As always, volatility remains in play—but this week’s close sends a strong signal: the bull market structure is still intact. Bitcoin Has Room To Grow As It Prepares For Historic Weekly Close Bitcoin is on track to record its highest weekly close in history, signaling growing strength as it prepares for what many believe could be the next major bullish phase. After surging to a new all-time high near $112,000 earlier this week, BTC is now stabilizing above the $105,000 level—positioning itself above key short-term support going into next week. Still, while price action paints a bullish picture, macroeconomic conditions continue to pose risks. High interest rates, tightening financial conditions, and broader market uncertainty remain major factors. Investors are cautiously optimistic, but volatility could quickly return if global risk sentiment deteriorates. On-chain data offers a more grounded view of the current cycle. According to Darkfost, CryptoQuant data shows that realized profits currently stand at 104,000 BTC, or around $11 billion. While that number may seem large, it’s still well below the historical danger zone of 350,000 BTC—a level that typically signals euphoric conditions or overheating. This suggests the market remains in a healthy profit-taking zone. “Profit-taking is not a red flag during a bull market,” Darkfost noted. “It’s necessary. It helps maintain momentum and keeps participants engaged.” The coming week will be critical. A confirmed weekly close above $105K could solidify this level as new support and set the stage for further upside. But if bulls fail to hold ground, the rally risks losing steam. For now, Bitcoin appears strong, but the market is entering a zone where conviction will be tested. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pulls Back To Daily EMA 8 – Can Bulls Hold Momentum? BTC Holds Key Support After Rejection From New ATH Bitcoin is currently trading around $107,750 after a volatile week that saw prices hit a new all-time high near $112,000. The daily chart shows BTC pulling back from overbought conditions but holding firmly above the 34-day EMA at $100,886—a level that has consistently acted as dynamic support during this uptrend. Price remains well above the 50, 100, and 200-day SMAs, confirming a strong bullish structure. The key horizontal support at $103,600—now reclaimed—is another crucial zone. This level previously acted as a resistance ceiling during the March-April range and now serves as a potential launchpad if BTC consolidates above it. Volume appears to be declining slightly on the pullback, which may suggest this is a healthy retrace rather than a reversal. As long as Bitcoin maintains above the $103,600–$105,000 zone, bulls remain in control. A deeper correction would find initial support around the 34 EMA and then the 100 SMA near $91,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Above Key Prices – Data Points To $2,900 Level As Bullish Trigger For now, the bullish trend remains intact. However, rejection at $112K and slowing momentum call for caution. A weekly close above $105K would confirm strength, while a break below $103K could trigger short-term weakness.

Crypto adoption in Latin America is still emerging, but the region shows strong potential: high inflation, expensive remittances, and limited banking access make it a great opportunity for decentralized solutions. That’s where KMBIO comes in: a new peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency exchange that connects digital assets with the real economy-starting with LATAM, but designed to scale globally.

Dogecoin News: Wall Street Rumors, ETF Hopes, and a $5 Target DOGE is currently trading around $0.24, with crypto analysts seeing many bullish signals that might propel DOGE to a $5 price point. DOGE technical analysis identifies some important factors that support this bullish outlook. The monthly chart analysis indicates that the Dogecoin price may replicate the same technical setting that preceded its historic 2021 spike. The 20-month and 50-month moving averages are providing strong support, as they did during the previous bull run. The monthly Relative Strength Index remains very low, but there is a possibility for an upward climb. In prior cycles, the RSI hovered around 80 before the peak price arrived. In another Dogecoin news regarding the potential DOGE ETF, things have been a little confusing. The SEC has postponed its judgment until June, however, this does not mean that it will not be approved. The SEC filings plainly state that the delay is due to extra analysis. The Polymarket chances for the DOGE ETF clearance by the end of July are merely 15%, down 7% in the previous 24 hours. However, the odds in 2025 are 63%, indicating that investor trust is stronger in the latter months of 2025. Additionally, in the Dogecoin news, Bloomberg experts have made similar predictions. In a recent X post, James Seyffart stated that there is no conspiracy behind the DOGE ETF approval delays and that it is simply the SEC’s usual procedure.

While notable altcoins gain the headlines, an emerging project on the XRP Ledger is quietly capturing the imagination of forward-looking investors. XpFinance , the first fully decentralized lending and borrowing protocol engineered specifically for XRP, has already filled more than twenty percent of its one-hundred-thousand XRP presale soft cap in only a few days. Buy XPF Tokens Market participants who booked profits during the recent Bitcoin and Ethereum surge are actively rotating capital into early-stage opportunities with strong fundamentals and real utility. XpFinance is quickly becoming the top destination for that capital. By delivering a noncustodial lending engine that harnesses XRP Ledger speed and near-zero fees, the protocol positions itself as the missing cornerstone of decentralized finance on XRPL. A clear solution to XRP’s DeFi gap Centralized lenders have dominated the XRP landscape for years, often charging opaque fees and forcing users to surrender custody of their coins. XpFinance eliminates those pain points through an on-chain architecture that gives users full control over their assets at every step. Loans are overcollateralized, transparently managed by smart contracts, and settled in seconds through XRP Ledger consensus. Investors who hold the native XPF token receive three immediate advantages. First, borrowing fees drop significantly for token holders, creating tangible savings for active users. Second, a share of all protocol fees is distributed to stakers in XRP, establishing a stable passive-income stream. Third, governance rights allow the XpFinance community to vote on new collateral assets, interest curves, and strategic upgrades, ensuring that platform evolution remains user centric. Joining Xpfinance Presale offer an instant upside XpFinance has reserved sixty million XPF , exactly thirty percent of the fixed two-hundred-million supply, for its limited presale. Tokens are sold at a transparent price of one XRP for two-hundred XPF. Upon the conclusion of the sale, XPF will list directly on XPMarket, the leading decentralized exchange on XRPL, at one XRP for one-hundred-forty XPF. Early buyers therefore secure a built-in thirty percent price advantage the moment public trading begins. Join Xpfinance Presale First look demo coming next week The development team has confirmed that a working demonstration of the lending dashboard will be released next week. Prospective users will be able to connect an XRPL wallet, simulate deposits, and preview real-time loan creation inside a web interface that mirrors the final production version. The demo is expected to serve as a powerful catalyst for the remaining presale phases, as investors will see first hand how fast and easy decentralized lending on XRP can be. How to participate in the Xpfinance presale Purchase XRP on a reputable exchange such as Binance, Coinbase, or Bybit. Transfer XRP to a self-custody wallet that supports trust lines, for example Xaman, XUMM, or Ledger Nano. Visit the official presale portal at xp.finance/presale and send XRP to the address displayed. Add the XPF trust line in your wallet so tokens are delivered automatically when the sale closes. The presale is filling rapidly. Analysts who track on-chain inflows expect the soft cap to be met well ahead of schedule and anticipate strong demand once XPF goes live on decentralized exchanges. About XpFinance XpFinance is building the first noncustodial money market on the XRP Ledger. The project’s mission is to unlock idle XRP liquidity, provide frictionless borrowing, and distribute protocol governance to a global community of token holders. By merging the speed of XRPL with a transparent fee model, XpFinance aims to set a new standard for decentralized finance. Secure your allocation before the window closes and position yourself at the forefront of the XRP DeFi renaissance.

While Cardano is certainly a great project, it has just not found its market. After several false starts, the Cardano price is frustratingly low and even the extreme 25-year Cardano price predictions show the token price flat. Considering Bitcoin has just hit an all-time high and the markets are white hot, seeing Cardano slip down the ranks to ninth place is quite disheartening. Fortunately, the new PayFi token Remittix is dominating the presale market and Cardano’s unrealized gains can be made up with Remittix. Source: Coingecko Cardano ( ADA ): Technical perfection means nothing if you can’t sell it From the outset, Cardano made it its mission to create a technically perfect blockchain. According to many, it has succeeded. The Cardano chain ticks all the boxes: it is secure, robust, scalable and can handle just about anything one hands it. This perfection comes at a cost, though. The Cardano blockchain is too slow for retail applications and expensive to operate. It’s a superyacht in a world of speedboats. Not everyone needs Cardano’s robust infrastructure; for most applications, Cardano is overkill. Cardano is perfect for governmental and institutional use , but until the world goes full blockchain, Cardano will not get its moment in the sun. Coincodex shows that Cardano’s price will be steady even over the next 25 years and adjusted for inflation, shows Cardano may even lose money. Source: Coincodex Maybe the time has come to thank Cardano for its service, but let the newer, faster chains take it from here. As for Cardino investors? They are finding solace in the potential of Remittix. Remittix (RMX): New PayFi token shows huge promise PayFi is a brand-new concept pioneered by Remittix . It brings the capacity to use blockchain tech and cryptocurrency to make direct-to-fiat bank account payments to almost any account in the world. If that does not sound like a big deal, here’s the lowdown: Global payments are incredibly slow and prone to delays, they cost a fortune with fees levied on both the sender and receiver of the funds, and, on top of that, require lots of administrative duties. International cross-currency payments could not be more expensive or cumbersome if they tried. With Remittix, payments clear almost instantly and cost a fraction of the price. As for the paperwork, what paperwork!? This means global transactions are much more economical and now possible where previously it would have been impractical. Remittix greases the wheels of trade and industry, opens up the free markets and even gives the world’s unbanked a chance to partake in the formal economy. For companies, this reduced hassle and overheads will greatly impact the bottom line, giving all parties an easier path to economic freedom. Remittix is now in presale and has gained over $15.3 million in liquidity thus far. Once the presale ends and the token goes mainstream, its use case could propel Remittix into the top-ranked coins. Even YouTube is enthused about the potential behind Remittix. Conclusion Cardano will always have a place in the cryptosphere and it has some institutional support, but from an investment perspective, Cardano just is not worth it anymore. Remittix , however, is taking up the slack and thanks to its massive use case and unique market positioning, Remittix could be the best-performing token of the year. Remittix is now available at $0.781 directly from their website.

While this price stagnation is due to broader market uncertainty, the potential for a post-holiday bounce is growing especially with Ripple’s recent foray into real estate tokenization in the UAE. UAE’s Real Estate Tokenization Boosts XRPL; XRP Supported Ripple’s XRP Ledger (XRPL) has been chosen by the Dubai Land Department (DLD) as the blockchain for its real estate tokenization project. According to DLD’s senior executive Mahmoud AlBurai, over 3,000 investors have registered interest in the pilot, strong demand for tokenized property ownership. Currently, participation is limited to Emirates cardholders who are official UAE residents. Key points: Partnerships with Prypco Mint and Ctrl Alt to tokenize ownership deeds for government properties. Ripple’s $10M investment in tokenized US Treasury bills on XRPL via OpenEden. $5M stake in a tokenized money market fund by UK-based Abrdn last year. This real-world asset (RWA) initiative is the first of its kind in the MENA region and strengthens XRPL’s case for institutional adoption. Ripple’s payments service is already onboarding institutions, licensed by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA). XRP/USD Technical Analysis: Descending Triangle in Focus XRP price prediction seems bearish for now as on the 2-hour chart, Ripple is in a descending triangle, a pattern that often precedes breakouts. It’s hovering around horizontal support at $2.2856, with recent candlesticks (spinning tops and doji) indicating market indecision. XRP/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview 50-period EMA ($2.3600) and horizontal resistance at $2.3557 cap the upside. MACD histogram is flattening, bearish momentum is slowing. Targets : Break above $2.3600 could be $2.4098 and $2.4756. Failure to hold $2.2856 could be $2.2440 or $2.1970. New traders should wait for a confirmed breakout above trendline resistance and EMA to be reclaimed before going long, with stops below $2.2440. XRP Outlook: Will Lower Volume Spark a Rally? With volume thinning out during holidays like Memorial Day , institutional activity tends to slow down—sometimes creating a perfect storm for a squeeze. If XRP holds $2.31, a light market could be a quick bounce to $2.75. But with the SEC’s XRP stance still unclear and broader market uncertainty, be prepared for volatility. BTC Bull Token Nears $7.33M Cap as 65% APY Staking Draws Interest With XRP/USD steady at $2.31, attention is shifting to altcoins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . So far, $6.33 million has been raised out of a $7.33 million cap. The presale is closing in on its limit, next presale price jump closes in fast. Bitcoin Rewards and Supply Reductions BTC Bull Token operates with a built-in system: the higher Bitcoin’s price, the more BTC airdrops are distributed to token holders. Notably, presale participants receive priority. The system also features: Token burns every $50K BTC increase, reducing supply. Current token price at $0.00253 before the next bump. This approach aligns token value with Bitcoin’s price moves while maintaining scarcity through programmed burns. Staking Terms for Passive Returns BTCBULL’s staking pool holds 1.62 billion tokens offering 65% APY, with: No lockup periods or fees. Full access to funds at any time. This structure appeals to holders looking for yield without complex requirements or risk of illiquidity. Momentum Before the Cap Fills With just over $1 million remaining in the presale, buyers are positioning early. The token’s mechanics of Bitcoin-tied rewards, supply adjustments, and staking options are driving participation. Key figures: USDT raised : $6,329,314.26 / $7,332,195 Token price : $0.00253 BTCBULL offers a whopping ~65% APY on its Ethereum-based staking pool (currently holding 1.61B BTCBULL), with no lockups or withdrawal fees. That means passive yield — with full liquidity.

XYZ aims for G.O.A.T. status as early buyers gear up for massive returns XYZVerse (XYZ) is flipping the script on what a memecoin can be. Blending the high-stakes thrill of sports — football, MMA, basketball, esportsb — with the viral energy of crypto, this isn’t just another token launch.

Presale Slsurge: XYZ delivers before hitting the market The XYZ presale is already making waves, offering entry prices far below the expected public listing value. Here’s a quick breakdown: Initial Price: $0.0001 Current Price: $0.003333 Next Stage: $0.005 Final Presale Price: $0.02 Target Listing Price: $0.10 With over $13 million raised, early backers are betting big — and for good reason.

For those eyeing outsized gains, timing is everything. Don’t miss the shot. Grab XYZ tokens now and and book a place before the final whistle. Chainlink Chainlink (LINK) has seen notable price movements recently. Over the past week, the price increased by 6.10%, and over the past month, it surged by 20.05%. However, over the last six months, it experienced a slight decline of 2.25%. The current price range is between $14.53 and $17.60, indicating a strong recovery from previous lows. Technical indicators suggest a potential upward trend. The 10-day simple moving average is $16.88, higher than the 100-day average of $16.05. This crossover signals positive momentum. The relative strength index is 59.33, approaching overbought conditions but still with room for growth. The MACD level is positive at 0.1350, indicating bullish momentum. If the current trend continues, Chainlink may test the nearest resistance level at $19, representing an increase of about 13% from the current price. If it breaks this barrier, the next resistance is at $22, offering further upside. Conversely, the nearest support level is at $13.17, and if the price falls below this, it could find support at $10.10. Traders are watching these key levels closely. Stellar Stellar (XLM) has shown positive movement recently. In the past week, its price increased by 4.16%. Over the last month, it rose by 14.71%. However, over six months, it has declined by 41.57%. Currently, the price ranges between $0.27 and $0.32. The short-term gains suggest potential for further growth. The Simple Moving Averages over 10 and 100 days are close, at $0.30 and $0.29. The Relative Strength Index stands at 55.41, hinting at bullish momentum. The MACD level is slightly positive at 0.001674, supporting the possibility of continued upward movement. If the trend continues, Stellar might reach the nearest resistance at $0.35, a gain of around 9%. Passing this could lead to the second resistance at $0.41, adding approximately 28%. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.24, a potential drop of about 11%. The second support at $0.19 represents a decrease of roughly 30%. These levels are key indicators for Stellar’s potential direction. Conclusion LINK, XLM, and XYZVerse are leading the 2025 bull run; with XYZ uniting sports fans and aiming for 20,000% growth, they are reshaping global finance.

Solana’s steady uptrend, Ethereum’s bullish structure, and the viral surge of MAGACOIN FINANCE are dominating the conversation, while Bitcoin, XRP, and TRON remain critical benchmarks for capital rotation in the coming cycle. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Frenzy, 50% Bonus, and 35x+ Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading the early-stage pack, with every presale stage selling out faster than the last and over $8 million already raised. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling unprecedented demand. Key reasons traders are watching MAGA closely: Community-driven narrative that cuts through market noise and builds lasting engagement. Early-stage positioning with robust tokenomics and a strict supply cap. Stage 8 nearly full and a $0.007 listing target, with analyst forecasts pointing to 18,500% upside if momentum holds. Early buyers can still use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% bonus, making MAGA the go-to allocation for those seeking the next supercycle winner before listings go live. Solana (SOL): Bullish Structure and Ecosystem Growth Solana is trading between $158 and $175, with analysts watching for a breakout above $175 to retest $183. The network’s high throughput, low fees, and expanding DeFi ecosystem are attracting both users and developers. June forecasts suggest SOL could reach $180–$190, with the potential for $200+ if bullish trends persist. While Solana’s momentum is robust, traders seeking sharper returns are increasingly rotating into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Ethereum (ETH): Steady Climb and Institutional Interest Ethereum is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, with technicals pointing to a possible breakout toward $2,800–$2,900 if bullish sentiment holds. Analysts expect that sustained momentum above $2,650 could open the door to $2,900 and beyond, with some forecasts even targeting $4,500 by year-end if institutional adoption and Layer 2 growth persist. While ETH remains a core holding, its near-term upside is steady compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin (BTC): Market Anchor and June Outlook Bitcoin is holding above $110,000, with forecasts suggesting a range of $113,000–$136,700 for June if bullish momentum continues. BTC’s macro strength provides a stable backdrop for altcoin surges, but its upside is now more measured—making MAGACOIN FINANCE the clear destination for investors targeting higher multiples. XRP and TRON: Steady Progress, MAGA Steals the Spotlight XRP is trading near $2.50, showing a solid uptrend supported by bullish technicals and whale accumulation. TRON is consolidating around $0.27, with forecasts suggesting a climb to $0.32 in early June. While both assets remain strong, their growth is more gradual compared to the explosive presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Conclusion Solana and Ethereum are gaining traction, but the heaviest community surge and most dramatic growth potential are now unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 35x–50x ROI, MAGA is the breakout contender for June and beyond.

The crypto industry is known to take pride in its speed and innovation, but when it comes to crisis management, it is every bit as vulnerable as traditional finance. However, unlike TradFi, crypto lacks clear regulations, central oversight, or even shared crisis protocols, which makes things even worse. You might also like: Building trust: Transparency will drive crypto market growth | Opinion In TradFi, a crisis situation can usually be contained through well-established frameworks—when things take a bad turn, there are central banks and regulators to turn to for help. In crypto, however, a singular event can spiral into a proverbial wildfire within hours, as viral panic on social media and a glaring absence of accountability fan the flames further. This isn’t a hypothetical scenario—we’ve already seen cases like that before. And that’s a problem—not just for individual projects and investors, but for the stability of the entire ecosystem and its future. So, what can be done? It starts with acknowledging that black swan events in crypto aren’t a rarity—they are a part of this landscape. Which means preparing for them should be a core business practice, not an afterthought. Plan in advance with smart, adaptive protocols, instead of tearing your hair out when the crisis is already upon you and all you can do is react haphazardly. Why TradFi risk frameworks don’t work in crypto To reiterate my previous point, TradFi runs on structure. There are rules, regulators, and a long history of crisis management models to draw from. Admittedly, they, too, need to be adjusted for modern-day realities, but that’s a whole other topic. For now, let’s stay focused on crypto—and what we have here is not very inspiring. No unified regulator, no standard response templates or established procedures, often not even a central authority that clients can turn to in case a disaster strikes. When something goes wrong, no one knows who’s in charge—and that’s terrifying for users and investors alike. The result? A situation that might be considered a ‘contained incident’ in traditional banking, for example, risks turning into a full-blown catastrophe in crypto. From flash crashes and protocol exploits to straight-up project implosions, crypto lives on the edge. And the pace at which information (or misinformation) spreads on X (former Twitter), Reddit, and other social networks leaves platforms with no time to regroup. And nobody can pretend such crises are just one-off occurrences. Terra, FTX, Celsius—all of them were wake-up calls. Black swan events are part of the natural rhythm of this market. And what it needs to better prepare for them is not wishful thinking, but intelligent crisis response protocols built specifically for this industry. That means planning for both the expected and the unexpected—and, when the time comes, being able to act on those plans with the speed and transparency crypto demands. The consequences of silence For many people in crypto, the collapse of FTX and the collapse of Terra are still notorious enough that I don’t need to revisit the details and monetary losses in this article. But what’s often overlooked is how the crisis wasn’t just technical or financial—it was communicational. Those events ended up being so destructive for the industry as a whole, not just because of poor risk management or flawed tokenomics. It was silence and confusion that drove that final nail into the coffin. When FTX started crumbling, users and investors alike didn’t know what was happening. There was no clear message, no accountability, and no trustworthy figure stepping up to clearly explain what was happening. And much the same happened with Terra. People were left guessing, and panic and misinformation filled the void. With no credible communication to combat them, trust vanished overnight. And when communication did finally arrive, it came delayed and didn’t help at all in reassuring people. From personal experience, I know that the crypto community has no shortage of very smart people who are good at building things. But far too often, they operate under the assumption that “this can’t happen to us.” That’s a dangerous mindset, because it’s fundamentally wrong. There is no such thing as an “unexpected” crisis—only the ones you didn’t prepare for ahead of time. And when the chaos is already here, silence won’t protect you from it. The absence of clear responsibility and proactive messaging can all too easily turn technical failures into trust failures, which is far harder to rebuild. It’s not just about avoiding mistakes—it’s about handling them when they inevitably come. It’s time for crisis playbooks, not just whitepapers If there’s one actionable takeaway from the past few years, it’s this: every serious crypto company needs a crisis playbook. And not just a theoretical one—it has to be alive, regularly updated, and realistic. Ready to go when things go sideways. That playbook should include: A real-time response plan to incidents that accounts for coordination between PR, legal, and user support teams. A communication tree that defines who speaks, when, and across what channels. Pre-approved messaging templates for common scenarios like hacks, outages, or regulatory scrutiny. Without a plan and a functional chain of command, even small issues can spiral and trigger a domino effect, causing user flight and media firestorms. But with a proper playbook, teams can contain the damage early and hold on to their community through the storm. The paradox of decentralised leadership: Trustless doesn’t mean leaderless Crypto likes to say it’s “trustless,” and that protocols are autonomous. But when things go sideways, people don’t look at strings of code—they look to people. In a crisis, the public wants a face, a voice, a leader. That’s why founders and core team members behind projects must be visible, credible, and prepared to lead, not hide behind pseudonyms. A strong personal brand isn’t just a thing that’s nice-to-have —it’s a core component of business resilience. It builds legitimacy and provides reassurance to your clients during uncertain times. A strong, authentic voice from leadership gives people something to anchor to. It can stabilise a community, calm investors, and steer the narrative during volatile moments. In many cases, a founder’s reputation can even be more valuable than their legal or technical protections. When regulation is confusing and systems are decentralised, credibility is everything. So if you’re building something real, your reputation needs to be as resilient as your code. Build like a crisis is coming—because it is The crypto industry has evolved at an astonishing pace, but it’s also high time for it to mature in how it handles risk. Black swan events aren’t once-in-a-decade exceptions—they’re part of the terrain, and planning for them as inevitabilities is what’s going to set serious players apart going forward. You don’t need to know when or how the next shock will come. But you do need to be ready when it does. Don’t wait until something breaks before you think about how to fix it. The strategies and communication protocols you put in place now will define whether your project is still standing five years from today.

In a new interview with Jimmy Conor, Alden says she’s expecting more or less “stagnant” markets in the near future. However, Alden says there will be “pockets of opportunity” – one of which is US financials, which she says she’s bullish on. “I think that’s kind of the phase we’re entering, so that’s why I expect a generally more stagnant market with pockets of opportunity. I’m public that I’m actually bullish on US financials at the current time. Ironically, as the US enters a slow-motion fiscal crisis, one of the winning sides is the private sector financials because everybody is fighting the last battle of what banks are going to be in trouble, or are we going to have a big credit event… I think that the biggest one is on the sovereign level, and that tends to be pretty decent for the private entities in the ecosystem… Basically, this gets taken out in terms of fiscal dominance, running things hot for a long period of time, taking it out on the currency rather than through major private sector deleveraging. So I think right now US banks on average are pretty cheap and they’re pretty well capitalized, so outside of certain rare pockets, I’m pretty bullish on US financials and US banks in particular. No one’s really interested in buying them right now, but I find them interesting. It’s not the only asset I’d own, but I’m a lot less bearish on them than the market seems to think.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Mostly seen as the Bitcoin proxy stock now boasts a staggering $101 billion market cap. However, its recent bet on Bitcoin might have opened a crack beneath the surface. 10X Research warns that Strategy’s days of high-flying volume may be over. Retail traders who were chasing the rally could soon shift toward even riskier, more volatile names like Metaplanet. This comes in when BTC went on to hit a fresh all-time high (ATH) of over $111,900 on May 22 before tracing back to the $107k zone. Strategy risks steep pullback Options traders say the days of 200–300% implied volatility are gone. Strategy’s at-the-money options now sit at 76%, which is still high, while the realized volatility is collapsing. For MSTR, declining volume also means less opportunity to source cheap volatility and sell it at a premium. The report highlighted that the market could enter a phase where Strategy can acquire significantly less Bitcoin than it has over the past six months. 10x Research stated that it would “consider shorting MicroStrategy at $400, setting a stop loss at $430, and risking $30 to potentially gain $100 if the stock retreats to $300.” It added that the momentum is fading as bearish divergences are flashing, and all three major reversal indicators have flipped negative. The 21-day moving average is sitting at $390, and below that level, long positions start looking shaky. A pullback could happen simply due to a compression in net asset value or, more broadly, if Bitcoin begins to consolidate. It is inevitable unless Strategy continues to drive it higher. If MicroStrategy fails to hold the $400 level, the door to $300 swings is wide open. And as BTC volatility cools, the upside chase might move elsewhere, it added. MSTR’s Bitcoin bet grows As of May 2025, Strategy holds 568,840 Bitcoin (approx. worth $60 billion), after adding a massive 80,715 BTC just in Q1. It is suggested that the pace of Bitcoin accumulation may slow as the past six months saw unprecedented BTC purchases. Maintaining that momentum will be tough without further capital or massive Bitcoin price surges. Strategy stock price has dropped by 7.5% in the last trading session to stand at $369.51. After-hours trading data shows that it might drop by another 3% to touch the $366 zone. However, it is still up by 23% year to date (YTD). Bitcoin has seen a week full of fluctuations. On Monday, BTC was trading around $103K and went on to knock $106K in a few hours and saw a dump to straight $102K area. The original crypto then hovered above the $111K, trying to breach into $112K, but failed. Bitcoin is trading at an average of $107,380 at press time with a trading volume of $45 billion.

Table of Contents Dogecoin price analysis: Sluggish movement indicates losses Memecoin enthusiasts flock to Unilabs for 100x opportunity Future outlook for DOGE hints at a rebound soon Can Unilabs beat Dogecoin’s 2018 breakout? Conclusion As DOGE holders regain confidence in the Dogecoin price, Unilabs (UNIL) is shifting the spotlight to its next-generation DeFi asset management system. With over $30.8 million in AUM, this investment protocol is positioned to lead most investment platforms in the upcoming sessions. So far, Unilabs has raised over $800,000 in its ongoing presale at $0.005 per token. You might also like: Why was Dogecoin up 8% on Wednesday? Dogecoin price analysis: Sluggish movement indicates losses Dogecoin (DOGE) experienced major volatility throughout May. After rallying near the $0.26 range in early May, the Dogecoin price slumped to $0.21–$0.22 by mid-month. Currently, DOGE holds a key support zone between $0.21 and $0.21, with notable rebounds backed by high trading volume. This sentiment indicates active buying interest at this level. The $0.21 mark is seen as a critical threshold; a breakdown below this level could trigger further downside in the Dogecoin price and push it toward $0.20. On the upside, DOGE would need to break through resistance levels at $0.22 and $0.23 to re-establish a bullish trend. A sustained move above $0.23 could help the Dogecoin price make a comeback and reinforce a recovery. According to technical data, the next Dogecoin price key support levels are at approximately $0.21 and $0.20, while the $0.23–$0.24 area stands out as a significant resistance zone to watch. The daily chart also shows the formation of a “bull flag” pattern for DOGE, which typically suggests a continuation of the prior uptrend. Memecoin enthusiasts flock to Unilabs for 100x opportunity While the Dogecoin price performance hints at a reversal in the near term, Unilabs is leading an optimistic narrative among the broader investor community. This new AI entrant is gaining recognition for its cutting-edge fundamentals and AI-backed trading analysis that deliver explosive gains and top-notch crypto projects before they hit the market. Unilabs defies market trends and investment norms with the modern-gen AI technology that takes DeFi asset management to a whole new level. With the platform’s creative AI integration, investors and retail traders no longer have to hunt the crypto market for a breakthrough project, just put Unilabs in charge, sit back, and relax. Future outlook for DOGE hints at a rebound soon If confirmed by strong buying momentum, the current technical setup could propel the Dogecoin price toward a target around $0.35. As for momentum indicators, both the RSI and MACD are showing neutral to mildly bullish signals. The 14-day RSI is hovering around 55, close to neutral territory, and not indicating any clear overbought or oversold conditions for DOGE. Meanwhile, the MACD line on the daily chart formed a bullish crossover in mid-May, echoing patterns seen before previous DOGE breakouts. The altcoin’s current trading volume is still up, particularly during retests of the $0.21–$0.22 support area, suggesting that investors’ dip-buying activity is still on full throttle. Dogecoin’s on-chain data further reinforces the technical analysis, supporting a bullish outlook. Whale wallets holding large amounts of DOGE have shown a massive buying trend in recent weeks. In April and May 2025 alone, these whale addresses collectively purchased over 1 billion DOGE, bringing their total holdings to roughly 25.97 billion DOGE coins. Can Unilabs beat Dogecoin’s 2018 breakout? Dogecoin may have shown a recovery in its price trend lately, but Unilabs has got analysts talking about it. The main reason behind the buzz is its explosive presale debut, which raised over $800,000 before the estimated time, and is projected to land an even stronger rally in the upcoming trading sessions. The platform’s investment protocol makes it the world’s first AI-powered DeFi asset manager with up to 2,000 weekly signups on the platform. As most memecoin lovers add UNIL to their portfolios, this $0.005 is poised to show a breakout bigger than Dogecoin’s 2018 cycle that marked its all-time high. Conclusion While most memecoin buyers are rejoining Dogecoin for better gains, AI enthusiasts are joining Unilabs for up to 100x opportunities with its AI-powered Launchpad.

Ethereum (ETH), continues to dominate the DeFi and NFT sectors. Cardano (ADA), now trading near $0.74, remains a solid choice due to its peer-reviewed tech and real-world partnerships in education and healthcare. Ripple’s XRP is gaining traction again as cross-border payments go mainstream, especially following positive regulatory momentum. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL), stands out for its blazing speed and expanding dApp ecosystem. For those eyeing high upside potential with lower entry costs, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the rising coin poised to ride this utility-driven rally. Already in the fifth phase of presale, this fast-rising altcoin is priced at $0.03 and has already seen $9.1 million worth of funding. As the price is set to increase to $0.035 in the next stage, more than 11000 investors already have their positions ahead of a 16.67% price increase. Utility Giants Poised for Growth: ETH, ADA, XRP, and SOL in 2025 As the next crypto bull cycle approaches, some of the best cryptocurrencies to buy right now are those with proven utility and long-term thought. Ethereum (ETH) at about $2,496 is still the basis for decentralized finance, and it is predicted to be as much as $10,000 by the year 2025 because of constant upgrades and institutional investor uptake. Cardano (ADA) trading at about $0.74 is known for its academic approach and real-world applications in regions like Africa, where blockchain technology solves the problems of identity and access to money. XRP trading at $2.35 keeps expanding its footprints within the field of cross-border payments, especially with growing legal clarity boosting investor morale. In the meantime, Solana (SOL) is cheering around $166 on speedster transactions and growing DeFi universe, with price targets reaching for the $1,000 handle if the uptrend holds. While these behemoths are out in front on fundamentals, upstart low-price coin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are becoming increasingly popular for asymmetrical upside. A DeFi Powerhouse Gaining Traction Mutuum Finance is withdrawing from mainstream lenders by using a dual-lending structure, leading to its fast adoption rate. There are more than 11,000 investors supporting MUTM by investing $9.1 million during the presale. Phase 5 of the offering has brought Mutuum Finance to $0.03 and with Phase 6 about to happen, investors in this stage can expect big gains. Because of its unique loan systems and popularity among traders, experts predict that the token will reach a value over $5 after launch at a price of $0.06. Reshaping DeFi Lending with a Dual-Model Approach Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing DeFi lending by integrating Peer-to-Contract (P2C) as well as Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. Through the P2C model, customers can gain passive income by being part of USDT liquidity pools while having smart contract-based automatic lending. P2P method provides direct lending where customers are able to do business without the involvement of intermediaries and remain in full possession of their capital. A Secure and Trustworthy Financial Ecosystem In addition to supporting its ecosystem, Mutuum Finance will also introduce a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike algorithmic stablecoins, this token is over-collateralized, minimizing risks and offering long-term stability.

With Chainlink steady and XRP whales accumulating, institutional and retail investors are zeroing in on MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Bitcoin as the top contenders to watch for Q3 2025’s breakout. CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Moves, 50% Bonus, and Early-Stage Surge MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming 2025’s most-watched presale, with over $8 million raised and a record-setting 72.95 ETH whale buy marking the largest early-stage purchase of the year. The project’s capped supply, HashEx audit, and scarcity-driven tokenomics are driving unprecedented demand. Early buyers can still use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% bonus, making MAGA even more attractive for those seeking exponential upside. Analysts are projecting 25x–35x returns, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% if momentum continues. As Stage 8 nears completion, smart money is positioning ahead of listings, recognizing MAGACOIN FINANCE as a rare ground-floor opportunity before price discovery goes public. Bitcoin (BTC): Bullish Structure and Institutional Support Bitcoin is trading in the $110,000–$115,000 range, with technicals showing strong bullish momentum and support at $110K. The breakout above April’s highs has ended a long consolidation, and BTC is now in price discovery mode. Institutional inflows remain robust, and as long as BTC holds above $110K, analysts expect a push toward $112K–$115K in the coming sessions. This steady foundation is prompting investors to rotate some capital into higher-upside plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Whale Accumulation and Bullish Sentiment XRP is consolidating near $2.42, with recent whale transactions totaling over $300 million signaling confidence in the token’s future. The number of large XRP wallets has surged, reflecting growing influence from major investors. Analysts forecast a move toward $2.80–$3.40 in the coming weeks, with some bullish scenarios targeting $5.50 by year-end if momentum persists. As XRP holders seek sharper upside, many are reallocating to early-stage opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana (SOL) and Chainlink (LINK): Steady, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight Solana is trading between $158 and $175, consolidating after a recent high near $183, with technicals suggesting a potential breakout if resistance is cleared. Chainlink remains steady, with price forecasts between $10.32 and $16.47 for 2025. However, both are being outpaced in sentiment and capital flows by the explosive momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW Conclusion With Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana providing stability, the most dramatic growth potential is now unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE. As Stage 8 nears completion and the 50% PATRIOT50X bonus remains, this may be the last low-entry window before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. For those seeking the next breakout, MAGA is the name to watch for Q3 2025.

The company said that after Solana broke the resistance area at $159, it quickly rose to $188 and is currently entering a sideways consolidation period just below that area. According to MakroVision, Solana clearly broke out of a long-standing downtrend and subsequently displayed a strong bullish structure by forming higher lows and higher highs. According to the analysis, the current sideways movement is seen as a natural and constructive pause after the previous strong rally. Analysts list the key support levels to watch in the short term as follows: $159: It stands out as a short-term support level and there has been a reaction from this level before. $153: Coincides with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level and should be watched for possible reversals. $142: Key level that needs to be defended for Solana to maintain its bullish structure. MakroVision notes that if Solana achieves a sustained break above the $188 level, the price could gain new momentum towards the $204 and then $223 levels. On the other hand, the short-term technical outlook is thought to remain positive as long as the price stays above the $153 level. According to MakroVision’s assessment, Solana is in a healthy consolidation phase after its strong rally. This sideways movement could pave the way for a continuation of the uptrend, while a break above the $188 level could give the market new momentum. *This is not investment advice.

Token utility is the phrase we use to describe what a token actually does, and therefore the main reason why it’s worth having. The basic premise is that the more utility a token has, the more valuable it should be. So a token that allows you to do lots of different things, or obtain various benefits, is likely to be worth more than one that lacks any real utility. With that in mind, the decentralized computing infrastructure startup iExec has unveiled a masterplan to turbocharge the utility of its native RLC token . It came via a string of new updates delivered throughout last week’s Tokenomics Week event. It wasn’t a physical event per se, but rather a series of announcements on X that explore what iExec is doing to boost the utility of RLC in its ecosystem, as it strives to build a more productive, circular token economy where value flows to every participant. 5 days. 5 new ways to use & earn $RLC . Make sure you’re watching. — iExec RLC (@iEx_ec) May 19, 2025 What is iExec? In case you’re not familiar with iExec, it can be thought of as an alternative to public cloud computing infrastructure giants like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Its primary customers are developers, who can pay to access its blockchain-powered computing resources, including servers, virtual machines, GPUs and storage, or whatever else it is they need, at much lower costs. To pay for those services, you’ll need RLC tokens, which act as the primary currency within its economy. The major difference between iExec and the likes of AWS is that its infrastructure is fully decentralized, meaning that the company doesn’t own any of the hardware it rents out. Instead, those resources are owned by the broader iExec community, which can earn rewards for providing idle computing power and unused storage to the network. It’s this unique business model that enables iExec to offer computing services at much lower costs than the usual cloud suspects. Another differentiator between iExec and Amazon et al is that its infrastructure is optimized especially for blockchain developers building decentralized applications. What Happened in iExec’s Tokenomics Week? The week-long event was nothing short of a bonanza for RLC token holders, with a series of high-impact announcements and initiatives being launched that are designed to transform the role of its native token. The idea is to amplify the role of RLC and put it at the forefront of iExec’s decentralized economy by increasing demand for the asset. For iExec, the best way to do that is to give every participant the opportunity to profit. Tokenomics Week kicked off with the simple announcement that more RLC has entered circulation , increasing liquidity within the ecosystem and eliminating the chances of any nasty surprises for token holders later on down the line. RLC has a fixed supply of 86 million tokens and the vast majority of them have already been distributed among the community to minimize the chances of any inflation occurring, reducing risk to the economy. The big news started on day two, when iExec revealed its new voucher scheme for application builders, designed as a way to simplify access to its infrastructure. So instead of buying tokens, which can be complicated to manage, users can instead buy a voucher, which gives them access to a guaranteed amount of computing resources with more predictable costs. What’s more, iExec says it’s giving away some of the vouchers for free to those projects that are still building and yet to release a final product. Only once they’ve got their project up and running and start generating real revenue will they need to acquire an Earn voucher, which gives them access to round-the-clock support and various other perks, such as the chance to talk to investors and so on. Tokenomics Announcement 2: The iExec VoucherFrom a dev’s first line of code to every time a user runs the app, $RLC circulates.This is how devs should interact with utility tokens. pic.twitter.com/R1UZ7MFweb — iExec RLC (@iEx_ec) May 20, 2025 The excitement mounted further one day later with iExec’s new revenue sharing model , which is linked to the voucher model. The way it works is that fees from voucher sales are redirected back into the iExec ecosystem in the shape of rewards distributed proportionally to builders and application users. So the more app users acquired by a builder, the greater the amount of RLC rewards they’ll be entitled to. The same goes for users, who can increase their rewards by engaging with iExec-based applications more often. The basic idea is to incentivize both usage and development, encouraging long-term adoption of iExec’s infrastructure. Tokenomics Announcement 3: $RLC Revenue SharingBuilders use RLC. Users engage with apps. Revenue flows back through the ecosystem.This is how a circular token economy is built. pic.twitter.com/Bfui8We00P — iExec RLC (@iEx_ec) May 21, 2025 RLC token holders will also get more utility in the shape of a new staking initiative that’s linked to one of iExec’s existing incentive programs, known as the Privacy Pass. By acquiring a Privacy Pass, users can sign up to receive marketing emails – which are delivered to their inbox without revealing their address to the marketer. For each email viewed, the user can earn a small amount of RLC as a reward. On day four, iExec revealed it’s extending this program, offering boosted rewards for some campaigns, with the exact amount determined by how many RLC is currently held in your wallet. The basic gist is that, the more RCL you hold, the more rewards you’re entitled to. Tokenomics Announcement 4: $RLC StakingThe more RLC you hold, the greater your rewards across the ecosystem.We're starting with a new mechanism for the iExec Privacy Pass. pic.twitter.com/WbHrUlht3V — iExec RLC (@iEx_ec) May 22, 2025 Last but not least, iExec wrapped things up with the launch of a new incentive program for builders that’s meant to encourage the development of privacy-focused applications. Success will be measured by the amount of sensitive data each application protects, meaning that those with more users should be entitled to greater rewards. As privacy is one of the major principles of iExec’s decentralized infrastructure, it makes a lot of sense to incentivize builders to protect user’s information. Tokenomics Announcement 5: Builder IncentivesEarnings scale with your impact. The more your project contributes to the iExec ecosystem, the more $RLC you unlock. pic.twitter.com/sBglyoCEjO — iExec RLC (@iEx_ec) May 23, 2025 What’s Next For iExec? To be honest, there weren’t any real surprises in iExec’s Tokenomics Week, as anyone following the project will have already been well acquainted with its plans. Many of the initiatives were outlined earlier this year when it published its 2025 roadmap , but it’s one thing to announce things, and quite another to actually get them done. iExec gets quite a bit of kudos for moving so fast. iExec is keen to expand the utility of RLC in order to boost adoption of its decentralized infrastructure, and in line with that it has also been making efforts to increase the token’s accessibility. Its roadmap calls for RLC to be listed on many more platforms, including both centralized and decentralized exchanges, and with the basic tokenomics structure now mapped out, we can look forward to seeing some new listings imminently. At the same time, there’s every reason to think we’ll see many more projects taking advantage of iExec’s infrastructure, which is designed for use cases including AI, confidential computing and DePIN. Earlier this year, it announced the creation of a new 1 million RLC developer fund to support early stage builders, and it shouldn’t be long before we start to see the fruits of that investment coming into bloom.

Just when the world thought XRP was free to roam, it turns out that the settlement with the SEC was a no-go . The XRP price prediction has suffered because of it and now investors are looking for alternatives to invest in. Hyperliquid is doing some interesting things and Sam Altman’s Worldcoin is back in the news. Could these tokens deliver on investment promises XRP could not keep? Maybe. But for a more definitive answer, Remittix makes a strong case. Hyperliquid (HYPE): Speed demon makes its mark The biggest challenge to making crypto fully transactional is speed. Transactions on older chains can take forever to clear, with Ethereum sometimes taking days, let alone hours. In steps Hyperliquid, a relatively new chain which only went live in December and is already at number 11 by market capitalization. Hyperliquid is currently in a massive upsurge, pushing its ATH further upwards by the hour. Hyperliquid is expected to lose a bit of momentum but to climb to $50 by the end of next year and from there, to continue going higher. Hyperliquid is definitely one for the books. Source: CoinCodex Worldcoin (WLD): Altman’s utopian vision gets cash injection Worldcoin is back in the spotlight after raising $135 million from a16z and Bain Capital Crypto, pushing its eyeball-scanning tech into the U.S. market. Sam Altman’s grand vision, a global digital identity system to separate humans from bots, now includes shiny new Orb Minis, rolling out in cities like LA and San Francisco. The Worldcoin token surged on the news, hitting $1.53 with bullish eyes on $2. But the biometric utopia isn’t without backlash: regulators in Spain, Portugal and Indonesia have already hit pause on Worldcoin over privacy concerns. Still, with over 26 million sign-ups, Worldcoin could be something for investors to keep a keen eye on. A word of caution, though. Even at the elevated price, Worldcoin is still well below its launch ATH of $11.78 and will have a ways to go before reaching the March 2024 high, but it would not be prudent to bet against Sam Altman’s capacity to create wealth. Source: CoinCodex Remittix (RTX): XRP alternative heads for the big leagues. XRP was supposed to make cross-border payments easy, but thanks to spending more than a decade in the development of promises of what was to come and then years spent handcuffed by the SEC, XRP failed to deliver. But thankfully, Remittix is here to pick up where XRP left off. Remittix is a PayFi platform that allows users to use cryptocurrency to make direct-to-fiat bank transfers. With Remittix, global payments are quick, painless, hassle-free and, above all, cheap. This is the biggest news in cryptocurrency since Bitcoin itself because, with Remittix, crypto can be used as a payment system. This democratizes global payments and lubricates the wheels of trade and industry. And, what’s more, it gives the world’s unbanked the capacity to participate in a growing economy. Remittix stands for more than what it can do for investors, but what it can do to truly set the markets free. Conclusion XRP’s prospects are as flat as a pancake, and investors will not be blamed for seeking greener pastures in coins with higher growth potential. Hyperliquid has already made a name for itself and Worldcoin is now back with a vengeance and both of these are projects to consider. The dark horse winner, though, is Remittix . It is already easing the administrative and financial strain of cross-border payments. With over $15.3 million in liquidity and a strong following on YouTube, Remittix is signaling its intent to be one of the big guns. Remittix is now available at $0.0781 directly from their website.

The recent price action hints at potential corrective consolidation toward the $2.2K threshold, before attempting a breakout. Technical Analysis The Daily Chart ETH has encountered strong resistance at the crucial 200-day moving average around $2.7K over the past week, reflecting a significant seller presence at this psychological level. The asset has lost upward momentum and is currently displaying a double-top formation—a classic bearish reversal pattern. This structure signals increased profit-taking and distribution, suggesting a probable short-term corrective phase targeting the $2.2K support zone. This retracement phase could serve as a healthy reset, attracting new demand at lower levels and providing the necessary momentum for a fresh breakout above the $2.7K resistance. Structurally, Ethereum remains confined between the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, setting the stage for a potential bullish breakout in the coming weeks. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Ethereum’s weakening bullish momentum is reflected in its price action within an ascending wedge, a bearish reversal pattern. This formation often signals diminishing buyer strength and increased seller dominance. Additionally, a clear bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator confirms this outlook, pointing to aggressive distribution near the current resistance. If ETH breaks below the wedge’s lower boundary near $2.4K, a pullback toward the $2.2K level becomes the most likely scenario. However, an unexpected breakout above the wedge could trigger a short squeeze, fueling a renewed rally toward higher resistance levels. Onchain Analysis Ethereum continues to hover below a critical resistance range, keeping investors on edge about the likelihood of a bullish breakout. While price action alone has provided mixed signals, insights from the futures market shed light on underlying sentiment shifts that could shape the asset’s next major move. One of the most telling indicators is the ETH Taker Buy-Sell Ratio, which measures whether aggressive market orders are dominated by buyers or sellers. Aggressive orders, those executed at market price, typically reflect urgency and strong conviction from market participants. Recently, this ratio’s 14-day moving average has seen a notable decline, pointing to increased aggressive selling activity. This trend suggests that bears are regaining control, triggering a wave of profit-taking and distribution as Ethereum struggles near resistance. If the selling pressure persists and the ratio continues trending downward, Ethereum could undergo a deeper correction, with the $2.2K support emerging as a likely target. However, if this aggressive selling is primarily driven by short-term players or “weak hands,” it could represent a healthy consolidation phase before a broader bullish breakout resumes. In short, Ethereum’s next direction hinges on whether the current selling momentum intensifies or exhausts, in the face of growing mid-term demand.

Many people online are speculating that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might soon approve several XRP spot ETF applications. Big companies like Bitwise, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, and 21Shares have already submitted their applications, and some important decision dates are coming up soon. The first major date to watch is June 17, 2025, when the SEC is expected to make a decision on Franklin Templeton’s spot XRP ETF application. Other decisions are also lined up — Grayscale’s deadline was May 21, 2025 and Bitwise is waiting for a decision on May 25, 2025. The crypto community is keeping a close eye on these dates because if any of these get approved, it could give a big push to XRP’s price and popularity. At the same time, another rumor is doing the rounds. Some people believe that the SEC and Ripple have already quietly settled their long-running legal battle, and they’re just waiting for the judge to approve it. But former SEC attorney Marc Fagel has cleared things up. He said that the judge actually rejected the request from both Ripple and the SEC. It’s not actually settled. The parties may have entered an agreement, but implementing the settlement requires court action. And the court indicated it would not simply do what the parties asked without further briefing. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) May 24, 2025 According to Fagel, while both sides may have agreed on a deal, it’s not official yet. The court wants them to explain why it should change the decision it had already made. He added, “It’s not actually settled. The parties may have entered an agreement, but implementing the settlement requires court action. And the court indicated it would not simply do what the parties asked without further briefing.” In short — both the XRP ETF decisions and the Ripple lawsuit situation are still up in the air.

According to the authorities, the hackers stole tons of company data and demanded a ransom of about Rs. 4.5 lakh (approximately $5,283) in Bitcoins. According to the police, the hackers, upon gaining access and stealing the data, threatened to delete the important ones if the company refused to comply with their ransom demands. This move is defined as ransomware, where hackers or malicious entities gain access to a system or important information and threaten to delete it if the victims do not comply with payments. Over the years, there has been a series of ransomware cases, involving even entities with the most sophisticated security. Hackers demand Bitcoin to return the company’s sensitive data According to the authorities, the issue came to light on May 3, after the company’s staff started encountering issues while logging into its servers. The police mentioned that after gaining access to the servers using the “forgot password” option, they realized that a lot of data was missing. The company proceeded to hire third-party IT contractors to look into the issue, and it was then that they found a note from the hackers detailing their activities. According to the police, the hackers left a note in the form of a text file for the company on their server, which stated that they were able to carry out the activity because the company lacked better security measures. They also added that the company would have to pay a big ransom in order to protect their files and not have them damaged beyond repairs. The text file also mentioned that the hackers would completely damage the stolen data should the company make any attempt to either recover them or delete files on its server. The hackers added that if the company refused to comply with their demands and pay the ransom soon, they would either delete the stolen data or leak it online. Finally, they said it was a one-time deal, adding that they could even go ahead to give the company tips on how to strengthen its security after the ransom is paid. Police to charge suspects as global crypto-related crimes rise According to the police, when the advertising agency enlisted the services of a cyber security expert to look into the issue, they submitted a report saying that the hackers had used the Brute Force Attack method to gain access into their server. The cyber security firm mentioned that the hacker used trial and error methods until they were in the company’s servers. The police mentioned that they received a complaint from 33-year-old Pranay Ramaiyaa, who is a resident of Thane and an employee of the advertising agency. The police have also proceeded to register a case against the unknown suspects, charging them under sections 43 (penalty and compensation for damage to the computer, computer system, etc.), 65 (tampering with computer source documents), and 66 (computer-related offenses) of the Information Technology Act and under sections 308 (extortion) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. Meanwhile, this is not the first case of ransom demands related to digital assets over the last few months, with criminal elements now upping their activities, targeting influential entities in the sector. For instance, some months ago, the father of a crypto millionaire was kidnapped, with his son urged to pay ransom in digital assets or else they would kill him. The criminals even went ahead to mutilate the man, using it as a pressure tactic to force his son to pay the ransom. Another incident that happened recently was that of crypto investor John Woeltz, who kidnapped and tied up a tourist for weeks, forcing him to give up the passwords to his account. The tourist, who coincidentally was a long-time business partner of the suspect, said the assailant inflicted many wounds on him and took pictures of it to either blackmail him into giving up his assets or scare his family into paying a ransom.

The move is part of a broader digital transformation plan spearheaded by the Pakistan Crypto Council and backed by the Ministry of Finance, according to a May 25 report by local news outlet 24NewsHD TV Channel. In the first phase, the government plans to channel excess power into AI infrastructure and crypto mining operations. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the decision is expected to attract billions in foreign investment while generating high-tech employment across the country. The initiative’s second phase will introduce access to renewable energy for mining operations, aiming to balance growth with environmental responsibility.

Officials confirmed that multiple foreign delegations have visited Pakistan in recent months to explore potential partnerships. To further incentivize investment, the Ministry of Finance announced a package of tax incentives for AI centers and duty exemptions for Bitcoin miners. Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of Pakistan’s Crypto Council, reportedly welcomed the development, calling it a “turning point” for the country’s digital economy. Saqib claimed that with clear regulations and a transparent framework, Pakistan could emerge as a significant player in the global crypto and AI sectors. Saqib first proposed using the country’s runoff energy to fuel Bitcoin mining at the Crypto Council’s inaugural meeting on March 21. The meeting included lawmakers, the Bank of Pakistan’s governor, the chairman of Pakistan’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SECP), and the federal information technology secretary.

The PDAA will also be tasked with tokenizing national assets and government debt, facilitating monetization of Pakistan’s surplus electricity through regulated Bitcoin mining , and helping startups build blockchain-based solutions at scale.

The Human Rights Foundation (HRF), which hosts the annual summit for individual freedoms and human rights, confirmed Durov will address remotely by livestream instead. It’s unfortunate the French courts would disallow Mr. Durov from joining a platform where his voice is so needed,” said HRF founder and CEO Thor Halvorssen. Durov, who has long spoken about digital freedom of speech, has been a vocal figure in the crypto and technology space because he refused to succumb to censorship demands from authoritarian regimes. Durov Accuses French Censorship Request Before Romanian Elections The travel ban follows disputed claims by Durov of being threatened by French spies to censor rightwing voices on Telegram. Durov, in a May 18 telegram post, accused Nicolas Lerner, head of France’s General Directorate for Internal Security (DGSI), of asking him to ban political voices related to Romania’s upcoming presidential elections. The meeting took place at Paris’s Hôtel de Crillon, where Lerner supposedly requested moderation of speech that was conservative-leaning, stated Durov. “You can’t ‘defend democracy’ by destroying democracy,” Durov replied with rejection of the request. He went on to tweet on X that Telegram would not begin censoring when it rejected demands to do so in Russia, Iran, or Belarus. Telegram’s Unwavering Stand on Free Speech Durov reaffirmed Telegram will never succumb to political pressure to censor and would sooner leave a market than sacrifice its very foundations. Calling the request a blatant violation of human rights, Durov maintains freedom of expression must be safeguarded everywhere—not on an ad hoc basis based on politics. The HRF and other digital rights organizations view the travel block as one of many signs of growing tensions between states and technology platforms about information control.",Blockchain,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-05-25 09:48:56

As Memorial Day approaches this Monday, thin liquidity in the crypto market is raising questions about potential price moves. Could a post-holiday dip push ETH down toward $2,300, or will it find support to hold current levels? ETF Flows Show Renewed Optimism; Ethereum Supported? May 23 was a big day for crypto ETFs. Bitcoin ETFs saw $211M in inflows, Ethereum ETFs $58.63M. 22,000 ETH were bought, so institutional investors are still paying attention. Bitcoin ETFs : $211.74M in inflows , 1,900 BTC added. Ethereum ETFs : $58.63M invested, 22,000 ETH added. https://twitter.com/PushpendraTech/status/1926294065248657446 These flows show ETH is back in favor. The renewed interest is likely due to recent regulatory clarity, improving macro and network upgrades. Ethereum Technical Analysis: Caution on Key Levels On the 2-hour chart, ETH has broken the trendline and is stuck below the 50-period EMA at $2,555 which is now resistance. Given the bearish breakout of an upward trendline at around $2,500 area, the Ethereum price prediction remains bearish. Candlestick patterns at $2,523 are showing hesitation and the widening MACD histogram is bearish momentum. Key levels to watch: Support : $2,378, $2,272, $2,172. Resistance : $2,555, $2,626. Indicators : Bearish MACD, EMA acting as resistance, trendline break is bearish. For traders, patience is key. A confirmed break below $2,378 could mean more downside until $2,300. Above $2,555 and we could see a rally back to $2,800. Will Memorial Day Liquidity Cause a Ethereum Price Squeeze? With volume likely to be thin over the long weekend, ETH could see bigger moves. If ETF flows continue and sentiment stays positive, we could see a break above resistance. But if the market is hesitant, we may see ETH test lower support early next week. BTC Bull Token Nears $7.33M Cap as 65% APY Staking Draws Interest With ETH/USD falling below $2,500, attention is shifting to altcoins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . So far, $6.33 million has been raised out of a $7.33 million cap. The presale is closing in on its limit, next presale price jump closes in fast. Bitcoin Rewards and Supply Reductions BTC Bull Token operates with a built-in system: the higher Bitcoin’s price, the more BTC airdrops are distributed to token holders. Notably, presale participants receive priority. The system also features: Token burns every $50K BTC increase, reducing supply. Current token price at $0.00253 before the next bump. This approach aligns token value with Bitcoin’s price moves while maintaining scarcity through programmed burns. Staking Terms for Passive Returns BTCBULL’s staking pool holds 1.62 billion tokens offering 65% APY, with: No lockup periods or fees. Full access to funds at any time. This structure appeals to holders looking for yield without complex requirements or risk of illiquidity. Momentum Before the Cap Fills With just over $1 million remaining in the presale, buyers are positioning early. The token’s mechanics of Bitcoin-tied rewards, supply adjustments, and staking options are driving participation. Key figures: USDT raised : $6,329,314.26 / $7,332,195 Token price : $0.00253 BTCBULL offers a whopping ~65% APY on its Ethereum-based staking pool (currently holding 1.61B BTCBULL), with no lockups or withdrawal fees. That means passive yield — with full liquidity.

Yet, while these established assets anchor portfolios, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly registering the heaviest surge in community activity and presale demand—making it the most-watched early-stage contender for 2025. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: Breakout Presale, 50% Bonus, and Unmatched Community Growth MAGACOIN FINANCE is redefining early-stage momentum, with Stage 8 live and over $8 million raised as buy activity accelerates daily. The project’s scarcity-driven tokenomics—a capped 100 billion supply, HashEx audit, and viral narrative—are fueling unprecedented demand from both retail and institutional investors. A recent 72.95 ETH whale buy, valued at over $133,000, marks the largest early-stage purchase of 2025 and underscores growing institutional confidence. Early buyers can use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% bonus, making MAGA even more attractive for those seeking transformative gains. With Stage 8 nearly full and a $0.007 listing target, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now the go-to allocation for those seeking the next crypto supercycle winner before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. Ethereum (ETH): Steady Growth and Institutional Adoption Ethereum is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, with technicals pointing to a possible breakout above $2,700. Institutional adoption and ongoing upgrades continue to support ETH’s long-term outlook, but its near-term upside is now more measured compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana (SOL): Positive Trend and Ecosystem Expansion Solana is trading between $158 and $175, with analysts watching for a breakout above $175 to retest $183. The network’s high throughput, low fees, and expanding DeFi ecosystem are attracting both users and developers. While Solana’s growth is robust, its upside is steadier than the presale-driven surge of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin (BTC): Market Anchor and Steady Inflows Bitcoin is holding above $110,000, with forecasts suggesting a range of $111,000–$115,000 for late May and potential highs of $140,000 if bullish momentum continues. While BTC remains the market’s anchor, its upside is now more measured—making MAGACOIN FINANCE the clear destination for investors targeting higher-growth opportunities. Stellar Lumens (XLM): Quiet Strength, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Stellar is projected to trade between $0.65 and $0.80 in 2025, with technicals and institutional interest supporting long-term gains. While XLM’s fundamentals are strong, its near-term upside is less dramatic than the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which continues to set the standard for early-stage excitement. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF Conclusion Ethereum and Solana’s steady advances are noteworthy, but the heaviest community surge and most dramatic growth potential are now unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 40x ROI, MAGA stands as the breakout contender for 2025.

With a bold vision, real AI infrastructure, and early community momentum, Codename:Pepe isn’t just another token — it’s a contender. The blend of humor, data, and decentralized ambition positions it to become one of the Top 10 memecoins of this cycle. From meme to mainstream: Shiba Inu’s future potential Shiba Inu (SHIB) has gained 4.65% in the past week and 14.20% over the past month. This recent upward trend suggests growing interest in the token. Despite these gains, SHIB is still down 40.24% over the past six months. The current RSI of 55.34 indicates moderate buying pressure, which could support further price increases. The price is currently between $0.00001344 and $0.0000171, nearing the resistance level at $0.0000192. If SHIB breaks this resistance, it could see additional gains. The support level is at $0.00001188, which, if breached, may lead to a decline. Based on recent performance and RSI data, SHIB may rise toward the resistance level. Breaking above $0.0000192 could result in further percentage gains. However, the significant six-month decline shows volatility remains. The coming days will be crucial in determining SHIB’s price direction. Dogecoin gains 37% this month: What’s next? Dogecoin is currently trading between $0.21 and $0.25. Over the past week, its price has increased by 12.02%. In the past month, it has surged by 37.00%. However, over the last six months, the price has decreased by 42.97%. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 55.52, indicating neutral momentum. This suggests there may be room for further price appreciation before reaching overbought levels. Dogecoin’s nearest resistance level is at $0.28. If the price climbs to this point from the current range, it could see gains of up to 33%. The nearest support is at $0.19. A drop to this level would represent a decrease of up to 24%. Given the recent positive momentum, Dogecoin may continue its upward trend toward the resistance level. A break above $0.28 could signal further growth. Traders are watching these key levels closely to see where the price heads next. Conclusion Recent price swings in SHIB and DOGE suggest limited potential for significant short-term gains. These cryptocurrencies may not offer the rapid returns that investors are seeking in the current bullish market. In contrast, Codename:Pepe crypto introduces true intelligence aimed at maximizing profits. By leveraging advanced AI to analyze trends and execute trades, it presents a promising opportunity for investors looking for substantial growth beyond traditional memecoins.

It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by January 2027. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support for this meme coin can push it to $1 by 2029. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 2,849.48 DOGE in May; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading above its average price of the last two years. Currently, the coin is following a downward pattern since it peaked at $0.414 on January 17, 2025, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.37 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial.

By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955.

In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February.

33767162,[object Object],1748167245,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,VanEck Exec Slams SEC For Delay On Bitcoin ETF Options – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/vaneck-slams-sec-for-delay-on-bitcoin-etf-options/,"Matthew Sigel, the head of digital assets research at VanEck, has criticized the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over a delayed response on a proposal to list options trading on the firm’s Bitcoin Spot ETF. Notably, the Commission has continued to issue delayed responses to all recent digital asset-related ETF proposals/amendments despite a crypto-friendly policy of the Donald Trump Administration. SEC Delay Is Frustrating, Offers No Feedback, VanEck’s Sigel Says On April 3, 2025, the Chicago Board of Exchange (Cboe) filed a proposed rule change to list options trading on the VanEck Bitcoin ETF (HODL). For context, options trading grants investors the right to buy and sell an asset at a specific price before a certain date. Following the resounding success of the US Bitcoin Spot ETFs, options trading became a potential mode of market expansion, with several asset managers submitting applications to offer options to their respective ETFs. Notably, the SEC has granted approval for this request for multiple Bitcoin ETFs, including the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC), and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), among others. However, following the initial 45-day review, the Commission has delayed a response on Cboe’s proposal to list trading options on the VanEck Bitcoin ETF (HODL). In an X post on May 23, Matthew Sigel strongly criticized this decision, which he described as “frustrating” and offered no transparency to investors. While tagging Hester Pierce, the Head of the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, Sigel complained that the Commission had issued a delayed response while offering no comments or feedback along with this decision. The VanEck Exec explained the asset manager’s objection to this development while responding to a user comment. He said. This was the first decision date, so it has not been rejected, just delayed, even though the SEC’s initial comments were addressed. It’s the lack of any feedback that is particularly irksome… It is highly worth noting that delayed responses by the SEC have been quite a common response for digital assets ETF-related proposals. The Commission can choose to wait till the final decision deadline, i.e., 240 days after the application, as seen with the Bitcoin Spot ETFs in 2024. However, Sigel’s concerns stem from an absence of an explanation on this delayed ruling, especially considering that options trading has been approved for certain other Bitcoin Spot ETFs. Bitcoin Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $108,349, reflecting gains of 5.23% and 17.71% in the past seven and 30 days, respectively.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin Spot ETFs|Hester Pierce|Matthew Sigel|options trading|SEC|vaneck|VanEck Bitcoin ETF,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-25 10:00:45

Despite this, the price exhibits slight bullish momentum, suggesting a potential consolidation at this level for the short term. Technical Analysis The Daily Chart Bitcoin has officially broken above its previous all-time high of $109K, establishing a new peak around the $112K region. This breakout underscores strong buyer interest and highlights the bullish sentiment that continues to fuel this cycle. However, the recent price action suggests that bullish momentum is softening, with BTC beginning a minor pullback toward the broken $109K level. This area now acts as a crucial support zone. If renewed demand materializes at this level, Bitcoin could resume its upward trajectory toward the $115K mark and potentially higher. Conversely, if selling pressure intensifies and the $109K level fails to hold, a deeper correction may unfold. In this scenario, a retest of the psychological $100K support becomes increasingly probable, potentially classifying the breakout as a bull trap, shaking investor confidence, and introducing volatility in the short term. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour chart, BTC maintains a bullish market structure, with a clear sequence of higher highs and higher lows. The price has consistently respected an ascending trendline, which remains a key dynamic support. Following the breakout, Bitcoin is currently retracing toward this trendline as well as the broken $109K swing high. This confluence zone will play a pivotal role in determining the next move. Should it hold, a renewed rally toward the $115K resistance zone becomes highly likely. However, if Bitcoin fails to hold this level and breaks below the trendline, it would signal short-term weakness, opening the door for a correction toward the $100K range. On-chain Analysis By ShayanMarkets While BTC has reached a new all-time high at $112K, a wave of profit-taking is naturally expected, particularly from short-term traders securing gains. However, a deeper look into on-chain metrics reveals a contrasting narrative among long-term holders, investors who have held BTC for over 150 days. The LTH-SOPR has remained relatively low during this rally, especially when compared to the levels seen during Bitcoin’s surge to $73K in late-2024. Despite the price now being significantly higher, long-term holders are not showing signs of major profit realization. This indicates ongoing accumulation behavior, reflecting confidence in higher future valuations. This divergence in behavior highlights that the current consolidation phase is likely driven by short-term holders and retail participants, rather than broader market distribution. If long-term holders continue to display conviction, Bitcoin is well-positioned to resume its uptrend following this short-term pause, with the potential to set new ATHs in the mid-term.
