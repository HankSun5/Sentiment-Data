Bitcoin (BTC) has reached new highs before retracing slightly, but investors’ interest in the flagship crypto keeps growing. Ethereum (ETH) has shown mild recovery. At the same time, more people are buying and selling NFTs. However, total sales are down. Bitcoin Reaches New High, Then Falls Bitcoin recently touched a new all-time high of $111,000 before slipping to $108,000. This drop is partly caused by market worries about a 50% tax increase on imports from the EU. Ethereum also rose to $2,700 this week but is now back to over $2,500, according to CoinMarketCap data. The total crypto market is now worth $3.42 trillion, which is higher than last week’s $3.29 trillion. This means more people are investing in crypto, even though NFT sales are slightly lower. NFT Sales Drop, But Participation is Rising. NFT sales dropped by 0.05% this week to $129.8 million. Ethereum is still the top NFT network with $29.6 million in sales, 26.22% less than last week. Wash trading also dropped to $2 million. Even with lower sales , more people are active in the NFT market. NFT buyers increased by 61.18% to 443,548. Sellers went up by 31.87% to 199,129. Total NFT trades also rose by 15.39% to 1,697,343. Avalanche and Polygon See Big Growth While Ethereum still leads in total NFT sales, Avalanche has taken second place with $22.3 million, a jump of 202.92%. Polygon is third with $21.3 million, growing by 45.98%. These chains are becoming strong players in the NFT space. Bitcoin NFTs fell to fourth place with $18.2 million, a 21.85% drop. Solana is now seventh, with $6.4 million in sales, a 26.36% decrease. Meanwhile, more people are buying NFTs on different chains. Avalanche had the most significant buyer growth at 79.08%, followed by Bitcoin at 72.98% and Solana at 71.09%. Furthermore, there has been a big shake-up in Non-Fungible Token collections. XSY Deposit on Avalanche is now the top NFT collection with $22.1 million in sales. However, most of this comes from just one buyer and seller. Courtyard on Polygon is second with $14.4 million in sales, up 23.23%. DMarket is third with $8.8 million, up by 7.07%. Bitcoin’s BRC-20 NFTs are now fourth with $6 million, dropping by 15.78%. Guild of Guardians Heroes is fifth with $5.9 million. CryptoPunks is sixth with $4.8 million in sales. It fell by 30.94%, as it now has fewer trades, fewer buyers, and fewer sellers than before.

This update enhances the network’s appeal for large-scale investors by streamlining infrastructure, increasing security, and enabling more efficient staking and withdrawals. While Ethereum strengthens its position as a blockchain leader, another innovative project is gaining traction in the blockchain and AI sector. Say hello to Ruvi AI, a cutting-edge platform that merges blockchain security with the intelligence of AI to tackle complex problems in today’s industries. Ruvi AI Redefines Blockchain Innovation Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,724.68 and has just released its Pectra upgrade which improves native staking for institutions. This makes the network more attractive for big players by simplifying infrastructure, increasing security and making staking and withdrawals more efficient. While Ethereum is strengthening its position as a blockchain leader another project is gaining traction in the blockchain and AI space. Say hello to Ruvi AI, a platform that combines blockchain security with AI to solve complex problems in today’s industries. Ruvi AI Redefines Blockchain Innovation Ruvi AI is going to disrupt healthcare, finance and logistics by combining the best of AI analytics with blockchain transparency. The goal is to create tools that make better decisions, simplify operations and drive real world impact. The Beta is live and users can access advanced tools for business workflows. Ruvi AI is listing on its first exchange and more to come. This means the platform is serious about getting its solutions out there and establishing itself in the tech world. Presale Success Means Confidence Ruvi AI has already captured the attention of early adopters through its presale. The Phase 1 presale was $0.01 per token and sold out in 2 weeks. Investors who got in early have already seen their token value increase by 50% as the price has risen to $0.015 in Phase 2. Analysts are bullish on Ruvi AI’s long term and many are projecting a $1 token soon after listing. This is a strong sign of confidence in Ruvi AI’s approach. Investment Opportunities Ruvi AI is offering presale bonuses for investors. Here’s what’s on offer: VIP 2 50,000 tokens during presale gets a 40% bonus and adds 20,000 tokens to total 70,000 tokens. This is a $750 investment at $0.015 per token. At listing price of $0.07 the investment would be worth $4,900 and if Ruvi AI reaches $1 per token the value would be $70,000. VIP 3 100,000 tokens gets a 60% bonus and adds 160,000 tokens. A $1,500 investment would be worth $11,200 at listing price of $0.07 and $160,000 if the token hits $1. VIP 5 500,000 tokens gets a 100% bonus and doubles to 1,000,000 tokens. At listing price of $0.07 this is $70,000 and at $1 per token it would be $1,000,000. Building a Community Ruvi AI’s roadmap is not just about technology; it’s about building a community of supporters and contributors. Through a leaderboard program the project rewards engagement: Top 10 contributors get 500,000 tokens each which would be worth $500,000 at $1. Top 50 contributors get 250,000 tokens which would be worth $250,000 at $1. Top 100 contributors get 100,000 tokens which would be worth $100,000 at $1. This encourages active participation and a collaborative ecosystem that benefits all. What’s Next Ruvi AI’s achievements so far show just how much it can shake up the intersection of blockchain and AI. That’s clear from its live Beta platform, its successful presale-and where it’s headed with those upcoming exchange listings. That makes it a project to watch in the tech innovation space. Right now, at $0.015, Ruvi AI is offering early supporters a pretty compelling reason to get in on the ground floor. With a confirmed listing price of $0.07 and the potential to reach $1 per token, the potential for growth is huge. Ethereum leads the way in blockchain advancements with updates like Pectra but Ruvi AI is showing how blockchain and AI can work together to create solutions that are both scalable and efficient.

While the world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, reached a new all-time high, LTC failed to capitalize on the injection of bullish momentum into the crypto market. However, a prominent crypto expert has come forward with a claim that Litecoin might be the most undervalued asset in the market at the moment. Interestingly, the altcoin’s price seems set to enjoy a period of strong bullish impetus over the next few months. Here’s Why LTC Price Could Be Set For An Extended Rally Chartered Market Technician Tony Severino has put forward an exciting prediction for the price trajectory of Litecoin in the coming months. According to the crypto expert, the digital asset could be preparing for an extended bull rally of at least 1,000% — and up to 2,000% — price growth. Related Reading: Traders Pile In: Bitcoin Open Interest Hits All-Time High As Price Nears $112K This bullish projection is based on the movement of the Stochastic Oscillator on the 3-month LTC price chart. The Stochastic Oscillator is an indicator used in technical analysis to gauge price momentum and pinpoint potential trend reversals. The indicator is usually represented by two lines: %K and %D. %K is a faster line while %D is a smoothed moving average of %K, and they both oscillate between 0 and 100. When the Stochastic Oscillator falls below 20, it implies an oversold market; while values above 80 often indicate an overbought market. According to Severino, the Litecoin 3-month Stochastic is approaching the 50 mark, which signals rising bullish sentiment for the altcoin’s price. The indicator failed the last time it attempted to cross this level in 2021. However, the successful breach of this 50 mark is still historically significant, as it has marked the start of substantial bull rallies in the past. For instance, the altcoin’s price grew by 4,900% when the Litecoin Stochastic crossed the level in 2017. Severino noted that it is highly unlikely for the price of Litecoin to surge by nearly 5,000% from its current level if the Stochastic Oscillator crosses the 50 level. Nevertheless, the market expert believes the asset’s price could rise by at least 1,000% and up to 2,000% by the end of 2026. Finally, Severino mentioned that the Litecoin price is in an interesting place, with the asset being one of the most undervalued crypto assets at the moment. Litecoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of LTC stands at around $96, reflecting an over 5% decline in the past 24 hours.

The event was held for holders of his meme coin, who collectively spent $148 million just to attend. Guests were promised access, luxury, and a moment with Trump. What they got instead was bad food, weak security, and a brief fly-by appearance from the president himself. According to CNBC , it was a night that left many attendees frustrated — and some outright angry. Among the 220 people who showed up were crypto figures like Sandy Carter from Unstoppable Domains and former NBA star Lamar Odom, who used the occasion to promote his own token, $ODOM. Trump showed up, said a few words, and left in a helicopter without greeting most of the room. One guest, 25-year-old Nicholas Pinto, said , “He didn’t talk to any of the 220 guests — maybe the top 25.” Pinto added that he had nothing to drink besides Trump-branded wine or water. “I don’t drink, so I had water. My glass was only filled once,” he said. As for the food? “The food sucked,” he said plainly. Guests ignored, wallets tracked, and complaints everywhere The top 25 wallets were promised a special reception and tour. But others like Pinto — who was driven there in a Lamborghini by his dad — left unimpressed and hungry. Trump only stayed 23 minutes, gave a quick speech recycling old crypto lines, then flew off without taking pictures or answering any questions. Pinto noticed that phones were not locked in RFID pouches and said security became an afterthought once Trump was gone. “Once Trump left, they didn’t really worry about anything else,” he said. Inside the ballroom, guests flaunted money. “Richard Mille watches weren’t even rare,” Pinto said. “I saw at least 16 people wearing them.” But he said the energy was off. “Lots of people didn’t even hold the coin anymore. They were checking their phones during dinner to see if the price moved.” Outside the gates, about 100 protesters gathered. One of them was Senator Jeff Merkley, who showed up to support a new bill with Chuck Schumer. The bill — called the End Crypto Corruption Act — aims to stop presidents and high officials from profiting off crypto ventures while in office. Protesters held signs saying “Crypto Corruption” and “Trump is a traitor.” Inside the event, the #1 holder of the $TRUMP coin was Justin Sun, the Chinese-born crypto billionaire. Justin holds over $22 million in the $TRUMP token and $75 million in World Liberty Financial’s token. He’s currently facing SEC fraud charges, although the case has been paused. Justin didn’t seem worried though. “As the top holder of $TRUMP and proud supporter of President Trump, it was an honor to attend the Trump Gala Dinner,” he posted. “Thank you @POTUS for your unwavering support of our industry!” The chaos around the dinner added fuel to what’s becoming a mess on Capitol Hill. Representative French Hill, a Republican from Arkansas, said the Trump family’s involvement in meme coins is “making his work in Congress harder.” Hill is one of the lawmakers behind the GENIUS Act, a bill designed to finally regulate stablecoins. But now, with Trump’s name tied to controversial tokens, he says the gala was “a distraction from the good work we need to do.” The GENIUS Act now faces a serious risk. Senator Josh Hawley added a clause that would limit credit card late fees, which banks hate. It’s now being called a poison pill that could kill support for the whole thing. While the gala was happening, Senate Democrats said they would push for new rules blocking US presidents and top officials from profiting off crypto — a direct challenge to USD1, a stablecoin linked to Trump and launched this spring. If the bill collapses, the damage could go global. JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Citi are reportedly in early discussions about building a US digital dollar. Their plan is to compete with Tether, which now dominates 60% of global crypto transactions. But those banks are waiting for legal clarity. If the GENIUS Act doesn’t pass, the US could lose momentum in the international crypto race.

Data from leading European alternative asset manager CoinShares revealed that inflows into Ethereum hit $205 million, marking a major increase from the previously reported $1.5 million. James Butterfill, a researcher at CoinShares , explained that the new development might be directly tied to Ethereum’s recent Pectra upgrade and the recent appointment of a new co-executive director as part of its leadership reshuffling process. “Ethereum was the standout performer, with US$205m in inflows last week and $575 million YTD, indicating renewed investor optimism following the successful Pectra upgrade and the appointment of new co-executive director Tomasz Stańczak,” The researcher wrote. Meanwhile, the broader cryptocurrency market saw inflows hit a staggering $785 million the previous week. The new metric, significantly topping outflows recorded earlier in the year, particularly between February and March, suggests that the market has been recovering steadily. Notably, year-to-date cryptocurrency inflows (YTD) have hit an impressive total of $7.5 billion. Despite the new figures marking a drop from last week’s total inflow of $882 million, the United States remarkably outperformed Hong Kong and Germany, which saw inflows totaling $24.2 million and $86.2 million, respectively. Acknowledging the mild decline in Bitcoin inflows recorded in the last week, CoinShare’s James Butterfill made the following assertion in the report: “Bitcoin attracted $557 million in inflows, a decrease from the prior week, likely due to continued hawkish signals from the US Federal Reserve. Short-bitcoin products saw a fourth consecutive week of inflows, totaling $5.8 million, reflecting investor positioning amid recent price gains.” With last week’s development reflecting five consecutive weeks of positive inflows, it remains to be seen how much the positive sentiment can grow and how much the current trend could influence price action for Bitcoin and altcoins alike.",Ethereum|News|Ethereum News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-24 21:04:41

However, according to the analyst, a key signal that a bearish formation is in play could be if the 21 exponential moving average (EMA) experiences a bearish cross with the 33 Simple moving average (SMA) on the weekly chart. “The top was in, and we’re heading into a bear market. Many will still believe we’re advancing, but that cross signals a major trend shift.” He asserted. Taking a step further, the analyst outlined key historical trends validating a potential bearish outcome for the altcoin. In May 2018 and November 2021, the crosses mentioned above were observed on the XRP chart, after which an 87% and 72% drop in price value was recorded. If the average cross movement is considered, the analyst sees the next major drop sending XRP down by 79.5% from the bearish cross point. Conversely, the analyst highlighted other bullish possibilities, stating that the aforementioned bullish patterns displayed in XRP’s technical chart could trigger another price rally for the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This anticipated bull run could send XRP way ahead of its $3.84 all-time high and instead place the asset at a never-before-seen price value of $27 . “Based on these bullish signals, I believe XRP could see another major pump—similar to the 1600% move—this time pushing us toward around $27 from the current level.” The analyst wrote. Despite recording a 5% decline in price value over the last week, XRP has managed to sustain momentum above $2.

With Ethereum and Avalanche also showing positive momentum amid recent news, the crypto market is heating up and Solana has hit $176, reflecting renewed confidence and setting the stage for a breakout summer—and MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the standout presale of 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Explosive Presale, 50% Bonus, and 9,800% Upside CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to dominate early-stage watchlists, with Stage 8 live and record buy volume as investors rush to secure positions before listings. The project’s scarcity-driven model, capped supply, and HashEx-audited contracts provide a secure foundation for growth. Analysts are forecasting up to 9,800% upside, with on-chain data showing skyrocketing wallet activity and repeat buyers signaling strong conviction in the project’s long-term trajectory. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the clear standout for early-stage returns . Early participants can now use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% bonus on token purchases, making MAGA even more attractive for those targeting transformative gains. Solana (SOL): Bullish Momentum and Technical Strength Solana has surged from $100 to $176 since April, with technical indicators like RSI and MACD signaling sustained momentum and possible further gains. Analysts predict a potential move toward $200–$210 if bullish sentiment holds, especially as network activity and DeFi TVL continue to rise. Even with this strong performance, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers higher-multiple upside for early investors. Ethereum (ETH): Surge in Capital Inflows and Price Momentum Ethereum recently saw a dramatic 8.2% price surge in 24 hours, reaching $3,850 as trading volume spiked by 35% to $18.5 billion. This influx is attributed to institutional interest and a broader risk-on sentiment in tech markets, with ETH now testing resistance at $3,900. While Ethereum remains a core holding for DeFi and Web3, its near-term upside is steady compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Avalanche (AVAX): Ecosystem Growth and Price Outlook CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Avalanche is trading around $24–$25, with bullish patterns and strong DeFi activity hinting at continued growth. Analysts see AVAX potentially reaching $30–$56 in a bullish scenario, but its trajectory is steadier than the presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which stands out as the top pick for outsized returns . Conclusion Solana’s rise to $176 and the surge in Ethereum and Avalanche are impressive, but the real excitement is in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearing completion, a 9,800% upside forecast, and the PATRIOT50X 50% bonus still available, MAGA is the breakout contender for 2025.

The first batch of brain chips is expected to arrive in late 2025. The company, incorporated in 2019, published its first blog post about the new brain chip, positioning itself as a new competitor to Elon Musk’s Neuralink. Starfish stated that the custom electrophysiology chip will interact with multiple brain regions simultaneously. This means that the chip will read and write to connected parts of the brain, making it possible to help people with neurological disorders. Starfish is making a miniaturized brain chip Most existing brain chips are fairly bulky. Each side usually measures more than 5 mm (about the width of two stacked pennies) and may reach 10 mm or more per side. In addition, such chips consume a high power of 10s of milliwatts (mW). Starfish stated that the upcoming brain chip will be miniaturized, making it much smaller than expected. The chip will have physically small dimensions of 2 x 4 millimeter (mm) and a 0.3 mm-pitch Ball Grid Array (BGA) package. A BGA is simply a type of chip carrier used for integrated circuits (ICs). In terms of power consumption, the chip will operate at an ultra-low power range. During normal recording of brain spikes, the chip will consume a total of 1.1 milliwatts (mW). This is equivalent to powering a single LED or a low-power temperature sensor. By having a tiny chip that consumes ultra-low power, Starfish aims to reduce the surgical impact of brain implants. Other features include recording neural spikes and local field potentials (LFPs), which are the slower, smoother voltage fluctuations in the brain. Moreover, the chip will stimulate the brain by sending tiny electric pulses that go positive and then negative, known as biphasic pulses. The chip will also include 32 electrode sites that interface directly with brain tissue. It will record from 16 of these sites simultaneously. Each active channel samples at 18.75 kHz to capture rapid neural spikes and waveforms with high precision. There will be one current source for stimulating any pair of electrodes. Also, the brain chip will monitor impedance and measure voltage transients onboard. It will process data digitally, detect spikes in real-time, and transmit relevant data over low-bandwidth wireless links. The chip will be fabricated using TSMC’s 55 nm process for optimal size and efficiency. Starfish announced that it is “interested in finding collaborators for whom such a chip would open new and exciting avenues.” The company is looking for people who work in fields like wireless communications or people who design custom implanted neural interfaces. However, any person who believes the brain chip is useful to their field of work is welcome to collaborate. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Yet among these giants, a new coin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is turning heads with its explosive potential. The fifth phase of Mutuum Finance presale continues as this high-growth altcoin sells at $0.03 and has collected $9.1 million. The next stage of the presale will boost MUTM’s price to $0.035 while attracting more than 11,000 investors. This phase’s investors will receive a 100% profit when the launch price reaches $0.06. For investors looking beyond SOL, ETH and XRP, MUTM could be a pivotal play in the 2025 crypto boom. For investors searching for the best altcoin to buy now, MUTM is shaping up to be one of the top cryptocurrencies to watch. Ethereum, Solana, and XRP Gear Up for 2025 Altcoin Season Surge Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Ripple’s XRP all enter 2025 with a lot of steam behind them, each one backed by niche fundamentals that will catalyze massive gains during the next altseason. Ethereum, currently trading at approximately $2,496, will probably break through the $10,000 mark with scaling enhancements like Pectra that cut through inefficiencies in its network. Solana, trading around $166, is rapidly emerging as a fast, inexpensive network powering DeFi and meme coins, and that’s where bullish projections believe it has a chance to break out to $500. XRP, in the meantime, remains an anchor for cross-border payments, and regulatory news in its favor can finally push it up to $5 from its current position at $2.35. While these giants prepare for liftoff, new tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are picking up steam with the capability of outperforming in ROI. A DeFi Giant on the Rise Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 11,000 investors have joined the presale funding to support the project which has received $9.1 million in total. Mutuum Finance’s price has currently reached $0.03 in Phase 5 even though investors anticipate a 16.67% price increase in Phase 6 which will generate considerable profit potential. Analysts forecast MUTM to surge beyond $5 in upcoming months when it launches at $0.06 because its distinctive lending approach meets rising market requirements thus making it an underappreciated yet promising DeFi resource. The Dual-Model System for Enhanced DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts. The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi. Driving Community Growth with Investor Rewards To attract more community members Mutuum Finance implements profitable incentive programs at an aggressive pace. The program will use $100,000 to give ten investors $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and the referral system gives rewards to users who bring in new investors to the platform. The platform gives early supporters exclusive benefits including VIP-exclusive updates to enhance their connection with the platform. Mutuum Finance is quickly gaining momentum with over $9.1 million raised and 11,000+ investors buying in at $0.03 during its presale. With a projected 100% profit at the $0.06 launch price and a forecasted surge beyond $5, MUTM presents a compelling alternative to Ethereum, Solana, and XRP in the 2025 altcoin season. Its innovative dual lending model combines automated liquidity pools with direct peer-to-peer loans, maximizing yield and decentralization. Backed by strong community incentives and transparent governance, Mutuum Finance is well-positioned to outperform established players and capture significant market share in the coming months.

Cardano is now inching toward $0.76, signaling renewed confidence among investors, but it is MAGACOIN FINANCE that is rewriting the playbook for early-stage success in 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Unprecedented Presale Momentum and 13,000% Upside CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing the imagination of the crypto community, with Stage 8 attracting record participation from both retail and institutional buyers. The project’s innovative tokenomics—a fixed supply, rigorous audits, and a compelling narrative—are setting a new benchmark for presale projects. Early backers can leverage the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code to secure a 50% bonus, amplifying the appeal for those seeking exponential gains. Analysts are now pointing to a potential 13,000% upside, fueled by robust on-chain activity and a rapidly expanding investor base. In a market hungry for innovation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the frontrunner for outsized early-stage returns . Cardano (ADA): Testing Resistance and Building Momentum Cardano is trading just shy of $0.76, with technical indicators hinting at a possible breakout if buying pressure persists. Recent developments in the ecosystem, including new DeFi integrations and partnerships, are bolstering sentiment. While ADA’s fundamentals remain solid, its growth trajectory is more gradual compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which continues to set the pace for early-stage excitement. XRP: Institutional Interest and Price Resilience XRP is holding steady above $2.35, supported by ongoing regulatory progress and growing institutional interest. Market watchers are eyeing a potential move toward $2.85–$3.40 if bullish trends continue, with some forecasts even suggesting higher targets by year-end. Despite its strong position, XRP’s upside is outpaced by the dynamic growth and presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE, making MAGA the preferred choice for those seeking rapid appreciation. Bitcoin (BTC): Stability and Institutional Backing Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of the crypto market, trading above $110,000 with strong institutional backing and ETF inflows. Analysts anticipate a potential push toward $115,000 if current momentum holds, but the scale of BTC’s market cap means its growth is now more measured. In contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a unique opportunity for investors to participate in a project still in its formative stages, with far greater upside potential. Hedera (HBAR): Steady Progress and Future Prospects Hedera is consolidating near $0.21, with technicals indicating a period of stability after recent gains. Analysts are optimistic about a move toward $0.25–$0.30 in the coming months, but the pace of growth is expected to be steady rather than explosive. For those seeking the next major breakout, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the clear leader for high-growth early-stage investments. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion Cardano’s approach to $0.76 and the steady performance of XRP, Bitcoin, and Hedera are noteworthy, but the spotlight is firmly on MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearing completion, a 13,000% growth path, and the PATRIOT50X 50% bonus still available, MAGA is the breakout opportunity of 2025.

According to an announcement from the Human Rights Foundation (HRF) — a non-profit organization that advocates for universal human rights and individual liberty, and the host of the Oslo Freedom Forum — Durov will still deliver his keynote address remotely over a livestream. “It is unfortunate that French courts would block Mr. Durov from participating in an event where his voice is so needed,” HRF founder and CEO Thor Halvorssen said. Durov continues to be a vocal advocate for free speech and individual liberty. Tech and crypto industry executives closely monitor developments related to Pavel Durov and the implications for individual freedom from his ongoing legal battle in France. Source: Pavel Durov Related: Pavel Durov rejects EU pressure to censor Romanian election content Durov claims French intelligence services asked him to censor conservative voices Pavel Durov recently accused French intelligence officials of asking him to censor conservative-leaning political content related to the Romanian presidential elections on the Telegram platform. Durov said that he flatly denied the request . ""You can’t 'defend democracy' by destroying democracy. You can’t 'fight election interference' by interfering with elections,"" Durov wrote in a May 18 Telegram post . Although the Telegram founder did not initially name the intelligence official or the European Union country that asked him to censor the content, Durov later revealed more concrete details. The Telegram co-founder wrote in a May 18 X post : ""This spring at the Salon des Batailles, in the Hôtel de Crillon, Nicolas Lerner, head of French intelligence, asked me to ban conservative voices in Romania ahead of elections. I refused. We didn’t block protesters in Russia, Belarus, or Iran. We won’t start doing it in Europe."" Durov has repeatedly stated that Telegram will not censor political content on the platform and would exit markets before restricting free speech on the social messaging application.

After reaching a 24-hour high of $3.9599, the pair encountered strong resistance, triggering a sharp pullback. SUI’s rejection has led to a notable 6.64% decline over the past day, raising questions about whether SUI can stabilize or if further downside is ahead. SUI Uptrend Peaks At $4.20 Before Sharp Reversal MAB’s recent analysis highlights that from May 20 to May 23, SUI experienced a clear uptrend, marked by consistently higher highs and higher lows. The steady upward movement peaked around the $4.20 level, reflecting strong bullish momentum during that period. Related Reading: SUI Preparing For Another Leg Up – Is $5 The Next Target? However, shortly after reaching its peak, SUI faced a sharp reversal. Large red candles appeared on the chart, indicating heavy selling pressure and a rapid loss of value. This sudden downturn from the recent highs caught many by surprise, with profit-taking triggering fears in the market. Volume analysis further supports this narrative. There was a notable spike in volume at the peak and during the sell-off, showing strong market participation in the decline. Currently, trading volume remains elevated at around 462.57 million USDT, which indicates continued activity. SUI is now testing a critical support zone between $3.6000 and $3.6500. A break below this area might pave the way for further losses, pushing the price down to the 24-hour low near $3.5233 or even lower. Market Sentiment: Fear Or Opportunity? Crypto Man MAB elaborated on the market dynamics by pointing out clear bearish signals alongside potential bullish opportunities. He noted that the sharp decline from the $4.20 peak and the inability to maintain levels above $3.8000 signal that bearish momentum is dominating. This is supported by the 7-day performance, which shows a 5.62% drop, underscoring the prevailing short-term weakness. Related Reading: SUI Hype Grows As Price Action Points To A Rally: $4 Level In Focus On the bullish side, the analyst pointed out that if the crucial $3.6000 support level holds firm, there could be a rebound toward $3.8000, a previous resistance turned into a support level. This support could encourage SUI buyers to re-enter the market, setting the stage for upward movement. Looking beyond the immediate fluctuations, the analyst emphasized that the 30-day gain of 20.29% and the 90-day gain of 5.90% reflect an overall positive trend for SUI. Despite recent setbacks, this suggests that a sustained recovery remains possible if buying pressure strengthens. To sum up, he highlighted that SUI stands at a crucial crossroads, and a drop below the $3.6000 support could lead to additional downside pressure. However, a strong bounce from this zone might pave the way for a recovery supported by increasing volume, whereas growing volume on a decline would reinforce the bearish outlook.

45058615,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=734277,1748126574,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45058615.jpeg,"Dubai picks XRP Ledger for real estate tokenization as 3,000 investors register",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/dubai-picks-xrp-ledger-for-real-estate-tokenization-as-3000-investors-register/,"More than 3,000 investors have registered for Dubai’s flagship real estate tokenization program. Mahmoud AlBurai, a senior executive at the Dubai Land Department (DLD), disclosed this in a post on LinkedIn. According to AlBurai , the massive number of participants who have joined the waitlist highlights their interest in the project. The real estate tokenization project is the first in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. With the pilot launched on March 16, the DLD partnered with Prypco Mint and Ctrl Alt to tokenize ownership deeds of real estate properties owned by the government. The department now plans to offer fractional ownership of these properties to investors. Presently, only holders of an Emirates Card, i.e., official residents of the United Arab Emirates, can participate in the program. Despite the eligibility limit, many investors have shown interest in the project. This is likely because several regulators are playing key roles in the actualization of the project. Beyond the DLD, the Dubai Future Foundation, Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), and the Central Bank of UAE are also involved, giving potential investors confidence in the project. While the project remains in the early stages, DLD already has big projections. In its earlier announcement, it predicted that it could become a $16 billion market by 2033, noting the effectiveness, transparency, and accessibility that blockchain could enable for the real estate market. Dubai picks XRPL to tokenize real estate assets Interestingly, Dubai chose Ripple’s XRP Ledger as the blockchain for tokenizing the deeds. According to AlBurai, XRPL is the pilot phase network. This has led to speculations as to whether XRPL would be the only choice or if it plans to expand to other networks. For now, the choice of XRPL represents a momentous milestone for the blockchain network. While it has seen minimal activity compared to other major smart contract networks, its use for the project represents an opportunity to show its ability for tokenization. Ripple has been actively pushing for tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) on XRPL. Last year, it invested $5 million into a tokenized money market fund on XRPL by UK-based firm Abrdn while investing $10 million into tokenized US treasury bills by OpenEden after the platform launched on XRPL. With real estate tokenization entering the mix, XRPL looks poised for more institutional adoption. Ripple recently secured a payments provider license from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) and has started onboarding institutions into its payments service, which is enabled through XRPL. UAE could emerge as a leader in real estate tokenization Meanwhile, the DLD Tokenization Project, while still in the pilot phase, could allow the UAE to become a pioneer in the real estate tokenization sector. While tokenization of RWA has become one of the most exciting sectors globally, most financial institutions and regulators are currently focused on tokenization of financial products such as securities and bonds. This means that the real estate sector has seen limited tokenization efforts, allowing Dubai to dominate with its Real Estate Tokenization Sandbox. So far, the UAE has seen about $3 billion worth of real estate assets tokenized, according to local reports . Interestingly, regulatory involvement in the Dubai real estate tokenization efforts could also prove to be an advantage after a recent lawsuit by the US Securities and Exchange Commission against real estate tokenization company Unicoin executives. The SEC alleged in the lawsuit that Unicoin, which claimed to own several tokenized estate properties, did not own any of the assets and inflated their value. It added that the firm also misled investors about returns and exaggerated sales. With the lawsuit likely to shake investors’ confidence in the tokenized real estate sector, a government-backed project with regulatory support from several agencies could be an alternative to private projects.

Ethereum is steadily climbing, while Bitcoin’s robust rally above $111,000 is fueling optimism across the board. In this environment, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE and established assets such as XRP are emerging as top contenders for outsized gains—offering strategic entry points for those willing to act before major catalysts unfold. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Unrivaled Presale Momentum and 10,500% Upside JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly establishing itself as the breakout presale of 2025 , drawing unprecedented demand from both retail and institutional investors. With over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearing completion, the project’s capped supply, audited contracts, and viral political narrative are driving a surge in participation. Early backers can now use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code to secure a 50% bonus on token purchases, amplifying the opportunity for transformative gains. Analysts are projecting up to 10,500% upside, with some models even suggesting a $1 valuation by year-end if momentum continues. In a market hungry for innovation, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the clear leader for early-stage returns. Ethereum (ETH): Steady Climb and Institutional Adoption Ethereum is trading between $2,400 and $2,900, with bullish technicals and ongoing upgrades supporting its long-term outlook. The network’s recent Layer 2 expansion and anticipation of ETF approvals are fueling institutional interest, with analysts forecasting a potential move toward $4,000–$6,000 by late 2025. While Ethereum remains a core holding for DeFi and Web3, its near-term upside is steady compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Regulatory Clarity and Price Resilience XRP is consolidating above $2.30, buoyed by regulatory clarity, CME futures speculation, and significant whale accumulation. Analysts forecast a move toward $2.41 in June, with some bullish scenarios targeting $5 and beyond if ETF approvals and adoption accelerate. Despite its strong fundamentals, XRP’s growth trajectory is steady—underscoring why MAGACOIN FINANCE is the preferred choice for those seeking rapid appreciation. Bitcoin (BTC): Institutional Strength and Price Range Bitcoin is trading above $111,000, with analysts predicting a range of $110,000–$115,000 for May and potential highs of $140,000 if bullish momentum sustains. Institutional inflows and ETF demand are reinforcing BTC’s dominance, but its upside is now more measured—making MAGACOIN FINANCE the clear destination for investors targeting higher-growth opportunities. Litecoin (LTC): Steady Performance and Market Position Litecoin is trading near $82, with recent volatility following news of a delayed ETF decision. Analysts expect LTC to reach up to $92.69 in May, but its growth is gradual and its market position remains subdued compared to the explosive presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which continues to set the standard for early-stage excitement. CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE Conclusion Ethereum’s steady gains and XRP’s bullish momentum are noteworthy, but the real excitement is in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearing completion, a 10,500% upside forecast, and the PATRIOT50X 50% bonus still available, MAGA is the breakout contender for 2025. Bitcoin and Litecoin provide stability, but for those seeking the next crypto supercycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands as the defining early-stage opportunity.

While Bitcoin and Injective maintain their appeal among institutional players, market participants are increasingly drawn to the dynamic potential of early-stage projects—with MAGACOIN FINANCE at the forefront.

Early supporters can access a 50% token bonus via the exclusive PATRIOT50X code, further enhancing MAGA’s allure for those pursuing rapid appreciation. Each new phase sparks heightened activity and enthusiasm, solidifying MAGACOIN FINANCE as the community’s breakout contender for the coming year . Bitcoin (BTC): Institutional Demand and Market Leadership Bitcoin continues to anchor the market, hovering near $111,500 amid robust institutional inflows and optimistic technical signals. Forecasts indicate BTC could test $121,000 by late May, yet its more stable trajectory is prompting savvy participants to diversify into high-growth alternatives—where MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the preferred choice for outsized returns. XRP: Steady Performance and Shifting Trader Focus XRP remains resilient at $2.37, consolidating after recent advances. While regulatory clarity and ETF speculation keep sentiment positive, short-term volatility has led to a rotation of interest among holders. Many are now directing attention and capital toward early-stage ventures such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is rapidly becoming the most talked-about opportunity in online trading circles. Ethereum (ETH): Technical Rebound and Community Sentiment Ethereum has rebounded to $2,489, reflecting a 4% intraday gain and signs of renewed momentum. Despite its strong fundamentals and institutional adoption, ETH’s appreciation is outpaced by the excitement surrounding MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is now the focal point for traders seeking the next major breakout. Injective (INJ): Consistent Growth and Emerging Trends Injective trades near $17.74, with analysts predicting a rise to $18.56 in June as DeFi activity expands.

The product which tokenizes deposits is the first of its kind by a regulated financial institution in the city. According to a report from SCMP citing HSBC official statements, the settlement service allows the conversion of bank cash deposits into digital tokens on the blockchain. This will allow the bank’s corporate customers to make real-time payments using US Dollars (USD) and Hong Kong Dollars (HKD). The service is expected to reduce the cost of client transactions and ensure that payment can happen within a shorter period and at all times. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) supported the initiative through its Supervisory Incubator for Distributed Ledger Technology. Speaking on the achievement, HSBC’s global head of domestic and emerging payments for global payments solution, Lewis Sun, said it can improve payments and cash management. Sun said: “Tokenised deposits, when supported by regulated financial institutions, can offer a safe and fully compliant approach to improving payments and cash management for [companies].” The service already has its first user, with Alibaba affiliate Ant International using it for an instant fund transfer. Ant noted in a separate press release that the pilot test of the product using Ant’s blockchain-based global treasury management platform, the Whale. HSBC integrated the experience from the pilot testing into the tokenized deposit service before the full launch. Currently, the service is only available in Hong Kong, but HSBC plans to expand it to other countries in Asia and Europe by the year’s second half. Big banks are embracing tokenization Meanwhile, the launch of the tokenized deposits is only another step in the long-term tokenization plan for HSBC. The bank launched gold tokenization as far back as 2023 and plans to use the blockchain network and technologies to create a new digital transfer and settlement infrastructure. Part of its planned use cases include digital currency settlements and other forms of tokenization. The bank has been exploring various uses of digital ledger technologies with initiatives such as tokenized bonds, the Orion blockchain platform, and several others. However, it is not alone; several other major banks and financial institutions have identified tokenization as the next frontier for the financial markets. Institutions such as BlackRock, JP Morgan, Visa, Mastercard, and others are all exploring the incorporation of tokenization into payments and financial markets. Several banks, including Bank of America, Euroclear, and Italian Central Bank, also recently tapped Solana as a tokenization layer after developer R3 partnered with Solana Foundation to connect its private blockchain Corda to the public network. The massive interest in the sector from every stakeholder, both traditional institutions and fintech companies, explains why researchers predict it could be worth $30 trillion by 2030. Hong Kong status as digital finance hub increases Meanwhile, HSBC’s choice of Hong Kong to launch the tokenized deposit service highlights how the city has become a major hub for global financial innovation. Hong Kong has been active in its efforts to attract financial technology and digital assets companies with regulatory clarity and government-banked initiatives. Unsurprisingly, the tokenized deposit service is a product of one of such initiatives, with HSBC being one of the key participants in Phase 2 of the city’s e-HKD Pilot Program. The program focuses on banks experimenting with how tokenized fiat currencies can be used in digital asset transactions. The bank has also been involved in HKMA projects such as mBridge and Ensemble. Interestingly, Hong Kong also recently passed a Stablecoin bill that expands its regulatory framework for digital assets by requiring all stablecoin issuers to get a license from the HKMA. The government claims that the new law, which is expected to come into force this year, will provide financial stability while encouraging innovation.

As the summer bull run of 2025 approaches, the spotlight is on SUI and Solana . Which of these cryptocurrencies holds the key to maximum gains? The answer could shape investment strategies in the coming months. Dive in to discover which coin is poised for significant growth. SUI’s Rapid Surge with Attractive Trading Levels SUI experienced a notable 44.75% gain over the past month and a solid 12.53% increase over the last six months. The coin's price behavior changed from slow and steady movements to a pronounced surge recently, indicating a rise in buyer interest and active trading participation. This shift from modest growth to a rapid upward trend highlights the evolving dynamics in its market performance. Currently, SUI’s price fluctuates between $2.19 and $4.34, with support at $0.88 and resistance at $5.19. Bulls maintain strength within this range, but mixed momentum signals suggest caution. Trading strategies could involve buying near the support level and targeting exits as the price approaches resistance while closely monitoring to mitigate risk. Solana Price Trends and Key Levels Over the last month, Solana showed strong upward movement with a 20.92% price gain, while over the past six months it experienced a downturn of nearly 29.28%. Price activity has been volatile, with significant positive movement in the short term counterbalanced by longer downturns. Historical data suggests periods of rapid recovery followed by marked corrections, emphasizing a fluctuating pattern in the coin’s performance. Current trading shows Solana in a range between $109.63 and $171.27. Immediate resistance stands at $194.93, with a secondary level at $256.57, while support appears at $71.65 and then at $10.01. Indicators like a 64.57 RSI combined with a slight negative momentum hint at cautious bullish control. Trades within these levels may favor buyers if prices hold above support and clear resistance is eventually breached. Conclusion SUI has shown solid performance and has promising technology, while SOL has a robust track record and strong community support. SUI may offer higher growth potential due to its innovative solutions and newer presence. SOL remains a reliable choice with established infrastructure and partnerships. Diversifying investments between both could balance the portfolio. Final decisions should align with individual investment goals and risk tolerance.

Amid this market downturn, popular market analyst CasiTrades has stated that XRP lies in danger of a further decline should a particular support level fail. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Above Key Prices – Data Points To $2,900 Level As Bullish Trigger XRP Must Avoid Crash Below $2.25 – $2.26 As Bitcoin prices reached a new all-time high in the past week, XRP followed suit, reaching as high as $2.45 before experiencing a price rejection driven by negative macroeconomic pressure due to the new international tariffs by the US Government. In the day, XRP price notably declined by over 5% from $2.45 to $2.33 before finding some stability to enter a sideways movement as seen in the last few hours. According to CasiTrades, XRP’s rejection aligns with a 1:1 Fibonacci extension of the corrective C-wave pattern in the Elliott Wave Theory, signaling the possible exhaustion of the previous relief rally seen earlier in the week. Notably, the analyst warns that XRP’s decline may lead to a retest of “major structural support” at the $2.25 – $2.26 price zone, which aligns with the Fibonacci retracement level 0.382. CasiTrades explains that Fib 0.382 has represented a key technical price level over the past six months. Therefore, a price break below this level could trigger deeper corrections, forcing XRP’s price as low as $1.55 – $1.90, a price move that would wipe out all price gains that have been recorded since the crypto market uptrend resumed in early April. However, if the $2.25 – $2.26 support zone holds, such market resilience could trigger a new price rally to around $2.70 and beyond. Thereafter, XRP is likely to return to the local peak of the current bull run at $3.84.

However, the altcoin is up by 9.77% in the past month, reflecting that the majority of new market entrants are still in profit. In other positive news, Volatility shares launched an XRP futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) on May 22. It is a 1x fund, indicating that it would track the daily performance of XRP futures contracts with no leverage. With a total market cap of $233.58 billion, XRP remains the 4th largest cryptocurrency and third-largest altcoin in the market.

Yet, the spotlight is increasingly shifting to MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is building momentum with projections of up to 14,000% growth. With Bitcoin and Aptos also in the mix, traders are eyeing a dynamic landscape where early-stage opportunities could deliver outsized returns. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: Explosive Presale, 50% Bonus, and 14,000% Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the breakout presale of 2025, with Stage 8 live and over $8 million already raised.

The network’s high transaction speeds, low fees, and growing DeFi activity continue to attract users and developers. Analysts forecast a move toward $240–$260 later in the year if bullish trends persist. While Solana’s growth is impressive, its upside is steadier compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE, making MAGA the preferred choice for those seeking rapid appreciation. Aptos (APT): Price Consolidation and Future Potential Aptos is consolidating around $4.09, with forecasts suggesting a trading range of $2.79 to $5.38 for May 2025. While Aptos’s fundamentals remain solid, its price action is more subdued compared to the presale-driven momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. As capital seeks higher-multiple opportunities, MAGA stands out as the clear breakout play for 2025. Bitcoin (BTC): Institutional Demand and Market Leadership Bitcoin is trading above $111,000, buoyed by robust institutional inflows and strong technical momentum. Analysts see BTC potentially reaching $118,000–$131,000 in the near term, with long-term targets as high as $135,000–$320,000 for the year. While Bitcoin remains the market’s anchor, its upside is now more measured compared to the explosive growth potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion Solana’s traction and Aptos’s steady progress are impressive, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is the standout for early-stage momentum.

Yet the fact that almost everyone can name a digital coin shows that Singapore’s trading scene is maturing. Singaporean Investors are increasing their XRP holdings.👇 https://t.co/ydq9PGwmXj pic.twitter.com/aK9H85ZVwb — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 22, 2025 XRP Ownership On The Rise Based on reports from Milieu Insight Market Research, XRP saw one of the strongest gains among altcoins. It now represents 17% of crypto holdings in Singapore, up from 14% last year. Ethereum grew even more, climbing from 41% to 48%. Solana ticked up from 17% to 19%, while Dogecoin rose only 1 point, from 18% to 19%. Still, XRP’s 3-point boost hints at growing trust in its payment-focused design. Monthly Investments Varied Widely Investors in Singapore are not all spending the same amount each month. About 57% put in less than $500. Another 29% contribute between $500 and $1,000. Only 10% dedicate more than $1,000 each month to steadier “dollar-cost averaging.” Those figures suggest that most people treat crypto as a side play rather than a full-time career. Stablecoin Trends And RLUSD Stablecoins are also part of the mix. Roughly 46% of respondents said they own—or once owned—these US-pegged assets. Of that group, 21% hold them now, while 25% have moved on. Eighty-three percent prefer USD-pegged coins. In that context, Ripple’s new RLUSD has reached a $310 million market cap in just a few months. Ripple’s APAC managing director, Fiona Murray, said the coin is not just for trading but also for cross-border payments and DeFi work.

Businesses worldwide had no choice but to quickly change how they manage supply chains, plan pricing, and choose global partners. Companies relying on overseas factories had to pass the new costs on to customers, find new suppliers in other countries, or figure out how to work with a confusing and constantly changing tariff system that made every shipment more expensive and difficult to track. Many businesses realized that their old systems weren’t fast or smart enough to handle all the changes because tariff laws could now shift overnight and expose their operations to risks they couldn’t predict. AI has become a lifeline for companies to understand their supply chains, reduce their tariff exposure, and find new ways to cut costs. Trump started a trade fight, and companies turned to AI Donald Trump’s administration introduced tariffs that made global trade more tense and unpredictable for companies that had spent decades building international supply chains. The Trump tariffs affected electric vehicles and batteries , while others targeted raw materials, machinery, consumer electronics, and simple goods like textiles and furniture. Since the US customs system has more than 20,000 product categories, each one could face a different rate or rule depending on the country of origin and trade status. This uncertainty forced companies to go back and analyze thousands of product categories, track long Harmonized Tariff Schedule codes, and figure out which parts of their inventory were now affected. Businesses quickly needed smarter tools to read tariff schedules, track product codes, analyze costs, and react instantly to customs office updates. So, they turned to artificial intelligence to survive a new era of fast, deep, and unpredictable tariffs. Companies turned to AI to keep up with tariffs Companies discovered that AI could read huge volumes of complex documents, connect the dots across departments, and react faster than human teams ever could. Salesforce created a powerful AI agent that could instantly scan and understand the US. Harmonized Tariff Schedule (4,400 pages) for businesses to identify every possible product category and associated duty. Kinaxis used AI to let businesses run live supply chain simulations that showed what would happen if they changed one part of their operation. This way, companies will know how to keep production running while lowering costs and avoiding new tariffs. Wipro combined traditional machine learning with new generative AI systems to quickly analyze global trade routes, supplier locations, shipping lanes, and tariff exposure. The system would then recommend how to reroute cargo, switch to cheaper vendors, or adjust sourcing strategies so businesses could stay flexible and competitive even as the rules kept shifting. These AI systems took over work that was simply too large, fast, and complex for human teams to manage independently. These tasks include tracking new trade policies as they happened, scanning global supplier data for vulnerabilities, modeling what-if scenarios for cost impact, and suggesting better decisions that balance speed, savings, and compliance. A lifeline for big companies, but what about everyone else? Large corporations have the money, talent, and data to train AI tools properly. AI made them flexible and intelligent enough to respond instantly to changing trade rules and protect their profit margins in ways that older systems or manual processes simply couldn’t match. But many small businesses don’t have enough money to buy AI tools, hire experts to build custom models, or collect the clean, real-time data AI systems need to work properly and deliver useful insights. AI is often portrayed as magic, but the truth is that it’s only as good as the data it works with. If a company can’t afford clean, updated, and well-organized data about its products, suppliers, logistics, and costs, then even the best AI system won’t be able to deliver the results that big businesses already see. AI has become a lifeline in this context, helping companies navigate unpredictable policies. But the deeper question going forward is whether this lifeline will also act as a ladder, giving smaller businesses and under-resourced players a way to climb into the future, or whether it remains just a crutch for the most powerful to keep their lead while others fall further behind.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) checks all those boxes, quickly earning its place among the best cryptocurrencies to invest in today. Unlike many tokens that rely solely on hype, MUTM delivers a robust DeFi platform designed to maximize yield opportunities while maintaining security and scalability. The project has hit phase 5 of its presale after selling out phase 4 at a higher pace than expected. MUTM will be launched officially at $0.06. The next phase prices will spike by 16.67% to $0.035. The tokens are available at $0.03, with listing at $0.06, offering early investors up to 100% potential returns. MUTM is rapidly taking center stage, with over $9.1 million raised and attracted more than 11,000 investors. With its competitive entry price and promising roadmap, MUTM is capturing attention as a top crypto to buy now, poised to challenge established giants and lead the next wave of decentralized finance innovation. Investors looking for the best crypto to invest in today should keep a close eye on MUTM as it gears up for major growth in 2025. Phase 4 Sold Out, MUTM’s Ascent Is Only Beginning The presale is in phase 5 with Phase 4 totally sold out. The tokens are available at $0.03, and listing for $0.06, early investors are looking at up to 100% potential returns. MUTM is rapidly taking center stage, with over $9.1 million raised and attracted more that 11,000 investors. As Phase 5 is in , the token price will rise to $0.035 in the next phase, providing current participants with a 16.67% profit. A Smarter DeFi Model: Hybrid Lending for a New Era Mutuum Finance stands out through its dual approach to crypto lending, which integrates Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) allows users to put stablecoins like USDT into smart contract liquidity pools and automatically earn passive income. In contrast, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) allows lenders and borrowers to communicate directly without intermediaries, with the ability to adjust loan terms and privacy advantages. This is a hybrid solution that provides more decentralization and flexibility but at the same time has strong yield opportunities, while liquidity providers receive over 10% today in passive return. Trust and Transparency: Stable, Audited, and Made to Last Mutuum Finance isn’t just innovating, it’s building trust. The platform’s smart contracts are open-source and undergoing rigorous audit by Certik. In addition to the native token, a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin is being developed, which circumvents the vulnerabilities of algorithmic stablecoins that have toppled other DeFi initiatives. The project is set to build a USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum network as one of the main features in the Mutuum Finance roadmap. Security and transparency are fundamentals of the ecosystem. Fostering Growth with $100K Giveaway and Gamified Community Tools To turbocharge adoption, Mutuum Finance is actively incentivizing its early adopters. Already underway is a $100,000 giveaway, where ten participants will receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens. Running in tandem is a gamified leaderboard, displaying and rewarding the top 50 token holders, to encourage greater investment and continued participation. This is supported through a referral program, a new level of grassroots expansion in this rapidly growing community. Mutuum Finance has raised over $9.1 million from 11,000+ investors, offering tokens at $0.03 with a launch price of $0.06—delivering up to 100% returns. The upcoming price increase to $0.035 provides an additional 16.67% profit for current buyers. Combining a unique hybrid lending model with Certik-audited smart contracts, MUTM ensures strong yields and security. With a $100,000 giveaway and active community rewards, Mutuum is set to lead DeFi growth into 2025. Don’t miss the chance to be part of this rising project.

While Bitcoin and Solana remain key holdings, the spotlight is increasingly turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP—two assets now seen as top contenders for 10,200% upside scenarios in 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Momentum, 50% Bonus, and 10,200% Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the standout early-stage opportunity of 2025, drawing both retail and institutional attention. The project’s unique blend of scarcity-driven tokenomics, audited contracts, and viral narrative is fueling record demand. Stage 8 Live: Over $8 million raised, with each presale stage filling faster than the last as investors rush to secure positions before price discovery. 50% Bonus with PATRIOT50X: Early buyers can use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% token bonus, amplifying potential returns. Analyst Targets: Industry experts forecast returns of up to 10,200%, with some models suggesting even higher upside if current momentum holds. With these catalysts, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now the go-to allocation for those seeking transformative early-stage gains. Ethereum (ETH): Bullish Technicals and Institutional Adoption Ethereum is trading between $2,400 and $2,900, with technical indicators signaling a possible breakout above $2,700 toward $2,800–$2,900 if momentum sustains. The Parabolic SAR and RSI both suggest renewed buying interest, while institutional adoption and Layer 2 growth underpin ETH’s long-term outlook. While Ethereum remains a core asset, its upside is now outpaced by the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin (BTC): Market Anchor and Capital Rotation Bitcoin is trading above $110,000, with institutional inflows and strong market structure reinforcing its dominance. Analysts see BTC potentially reaching $115,000 or higher if bullish momentum continues. As Bitcoin’s pace steadies, traders are diversifying into high-growth altcoins—where MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the top choice for outsized returns. Solana (SOL): Technical Strength and DeFi Surge Solana is consolidating between $158 and $175, with a breakout above $175 potentially leading to a retest of $183. The network’s high throughput and expanding DeFi ecosystem continue to attract users and developers. While Solana’s outlook is positive, its upside is more gradual compared to the presale-driven momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Stellar (XLM): Steady Growth, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Stellar is projected to trade between $0.65 and $0.80 in 2025, with technicals and institutional interest supporting long-term gains. While XLM’s fundamentals are strong, its near-term upside is less dramatic than the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which continues to set the standard for early-stage excitement. Conclusion Ethereum’s bullish chart patterns and Bitcoin’s stability are noteworthy, but the real excitement is in MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP—where early-stage momentum and analyst forecasts up to 10,200% ROI are drawing smart capital. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and strong community engagement, MAGA is the breakout contender for 2025.

The Russian technology entrepreneur will deliver his keynote speech remotely via livestream despite the travel ban, according to the Human Rights Foundation (HRF.) The Oslo Freedom Forum is organized by the Human Rights Foundation (HRF), a non-profit promoting freedom of speech and democracy globally. HRF founder Thor Halvorssen said the decision was disappointing, adding that it was a shame the French courts had banned Mr. Durov from attending an event where his voice was so critical. He has been the subject of legal investigation in France since August 2024. Durov was arrested while trying to leave the country at Le Bourget Airport near Paris. French prosecutors charged him with complicity in distributing child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and refusal of assistance to law enforcement. Telegram reportedly refused more than 3,000 law enforcement requests to provide evidence connected to criminal content. Following his arrest, the entrepreneur was released on 5 million euro bail . But the court laid down conditions. He has been ordered to stay in France and report to police twice weekly. Durov has said in court filings that the accusations are unfounded. He said that while Telegram has an EU-based legal representative to handle law enforcement requests, his company cooperates with such requests whenever possible. In a public post, Mr. Durov said that his detention was unconstitutional. He added that Telegram was not a lawless zone and that the company was committed to improving moderation while protecting privacy and free speech. Yet the court denied him permission to travel to Oslo. Judges ruled that the threat of him absconding was “high.” Durov claims pressure to censor political content on Telegram Telegram’s founder has claimed the French government has pressured the app to censor political content. Durov threw down a gauntlet in mid-May 2025 in a surprising maneuver. He said French intelligence chief Nicolas Lerner personally instructed him to ban conservative political content ahead of Romania’s upcoming presidential election. The meeting supposedly occurred at the Hôtel de Crillon in Paris, a grand luxury palace in the city. He said Lerner had asked him to “mute” voices of Romanian opposition on Telegram. In a post on Telegram, the tech entrepreneur said that democracy cannot be defended by denying people the right to express their opinions. The allegations have been denied by France’s DGSE (Directorate-General for External Security), under Lerner’s command. Officials said their discussions with Durov only touched on threats such as terrorism and child abuse material, not political content. But the assertions set off an uproar online. Public figures, including the tech mogul Elon Musk and the whistle-blower Edward Snowden, rallied to Durov’s defense, saying the episode is part of a broader pattern of Western governments attempting to clamp down on online speech. Supporters defend free speech amid Durov case Durov’s supporters say the French charges are calculated for political reasons. They caution that holding platform founders responsible for internet users’ posts could threaten internet freedom. One digital rights advocate said that if tech executives are going to be jailed every time they refuse to remove content that governments want taken down from social media, then no one is safe. Others say platforms like Telegram need to do more to remove illegal content and safeguard vulnerable communities. Durov says Telegram strikes the correct balance. He said that they did not censor protesters in Russia, Belarus, or Iran and that they would not start doing so in Europe. Having Durov present, even virtually, is key to conversations around digital rights, according to the Human Rights Foundation. For now, he remains in France, fighting legal charges and what he claims is Europe’s shift toward political censorship.

While Bitcoin and Hedera (HBAR) remain key portfolio anchors, the most strategic capital is now flowing into MAGACOIN FINANCE—a presale project with forecasts of up to 33x returns and growing community momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Strategic Entry, 50% Bonus, and 33x Upside 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming the breakout presale of 2025, with Stage 8 live and over $8 million raised as demand accelerates. The project’s capped supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral narrative are fueling unprecedented buy activity. Participants can unlock a 50% bonus using the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code, amplifying the appeal for those targeting exponential gains. Analysts are projecting returns of 25x–35x, with some models suggesting even higher upside if current momentum continues. With each stage, MAGACOIN FINANCE is securing its place as the go-to allocation for traders seeking the next crypto supercycle . XRP: Accumulation and Bullish Setup XRP is consolidating between $2.35 and $2.60, with technical indicators signaling a potential breakout if bullish sentiment returns. Analysts forecast a move toward $2.65–$2.85 in the near term, and some models target $3.40 if volume picks up. Recent data shows large investors accumulating significant holdings, reflecting strong confidence in XRP’s long-term value. While XRP’s fundamentals remain robust, the most aggressive capital is now rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for outsized returns. Hedera (HBAR): Steady Growth and Ecosystem Strength Hedera is trading near $0.25, with technicals and forecasts indicating a possible move to $0.29–$0.30 in the coming months. The network’s partnerships and enterprise adoption underpin its long-term outlook. However, HBAR’s growth trajectory is steady compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which continues to set the standard for early-stage excitement. Bitcoin (BTC): Institutional Demand and Market Stability CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST Bitcoin is trading above $110,000, with institutional inflows and strong market structure reinforcing its dominance. Analysts see BTC potentially reaching $118,000–$131,000 in the near term, but its upside is now more measured compared to the presale-driven momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Conclusion XRP’s accumulation phase is a strong vote of confidence, but the real excitement is in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearing completion, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 33x ROI, MAGA stands as the breakout contender for 2025.

The AI token continues to prove a favorable investment, reporting a monthly gain of 36.20% following the resurrection of the crypto bull market. Interestingly, a market analyst with the X username Cryptododo7 and popularly known as Plan D has stated FET is likely headed for green days with a forming bullish pattern. Related Reading: Litecoin Monthly Close Above Key Resistance Could Ignite 30% Rally – Is A Breakout Coming? FET Bulls Gear Up For Major Price Rally In an X post on May 23, PlanD shared a technical analysis on the FET market using an hourly trading chart from TradingView. Based on the presented chart, FET’s price action in the past two years has formed a bull flag pattern, hinting that the altcoin is on the edge of a breakout. The bull flag is a typical bullish pattern that signals the potential continuation of an uptrend after a brief period of consolidation. It consists of a flagpole, which represents a strong upward price movement as seen in 2024 when FET’s price surged by 1,400% from $0.20 to $3.00. Following this price rally, there is the flag/pennant, which is a small downward or sideways price movement resembling a flag on a pole. This consolidation is seen between 2024 and 2025, when FET retraces from its market top at $3.00 to below $0.25. Thereafter, there is the price breakout, which represents the moment a token’s price crosses above the flag’s upper boundary, signaling a continuation of the upward trend. While FET currently trades at $0.84, the upper boundary of the bull flag stands at $1.71. If the market bulls are able to command a decisive price close above this price mark, FET is tipped to produce a price rally similar to the length of the initial flagpole. Based on this calculation, PlanD predicts FET to hit a price target of $9.33, representing a potential 1,050% gain on the present market prices.

Notably, the token’s trading volume is up by 51.46%, indicating a strong market participation that could support a further market gain. According to the price prediction site CoinCodex, investors’ sentiment is largely bullish, with the Fear & Greed Index indicating Extreme Greed at 78. However, CoinCodex analysts foresee a continuous market correction tipping FET to trade at $0.80 and $0.60 in the coming five and 30 days, respectively.

While ETH’s consolidation signals stability, the real action is unfolding in early-stage projects—none more so than MAGACOIN FINANCE, where presale momentum and community support are rapidly intensifying. With Solana, Aptos, and Bitcoin also in focus, traders are recalibrating for the next wave of growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Accelerating Presale, 50% Bonus, and 35x+ Potential JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly establishing itself as 2025’s most dynamic presale, with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral narrative are fueling record demand from both retail and institutional investors. Key highlights: Scarcity-Driven Model: Only 100 billion tokens, with 45% allocated to presale, creating a strong supply squeeze as demand rises. 50% Bonus: Early buyers can use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% token bonus, amplifying upside ahead of the $0.007 listing target. Analysts are projecting 25x–35x returns, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% if momentum continues. With every stage, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s trendline is steepening—making it the cycle’s breakout contender before listings ignite true price discovery . Ethereum (ETH): Sideways Action and Steady Inflows Ethereum is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, with technicals hinting at a possible breakout above $2,700 if bullish sentiment returns. Institutional inflows remain robust, and analysts expect ETH to test $2,800–$2,900 in June. While ETH remains a foundational asset, its near-term upside is now more measured compared to the rapid acceleration seen in MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana (SOL): Bullish Structure and Upside Potential Solana is trading between $158 and $175, with a breakout above $175 potentially leading to a retest of $183 and even $200 if momentum persists. The network’s high throughput and expanding DeFi ecosystem continue to attract capital, but the most aggressive traders are now rotating into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper returns. Aptos (APT): Quiet Growth, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Aptos is trading around $4.09, with forecasts suggesting a range of $2.79 to $5.38 for May 2025. While APT’s fundamentals remain solid, its near-term upside is less dramatic compared to the explosive presale-driven momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin (BTC): Macro Anchor and Capital Rotation CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Bitcoin is holding above $110,000, with strong institutional support and technicals pointing to a possible move toward $115,000 if momentum holds.

45063731,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=734302,1748138669,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45063731.jpeg,Robert Kiyosaki reveals why he trusts Bitcoin over cash,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/kiyosaki-reveals-why-he-trusts-btc-over-cash/,"Robert Kiyosaki, the famous author of Rich Dad Poor Dad , has once again made headlines by explaining why he trusts Bitcoin more than traditional cash. In a message to his millions of followers on X (formerly Twitter), he cautioned that many are still poor due to neglect of fundamental financial truths. The message was simple: Learn money laws, avoid fake money, and save with real assets like Bitcoin. Kiyosaki’s post , “ARE YOU BREAKING the LAWS?, called out the people who violated two important laws of money : Gresham’s Law and Metcalf’s Law. Gresham’s Law reads, “Bad money drives good money out of circulation.” He said that when governments make new fiat currency – which Kiyosaki refers to as “fake money” – it loses worth. https://twitter.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1926364887904587821 In return, smart investors bury or shelter their fortune in things with actual, enduring value. For Kiyosaki, these assets are gold, silver, and Bitcoin. He emphasized that saving in dollars or other fiat currencies doesn’t make sense, pointing out that people essentially save in something that loses value daily. He questioned why anyone would save “fake money” and urged his followers to save what he called “good money”—decentralized assets that cannot be printed at will. Kiyosaki contrasted successful companies like FedEx and McDonald’s — powerful because they create strong networks and smaller operations like “Mom Pop Burgers” that fail because they lack the network advantage. Kiyosaki stated that Bitcoin is a network, so he invested in it. He warned that many cryptocurrencies lack strong network support and are likely poor investments. He advised people to follow the laws of money and invest in assets that gain value through the strength of their networks. Major financial players invest in Bitcoin Kiyosaki is not the only one who has faith in Bitcoin’s potential future. The biggest Wall Street players are also buying in. Among the biggest names is Michael Saylor, founder and chairman of Strategy Inc., who has emerged as one of Bitcoin’s loudest corporate advocates. This week, Saylor’s outfit acquired an additional 7,390 BTC to its tropospheric holdings. The total purchase cost $764 million, bringing the company’s total amount to 576,230 BTC, worth over $62 billion today. Saylor’s average purchase price is $69,726 per Bitcoin. In that post, Kiyosaki quotes Saylor’s advice to “only invest in things a rich person will buy from you,” highlighting their shared belief that Bitcoin has evolved beyond a fringe asset. He noted that some of the most influential figures in finance now view it as a legitimate and serious store of value. Both men believe Bitcoin is a bulwark against inflation and misguided government monetary policy. As central banks keep printing money and global debt rises, they think Bitcoin will grow more valuable. Kiyosaki says BTC has a bright future Kiyosaki has been forecasting huge Bitcoin gains for years now. He reiterated his bold price target earlier this year: $500,000 per BTC. He thinks soaring inflation, ballooning debt, and economic uncertainty will lead more people to store value in Bitcoin. And he’s not alone. Other financial pundits also project strong growth for the crypto giant. Bitcoin has recently rallied to a new all-time high of $111,970.16 before its first small pullback. As of this writing, Bitcoin is priced at $107,424, according to CoinMarketCap . Even as prices have soared, analysts say the recent surge in trading activity indicates a robust demand from institutions and everyday investors. There are even a few spot Bitcoin ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) now, enabling folks to invest in BTC without learning how wallets and keys work. Meanwhile, nations and central banks struggle to cope with inflation, banking collapses, and their devaluing money. According to Kiyosaki, these challenges further bolster the case for Bitcoin.

In this environment, MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Cardano are emerging as the new favorites, each offering unique catalysts for exponential growth. Solana and Sui round out the watchlist, but the real momentum is building around presale-driven MAGA, where analysts see up to 15,000% upside on the horizon. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Standout With 15,000% Potential CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly distinguishing itself as the breakout presale of 2025, outpacing every new token in both demand and community engagement. Key highlights: Accelerated traction: From its launch, MAGA has climbed to the top of watchlists, drawing both retail and institutional investors with its clear vision and viral narrative. Record-breaking momentum: Analysts are now projecting 35x–50x returns, with some models suggesting up to 15,000% upside if momentum continues post-listing.

The token’s fundamentals remain robust, supported by regulatory clarity and real-world adoption. Yet, while XRP’s upside is strong, its growth curve is outpaced by the presale-driven surge of MAGACOIN FINANCE, making MAGA the preferred choice for those seeking rapid appreciation. Cardano (ADA): Double Bottom and New Bullish Trend Cardano is now in the early stages of a new bullish trend, with a double bottom pattern confirmed in May and price targets ranging from $0.66 to $1.88 for the year.

Sui is expected to trade between $1.99 and $3.82 in May, offering steady but less dramatic upside compared to MAGACOIN FINANCE.

XRP, SEI, and Cardano round out the watchlist, but the spotlight is firmly on MAGA and SOL as the next leaders of the crypto market. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Surge, 50% Bonus, and 13,800% Potential CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the breakout presale of 2025, with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearing completion. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling unprecedented demand from both retail and institutional investors. Key highlights: Scarcity-driven model: 100 billion tokens, 45% allocated to presale, creating a powerful supply squeeze. 50% bonus: Early buyers using the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code secure a 50% token bonus before the $0.007 listing target.

Solana (SOL): Technical Strength and Institutional Confidence Solana is consolidating between $158 and $175, with technical indicators pointing to a possible breakout above $175 toward $183 and beyond.

Cardano: Cardano is trading near $0.85, with bullish scenarios targeting $1.20–$1.50 by month’s end if momentum holds. While these assets offer solid fundamentals and steady growth, none match the explosive presale-driven momentum and analyst projections now surrounding MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin (BTC): Macro Anchor and Capital Rotation Bitcoin is currently trading above $112,000, with technical support at $110,000 and a projected range of $113,000–$140,000 for May and June if bullish momentum sustains. Institutional inflows remain robust, but as BTC’s upside moderates, more investors are rotating into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper returns. EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Conclusion Bitcoin’s breakout above $112,000 is setting the stage for a summer of altcoin momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE and Solana are emerging as the leaders of this new cycle, with MAGA’s presale drawing 13,800% ROI forecasts and Solana’s technicals hinting at fresh highs. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst confidence at record levels, MAGA is the breakout contender for 2025.

Wallets remain an insurance policy, says Wood “So ETFs for those who want the convenience, I don’t think, will lose a lot of their luster,” she said. “But they will be a stepping stone into wallet-based.” Wood reiterated the extra layer of protection that crypto wallets provide: “These are insurance policies against something going wrong in the traditional world.” Bitbo data suggests that there are around 200 million active Bitcoin ( BTC ) wallets worldwide. Meanwhile, the trading week ending May 23 saw approximately $2.75 billion inflows into US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs , coinciding with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22. Cathie Wood spoke to ETF analyst Eric Balchunas at Solana Accelerate on May 23. Source: Solana Since spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in the US in January 2024, approximately $44.49 billion in inflows have been recorded, according to Farside data. Meanwhile, spot Ether ( ETH ) ETFs have seen approximately $2.77 billion in inflows since launching in July 2024. Wood said that spot Ether ETFs were “less successful than people were expecting” because the US Securities and Exchange Commission did not allow staking . On May 21, the SEC delayed its decision on Bitwise’s application to add staking to its Ether exchange-traded fund. However, Wood still views Ether as the entry point for new investors to familiarize themselves with smart contracts before exploring other cryptocurrencies, such as Solana ( SOL ). “So they might start in the smart contract world with Ether, but once they study the technology, and follow the developers, and see the uptake by consumers, I think they will get there,” Wood said. Related: ‘We are worried about a recession,’ but there’s a silver lining — Cathie Wood Wood said that the launch of US President Donald Trump’s memecoin, Official Trump (TRUMP), in January on the Solana network may have caused investors to be skeptical of Solana. “Institutions and you’re saying 60-year-olds…I think they might be a little turned off by what happened with the Trump memecoin,” Wood said. Just days after its launch on Jan. 17, TRUMP slid around 50% after the president made no crypto-related “day one” executive orders . “I mean, that might scare them,” Wood said. Her comments came in response to ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reiterating the point that Bitcoin is “so easy” to explain to a “boomer or adviser” as being digital gold, but other cryptocurrencies “are tougher.” Wood said she is still finalizing her Solana price target and will share it once her research is complete. In April, ARK raised its “bull case” Bitcoin price target from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by the end of 2030 , primarily driven by institutional investors and Bitcoin’s increasing acceptance as “digital gold.” Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-25 03:20:22

Whales are making decisive moves—accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE, Solana, and XRP—while Bitcoin’s strong foundation sets the stage for the next wave of exponential gains. With analysts now forecasting up to 47x returns for MAGA, the window for early entry is rapidly narrowing. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Inflows, 50% Bonus, and 47x Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is cementing its status as 2025’s breakout presale, with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearing completion. On-chain data confirms a game-changing 72.95 ETH whale buy—valued at $133,743—marking the largest single early-stage crypto purchase of the year. Key highlights: Scarcity-driven model: 100 billion tokens, 45% allocated to presale, creating a powerful supply squeeze. Institutional-grade confidence: Whale purchases signal calculated, long-term positioning before public listings. 50% bonus: Early buyers using the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code secure a 50% token bonus before the $0.007 listing target. Analysts are projecting 35x–47x returns for MAGA, with some models suggesting even greater upside if listing momentum accelerates. As each stage fills, MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting the pace for early-stage gains before listings ignite the next phase of price discovery. Bitcoin (BTC): Macro Momentum and Whale Accumulation Bitcoin is trading at $106,342, just shy of its all-time high of $109,114. On-chain data shows supply on exchanges at its lowest since 2018, with whales pulling BTC into long-term storage—a sign of growing confidence in higher future prices. Institutional inflows remain robust, and analysts now target $125,000–$150,000 by year-end if momentum holds. Solana (SOL): Whale Bets and Ecosystem Growth Solana is consolidating around $172, with whales recently investing millions in ecosystem meme coins and core SOL positions. Technicals point to a possible breakout toward $200, with analysts forecasting $240–$260 if bullish trends persist. Whale activity is a clear vote of confidence in Solana’s continued rise. XRP: Accumulation Phase and Bullish Outlook XRP is trading at $2.42, with whales accumulating over 94 million tokens in recent days—worth more than $230 million. Analysts forecast a move to $2.85–$3.40 in the coming weeks, with $5.50 possible by year-end if ETF approvals and adoption accelerate. The number of large XRP wallets is rising, signaling growing influence from major investors. Avalanche (AVAX): Steady Growth, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Avalanche is priced at $24.72, with analysts projecting a bullish scenario of $56.83 for 2025. While AVAX’s fundamentals are solid, its near-term upside is overshadowed by the explosive presale-driven momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Conclusion Bitcoin’s strong base at $108,000 is anchoring the market, but the most aggressive capital is flowing into MAGACOIN FINANCE , Solana, and XRP. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 47x ROI, MAGA stands as the breakout contender for Q3 2025.

While ETH’s consolidation signals stability, the real action is unfolding in early-stage projects—none more so than MAGACOIN FINANCE, where presale momentum and community buzz are rapidly intensifying. With Solana, Aptos, and Bitcoin also in focus, traders are recalibrating for the next wave of growth. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: Accelerating Presale, 50% Bonus, and 35x+ Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly establishing itself as 2025’s most dynamic presale, with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral narrative are fueling record demand from both retail and institutional investors.Key highlights: Scarcity-Driven Model: Only 100 billion tokens, with 45% allocated to presale, creating a strong supply squeeze as demand rises. Community Surge: Over 20,000 holders and growing, with social buzz and presale trackers consistently ranking MAGA as a top pick. 50% Bonus: Early buyers can use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% token bonus, amplifying upside ahead of the $0.007 listing target. Analysts are projecting 25x–35x returns, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% if momentum continues. With every stage, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s trendline is steepening—making it the cycle’s breakout contender before listings ignite true price discovery. Ethereum (ETH): Sideways Action and Steady Inflows Ethereum is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, with technicals hinting at a possible breakout above $2,700 if bullish sentiment returns. Institutional inflows remain robust, and analysts expect ETH to test $2,800–$2,900 in June. While ETH remains a foundational asset, its near-term upside is now more measured compared to the rapid acceleration seen in MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana (SOL): Bullish Structure and Upside Potential Solana is trading between $158 and $175, with a breakout above $175 potentially leading to a retest of $183 and even $200 if momentum persists. The network’s high throughput and expanding DeFi ecosystem continue to attract capital, but the most aggressive traders are now rotating into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper returns. Aptos (APT): Quiet Growth, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Aptos is trading around $4.09, with forecasts suggesting a range of $2.79 to $5.38 for May 2025. While APT’s fundamentals remain solid, its near-term upside is less dramatic compared to the explosive presale-driven momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin (BTC): Macro Anchor and Capital Rotation Bitcoin is holding above $110,000, with strong institutional support and technicals pointing to a possible move toward $115,000 if momentum hold. As BTC’s growth steadies, more investors are rotating into high-upside altcoins—where MAGACOIN FINANCE is now leading sentiment and capital flows. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion Ethereum’s sideways movement is providing a stable backdrop, but the steepest trendline belongs to MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus , and analyst forecasts up to 35x–50x ROI, MAGA is the breakout name to watch as Q3 approaches.

As ADA consolidates above key support and eyes a push toward $0.85–$0.90, traders are looking for the next big rotation. While legacy tokens like Solana, Bitcoin, and TRUMP remain in the spotlight, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the high-conviction early-stage play—charting new support zones and capturing analyst attention with 35x ROI projections. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Surge, 50% Bonus, and 35x Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming 2025’s breakout presale, with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral narrative are fueling unprecedented demand.Key highlights: Scarcity-driven model: 100 billion tokens, 45% allocated to presale, creating a powerful supply squeeze. Community momentum: Over 20,000 holders and a record-setting whale buy, signaling high-conviction early interest. 50% bonus: Early buyers using the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code secure a 50% token bonus before the $0.007 listing target. Analysts are forecasting 25x–35x returns, with some models suggesting up to 3,500%–14,200% upside depending on entry stage and bonuses. As each stage fills, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out fresh support zones and positioning itself as the next cycle’s breakout opportunity. Cardano (ADA): Bullish Channel and Supply Shock Cardano is trading at $0.79, with strong support at $0.75 and bullish momentum building. Analysts are watching for a move toward $0.85–$0.90 in the near term, with some forecasting a breakout to $1.20 if resistance is cleared. Massive ADA withdrawals from exchanges and an ascending channel on the charts are fueling optimism for a supply shock-driven rally. Solana (SOL): Technical Strength and Institutional Confidence Solana is consolidating between $158 and $176, with a breakout above $175 potentially leading to $183 and beyond. Technical indicators remain bullish, and analysts forecast a possible move toward $200–$212 in the coming months. While Solana’s fundamentals are robust, the most dramatic growth potential is now unfolding in early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin (BTC): Macro Anchor, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Bitcoin is trading at $111,466, with forecasts suggesting a range of $110,000–$115,000 for late May. Institutional inflows remain strong, but as BTC’s upside moderates, more investors are rotating into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper returns. TRUMP Coin: Volatility and Speculative Appeal TRUMP coin is trading near $13.00, with a forecasted range of $9.50–$14.00 for May 2025. While its meme-driven appeal attracts speculative capital, its upside is overshadowed by the structured presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Conclusion Cardano’s strength above $0.75 and Solana’s bullish structure are impressive, but the most compelling early-stage momentum is in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 35x ROI, MAGA stands as the breakout contender for 2025.

Bitcoin has remained stuck at $108,000, while Ethereum remains at $2,500, and the market cap of all cryptocurrencies was at $3.39 trillion. This article looks at the top 3 cryptocurrencies to watch this week and the catalysts that will drive them. While many of them will be in the spotlight, the most notable ones are Cetus Protocol (CET), Aergo (AERGO), and Monero (XMR). Monero (XMR): Will it retest an all-time high? The first cryptocurrency to watch this week will be Monero, the biggest privacy token in the crypto industry. It will be in the spotlight because it has largely defied gravity in the past few months as it separated itself from the pack. Data shows that Monero token has jumped in the past seven consecutive weeks and it is not losing momentum. It jumped by 20% last week, after jumping by less than 5% a week earlier. Monero price has also retested the important resistance level at $400, a strong performance for a coin that bottomed at $99 last year. This surge has happened as investors embraced privacy coins following the end of Tornado Cash sanctions earlier this year. Analysts now believe that the end of these sanctions will help it receive more exchange listings since most of them delisted them a while back. Technically, Monero price has entered the markup phase of the Wyckoff Theory. This phase comes after the accumulation one that has little price action. It is characterized by high demand than supply and is then followed by the distribution. Therefore, the path of the least resistance for the XMR price is bullish, with the next point to watch being at $515, up by 27% from the current level. A drop below the support at $350 will invalidate the bullish outlook. Monero price chart | Source: TradingView Aergo (AERGO): in focus after a key vote Aergo token came in the spotlight in April as it jumped from a low of $0.050 in April to a high of $0.7158, a 1,355% surge that pushed its market cap to over $150 million. This rally happened after some popular exchanges like Coinbase, Upbit, OKX, and Bitget listed it. Aergo will be in the spotlight this week after a recent vote by the community members, who opted for the House Party Protocol. They agreed to launch it on Arbitrum instead of the Optimism Stack. The developers noted that Arbitrum was better suited because of its smarter resource management, ecosystem maturity, DeFi synergy, and network effect. Technically, Aergo price will be in focus because it has formed a falling wedge pattern, pointing to a potential rebound this week. If the pattern works well, the Aergo token may surge from $0.1590 to $0.2500. Aergo price chart | Source: TradingView Cetus Protocol (CET): What next after the hack? The other top crypto to watch will be Cetus Protocol, the biggest player in Sui’s network. Cetus will be in focus as the network was hacked last week, with hackers draining over $223 million. $162 million of these funds were stopped. Cetus noted that it was pursuing two approaches, including an on-chain vote by the Sui community to authorize the recovery of the frozen $162 million. This vote initially failed as Sui took a neutral stance. The developers also aim to reach a whitehat agreement with the hackers to recover the other funds. It is highly unlikely that the hackers will return the cash, and taking legal action against them will likely not work. Therefore, Cetus Protocol will be in the spotlight this week as investors wait for any new developments from the company.

As, Donald Trump’s announcement of a 50% tariff on the European Union , effective June 1, has reignited concerns. Despite this looming threat, ADA’s price has remained stable, indicating that the market has adjusted to such sentiments, with investors showing less volatility. Some experts even suggest that ADA’s current consolidation pattern may lay a healthier foundation for a potential breakout toward the $1 range. Additionally, this week, Messari released its Q1 report, highlighting some positive metrics despite Cardano’s financial challenges. The report indicates that the community remains resilient, focusing on long-term growth and stability. Keep reading to know more. Analyst Says Cardano Price Aims $1 Cardano’s price has been caught in a lengthy consolidation phase within a falling channel, largely influenced by ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and other countries . This trade climate pushed ADA price down to the $0.50 mark in April. However, a turning point came in mid-April when ADA began to recover, climbing to the upper boundary of the channel and reaching $0.85 in May. This rebound was fueled by a decrease in trade tensions, particularly after the UK signed a significant deal . However, recent tensions with EU resurfacing has left many investors worried, but knowing the threat ADA price has not fallen beneath key EMA’s, and until it doesn’t break key supports the bullish views remain intact. More to its price, a deep analysis of this week has been at the center of attraction. According to technical analysis from Dan Gambardello, the Cardano price action displays a markedly different pattern compared to its previous bull market cycle. He says, unlike the last cycle where ADA experienced a single dip after exiting the bear market before going parabolic, the current consolidation shows a more methodical approach with repeated pump and consolidate phases. This extended consolidation period is a “coiling” effect. He feels that Cardano price could smash $1 , if it meets all bullish conditions. Gambardello notes that this coiling behavior is not limited to Cardano price. The extended sideways movement has allowed for healthier price support levels, in other altcoin’s too. Additionally, Analyst Dan Gambardello uses Ethereum as a roadmap for altcoin performance. He noted that ETH is currently testing a multi-cycle trend line that has historical importance for the entire altcoin sector. Ethereum breakout would cause an altcoin move. It would be a more favorable time for tokens like Cardano crypto that have consolidated and formed technical bases in this extended build-up phase. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Bitcoin Ethereum and XRP Price Are Down Today? What Traders Need to Know Now , Cardano’s Report By Messari: Total Stablecoin Market Cap & ADA’s Treasury Balance Increased In a recent report, by Messari said that Cardano’s performance during Q1 2025 was tough. It revealed that its quarter was filled with challenges. As its native token, ADA price, took a hit, which led to a decline in its circulating market cap. Despite these hurdles, Cardano still made significant strides in governance, like the activation of the Plomin Hard Fork was the biggest accomplishment. Interestingly, the report further highlighted that, while the ADA price volatility affected its most of the market sentiment, but the commitment to staking still remained remarkably stable. The stats showed that the total staked ADA saw only a slight decrease of 1%, settling at 21.6 billion ADA. In contrast, some metrics performed exceptionally like the stablecoin market, messari said that it expanded by 30% to reach a market cap of $30.1 million. This increased was largely driven by the popularity of fiat-backed options like USDM, IUSD, USDA, and others. Additionally, Cardano’s treasury balance showed resilience, increasing by 5% quarter-over-quarter to 1.7 billion ADA. However, the U.S. dollar value of the treasury took a hit, dropping 19% to approximately $1.1 billion. Overall, while Cardano faced financial challenges, its governance advancements and stable staking commitment highlight the community’s ongoing dedication to the platform’s future. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Possibly. Analysts like Dan Gambardello suggest ADA is in a “coiling phase”—a bullish consolidation that may lead to a breakout. However, a confirmed move above $0.85 with strong volume is key before targeting $1. Can Cardano (ADA) break out of the current consolidation and surpass the $1 mark? If so, when? A breakout is possible if bullish conditions align, potentially leading to a $1 mark. While exact timing is uncertain, some analyses point to this happening in the coming days or weeks. What are the broader implications of the U.S.–EU trade tension on the crypto market in general? Renewed trade tensions can increase market volatility, as seen with Bitcoin’s recent dip. Crypto markets often react to such macroeconomic events, acting as risk assets. Is now a good time to accumulate ADA, or should I wait for confirmation of a breakout or breakdown? Some analysts see the current consolidation as a healthy foundation for growth, suggesting accumulation. However, it’s wise to consider personal risk tolerance and market indicators for confirmation.

Opinions vary, truth is singular",https://crypto.news/bitcoin-harmful-environment-opinions-vary/,"The level of Bitcoin mining energy consumption is on par with that of some countries. This statement is often mentioned as one of Bitcoin’s main drawbacks, as consumption takes its toll on the environment. However, Bitcoin advocates argue that things are not that simple, and in some ways, Bitcoin is an eco-friendly technology. How come, and who’s right? Proof-of-work The Bitcoin network is protected from spam attacks with a mechanism known as “proof-of-work.” The earliest installment of this algorithm was created by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor in 1993, long before Bitcoin’s emergence. The essence of this mechanism is the requirement to make calculations (do the “work”) in order to get permission to cast a transaction (originally, to send an email). Transaction validation requires performing calculations to filter out bad actors. The network rewards them with bitcoins that haven’t been in circulation to incentivize validators. That’s how bitcoins are “mined;” that’s why the validation process is called “mining.” In the early days of Bitcoin, mining wasn’t demanding. Anyone could mine it using a regular PC. However, as the demand for Bitcoin grew, the mining difficulty increased, requiring more and more energy to complete the math tasks. These days, mining operations have an industrial scale. Mining farms occupy extensive facilities of devices created for the only purpose–to crack Bitcoin puzzles at the highest speed possible (to solve the puzzle before the rest of the miners and get the reward). By 2018, the Bitcoin network’s energy consumption reached a level comparable to Nigeria and Denmark. Bitcoin’s environmental impact Bitcoin mining operations impact the environment in four main directions: Mining has a carbon print Mining consumes much water Mining consumes much electricity Mining creates electronic waste Based on all of these metrics, Bitcoin has a serious impact on the environment. These metrics indicate that Bitcoin consumes as much electricity and water and leaves as much harmful waste as in some countries. While it may be hard to comprehend what it means when you read that Bitcoin consumes as much power as Poland, you may zoom in and see the equivalents of each Bitcoin transaction’s impact. It pictures a much more vivid picture. According to Digiconomist , one Bitcoin transaction consumes over 1,100 kW/h (as much as an average U.S. household in 38 days), consumes 17,500 liters of fresh water (as much as a backyard swimming pool), creates over 280 grams of electronic waste (more than 1.5 iPhones 12), while the carbon emissions amount to 620kgCO2 (as much as 1.3 million transactions of VISA or watching 11.7 years of videos on YouTube). Statista provides similar estimations . More than that, gold mining is less harmful to the environment than BTC mining if we compare the amount of BTC and the amount of gold with the same value expressed in USD. Although no precise date is associated with these estimations, the articles seem to rely on data revealed in 2023 or earlier. Tesla cited environmental impact as the reason for stopping support for Bitcoin payments in 2021, shortly after the launch of this option. Ethereum transitioned from proof-of-work to a greener proof-of-stake algorithm in 2022. Read more: Tesla to Halt Bitcoin Payments due to ‘Environmental Concerns’ Fossil fuels power most mining facilities. Various sources evaluate the use of fossil fuels to power Bitcoin mining at a range from 50 to 90 percent. What Bitcoin advocates say… First, the Digital Assets Research Institute denies that the data and articles about Bitcoin’s environmental harm are correct. According to this study, flawed 2018 research suggesting the high environmental harm of Bitcoin was quoted thousands of times until 2024. Accurate articles amounted to only 2% of all pieces on the topic. DARI’s paper claims that 2022 was marked by a shift toward more rigorous coverage of Bitcoin’s environmental impact theme. As the environmental impact of mining is a serious problem, various mining operations began to look for ways to greener Bitcoin mining, and the search was successful. The 2020s initiatives saw companies using the excess power for Bitcoin mining instead of wasting this power and the resources spent on its production. a NYC bathhouse is mining bitcoin and using the excess waste energy to heat their pools. or, in other words, they're heating their pools as they would ordinarily do, and monetizing the excess power that exists as a byproduct of that process. this is demonstrably a carbon… pic.twitter.com/V0VeDwBicy — nic carter (@nic__carter) June 22, 2023 Another way to make Bitcoin mining greener is to rely on renewable resources. For instance, Ethiopia is using its Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam for clean Bitcoin mining. The 2024 studies show that, lately, Bitcoin mining has played a positive role in reducing CO2 emissions, becoming the straight opposite in terms of environmental impact. Although some companies already boast they are carbon-neutral Bitcoin mining operations, most enterprises only admit to reducing energy consumption. As no institution that studies Bitcoin’s environmental impact has all the info about mining operations, we don’t have all the data regarding CO2 emissions associated with mining. We can’t say how much the pollution level dropped in the last couple of years. Pierre Rochard of Riot Platforms appeared in a video in which he meters the CO2 level in the mining facility using a special device. It drew some criticism as some users pointed out that the emissions are not coming from the mining devices but are associated with excessive electricity production. Dude, the CO2 concern is supposed to be related to energy generation to power the CPUs, not the CO2 emission of the CPU themselves. — Snake Sanders (@snake_sanders1) April 10, 2023 Another line of defense used by some Bitcoin advocates is comparing Bitcoin’s environmental impact to that of the banking system, indicating that bank transactions are not more eco-friendly than Bitcoin. This argument may have made sense if Bitcoin were to replace the banking system, but this is not happening. Who’s right? Although the Bitcoin mining industry is far from eco-friendly, various participants seek ways to make it greener or even reduce CO2 emissions through Bitcoin mining so that mining would have a negative carbon footprint. According to a recent report by MiCA Crypto Alliance, 70% of the Bitcoin network will be powered by sustainable energy by 2030. To conclude this, we may state that certain mining operations are green while others are not. However, an eco-friendly trend is on the rise.

Let’s break down what’s happening on the charts right now and what could be in store for XRP in the short and medium term. Short-Term XRP Price Action XRP recently experienced a mild pullback, following the broader crypto market’s cooling trend. The price dropped below a key retracement level but managed to find solid support around $2.30 — a level analysts had been closely watching. This price area between $2.30 and $2.34 served as a safety net, with XRP bouncing off its lower boundary. However, if the price begins closing daily candles below $2.30, and fails to quickly reclaim it, the chances of further decline increase. In that case, the next important support lies around $2.10 to $2.15. Is the Bullish Trend Still Intact? Despite recent pullbacks, the broader trend for XRP remains bullish for now. The price continues to form higher highs and higher lows, a classic sign of an uptrend. What the market is seeing right now is more of a temporary pause in that bullish momentum. As for resistance, immediate pressure sits at $2.44, while a more important resistance zone stretches from $2.55 to $2.62. Overcoming these levels would be a crucial step for bulls to regain control. A Possible Inverse Head and Shoulders Forming? Interestingly, if XRP continues to pull back towards $2.10–$2.15 and bounces from there, it could lay the groundwork for a massive inverse head and shoulders pattern on the daily chart. This classic bullish formation often signals a major trend reversal if confirmed. At the moment, this pattern isn’t confirmed — it’s only a possible setup to monitor. But if it does take shape and XRP manages to break above the golden pocket retracement zone afterward, it could open doors to a powerful rally. In fact, if the pattern plays out fully, analysts predict XRP could aim for targets beyond $3, potentially setting new all-time highs. Source: TradingView One scenario that some analysts are considering involves a five-wave decline structure already unfolding from the recent high. If this plays out, XRP could be working on a Wave 2 retracement now, before potentially heading lower again to test major support levels. Micro-resistance levels to watch in this scenario include the $2.35 to $2.44 range. A rejection here could keep downward pressure intact in the coming sessions.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-25 04:57:35

While XRP’s technical momentum and regulatory clarity keep it in the headlines, the real rotation is unfolding into early-stage tokens—especially MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is now leading analyst forecasts with up to 39x upside potential. With Ethereum and Injective also on the radar, Q3 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal period for strategic portfolio shifts and breakout gains. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Surge, 50% Bonus, and 39x Potential CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing the spotlight as the breakout presale of 2025 , with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full. Its capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling unprecedented demand from both retail and institutional investors. Key drivers: Scarcity-driven model: 100 billion tokens, 45% allocated to presale, creating a powerful supply squeeze. 50% bonus: Early buyers using the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code secure a 50% token bonus before the $0.007 listing target. Analysts are projecting 25x–39x returns, with some models suggesting even higher upside if momentum continues. As each stage fills, MAGACOIN FINANCE is solidifying its reputation as the top early-stage opportunity for the next cycle. XRP: Bullish Breakout and Institutional Catalysts XRP is trading near $2.45, supported by regulatory wins, ETF speculation, and robust whale accumulation. Technical indicators show a breakout setup, with analysts forecasting a move toward $2.85–$3.40 in the near term and $5.50–$7.00 by year-end if momentum persists. While XRP’s growth is steady, the most aggressive capital is rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper upside. Bitcoin (BTC): Macro Strength and Capital Rotation Bitcoin is holding above $111,000, with institutional inflows and ETF demand fueling its recent all-time highs. Analysts see BTC potentially reaching $118,000–$131,000 in the coming weeks, but its ROI from current levels is more measured—prompting many investors to seek higher multiples in altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Injective (INJ): Steady Growth, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Injective is trading near $13.17, with price forecasts suggesting a move toward $16.02 by year-end. While INJ’s fundamentals are solid, its near-term upside is less dramatic than the explosive presale-driven surge of MAGACOIN FINANCE. EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Ethereum (ETH): Stability and Ongoing Adoption Ethereum remains a cornerstone, consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900. Analysts expect ETH to target $2,800–$2,900 in the near term, but the most dramatic growth potential is now unfolding in early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Conclusion Bitcoin’s strength and XRP’s momentum are impressive, but the most compelling action is unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 39x ROI, MAGA stands as the breakout contender for Q3 2025.

The listing came with up to 20x leverage and over 40 collateral options, marking a major step forward for the project. But despite this big news, Pi’s price has struggled to find stability. Earlier this month, PI briefly rallied to $1.60, but has since fallen and is currently trading near $0.76. $PI @PiCoreTeam perpetual futures now live with up to 20x leverage Why choose Kraken Pro futures: 40+ collateral options 360+ markets Open PI perp https://t.co/NHHpKobugb *geo restrictions apply pic.twitter.com/aiJrJRbxW4 — Kraken Pro (@krakenpro) May 23, 2025 A lot of this has to do with the token’s complex situation around regulations and the way it was launched. Like many crypto projects, Pi Network has taken steps to avoid direct regulatory scrutiny by handling its coin issuance in a careful, sometimes confusing way. Pi Network Price Prediction PI Network has broken out of a falling wedge pattern after dropping 50%, showing signs of recovery. The next key level to watch is $0.84 — if it breaks above this, it could confirm the breakout and open the path to targets at $0.96, $1.20, and 1.57. Some predict Pi could rally to $5 in the future, which sounds unbelievable at first since it would give it a market cap of over $30 billion. But because there’s so little liquidity, it’s technically possible for its price to spike much higher than expected in the short term, especially if the team is actively managing supply and demand. Much of Pi’s future price action will depend on its upcoming roadmap milestones. The Pi Network website lists dozens of them, including plans to let users migrate more of their Pi coins to the mainnet and convert Fireside tokens into Pi coins. These moves could either release more coins into the market or tighten supply even further, both of which would affect the price.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-25 05:27:32

ETH is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, while Solana trades in a tight range near $170, both supported by bullish technicals and growing institutional adoption. Yet, the real buzz is building around MAGACOIN FINANCE—a presale altcoin whose community growth and upside projections are dominating analyst conversations. Avalanche (AVAX) also remains on the radar, but MAGA is rapidly emerging as the must-watch contender for outsized returns. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Momentum and 11,000% Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting the pace for early-stage altcoins in 2025, with Stage 8 live, over $8 million raised, and unmatched demand from both retail and institutional buyers.Key highlights: Scarcity-driven model: 100 billion tokens, 45% allocated to presale, creating a powerful supply squeeze. Community surge: Over 20,000 holders, with presale trackers and analyst dashboards ranking MAGA as the #1 presale of the year. 50% bonus: Early buyers using the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code secure a 50% token bonus before the $0.007 listing target. Analysts are projecting 35x–50x returns as a conservative estimate, with some models suggesting up to 11,000%–18,500% upside if momentum continues. As each stage fills, MAGACOIN FINANCE is solidifying its reputation as the breakout early-stage opportunity of 2025. Ethereum (ETH): Steady Gains and Bullish Structure Ethereum is trading between $2,400 and $2,900, with technical indicators pointing to a possible breakout toward $2,800–$2,900 if bullish sentiment holds. The network’s resilience, Layer 2 growth, and institutional adoption continue to support ETH’s long-term outlook, but its near-term upside is now more measured compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana (SOL): Bullish Momentum and Institutional Confidence Solana is consolidating around $170, with analysts watching for a breakout above $175 to retest $183 and potentially reach $240–$260 later this year. While Solana’s fundamentals are robust and its ecosystem continues to expand, traders seeking sharper returns are increasingly rotating into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Avalanche (AVAX): Quiet Strength, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Avalanche is forecasted to move between $17.7 and $91.1 in 2025, with a bullish reversal expected as key support levels hold. While AVAX’s fundamentals are strong, its near-term upside is less dramatic than the presale-driven surge of MAGACOIN FINANCE. EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Conclusion While Ethereum and Solana maintain steady momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is registering the heaviest community surge and most dramatic growth potential. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 11,000% ROI, MAGA stands out as the breakout altcoin to watch for 2025.

With over 13% gains in May 2025 alone and institutional ETF inflows piling in, the king of crypto is pulling markets into a bull run. That means altcoin season is back on. As BTC blazes a trail, traders are eyeing new breakout stars, and it’s not just XRP this time. SUI brings speed and DeFi strength, while Remittix (RTX), the $0.07 PayFi disruptor, is delivering instant crypto-to-fiat payments, minus the legal baggage. If you missed the last bull run, find out why this could be your second shot. Bitcoin price hits $111K, enters uncharted territory The Bitcoin price smashed through $111,000 on May 22, 2025, its highest ever, after months of consolidation. Institutional demand , led by firms like Strategy and advocates like Michael Saylor, has transformed this rally from retail hype into institutional validation. Source: CoinMarketCap With a market cap now at $2.21 trillion, Bitcoin’s dominance is reinforced by regulatory clarity , bank adoption (JPMorgan included), and looming legislation like the GENIUS Act. As macroeconomic tensions ease and lawmakers embrace crypto frameworks, Bitcoin’s breakout signals more than momentum, it reflects a maturing asset class finally embraced by the financial establishment. XRP gets Wall Street boost with new ETFs XRP just became more accessible thanks to two new ETFs, XRPI and XRPT , now trading on Nasdaq. These funds let everyday investors tap into XRP without needing a crypto wallet, private keys, or a crypto exchange. XRPI mirrors XRP’s price 1:1, ideal for simple investing. XRPT offers 2x daily exposure, aimed at more aggressive traders. Both ETFs are backed by XRP futures, making it easier to trade through regular brokerage accounts. This move follows rising demand for regulated crypto products and brings XRP closer to the mainstream. While convenient, investors should still be cautious as XRP’s price can swing fast. SUI’s secret sauce: powering real-world assets and web3 with blazing speed SUI is emerging as a powerful XRP substitute, offering real-time, secure blockchain data integration through partnerships with OMG Assembly and Microsoft Fabric . Its support for Soulbound Tokens enables tokenization of real-world assets like commodities and private credit, an evolution of XRP’s original use case. Source: CoinMarketCap With a stablecoin supply exceeding $1 billion and seamless Web3 development via Move and zkLogin , SUI powers scalable DeFi apps on a Layer 1 chain. As seen on the chart above, in May 2025, its price surged nearly 30%, peaking near $4.2 and stabilizing around $3.8, signaling strong institutional interest and long-term viability in global finance and payments. Remittix: the crypto-to-fiat game changer giving xrp a run for its money Remittix stands out as a next-gen substitute for XRP, built to deliver what XRP promised: instant, borderless payments, while fixing key flaws. Its core offering allows users to convert 50+ cryptocurrencies into 30+ fiat currencies instantly and send them to any bank account worldwide. The recipient doesn’t even need to know it originated from crypto, making it seamless for real-world adoption. What makes Remittix even more compelling is its flat-fee model, with no hidden FX or wire transfer charges. It runs on the Ethereum blockchain (ERC20), is fully audited with zero issues, and operates with a peer-to-peer architecture that removes middlemen and central control. Transactions are recorded immutably, ensuring total transparency. Security and autonomy are central to its design. High-grade encryption, combined with user-controlled funds, means no custodial risk. Remittix doesn’t just match XRP, it upgrades the model. Altcoin season is official. Are you ready? Altcoin season isn’t coming, it’s here. With Bitcoin blazing into uncharted territory above $111K, the ripple effects are lighting up the rest of the market. XRP may be back in the spotlight, but fresh contenders like SUI and Remittix are stealing the show. If you’re looking for the next big breakout, the timing might be perfect.

Rennick says Bitcoin will go to $1 million but is a “Ponzi Scheme” “Bitcoin will ultimately go to $1 million dollars. Why because it’s a Ponzi scheme whereby BlackRock will pump more and more dollars into a supply constrained product,” Rennick said. “What exactly will this product produce?” Rennick said. He added that Bitcoin ( BTC ) will produce “absolutely nothing” and Australia “needs real engineers not financial engineers.” Source: Gerard Rennick Bitcoiners across the world were quick to respond to Rennick’s comments. The Australian Bitcoin Industry Body (ABIB) said Rennick’s remarks about “Bitcoin reveal a deep misunderstanding.” The ABIB added: “This matters, because misunderstanding leads to misrepresentation. And misrepresentation leads to bad policy.” Unchained podcast host Laura Shin said , “You also can’t eat the internet, so do you oppose that too?” Bitcoin Marathon team lead Jimmy Kostro said , “This is definitely going to age well. Please enlighten us with more of your deep and nuanced understanding of Bitcoin.” Source: Coinvision Rennick responded to the criticism and said he doesn’t “need to explain anything.” “It’s pathetic how the Bitcoin community needs reassurance from a politician - the very people they claim they want to be free from,” Rennick said. The Bitcoin community has frequently spoken out when prominent individuals have expressed anti-Bitcoin views.

Prominent crypto analyst VirtualBacon, just shared that he might finally buy XRP , but only if a few key signs play out. So, what’s making him consider XRP now, after all these years? Watching the XRP/BTC Ratio VirtualBacon isn’t basing his decision on XRP’s dollar price. Instead, he’s watching how it performs against Bitcoin (XRP/BTC). Further he points out that the XRP/BTC chart has been showing weakness since 2017, forming a long downtrend. But recently, something interesting has developed, the chart is showing signs of a rounded top with strong support at 0.000022 BTC. I’ll buy $XRP when this happens I’ve never held $XRP . But that might be about to change. One key signal is setting up and if it triggers in the next 3–6 months, I’ll finally add $XRP to my portfolio. Here’s what I’m watching — VirtualBacon (@VirtualBacon0x) May 24, 2025 If this level breaks and XRP drops another 20–23%, he believes it will enter the “value zone,” between 0.000017 and 0.000019 BTC. That’s where he plans to buy, around the $1.80 price level. VirtualBacon’s Trade Plan According to VirtualBacon, this is the cleanest XRP setup he’s seen in two years. His plan looks like this: Wait for XRP/BTC to drop 20–22% Enter around the $1.80 price zone Watch for a breakout in the BTC ratio Likely timeframe: next 3 to 6 months He’s not rushing in. Instead, he’s preparing in advance, ready to act when the signal is clear. Why XRP Could Revive Other Coin This trade isn’t only about making gains. VirtualBacon believes a breakout for XRP could revive other older coins that have been forgotten in recent years like Cardano, Stellar, HBAR, Algorand, and XDC. Unlike Ethereum and Solana, which have gained strong reputations with institutions and retail respectively, XRP has always stood out for one reason, mass recognition.

He also says XRP will take only a few months to reach $10 to $20. According to the pseudonymous pundit, the current XRP price, hovering around $2.35, is significantly undervalued when considering its long-term potential. He believes that, in the coming years, XRP could reach as high as $1,000 per coin. In a recent post on X, BarriC declared that the token remains a “steal” at anything below $3, pointing to what he views as an eventual major price shift. $XRP will become very expensive to buy in the next few months and the next few years Right now, you can accumulate $XRP below $3 And somehow that’s considered a failure When $XRP skyrockets over the next few months and hits $10-$20 per #XRP That’s the new all time high… — BarriC (@B_arri_C) May 17, 2025 While XRP has recorded a year-over-year increase of 356%, outperforming assets like Ethereum, Solana, and BNB, BarriC acknowledged the growing sentiment that the asset’s progress since early 2025 has been underwhelming. However, he remains optimistic that XRP is nearing a turning point. “XRP Below $3 Is a Failure”? Not for Long, Says BarriC BarriC maintains that current doubts about XRP’s performance are misplaced. He highlighted that despite its multi-hundred percent annual gains, many market participants remain skeptical due to the token’s sideways movement over recent months. BarriC expects this sentiment to shift sharply if XRP reaches new highs during the next altcoin rally. He forecasts a short-term move to $10 and then $20 per coin, marking what he believes will be XRP’s new all-time high range. He also warned of a possible retracement after hitting those levels: “we will see an approximate 50% market dip into the bear market,” he noted. Should that happen, he believes prices in the $5 to $10 range would still represent strong value and remain higher than where XRP currently trades. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 These projections form part of his broader thesis that XRP is undergoing a major transformation in how it is perceived and utilized. BarriC Foresees Utility-Driven Path to $1,000 Valuation Looking further ahead, BarriC outlined a bold vision where XRP becomes a key player in global financial infrastructure. He envisions banks and major financial entities adopting the token for routine transactions and cross-border payments. Barric argues that if XRP is adopted widely for global settlements, demand will increase substantially and drive the price toward $1,000 per coin . In his view, such a valuation would be accompanied by reduced price swings, positioning XRP as a utility-based asset rather than a speculative one. He believes this transformation could occur within the next decade. His long-term outlook relies on the assumption that Ripple’s partnerships with central banks , financial service providers, and liquidity firms will continue to grow and deepen. These relationships, he argues, could form the foundation of a more utility-centered value model for XRP. Lofty Price Targets Face Skepticism Despite BarriC and others’ strong convictions, many market analysts remain skeptical. Critics point out that reaching a $1,000 price target would require a price increase of over 42,000% from current levels. More importantly, XRP would need to command a total market capitalization of approximately $58.5 trillion—a figure that exceeds the GDP of most major economies. Nevertheless, support for long-term projections like BarriC’s continues to gain traction within segments of the XRP community. Advocates believe that the asset’s utility and ongoing development will eventually validate these ambitious goals, even if it takes another 10 years or more.

45070439,https://timestabloid.com/?p=68405,1748154511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Is Now Exposed to the Wall Street Financial World. Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-is-now-exposed-to-the-wall-street-financial-world-heres-the-latest/,"A significant development in the digital asset investment landscape has been announced by crypto enthusiast Kenny Nguyen, who shared on social media that Robinhood has launched access to a leveraged XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). The investment product, known as the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF, is now available on the Robinhood trading platform. Nguyen calls this an initial step toward broader institutional adoption and integration of XRP into mainstream financial markets. According to the screenshot shared, the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF, ticker symbol XXRP, is currently trading at $37.86. It has recorded a daily gain of $0.59, equivalent to a 1.63% increase, with an overnight surge of $1.03 or 2.80%. This is the 1st step to major adoption with accredited investors & financial institutions. XRP is now exposed to the wall street financial world. They are ready to load their bag when Spot XRP ETFs kick in full gear. The 2nd step is ETFs approval, so get ready for 6/17/25. https://t.co/jIsWphJ5sc — Kenny Nguyen (@mrnguyen007) May 23, 2025 The ETF is designed to offer 2x leveraged exposure to the daily price movement of XRP, allowing investors to potentially amplify their gains or losses based on the performance of the underlying asset. The fund’s current daily trading volume is 418,931, suggesting significant retail and possibly institutional interest. Robinhood Lists Leveraged XRP ETF Launching Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF on Robinhood represents a substantial growth in the availability of crypto-related financial products to a broader investor base. Teucrium is a regulated issuer primarily known for its commodity ETFs. Its entrance into the XRP market via a leveraged fund signals expanding legitimacy for XRP within the U.S. financial system. The listing on Robinhood, a platform popular with retail and institutional users, enables increased access to XRP-focused trading strategies through a regulated environment. Kenny Nguyen’s Statement on Institutional Readiness In his tweet, Kenny Nguyen highlighted the larger implications of this listing, stating, “This is the 1st step to major adoption with accredited investors & financial institutions.” According to Nguyen, this move exposes XRP to the Wall Street financial ecosystem. He indicated that this milestone may prompt institutional participants to begin building positions ahead of the launch of spot XRP ETFs. Anticipation Builds for June 17, 2025 Nguyen concluded his post with a hint toward a future development he described as the next major phase for XRP, writing, “The 2nd step is ETFs approval, so get ready for 6/17/25.” While no official confirmation has been issued regarding a scheduled decision date for a spot XRP ETF approval, the statement suggests expectations within the community that regulatory progress may occur on or around that time. Growing Legitimacy in Regulated Markets Robinhood’s decision to list a 2x leveraged XRP ETF expands XRP’s accessibility and positions it more prominently within the regulated investment space. While leveraged ETFs carry inherent risks and are generally intended for short-term trading by experienced investors, their presence on major retail platforms can also serve as a precursor to more conservative products. If regulatory agencies approve a spot XRP ETF, it would further confirm XRP’s evolution from a digital asset associated with retail speculation to a structured financial instrument recognized by institutional markets. Nguyen’s tweet underscores the growing alignment between the digital asset ecosystem and traditional finance. With this first step now active on Robinhood, the crypto market’s eyes will likely turn to the next milestone Nguyen referenced—potential ETF approval by mid-2025.

As a result, the appetite among participants, developers, and enterprises for high-utility crypto projects is rising. Whether it’s reducing settlement friction, increasing data transparency, or powering permissionless financial applications, only a handful of projects are truly shaping the next era of Web3.One of the most talked-about opportunities right now is Qubetics (TICS) —a protocol that is combining real-world utility with powerful token economics to stand out in a crowded market. With features tailored for enterprise-grade adoption and one of the most robust presales in progress, Qubetics is making a clear case as one of the top cryptos to buy this month . Alongside it, well-established projects like SUI and Optimism continue to deliver high-performance capabilities that attract developers and Web3-native communities alike. This article offers an expert-level breakdown of all three. Qubetics (TICS): Seamless Cross-Border Transactions with 100x Infrastructure Upside Qubetics is fast becoming the go-to infrastructure for instant, secure, and cost-efficient cross-border transactions, bringing a layer of practical utility that many Layer-1s lack. At the core of its architecture is a smart, high-speed engine that bypasses the inefficiencies of SWIFT networks, centralized intermediaries, and slow international remittance systems. A mid-sized tech consultancy in Berlin needing to pay its freelance teams in Vietnam and Argentina. Using Qubetics, the company can execute multi-currency payments in seconds, with full on-chain verification, minimal fees, and no dependence on local banks or fiat exchanges. A decentralized gaming studio in South Korea can issue automated revenue shares to content creators in Europe via smart contracts—without ever dealing with wire transfers or intermediaries. Even NGOs can use the Qubetics protocol to transparently distribute international funding to field offices across multiple regions. These real-world cases demonstrate how Qubetics solves the operational bottlenecks faced by both global businesses and independent professionals. In an increasingly borderless economy, this type of value flow technology is not optional—it is essential. Combined with Qubetics’ broader features like wallet integrations, chain interoperability, and compliance options, its use case appeal continues to expand. Its growing presale traction has further cemented its reputation among the top cryptos to buy this month , attracting attention from early adopters across multiple regions. Qubetics Presale Details and Analyst Projections Qubetics is currently in Stage 35 of its ongoing crypto presale . Over 513 million $TICS tokens have already been sold to more than 26,900 holders, helping the protocol raise $17.3 million. The token is currently priced at $0.2785, presenting a unique window for early buyers to secure access before full network launch. Analysts closely tracking Qubetics expect the token to outperform based on its expanding utility. If $TICS reaches $1, participants could see 258% ROI. Projections for $5, $6, $10, and $15 indicate potential returns of 1,694%, 2,053%, 3,489%, and 5,284%, respectively. These scenarios are grounded in market demand for interoperable cross-border infrastructure and the protocol’s maturing technical roadmap. With growing real-world integration potential and a rapidly scaling community, Qubetics is a leading contender for those targeting high-impact blockchain projects this month. SUI: High-Performance Infrastructure for Scalable Web3 Applications SUI is a purpose-built Layer-1 blockchain developed by Mysten Labs, designed to optimize for throughput, scalability, and low-latency user interactions. Its unique architecture is built on the Move programming language and leverages parallel execution to offer sub-second finality—making it especially attractive for dApps requiring high responsiveness such as Web3 games, digital identity systems, and microtransaction platforms. A defining feature of SUI is its object-based data model, which treats on-chain data as programmable assets. This gives developers the ability to design more dynamic and responsive smart contracts with lower overhead. For instance, a decentralized social platform built on SUI can customize content interaction rules in ways that aren’t possible with account-based systems like Ethereum. SUI’s native token plays a pivotal role in governance, transaction fees, and validator incentives. It also fuels on-chain storage, giving developers efficient tools for long-term dApp maintenance. The platform supports both community and enterprise deployment, with partnerships spanning gaming studios, DeFi protocols, and digital collectibles ecosystems. Developer activity on SUI is accelerating, with its testnets and mainnet drawing significant engagement due to the ease of integration, cost-efficiency, and performance optimization. With a clear roadmap, developer-friendly infrastructure, and a strong focus on real-time user experience, SUI continues to serve the needs of both professional dApp builders and newcomers seeking rapid onboarding. As one of the most technically advanced Layer-1 chains currently in deployment, SUI holds strong weight among the top crypto platforms to track or accumulate this month. Optimism: Ethereum Layer-2 Built for Cost Efficiency and Ecosystem Growth Optimism is a rollup-based Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, offering reduced gas fees and increased transaction throughput while maintaining full Ethereum security. By using optimistic rollups, it offloads computation and data storage from Ethereum’s main chain, drastically reducing congestion without compromising decentralization. Optimism is particularly appealing to developers building consumer-facing dApps, DeFi platforms, and NFT marketplaces. It allows for Ethereum compatibility with significantly lower costs, enabling teams to retain EVM tools and smart contracts without rebuilding architecture from scratch. The network’s retroactive public goods funding model sets it apart. Community contributors are rewarded based on their impact after they’ve delivered value—fostering a unique incentive layer that motivates open-source development and decentralized innovation. As a result, Optimism’s ecosystem has expanded rapidly, including integrations with Chainlink, Uniswap, Synthetix, and hundreds of other projects. Optimism also introduced the OP Stack, a modular framework for creating customizable Layer-2 and Layer-3 chains. This has opened new opportunities for enterprise-grade solutions and regional rollups that need specific compliance, fee structures, or throughput requirements. From a broader perspective, Optimism is helping Ethereum scale without sacrificing user or developer experience. Its success represents a future where applications remain decentralized but operate with the speed, affordability, and interface quality expected in mainstream products. For those focused on Ethereum-native scalability solutions, Optimism is an essential part of this month’s buy list. Final Thoughts With the crypto landscape constantly expanding, clarity around the value of infrastructure projects is more important than ever. Real utility, ecosystem expansion, and protocol resilience are the new benchmarks for identifying promising assets—and this month, three platforms clearly rise to the top. Qubetics leads with its powerful cross-border transaction system, combining on-chain finality, security, and global utility under one banner. Its presale success and token projections highlight growing conviction across the blockchain community. The platform’s practical relevance, especially for enterprises and professionals needing interoperable financial rails, gives it unmatched upside potential heading into the next market phase. SUI delivers elite performance and execution speed with its object-centric design, opening doors for gaming, social, and DeFi use cases. It is an ideal choice for those who value high throughput and programmable smart asset logic. Optimism, meanwhile, remains the most accessible and scalable Ethereum Layer-2, offering developers the familiarity of EVM with the benefit of low-cost, high-throughput architecture. Its incentives and open infrastructure model position it as a leader in decentralized development and Ethereum’s broader roadmap. For participants aiming to act on the top cryptos to buy this month, Qubetics, SUI, and Optimism offer not just speculative potential, but lasting impact through innovation.

Mega Whale Wynn Bet $1.25B on It,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-to-121k-next-week-mega-whale-wynn-bets-1-25b-on-it/,"After recently hitting a new all-time high, Bitcoin (BTC) has retraced to the $108,000 level. Still, one whale is betting billions that the number one cryptocurrency will defy the chaos caused by U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest tariff bombshell and rocket to $121,000 within days. The $1.25B Gamble High-stakes trader James Wynn, known for his jaw-dropping leverages, has doubled down on a $1.25 billion BTC long position with 40x leverage, despite a rollercoaster week that saw his unrealized losses briefly hit $321 million. “THE SWINGS ARE INSANE,” Wynn tweeted Thursday after clawing back to a slim profit. “WHALES WANT ME GONE!!!” According to market tracker Lookonchain, his liquidation price is $105,180, which, at Bitcoin’s current value, is just a 3.5% dip away from total wipeout. However, the razor-thin margins seem not to have affected the trader’s bullishness, proclaiming a target for BTC in the coming week. “$118k – $121k next week,” he posted on X Saturday morning, doubling down even as volatility surged. Not long after, he returned to the social platform, sharing a screenshot showing $4.2 million in unrealized profit on one of his trades, which had earlier been $59 million underwater. “Built different,” the self-described meme coin maxi flexed. Can the Market Keep Up? But not everyone is buying the hype. Analyst Daan Crypto Trades called Wynn’s trade “insanity,” arguing that closing even a fraction of his position could shift Bitcoin’s price. “Every 1% BTC candle equals a $10M PNL swing,” he warned. Another pseudonymous market watcher, Innerdevcrypto, speculated that Wynn’s public bravado might be a play for clout. “That liquidation price is too close,” he pointed out. “I wonder if there is not some ulterior motive to him doing this.” To add fuel to the fire, President Trump’s latest tariff threats, including a 50% import tax on EU goods and a 25% Apple-specific levy, have shaken global markets. Bitcoin slipped over 3% on Friday, briefly dipping to around $107,600, with crypto intelligence platform Santiment warning the development had caused traders to change strategies to “holding and ‘hoping for the best.’” Meanwhile, Lookonchain revealed that Wynn had dumped his ETH and SUI longs, burning $5.3 million in losses, to go all-in on BTC. That kind of conviction, or recklessness, depending on your point of view, has set the stage for what is sure to be an interesting new week. Will the maverick whale’s $121,000 prediction come true to see him win big, or will he be eaten alive by the sharks circling around $105,000? UPDATE: More recent data from Lookonchain, though, shows that Wynn closed the entire $1.25 billion long position a few hours ago, which even caused a price slip for BTC on Hyperliquid. Top trader @JamesWynnReal closed all 11,588 $BTC ($1.25B) long positions an hour ago, losing ~$13.4M.

Then came the cooldown. Prices dropped, attention faded, and critics resurfaced. But Cardano kept building, in silence, with purpose. Now, a new wave of optimism is emerging, and this time, it’s powered by AI. Crypto enthusiasts are turning to ChatGPT to simulate possible futures based on market cycles, adoption rates, and historical benchmarks. One scenario is turning heads: Cardano hitting $7 by 2026, potentially breaking into the top five cryptocurrencies by market cap. It’s a bold projection, but not without basis. With major upgrades like Hydra and Mithril rolling out, and long-term ambitions across developing nations, Cardano’s fundamentals are aligning with the kind of growth story AI models love to explore. So, how realistic is this $7 price tag? And what would it take for ADA to go from quiet contender to crypto heavyweight? Let’s break it down, one data point at a time. Cardano’s quiet climb: can ADA hit $7 and crack the crypto top 5? Back in 2021, Cardano reached its all-time high of about $3.10, cementing its place as one of the major players in crypto’s last bull market. Fast forward a few years, and many investors are asking: if the next cycle mirrors the last, could ADA double or even triple that high? A $6 to $9 price tag doesn’t seem so far-fetched, especially in a market where momentum is everything. ADA monthly price movement. Source: CoinMarketCap Price alone doesn’t tell the whole story, though. Market cap is where the real battle for top-five status happens. With around 35 billion ADA in circulation, a $7 price would give Cardano a market cap near $245 billion. That’s serious territory, enough to rival the likes of Binance Coin or even make Ethereum glance over its shoulder, depending on how the broader market evolves. But hype won’t carry it there. Cardano has been quietly rolling out major upgrades, Hydra for scaling, Mithril for fast syncing, and smart contract improvements that open doors to DeFi and real-world use. Founder Charles Hoskinson has long championed adoption in Africa and government partnerships, and if even a fraction of those plans stick, Cardano could capture an entirely new wave of users and developers. Source: ChatGpt The idea of ADA hitting $7 by 2026 isn’t some wild guess. It’s a speculative model many are playing with, including through tools like ChatGPT. Feed in historical data, layer on market growth assumptions, and account for rising adoption, and suddenly, that future doesn’t feel so distant. Still, it’s important to separate simulation from certainty. AI can model outcomes, but the market has the final say. Cardano’s path to $7 depends on more than code, it hinges on community, trust, and real-world impact.

Garlinghouse emphasizes the ETF’s pivotal role in bridging traditional finance with the burgeoning crypto industry. Ripple’s CEO argued that ETFs institutionalized the crypto industry Speaking on Ripple’s “Crypto in One Minute” podcast episode, Garlinghouse explained two key reasons behind the increasing momentum for crypto ETFs. First, he claimed ETFs offered a direct trading option for institutional investors. Before these exchange-traded funds, investors could only trade through exchanges or self-custody, and ETFs changed that. He commented, “This was really the first time you had institutions be able to go on Wall Street and trade directly in crypto.” He added that ETFs allow capital previously excluded to enter the market through a familiar and regulated structure, enabling institutional investors to avoid the complexities and risks of self-custody and centralized exchanges. Second, he argued that ETFs are institutionalizing the crypto industry, changing perception among traditional investors. He even cited Bitcoin ETFs as evidence, hinting that investors view these crypto products as legitimate asset classes similar to gold ETFs. So far, multiple institutions have submitted filings to the US Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC), seeking approval for their XRP, Litecoin, Solana, and Dogecoin spot ETFs. Many crypto analysts believe the SEC will most likely approve spot XRP ETFs next. According to Polymarket, traders are placing the probability of a Ripple spot XRP ERF being approved in 2025 at 83%. CME’s head of crypto products, Giovanni Vicioso, agreed that interest in XRP has risen, adding that market participants are seeking regulated derivatives tied to a broader array of digital assets. Garlinghouse’s comments are making the rounds on social media, with many lauding his ability to articulate how game-changing the crypto ETFs’ on-boarding of institutions could be. These developments come as the crypto ETF market matures in a defining moment for embedding digital assets into traditional financial systems.

According to their SEC filing on May 21, the ETF will indirectly invest in the future of the Ripple-linked token via its Cayman Islands subsidiary. The new product, $XRPI, will also invest at least 80% of its net assets in XRP-linked instruments, including futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Volatility Shares is preparing to release a 2x XRP futures ETF, designed to deliver twice the daily returns of XRP by providing double leveraged exposure to XRP futures. Teucrium already launched a 2X XRP ETF in April and trades roughly $35 million daily. Seeing Teucrium’s success, Balchunas believes there will be good demand for Volatility Shares 2X XRP ETF. John Deaton argues Ripple executives could be excellent picks for a crypto Mount Rushmore Lawyer John Deaton believes some of Ripple’s executives could make the cut for a crypto Mount Rushmore for their contributions to the crypto industry. Deaton explained that Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb could be a perfect pick for the crypto Mount Rushmore for his efforts in creating XRP and the XRP ledger. Ripple CTO David Schwartz also caught the lawyer’s attention for his work in developing the XRP ledger and an early patent predating blockchain technology. Deaton also mentioned Ripple CEO Brad GarlingHouse for launching the RLUSD stablecoin and acquiring Hidden Road . Also on Deaton’s list were the anonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. He argued that Buterin makes a list for introducing smart contracts and decentralized applications. Deaton also named Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell, and Custodia Bank founder Caitlin Long as potential candidates. Strategy CEO Michael Saylor is also in the running list for leading his company in building its Bitcoin reserve. So far, Strategy holds 576,230 BTC. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The second should help Pioneers reset their passwords in a more secure and efficient way if needed. New Apps The blog post begins by laying out the five new applications that will be available in the Mainnet Ecosystem Interface, which, according to the team, signals “continued growth across the Pi app landscape.” The first is a snake game app, perhaps influenced by the iconic snake game in the early Nokia phones from two decades ago. The second is an e-commerce app, while the rest are focused on information about the PI token. All applications met the network’s standards for quality, completeness of functionalities, evaluation of utility, and compliance with the overall ecosystem guidelines and policies. The team emphasized the importance of these standards, as not all Mainnet-ready applications are and will be listed on the Mainnet if they don’t meet all of them. The five applications in question are already available for users worldwide. Such additions should boost developer confidence that their projects could be next in line as the ecosystem “becomes a more attractive and rewarding space to build in.” Account Recovery There have been a few complaints online about the account recovery process, which some claimed was not secure enough. The team has addressed those issues by implementing a new process that should provide clarity and straightforwardness. If a user (Pioneer) has set up a “trusted” email, they will receive a password reset link, which is the new addition to the already existing methods. This option should make account recovery “more accessible and reliable while ensuring security since email recovery is simpler and cheaper for users, and reliable in general, e.g., no dependency on local telecommunications carriers.” For more information on the overall Pi Network ecosystem and latest developments, you can check this article .

Bold Call From Bybit Executive,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-125k-by-end-of-q2-bold-call-from-bybit-executive/,"Bitcoin could climb higher before June wraps up, if today’s momentum holds. According to Shunyet Jan, Head of Derivatives at Bybit, the world’s second-largest crypto exchange, a move to $125,000 by the end of Q2 is on the table. That’s a jump of about 16% from current levels near $108,000. It’s a bold call, but Jan ties it to clear rules, steady fund flows and a sliding US dollar. Related Reading: Investors Pour $2.75 Billion Into Bitcoin ETFs As Price Skyrockets Bitcoin: Bold Price Forecast Jan set the $125,000 target in a market update on Thursday. He argues that if big players keep buying, Bitcoin can make that climb from roughly $108,100 today to $125,000 in five weeks. It’s a tight window. The weeks ahead will matter most as prices test new highs and traders look for clues on follow-through. Bybit’s Head of Derivatives Predicts Bitcoin Could Reach $125K by End of Q2 — WF (@WhaleFUD) May 24, 2025 Three Main Drivers Regulatory clarity tops Jan’s list. Based on reports, the new GENIUS Act gives stablecoins defined rules, which could help banks and funds feel safer about crypto. He also mentions spot Bitcoin ETFs. These funds have pulled in fresh capital, offering a straight path for institutions to own Bitcoin. Finally, Jan points to a weaker US dollar. When the dollar dips, Bitcoin often shines as an alternative store of value, his view goes. Altcoin Outlook Mixed While Bitcoin gets the green light, Jan warns that smaller tokens may struggle. He says high interest rates and global uncertainty might limit gains for Ethereum and other major altcoins. If money slows or risk appetite wanes, altcoins could lag behind Bitcoin’s rally. Traders aiming beyond BTC may need to pick their spots more carefully. Other Expert Predictions Jan’s view isn’t alone. Scott Melker, host of The Wolf of All Streets podcast, thinks Bitcoin could hit $250,000 by December 31, 2025. He notes BTC’s volatility has fallen from about three times that of the S&P to under two times. On another front, Adam Back of Blockstream sees an even steeper climb to between $500,000 and $1 million per coin this cycle. Michael Saylor, CEO of Strategy, adds that recent hiccups below $150,000 are tied to short-term holders exiting. He says longer-term investors are moving in through spot ETFs and corporate buys.

A surprise hawkish move from the Federal Reserve or a fresh regulatory twist could sway prices just as much as demand. If Bitcoin breaks toward $125,000, it would mark a major milestone. But as always, timing matters nearly as much as price targets.

Yet, as the market’s attention sharpens, early-stage capital is rotating into Ethereum and MAGACOIN FINANCE—two assets now highlighted for their explosive upside potential in the next cycle. Bitcoin, XRP, and Litecoin round out the list of key names to watch as Q3 2025 approaches. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Surge, 50% Bonus, and 10,600%+ Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the breakout presale of 2025 , with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling unprecedented demand.Key highlights: Scarcity-driven model: 100 billion tokens ensures a supply squeeze as demand intensifies. Secure and transparent: HashEx-audited contracts and rapid community growth. 50% bonus: Early buyers using the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code secure a 50% token bonus before the $0.007 listing target. Analysts are projecting 25x–35x returns, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% upside if momentum continues. As each stage fills, MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting the pace for early-stage gains before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. Ethereum (ETH): Bullish Structure and Institutional Inflows Ethereum is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, with technicals pointing to a potential breakout above $2,700 if bullish sentiment holds. The network’s resilience and growing institutional adoption are fueling optimism, with price forecasts for June targeting $2,700–$2,900. While ETH remains a core holding, its near-term upside is now being matched by the rapid acceleration of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin (BTC): Macro Anchor and Capital Rotation Bitcoin is trading above $108,000, with strong institutional demand and technical support at $107,000–$111,000. While BTC remains the market’s foundation, its upside is increasingly seen as more measured, prompting many investors to diversify into high-growth altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Volatility and Rotating Capital XRP is consolidating between $2.35 and $2.65, with analysts forecasting a move to $2.80–$3.40 if momentum returns. However, short-term volatility and profit-taking pressure have led many traders to seek sharper returns in early-stage projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. Litecoin (LTC): Bullish Signs, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Litecoin is holding above $90, with technicals suggesting a bullish continuation toward $100–$110. While LTC remains a reliable hold, its upside is less dramatic than the explosive presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion Solana’s bullish setup and Ethereum’s resilience are impressive, but the most dramatic growth potential is now unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE . With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 10,600% ROI, MAGA is the breakout contender for Q3 2025.

John Woeltz, 37, was arraigned on Saturday in Manhattan criminal court following his arrest on Friday. He stands accused of holding a 28-year-old Italian man captive for weeks inside a luxury townhouse in Soho, reportedly rented for $30,000 per month. According to police reports cited by The New York Times, the victim arrived in the US on May 6 and was allegedly abducted by Woeltz and an accomplice. The attackers are said to have stolen the man’s passport and electronic devices before demanding the password to his Bitcoin ( BTC ) wallet. When he refused, the suspects allegedly subjected him to prolonged physical abuse. Source: Mario Nawfal Related: Violent crypto robberies on the rise: Six attacks that targeted investors Crypto victim beaten, electroshocked The victim described being beaten, shocked with electricity, assaulted with a firearm and even dangled from the upper floors of the five-story building. He also told police that Woeltz used a saw to cut his leg and forced him to smoke crack cocaine. Threats were also reportedly made against his family. Photographic evidence found inside the property, including Polaroids, appears to support claims of sustained abuse. The victim managed to escape on Friday and alert authorities, leading to Woeltz’s arrest. Woeltz was charged with four felony counts, including kidnapping for ransom, and entered a plea of not guilty. Judge Eric Schumacher ordered him to be held without bail. He is expected back in court on May 28. A 24-year-old woman was also taken into custody on Friday in connection with the incident. However, she was seen walking freely in New York the next day, and no charges against her were found in the court’s online database. Authorities have yet to clarify the relationship between the suspect and the victim or whether any cryptocurrency was ultimately stolen.

On May 18, Amsterdam-based private firm Infinite Risks International reported a rise in requests for bodyguards and long-term protection contracts from high-profile figures in the space. French authorities have responded by introducing enhanced protections for crypto entrepreneurs and their families, including security briefings and priority access to police assistance. This comes amid a recent surge in kidnappings and ransom attempts. David Balland, the co-founder of hardware wallet company Ledger, was kidnapped in January 2025 and held for ransom for several days before being rescued by French police . In May 2024, the father of an unnamed crypto entrepreneur was freed from a ransom attempt after French law enforcement officials raided the location in a Paris suburb where the individual was being held hostage by organized criminals.

Pseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 66,400 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin is at risk of repeating its 2021 bull market top, when BTC lost all momentum after failing to rally above a cycle high of about $69,000. “We had a breakout [at $60,000 in 2021]. You really don’t want to see that breakout get stuffed. And the moment we closed below $60,000, I was like, ‘Okay, this is kind of [messed up].” Source: DonAlt/YouTube After Bitcoin failed to hold $60,000 in November 2021, BTC witnessed a multi-month downtrend that drove the crypto king to prices below $20,000. Now, DonAlt is warning that Bitcoin might be in a similar position as it struggles to convincingly take out its last resistance at $110,000. “And you can argue the same here. I don’t necessarily think $104,000 is good enough, but it would be an early warning sign if we start losing it. And then you can make the comparison easier. And then a little bit of a better warning sign, I think, is around $100,000, where we start getting into danger territory. And then if we start dipping down there, all bets are off, and then time to run probably.” Source: DonAlt/YouTube At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $107,590.

The platform is scheduled to go live by the end of June and aims to function as a retail-oriented equivalent of “Hidden Roads,” a firm known for serving institutional players in digital asset markets. Curated Clip Maybe it's XRP Ledger, @FlareNetworks , Ethereum, or @SuiNetwork , and bring that yield back to you on the #XRP Ledger.

More to follow! pic.twitter.com/G3dTVjcZff — Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) May 23, 2025 Yield Generation Across Multiple Blockchains The video, labeled as a “Curated Clip” by Crypto Eri, features Tutar explaining the core mission of MoreMarkets. He describes the service as a bridge for retail users to access yield opportunities by deploying idle XRP into various blockchain environments. These include the XRP Ledger, Flare Networks, Ethereum, and Sui Network. According to Tutar, the yield generated from these sources is returned to users directly on the XRP Ledger. A Platform Geared Toward Everyday Investors Tutar emphasizes the accessibility of the platform for retail investors. He notes that the system is designed for individuals who may contribute as little as $10 or $50 worth of XRP. The process involves routing the digital assets into markets that offer reliable yield generation, with a strong focus on security, auditability, and transparency. He confirms that MoreMarkets conducts thorough vetting of the protocols and networks it engages with. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Team Experience and Broader Strategic Vision In the conversation, Crypto Eri positions MoreMarkets as a solution tailored to the average retail user, contrasting it with Hidden Roads, which she suggests operates primarily in the institutional space. Tutar concurs that while Hidden Road has been active in servicing Ripple and other institutions, MoreMarkets will serve a distinct segment. He adds that MoreMarkets draws on the expertise of a team with experience at companies like Neoprotocol and financial institutions, including Deutsche Bank and Nomura. According to Tutar, the platform’s use of the XRP Ledger as a settlement layer for yield distribution represents a key innovation. By integrating with various blockchain ecosystems for yield generation and centralizing yield delivery on the XRP Ledger, MoreMarkets intends to offer a streamlined experience for retail participants. With the projected launch set for the end of June, further updates from MoreMarkets are anticipated. Crypto Eri concludes her tweet with “More to follow,” indicating that additional information will be shared in the coming weeks.

Many altcoins have posted notable gains on a weekly scale, led by HYPE, while SUI and XRP have retraced the most from the larger caps. BTC to $108K It all began last Sunday evening when BTC broke out of its weekend calmness and shot up from $103,000 to almost $107,000. It faced immediate resistance there and was pushed south on Monday. The scenario repeated once again as the business week progressed, but the bulls took complete control of the market on Wednesday. After a minor pullback, the cryptocurrency went hard on the offensive in the afternoon and jumped past $109,100 to market a new all-time high. The bears were quick to intercept and drove bitcoin back down to $106,500, but that was another short-lived correction. By Thursday morning, BTC had resumed its run and skyrocketed to almost $112,000 (on Pizza Day) to register a new all-time high. More volatility ensued on Friday when US President Trump recommended new tariffs against the EU, and bitcoin slipped by several grand almost immediately.

45071994,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=734122,1748158200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45071994.jpeg,Solana Price Prediction: SOL to $1000 or MUTM to $1—Which One Will Multiply Faster?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/sol-to-1000-or-mutm-to-1which-one-will-multiply-faster/,"Solana (SOL) has long been hailed as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in, thanks to its lightning-fast transactions and growing developer ecosystem. After recovering from previous market turbulence, SOL is once again climbing the charts, recently trading at $166, with bullish analysts projecting a potential breakout to $1,000 in the next bull cycle. But while SOL promises long-term strength, its high price tag limits explosive short-term returns. That is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters the picture. With still an entry price, Mutuum Finance just requires a little push to deliver massive returns, making it among the best new cryptos in which to invest today. Mutuum Finance presale is currently in stage 5 of presale after selling out of the fourth one. Its presale has raked in more than $9.1 million, adding over 11,000 holders. Investors are rushing in at $0.03 before the token jumps 16.67% to $0.035. Today’s investors are set for a 100% return on investment when the project finally comes out at $0.06. Solana’s Road to $1,000: Can the Top Altcoin Deliver a 6x Gain in 2025? Solana (SOL), currently at $166 and still one of the best cryptos to invest in as we go deeper into 2025’s bull trend, has ultra-fast transactions and scalable blockchain. Solana weathered the recent market corrections and came back stronger than ever. Analysts now predict a potential jump to $1,000 based on renewed developer activity, DeFi expansion, and increased institutional appetite. While this kind of move would be well over a 6x return, it suggests confidence in Solana to close the gap with Ethereum in terms of utility and speed. For investors looking for even greater upside possibility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is just starting to make waves at much lower prices. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows Its groundbreaking two-way lending model has made Mutuum Finance take center stage as far as speedy adoption by users is concerned. That more than 11,000 investors have invested $9.1 million in the presale is a testament to the success of the project. MUTM token will cost $0.035 in Phase 6 which means its price is set to appreciate by 16.67%. That presents investors with an opportunity for high returns. Through both market demand and strong lending approaches, MUTM is an intriguing DeFi project that could be worth $1 after launch. DeFi with a Hybrid Lending Approach Mutuum Finance is unique in that it combines both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. Through the P2C model, users are able to accrue passive income through USDT liquidity pools, reaping the advantage of automated lending by smart contracts. On the other hand, the P2P model facilitates direct-to-peer transactions without the involvement of an intermediary, giving users complete control over their funds. By hybridizing these two models, Mutuum Finance enhances security, efficiency, and decentralization, which is a perfect offer for DeFi investors seeking high-yielding alternatives. Rewarding Early Investors and Growing the Community Mutuum Finance is encouraging people to join by offering attractive rewards. Ten lucky users will be given $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and by inviting friends to join, users can earn as more rewards. While Solana (SOL) aims for a 6x gain to $1,000, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers potentially greater short-term upside with a presale price of just $0.03. Over 11,000 investors have contributed $9.1 million, and with the price set to rise 16.67% soon, early buyers can lock in 100% ROI at launch. MUTM’s unique dual lending model and growing community position it as a promising DeFi contender ready to surge toward $1 or beyond. Don’t miss your chance to join the MUTM presale before prices increase. Secure your tokens now and be part of the next DeFi breakthrough.

45072245,https://timestabloid.com/?p=68413,1748158860,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Google Gemini Predicts XRP Price for the End of 2025,https://timestabloid.com/google-gemini-predicts-xrp-price-for-the-end-of-2025/,"With XRP trading at $2.31 and major ongoing developments like CME’s recent launch of XRP futures and ongoing developments in the Ripple vs. SEC case, many investors are looking ahead to where the asset could be headed by the end of 2025. To get a forward-looking perspective, we asked Google’s Gemini AI to provide a price prediction based on current trends, legal factors, and market cycles. Gemini has high expectations for XRP, projecting that the digital asset could reach between $3.50 and $6.00 by late 2025, depending on several key conditions. Key Drivers Behind Gemini’s Forecast Gemini emphasizes that the end of the Ripple-SEC case is central to a bullish scenario. The AI notes that this development will increase investor confidence and push XRP’s price above $3 again. XRP has not reclaimed this level since its decline in early February, and both parties have now reached an agreement and are trying to get the court’s approval . The second driver is the anticipated regulatory clarity. Gemini expects more well-defined crypto regulations to emerge by the end of 2025 under Donald Trump’s administration. In this context, XRP may benefit because of its already-defined use case in global cross-border payments. Third, Gemini factors in market cycles. If Bitcoin maintains an upward trend, historical patterns suggest that altcoins like XRP often follow in the latter stages of a bull run. This correlation could support higher XRP valuations, especially if positive sentiment in the broader market persists into late 2025. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Gemini also considers the potential impact of the continued adoption of Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) platform. Greater institutional use of these services may validate XRP’s practical utility and could help justify a valuation closer to the upper end of the prediction, around $6.00. A New All-time High for XRP The upper range of Gemini’s prediction is much higher than XRP’s all-time high of $3.84, suggesting that the asset could experience the exponential growth the community has been eager to see for years. While the outlook is optimistic, Gemini also outlines a bearish scenario. If the SEC case is not resolved soon or if there is a broader downturn in the cryptocurrency market, XRP’s price could fall short of the projected range. In such cases, Gemini estimates that XRP could trade within a lower range of $1.50 to $2.50. While the current price remains lower than many expect, a favorable market could help XRP reach the new all-time high that Gemini predicted.

While ETH’s consolidation signals stability, the real action is unfolding in early-stage projects—none more so than MAGACOIN FINANCE, where presale momentum and community buzz are rapidly intensifying. With Solana, Aptos, and Bitcoin also in focus, traders are recalibrating for the next wave of growth. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: Accelerating Presale, 50% Bonus, and 35x+ Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly establishing itself as 2025’s most dynamic presale, with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral narrative are fueling record demand from both retail and institutional investors.Key highlights: Scarcity-Driven Model: Only 100 billion tokens, with 45% allocated to presale, creating a strong supply squeeze as demand rises. Community Surge: Over 20,000 holders and growing, with social buzz and presale trackers consistently ranking MAGA as a top pick. 50% Bonus: Early buyers can use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% token bonus, amplifying upside ahead of the $0.007 listing target. Analysts are projecting 25x–35x returns, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% if momentum continues. With every stage, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s trendline is steepening—making it the cycle’s breakout contender before listings ignite true price discovery. Ethereum (ETH): Sideways Action and Steady Inflows Ethereum is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, with technicals hinting at a possible breakout above $2,700 if bullish sentiment returns. Institutional inflows remain robust, and analysts expect ETH to test $2,800–$2,900 in June. While ETH remains a foundational asset, its near-term upside is now more measured compared to the rapid acceleration seen in MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana (SOL): Bullish Structure and Upside Potential Solana is trading between $158 and $175, with a breakout above $175 potentially leading to a retest of $183 and even $200 if momentum persists. The network’s high throughput and expanding DeFi ecosystem continue to attract capital, but the most aggressive traders are now rotating into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper returns. Aptos (APT): Quiet Growth, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Aptos is trading around $4.09, with forecasts suggesting a range of $2.79 to $5.38 for May 2025. While APT’s fundamentals remain solid, its near-term upside is less dramatic compared to the explosive presale-driven momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin (BTC): Macro Anchor and Capital Rotation Bitcoin is holding above $110,000, with strong institutional support and technicals pointing to a possible move toward $115,000 if momentum hold. As BTC’s growth steadies, more investors are rotating into high-upside altcoins—where MAGACOIN FINANCE is now leading sentiment and capital flows. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion Ethereum’s sideways movement is providing a stable backdrop, but the steepest trendline belongs to MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus , and analyst forecasts up to 35x–50x ROI, MAGA is the breakout name to watch as Q3 approaches.

Following Bitcoin’s surge past $111,000. Farina compared potential returns from Bitcoin to those from XRP. He emphasized that buying Bitcoin at current levels and expecting it to reach $500,000 would yield only a 355% gain, whereas buying XRP at $2.40 and seeing it rise to $100 would result in a 4,066% gain. “Make the right choices,” he concluded, suggesting that while Bitcoin may seem like a good option, a critical look at both assets shows that XRP will give much better returns. Let’s do some math: Buy BTC at $110K, it goes to $500K → ~355% gain Buy XRP at $2.40, it goes to $100 → 4,066% gain Make the right choices!

He argues that most crypto holders do not own a full Bitcoin and are unlikely to see life-changing returns from the asset at current prices. According to Farina, “Most investors don’t even have $10,000 in their bank accounts,” and buying BTC now provides limited growth potential compared to alternative digital assets. This limited growth is clear when comparing both assets, as a recent analysis showed that XRP has grown 490% since 2022 , while Bitcoin has risen by only 10%. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Manipulation Concerns and Utility-Based Alternatives Farina argues Bitcoin’s surge is driven by propaganda and low liquidity, not real demand. He claims manipulation via Tether (USDT) skews prices, and public celebration over Bitcoin reaching six figures is misplaced, as most investors won’t benefit. Farina highlights XRP, XLM, HBAR, and Algorand as better risk-reward plays, citing their real-world utility and lower market caps. He notes XRP’s rise from $0.50 to $2.40 as a strong example. He believes buying XRP at current prices is a no-brainer , and contrasts its growth with Bitcoin’s 30% gain during the same timeframe, despite significantly higher volatility and far lower upside. Questioning Bitcoin’s Long-Term Viability Farina questions Bitcoin’s long-term viability, citing high fees, poor scalability, and criticism from institutions like the IMF and ECB. He claims utility-based assets like XRP and XLM have more potential. He recalls selling his car to invest in Bitcoin at $16,000, only to cash out at $64,000 for a 4x return. He says those gains were modest compared to his returns from XRP bought at lower prices. For new investors, he sees limited upside and advises focusing on undervalued projects with real-world use , not hype-driven legacy assets, as Bitcoin’s big gains have been in the past.

Unilabs (UNIL) , a new altcoin, is slowly gaining momentum and may challenge Ethereum’s dominance in 2025. Powered by advanced AI and innovative DeFi investment strategies, Unilabs offers smart, automated portfolio management. This offering, coupled with other rewards and perks, could make Unilabs one of the best DeFi projects in the market. Binance Coin (BNB) Targets $700 Resistance The Binance Coin price has been retesting the $680 level in the past few days but bulls have held their ground. The cryptocurrency is currently starting an uptrend on the weekly chart. Its value has soared by 5.3% in this timeframe. Going forward, the Binance Coin price could climb to $700 based on technical analysis. Technical indicators such as the RSI show that buying pressure is high, supporting more upside. Rose Premium Signals in a recent post on X said the Binance Coin price chart was strong. The expert predicts the Binance Coin price is about to enter discovery. If this happens, the BNB price could climb to $743 and $789 in the next few weeks. Another expert, BATMAN said the Binance Coin price has formed a bullish flag and is waiting for a breakout. The analyst expects the Binance Coin price to soar to $700 when this happens. Analyst Forecasts Uptrend For Ethereum (ETH) Rose Premium Signals tweeted recently that the Ethereum price has broken from a descending trendline. It has also turned the former resistance zone at $2,000-$2,200 into a strong support. As long as the Ethereum price stays above this breakout zone, Rose Premium Signals says its value might climb higher. The analyst believes the Ethereum price is gearing up for the next leg up. They posted three potential targets which are $3,063, $3,566, and $4,201. At the moment, CoinMarketCap data indicates the Ethereum price has risen on the weekly timeframe by 4.5%. Meanwhile, the head of research at OnchainHQ, Leon Waidmann revealed that the Ethereum network has witnessed massive growth. The number of weekly active addresses has been above 15 million. Also, over 564k addresses are active on multiple chains. This ecosystem growth could push the Ethereum price to new levels in the months ahead.

Physical phishing tactics mark a shift from online-only attacks, raising new concerns for crypto security. Fake Ledger Live apps are targeting macOS users with trojanized malware designed to steal recovery phrases. A new phishing scam is targeting crypto holders through traditional mail, with scammers impersonating hardware wallet maker Ledger and sending fake letters urging users to “validate” their wallets or risk losing access to funds. BitGo CEO Mike Belshe was among the first to flag the attack, sharing an image of the fraudulent letter, which included a QR code — likely linked to a phishing site designed to steal private keys. Crypto Scammers Turn to USPS in Shift to Physical Phishing Attacks The letters have reportedly been delivered via the United States Postal Service (USPS), signaling a shift in tactics from digital to physical social engineering. Troy Lindsey, another recipient of the letter, warned others on social media: “These are all scams. Do not fall for any of these.” I got the same one last week I took and had @grok analyze it. These are all scams do not fall for any of these!! pic.twitter.com/ZFNpQpujqA — Troy Lindsey (@TroyandOlga) May 24, 2025 The warning echoes growing concerns about phishing schemes that leverage physical credibility to trick crypto users into exposing sensitive data. The attack comes amid a rise in crypto-related phishing cases. In April, $330 million in Bitcoin was stolen from an elderly victim, a heist confirmed by blockchain investigator ZackXBT. He linked the crime to individuals operating from a scam call center in Camden, UK. Meanwhile, Coinbase disclosed earlier this month that it was the target of a ransom attempt after customer support contractors leaked user data. The attackers demanded $20 million, which the exchange refused to pay. While Coinbase stated that no private keys or account access were compromised, the leaked data included names and contact information. TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington criticized the exchange , warning that breaches of this kind could lead to real-world harm for exposed customers. Fake Ledger Live Apps Target macOS Users Last week, cybersecurity firm Moonlock warned that a wave of malware attacks targeting macOS users is exploiting trust in Ledger Live, a popular crypto wallet management app. Moonlock warned that malicious actors are using trojanized clones of Ledger Live to trick users into entering their recovery phrases through convincing pop-ups. “Within a year, they have learned to steal seed phrases and empty the wallets of their victims,” the team stated, noting a major evolution in the threat. One of the primary infection vectors is the Atomic macOS Stealer, a tool designed to exfiltrate sensitive data such as passwords, notes, and crypto wallet details. Moonlock discovered it embedded across at least 2,800 compromised websites. Once installed, the malware quietly replaces the genuine Ledger Live app with a fake one that triggers fake alerts to harvest seed phrases. The moment a user enters their 24-word recovery phrase into the phony app, the information is sent to servers controlled by the attacker.

The new Galileo testnet introduces a host of improvements over its predecessor, including a 70% boost in network speed. The V3 testnet moves 0G closer to its mainnet launch, which will form a decentralized AI operating system for an array of data-intensive applications. Galileo gives dapp developers a clear idea of the sort of scalability and performance they can look forward to, including throughput of up to 2,500 TPS. We spoke with Funder and CEO of 0G Labs, Michael Heinrich, to better understand Galileo. Galileo notably boasts a 70% performance boost, achieving up to 2,500 TPS with an optimized CometBFT consensus. Can you elaborate on the specific technical enhancements made to achieve this throughput increase compared to V2? We learned a lot during the course of running Newton, our V2 testnet. The unprecedented demand from users to access Newton took us by surprise, but proved to be a blessing in disguise since it allowed us to identify chokepoints and develop solutions to overcome these. These findings have been incorporated into Galileo, which is better engineered to prevent mempool congestion and has greater bandwidth to avoid maxing out resources during peak times. With Galileo, we’ve rebuilt our testnet from the ground up, incorporating the latest EVM standards and enhancing the consensus efficiency with BLS signature to deliver a sleeker, more modular, and altogether more scalable network that can handle anything that’s flung at it. So far, all the benchmarks point to Galileo being streets ahead of its predecessor: from inference workloads to modular memory systems, it’s effortlessly handling it all, aided by more RPCs and compute to cope with high demand. The V2 testnet saw impressive traction with 2.5 million unique wallets and 350 million transactions. How is the 0G team planning to leverage Galileo’s strengths to further engage the developer and user community, and what feedback from the V2 testnet shaped Galileo’s development? We actually saw more than 5M wallets, we’re fortunate to have so many users already onboarded and engaging with 0G in various ways, be it as developers, infra partners, or end users. Because their attention is already invested in the 0G ecosystem, having the majority of them accompany us to Galileo has been smooth. From the perspective of regular users, we’re confident that the improved faucet system will ensure fair test token distribution, allowing everyone to participate on an equal basis. On V3, they’re going to encounter a much faster chain that’s capable of handling anything that’s thrown at it. Coupled with the capabilities that devs have at their disposal, now Galileo is running the Ethereum Engine API and is fully Pectra compatible, and we’re confident that we’ll be able to lure more EVM developers into the fold. In an early test 0G has already hit 2GB per second in data throughput (and multiples more coming), and compute and the service marketplace are also running better than ever in terms of benchmarks, it’s an exciting time to be building on 0G and we can’t wait to see which direction different developer teams move in now they have all these powerful tools at their disposal. How many subsequent testnets are planned before mainnet launch, and will Galileo’s state be retained so that applications built on it can be easily migrated to subsequent testnets and eventually mainnet? Given we re-architected Galileo completely, this will be the final testnet before 0G’s mainnet release, so developers and users alike can be confident that the V3 experience will be very close to what they’ll encounter on mainnet. We will add more features like infinite scalability and increasing the speed per shard to 10,000 tps. From a user perspective, what are some reasons to play around with the Galileo testnet and what are some of the tasks and experiences available on V3 for non-technical users to discover? Everyone loves new, and there’s a lot that’s new on Galileo and that will be of interest to ordinary users almost as much as to developers. It’s a chance to get a feel for what the next generation of smart contract chains is capable of in terms of performance, familiarize themselves with a network they’ll soon be using in a live environment, and there may also be additional incentives for claiming some testnet tokens and experimenting with sending transactions and interacting with dapps. Whether you’re passionate about DeFi, AI, DePIN, DeSci or some other onchain vertical, there are a lot of things taking shape on Galileo that will be relevant to your interests.

The move reignited bullish momentum across the market, with traders and analysts now turning their focus to what could be the next phase of this cycle. Related Reading: Tron Bulls Regain Control – On-Chain Data Shows Fresh Buying Pressure Despite the aggressive push higher, on-chain data suggests the market remains healthy. Top analyst Darkfost highlighted that net realized profits are still within normal levels for a bull run. According to his analysis, profit-taking is not a sign of weakness—it’s a necessary part of market structure during uptrends. “This is what keeps investors engaged and prevents parabolic exhaustion,” he noted. The recent price action points to a potential shift in market dynamics, as Bitcoin breaks out of its post-halving consolidation phase. With weekly support forming above $105K and realized profit metrics staying in check, bulls are eyeing higher levels. If this momentum holds, the $112K rejection may only be a short-term hurdle. As always, volatility remains in play—but this week’s close sends a strong signal: the bull market structure is still intact. Bitcoin Has Room To Grow As It Prepares For Historic Weekly Close Bitcoin is on track to record its highest weekly close in history, signaling growing strength as it prepares for what many believe could be the next major bullish phase. After surging to a new all-time high near $112,000 earlier this week, BTC is now stabilizing above the $105,000 level—positioning itself above key short-term support going into next week. Still, while price action paints a bullish picture, macroeconomic conditions continue to pose risks. High interest rates, tightening financial conditions, and broader market uncertainty remain major factors. Investors are cautiously optimistic, but volatility could quickly return if global risk sentiment deteriorates. On-chain data offers a more grounded view of the current cycle. According to Darkfost, CryptoQuant data shows that realized profits currently stand at 104,000 BTC, or around $11 billion. While that number may seem large, it’s still well below the historical danger zone of 350,000 BTC—a level that typically signals euphoric conditions or overheating. This suggests the market remains in a healthy profit-taking zone. “Profit-taking is not a red flag during a bull market,” Darkfost noted. “It’s necessary. It helps maintain momentum and keeps participants engaged.” The coming week will be critical. A confirmed weekly close above $105K could solidify this level as new support and set the stage for further upside. But if bulls fail to hold ground, the rally risks losing steam. For now, Bitcoin appears strong, but the market is entering a zone where conviction will be tested. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pulls Back To Daily EMA 8 – Can Bulls Hold Momentum? BTC Holds Key Support After Rejection From New ATH Bitcoin is currently trading around $107,750 after a volatile week that saw prices hit a new all-time high near $112,000. The daily chart shows BTC pulling back from overbought conditions but holding firmly above the 34-day EMA at $100,886—a level that has consistently acted as dynamic support during this uptrend. Price remains well above the 50, 100, and 200-day SMAs, confirming a strong bullish structure. The key horizontal support at $103,600—now reclaimed—is another crucial zone. This level previously acted as a resistance ceiling during the March-April range and now serves as a potential launchpad if BTC consolidates above it. Volume appears to be declining slightly on the pullback, which may suggest this is a healthy retrace rather than a reversal. As long as Bitcoin maintains above the $103,600–$105,000 zone, bulls remain in control. A deeper correction would find initial support around the 34 EMA and then the 100 SMA near $91,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Above Key Prices – Data Points To $2,900 Level As Bullish Trigger For now, the bullish trend remains intact. However, rejection at $112K and slowing momentum call for caution. A weekly close above $105K would confirm strength, while a break below $103K could trigger short-term weakness.

Crypto adoption in Latin America is still emerging, but the region shows strong potential: high inflation, expensive remittances, and limited banking access make it a great opportunity for decentralized solutions. That’s where KMBIO comes in: a new peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency exchange that connects digital assets with the real economy-starting with LATAM, but designed to scale globally. Why is KMBIO different? KMBIO isn’t designed for advanced traders. It’s built for everyday people who need financial tools that are simpler, more accessible, and more useful. The platform offers: - A fast and simple P2P exchange - Spot trading for over 100 cryptocurrencies - Staking and farming with attractive rewards - Access to real-world tools like cards, IBANs, and B2B accounts - All powered by the $KMBIO token In addition, the token enables participation in the platform’s governance, access to premium features, and reduced trading fees. Why focus on LATAM? Because Latin America isn’t just an emerging market - it’s a region where cryptocurrencies are already being used to send remittances, hedge against inflation, and bypass traditional banking barriers. From Argentina to Mexico, millions need a blockchain infrastructure built for them. KMBIO was born from that urgency, with a vision that’s both scalable and global. KMBIO: Private Sale announcement KMBIO has officially launched its private token sale round, aiming to raise funds to fuel the marketing, development of next-generation crypto exchange tailored for the LATAM market.

Unilabs is a revolutionary AI-powered platform that’s not just managing assets, but predicting meme coin success before the analysts blink. While DOGE turns bullish, Unilabs is all set to dominate the market ahead. Find out more about UNIL and the latest Dogecoin news. AI-Powered Meme Coin Hunting? Unilabs Leads the Market Unilabs is the first entirely AI-backed asset manager that is giving retail investors access to institutional-grade investment strategies and tools, leveling up their day-to-day trading game. Using its Early Access Scoring System (EASS), Unlabs stands out by evaluating over a thousand blockchain projects in real-time. This is backed by its high-grade AI-powered technology that works on an algorithm to detect high-growth potential projects before they go mainstream. The EASS identifies such projects based on different parameters, like the project’s real-life use cases, team credibility, exchange listings, etc. This system is not limited to utility tokens only, but also extends into the world of meme coins, where liquidity is the main point to consider. Unilab’s meme coin identification system takes into account its liquidity and virality metrics alongside to determine its reliability, tier-1 CEX listing, and the potential ROI. Taking a step further, Unilabs offers four AI-driven investment funds: the AI Fund, BTC Fund, RWA Fund, and Mining Fund, with over $30 million in assets under management (AUM). Each of these funds caters to different sectors, such as Bitcoin derivatives or AI-based projects, giving investors exposure to different funds as per their investment goals. Dogecoin News: Wall Street Rumors, ETF Hopes, and a $5 Target DOGE is currently trading around $0.24, with crypto analysts seeing many bullish signals that might propel DOGE to a $5 price point. DOGE technical analysis identifies some important factors that support this bullish outlook. The monthly chart analysis indicates that the Dogecoin price may replicate the same technical setting that preceded its historic 2021 spike. The 20-month and 50-month moving averages are providing strong support, as they did during the previous bull run. The monthly Relative Strength Index remains very low, but there is a possibility for an upward climb. In prior cycles, the RSI hovered around 80 before the peak price arrived. In another Dogecoin news regarding the potential DOGE ETF, things have been a little confusing. The SEC has postponed its judgment until June, however, this does not mean that it will not be approved. The SEC filings plainly state that the delay is due to extra analysis. The Polymarket chances for the DOGE ETF clearance by the end of July are merely 15%, down 7% in the previous 24 hours. However, the odds in 2025 are 63%, indicating that investor trust is stronger in the latter months of 2025. Additionally, in the Dogecoin news, Bloomberg experts have made similar predictions. In a recent X post, James Seyffart stated that there is no conspiracy behind the DOGE ETF approval delays and that it is simply the SEC’s usual procedure. UNIL Token Presale Picks Up Steam: $960K and Climbing Unilabs ‘ ecosystem is backed by its native UNIL token.

While notable altcoins gain the headlines, an emerging project on the XRP Ledger is quietly capturing the imagination of forward-looking investors. XpFinance , the first fully decentralized lending and borrowing protocol engineered specifically for XRP, has already filled more than twenty percent of its one-hundred-thousand XRP presale soft cap in only a few days. Buy XPF Tokens Market participants who booked profits during the recent Bitcoin and Ethereum surge are actively rotating capital into early-stage opportunities with strong fundamentals and real utility. XpFinance is quickly becoming the top destination for that capital. By delivering a noncustodial lending engine that harnesses XRP Ledger speed and near-zero fees, the protocol positions itself as the missing cornerstone of decentralized finance on XRPL. A clear solution to XRP’s DeFi gap Centralized lenders have dominated the XRP landscape for years, often charging opaque fees and forcing users to surrender custody of their coins. XpFinance eliminates those pain points through an on-chain architecture that gives users full control over their assets at every step. Loans are overcollateralized, transparently managed by smart contracts, and settled in seconds through XRP Ledger consensus. Investors who hold the native XPF token receive three immediate advantages. First, borrowing fees drop significantly for token holders, creating tangible savings for active users. Second, a share of all protocol fees is distributed to stakers in XRP, establishing a stable passive-income stream. Third, governance rights allow the XpFinance community to vote on new collateral assets, interest curves, and strategic upgrades, ensuring that platform evolution remains user centric. Joining Xpfinance Presale offer an instant upside XpFinance has reserved sixty million XPF , exactly thirty percent of the fixed two-hundred-million supply, for its limited presale. Tokens are sold at a transparent price of one XRP for two-hundred XPF. Upon the conclusion of the sale, XPF will list directly on XPMarket, the leading decentralized exchange on XRPL, at one XRP for one-hundred-forty XPF. Early buyers therefore secure a built-in thirty percent price advantage the moment public trading begins. Join Xpfinance Presale First look demo coming next week The development team has confirmed that a working demonstration of the lending dashboard will be released next week. Prospective users will be able to connect an XRPL wallet, simulate deposits, and preview real-time loan creation inside a web interface that mirrors the final production version. The demo is expected to serve as a powerful catalyst for the remaining presale phases, as investors will see first hand how fast and easy decentralized lending on XRP can be. How to participate in the Xpfinance presale Purchase XRP on a reputable exchange such as Binance, Coinbase, or Bybit. Transfer XRP to a self-custody wallet that supports trust lines, for example Xaman, XUMM, or Ledger Nano. Visit the official presale portal at xp.finance/presale and send XRP to the address displayed. Add the XPF trust line in your wallet so tokens are delivered automatically when the sale closes. The presale is filling rapidly. Analysts who track on-chain inflows expect the soft cap to be met well ahead of schedule and anticipate strong demand once XPF goes live on decentralized exchanges. About XpFinance XpFinance is building the first noncustodial money market on the XRP Ledger. The project’s mission is to unlock idle XRP liquidity, provide frictionless borrowing, and distribute protocol governance to a global community of token holders. By merging the speed of XRPL with a transparent fee model, XpFinance aims to set a new standard for decentralized finance. Secure your allocation before the window closes and position yourself at the forefront of the XRP DeFi renaissance.

While Cardano is certainly a great project, it has just not found its market. After several false starts, the Cardano price is frustratingly low and even the extreme 25-year Cardano price predictions show the token price flat. Considering Bitcoin has just hit an all-time high and the markets are white hot, seeing Cardano slip down the ranks to ninth place is quite disheartening. Fortunately, the new PayFi token Remittix is dominating the presale market and Cardano’s unrealized gains can be made up with Remittix. Source: Coingecko Cardano ( ADA ): Technical perfection means nothing if you can’t sell it From the outset, Cardano made it its mission to create a technically perfect blockchain. According to many, it has succeeded. The Cardano chain ticks all the boxes: it is secure, robust, scalable and can handle just about anything one hands it. This perfection comes at a cost, though. The Cardano blockchain is too slow for retail applications and expensive to operate. It’s a superyacht in a world of speedboats. Not everyone needs Cardano’s robust infrastructure; for most applications, Cardano is overkill. Cardano is perfect for governmental and institutional use , but until the world goes full blockchain, Cardano will not get its moment in the sun. Coincodex shows that Cardano’s price will be steady even over the next 25 years and adjusted for inflation, shows Cardano may even lose money. Source: Coincodex Maybe the time has come to thank Cardano for its service, but let the newer, faster chains take it from here. As for Cardino investors? They are finding solace in the potential of Remittix. Remittix (RMX): New PayFi token shows huge promise PayFi is a brand-new concept pioneered by Remittix . It brings the capacity to use blockchain tech and cryptocurrency to make direct-to-fiat bank account payments to almost any account in the world. If that does not sound like a big deal, here’s the lowdown: Global payments are incredibly slow and prone to delays, they cost a fortune with fees levied on both the sender and receiver of the funds, and, on top of that, require lots of administrative duties. International cross-currency payments could not be more expensive or cumbersome if they tried. With Remittix, payments clear almost instantly and cost a fraction of the price. As for the paperwork, what paperwork!? This means global transactions are much more economical and now possible where previously it would have been impractical. Remittix greases the wheels of trade and industry, opens up the free markets and even gives the world’s unbanked a chance to partake in the formal economy. For companies, this reduced hassle and overheads will greatly impact the bottom line, giving all parties an easier path to economic freedom. Remittix is now in presale and has gained over $15.3 million in liquidity thus far. Once the presale ends and the token goes mainstream, its use case could propel Remittix into the top-ranked coins. Even YouTube is enthused about the potential behind Remittix. Conclusion Cardano will always have a place in the cryptosphere and it has some institutional support, but from an investment perspective, Cardano just is not worth it anymore. Remittix , however, is taking up the slack and thanks to its massive use case and unique market positioning, Remittix could be the best-performing token of the year. Remittix is now available at $0.781 directly from their website.

While this price stagnation is due to broader market uncertainty, the potential for a post-holiday bounce is growing especially with Ripple’s recent foray into real estate tokenization in the UAE. UAE’s Real Estate Tokenization Boosts XRPL; XRP Supported Ripple’s XRP Ledger (XRPL) has been chosen by the Dubai Land Department (DLD) as the blockchain for its real estate tokenization project. According to DLD’s senior executive Mahmoud AlBurai, over 3,000 investors have registered interest in the pilot, strong demand for tokenized property ownership. Currently, participation is limited to Emirates cardholders who are official UAE residents. Key points: Partnerships with Prypco Mint and Ctrl Alt to tokenize ownership deeds for government properties. Ripple’s $10M investment in tokenized US Treasury bills on XRPL via OpenEden. $5M stake in a tokenized money market fund by UK-based Abrdn last year. This real-world asset (RWA) initiative is the first of its kind in the MENA region and strengthens XRPL’s case for institutional adoption. Ripple’s payments service is already onboarding institutions, licensed by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA). XRP/USD Technical Analysis: Descending Triangle in Focus XRP price prediction seems bearish for now as on the 2-hour chart, Ripple is in a descending triangle, a pattern that often precedes breakouts. It’s hovering around horizontal support at $2.2856, with recent candlesticks (spinning tops and doji) indicating market indecision. XRP/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview 50-period EMA ($2.3600) and horizontal resistance at $2.3557 cap the upside. MACD histogram is flattening, bearish momentum is slowing. Targets : Break above $2.3600 could be $2.4098 and $2.4756. Failure to hold $2.2856 could be $2.2440 or $2.1970. New traders should wait for a confirmed breakout above trendline resistance and EMA to be reclaimed before going long, with stops below $2.2440. XRP Outlook: Will Lower Volume Spark a Rally? With volume thinning out during holidays like Memorial Day , institutional activity tends to slow down—sometimes creating a perfect storm for a squeeze. If XRP holds $2.31, a light market could be a quick bounce to $2.75. But with the SEC’s XRP stance still unclear and broader market uncertainty, be prepared for volatility. BTC Bull Token Nears $7.33M Cap as 65% APY Staking Draws Interest With XRP/USD steady at $2.31, attention is shifting to altcoins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . So far, $6.33 million has been raised out of a $7.33 million cap. The presale is closing in on its limit, next presale price jump closes in fast. Bitcoin Rewards and Supply Reductions BTC Bull Token operates with a built-in system: the higher Bitcoin’s price, the more BTC airdrops are distributed to token holders. Notably, presale participants receive priority. The system also features: Token burns every $50K BTC increase, reducing supply. Current token price at $0.00253 before the next bump. This approach aligns token value with Bitcoin’s price moves while maintaining scarcity through programmed burns. Staking Terms for Passive Returns BTCBULL’s staking pool holds 1.62 billion tokens offering 65% APY, with: No lockup periods or fees. Full access to funds at any time. This structure appeals to holders looking for yield without complex requirements or risk of illiquidity. Momentum Before the Cap Fills With just over $1 million remaining in the presale, buyers are positioning early. The token’s mechanics of Bitcoin-tied rewards, supply adjustments, and staking options are driving participation. Key figures: USDT raised : $6,329,314.26 / $7,332,195 Token price : $0.00253 BTCBULL offers a whopping ~65% APY on its Ethereum-based staking pool (currently holding 1.61B BTCBULL), with no lockups or withdrawal fees. That means passive yield — with full liquidity.

Platforms like XYZVerse , Chainlink, and Stellar are at the forefront of this change. They’re pioneering technologies that could redefine how money moves around the world. This article delves into how these crypto giants are reshaping the financial landscape. XYZ aims for G.O.A.T. status as early buyers gear up for massive returns XYZVerse (XYZ) is flipping the script on what a memecoin can be. Blending the high-stakes thrill of sports — football, MMA, basketball, esportsb — with the viral energy of crypto, this isn’t just another token launch. It’s a cultural movement for fans who live and breathe competition. With a bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is stepping beyond fleeting hype. Recently crowned Best New Meme Project, XYZ is backed by a community that’s hungry for something with long-term firepower. Why XYZ is built different Unlike typical pump-and-dump meme tokens, XYZVerse has: A defined roadmap A fast-growing and engaged community A unique identity that fuses sports fanaticism with crypto culture That sports-fueled DNA gives XYZ a competitive edge — this is a token built for winners, by winners. Presale Slsurge: XYZ delivers before hitting the market The XYZ presale is already making waves, offering entry prices far below the expected public listing value. Here’s a quick breakdown: Initial Price: $0.0001 Current Price: $0.003333 Next Stage: $0.005 Final Presale Price: $0.02 Target Listing Price: $0.10 With over $13 million raised, early backers are betting big — and for good reason. If XYZ launches at its projected price, presale investors could see returns up to 1,000x. Time to make a play Demand is growing fast. Each new presale stage pushes the entry price higher. For those eyeing outsized gains, timing is everything. Don’t miss the shot. Grab XYZ tokens now and and book a place before the final whistle. Chainlink Chainlink (LINK) has seen notable price movements recently. Over the past week, the price increased by 6.10%, and over the past month, it surged by 20.05%. However, over the last six months, it experienced a slight decline of 2.25%. The current price range is between $14.53 and $17.60, indicating a strong recovery from previous lows. Technical indicators suggest a potential upward trend. The 10-day simple moving average is $16.88, higher than the 100-day average of $16.05. This crossover signals positive momentum. The relative strength index is 59.33, approaching overbought conditions but still with room for growth. The MACD level is positive at 0.1350, indicating bullish momentum. If the current trend continues, Chainlink may test the nearest resistance level at $19, representing an increase of about 13% from the current price. If it breaks this barrier, the next resistance is at $22, offering further upside. Conversely, the nearest support level is at $13.17, and if the price falls below this, it could find support at $10.10. Traders are watching these key levels closely. Stellar Stellar (XLM) has shown positive movement recently. In the past week, its price increased by 4.16%. Over the last month, it rose by 14.71%. However, over six months, it has declined by 41.57%. Currently, the price ranges between $0.27 and $0.32. The short-term gains suggest potential for further growth. The Simple Moving Averages over 10 and 100 days are close, at $0.30 and $0.29. The Relative Strength Index stands at 55.41, hinting at bullish momentum. The MACD level is slightly positive at 0.001674, supporting the possibility of continued upward movement. If the trend continues, Stellar might reach the nearest resistance at $0.35, a gain of around 9%. Passing this could lead to the second resistance at $0.41, adding approximately 28%. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.24, a potential drop of about 11%. The second support at $0.19 represents a decrease of roughly 30%. These levels are key indicators for Stellar’s potential direction. Conclusion LINK, XLM, and XYZVerse are leading the 2025 bull run; with XYZ uniting sports fans and aiming for 20,000% growth, they are reshaping global finance.

Solana’s steady uptrend, Ethereum’s bullish structure, and the viral surge of MAGACOIN FINANCE are dominating the conversation, while Bitcoin, XRP, and TRON remain critical benchmarks for capital rotation in the coming cycle. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Frenzy, 50% Bonus, and 35x+ Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading the early-stage pack, with every presale stage selling out faster than the last and over $8 million already raised. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling unprecedented demand. Key reasons traders are watching MAGA closely: Community-driven narrative that cuts through market noise and builds lasting engagement. Early-stage positioning with robust tokenomics and a strict supply cap. Stage 8 nearly full and a $0.007 listing target, with analyst forecasts pointing to 18,500% upside if momentum holds. Early buyers can still use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% bonus, making MAGA the go-to allocation for those seeking the next supercycle winner before listings go live. Solana (SOL): Bullish Structure and Ecosystem Growth Solana is trading between $158 and $175, with analysts watching for a breakout above $175 to retest $183. The network’s high throughput, low fees, and expanding DeFi ecosystem are attracting both users and developers. June forecasts suggest SOL could reach $180–$190, with the potential for $200+ if bullish trends persist. While Solana’s momentum is robust, traders seeking sharper returns are increasingly rotating into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Ethereum (ETH): Steady Climb and Institutional Interest Ethereum is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, with technicals pointing to a possible breakout toward $2,800–$2,900 if bullish sentiment holds. Analysts expect that sustained momentum above $2,650 could open the door to $2,900 and beyond, with some forecasts even targeting $4,500 by year-end if institutional adoption and Layer 2 growth persist. While ETH remains a core holding, its near-term upside is steady compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin (BTC): Market Anchor and June Outlook Bitcoin is holding above $110,000, with forecasts suggesting a range of $113,000–$136,700 for June if bullish momentum continues. BTC’s macro strength provides a stable backdrop for altcoin surges, but its upside is now more measured—making MAGACOIN FINANCE the clear destination for investors targeting higher multiples. XRP and TRON: Steady Progress, MAGA Steals the Spotlight XRP is trading near $2.50, showing a solid uptrend supported by bullish technicals and whale accumulation. TRON is consolidating around $0.27, with forecasts suggesting a climb to $0.32 in early June. While both assets remain strong, their growth is more gradual compared to the explosive presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Conclusion Solana and Ethereum are gaining traction, but the heaviest community surge and most dramatic growth potential are now unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 35x–50x ROI, MAGA is the breakout contender for June and beyond.

Onchain data revealed that Wynn closed all of his PEPE memecoin positions. By closing his trades, the trader earned a total of $25.18 million from these positions. According to his own statement, James Wynn earned $25 million in PEPE trading transactions, which he started with $7,000 in 2023. This year, he earned another $25 million with the PEPE long transactions he made. In other words, the trader made a total profit of over $50 million in a single token.

In addition to the $1.7 million loss on the currently open position, a funding fee of $4.6 million was paid.

The crypto industry is known to take pride in its speed and innovation, but when it comes to crisis management, it is every bit as vulnerable as traditional finance. However, unlike TradFi, crypto lacks clear regulations, central oversight, or even shared crisis protocols, which makes things even worse. You might also like: Building trust: Transparency will drive crypto market growth | Opinion In TradFi, a crisis situation can usually be contained through well-established frameworks—when things take a bad turn, there are central banks and regulators to turn to for help. In crypto, however, a singular event can spiral into a proverbial wildfire within hours, as viral panic on social media and a glaring absence of accountability fan the flames further. This isn’t a hypothetical scenario—we’ve already seen cases like that before. And that’s a problem—not just for individual projects and investors, but for the stability of the entire ecosystem and its future. So, what can be done? It starts with acknowledging that black swan events in crypto aren’t a rarity—they are a part of this landscape. Which means preparing for them should be a core business practice, not an afterthought. Plan in advance with smart, adaptive protocols, instead of tearing your hair out when the crisis is already upon you and all you can do is react haphazardly. Why TradFi risk frameworks don’t work in crypto To reiterate my previous point, TradFi runs on structure. There are rules, regulators, and a long history of crisis management models to draw from. Admittedly, they, too, need to be adjusted for modern-day realities, but that’s a whole other topic. For now, let’s stay focused on crypto—and what we have here is not very inspiring. No unified regulator, no standard response templates or established procedures, often not even a central authority that clients can turn to in case a disaster strikes. When something goes wrong, no one knows who’s in charge—and that’s terrifying for users and investors alike. The result? A situation that might be considered a ‘contained incident’ in traditional banking, for example, risks turning into a full-blown catastrophe in crypto. From flash crashes and protocol exploits to straight-up project implosions, crypto lives on the edge. And the pace at which information (or misinformation) spreads on X (former Twitter), Reddit, and other social networks leaves platforms with no time to regroup. And nobody can pretend such crises are just one-off occurrences. Terra, FTX, Celsius—all of them were wake-up calls. Black swan events are part of the natural rhythm of this market. And what it needs to better prepare for them is not wishful thinking, but intelligent crisis response protocols built specifically for this industry. That means planning for both the expected and the unexpected—and, when the time comes, being able to act on those plans with the speed and transparency crypto demands. The consequences of silence For many people in crypto, the collapse of FTX and the collapse of Terra are still notorious enough that I don’t need to revisit the details and monetary losses in this article. But what’s often overlooked is how the crisis wasn’t just technical or financial—it was communicational. Those events ended up being so destructive for the industry as a whole, not just because of poor risk management or flawed tokenomics. It was silence and confusion that drove that final nail into the coffin. When FTX started crumbling, users and investors alike didn’t know what was happening. There was no clear message, no accountability, and no trustworthy figure stepping up to clearly explain what was happening. And much the same happened with Terra. People were left guessing, and panic and misinformation filled the void. With no credible communication to combat them, trust vanished overnight. And when communication did finally arrive, it came delayed and didn’t help at all in reassuring people. From personal experience, I know that the crypto community has no shortage of very smart people who are good at building things. But far too often, they operate under the assumption that “this can’t happen to us.” That’s a dangerous mindset, because it’s fundamentally wrong. There is no such thing as an “unexpected” crisis—only the ones you didn’t prepare for ahead of time. And when the chaos is already here, silence won’t protect you from it. The absence of clear responsibility and proactive messaging can all too easily turn technical failures into trust failures, which is far harder to rebuild. It’s not just about avoiding mistakes—it’s about handling them when they inevitably come. It’s time for crisis playbooks, not just whitepapers If there’s one actionable takeaway from the past few years, it’s this: every serious crypto company needs a crisis playbook. And not just a theoretical one—it has to be alive, regularly updated, and realistic. Ready to go when things go sideways. That playbook should include: A real-time response plan to incidents that accounts for coordination between PR, legal, and user support teams. A communication tree that defines who speaks, when, and across what channels. Pre-approved messaging templates for common scenarios like hacks, outages, or regulatory scrutiny. Without a plan and a functional chain of command, even small issues can spiral and trigger a domino effect, causing user flight and media firestorms. But with a proper playbook, teams can contain the damage early and hold on to their community through the storm. The paradox of decentralised leadership: Trustless doesn’t mean leaderless Crypto likes to say it’s “trustless,” and that protocols are autonomous. But when things go sideways, people don’t look at strings of code—they look to people. In a crisis, the public wants a face, a voice, a leader. That’s why founders and core team members behind projects must be visible, credible, and prepared to lead, not hide behind pseudonyms. A strong personal brand isn’t just a thing that’s nice-to-have —it’s a core component of business resilience. It builds legitimacy and provides reassurance to your clients during uncertain times. A strong, authentic voice from leadership gives people something to anchor to. It can stabilise a community, calm investors, and steer the narrative during volatile moments. In many cases, a founder’s reputation can even be more valuable than their legal or technical protections. When regulation is confusing and systems are decentralised, credibility is everything. So if you’re building something real, your reputation needs to be as resilient as your code. Build like a crisis is coming—because it is The crypto industry has evolved at an astonishing pace, but it’s also high time for it to mature in how it handles risk. Black swan events aren’t once-in-a-decade exceptions—they’re part of the terrain, and planning for them as inevitabilities is what’s going to set serious players apart going forward. You don’t need to know when or how the next shock will come. But you do need to be ready when it does. Don’t wait until something breaks before you think about how to fix it. The strategies and communication protocols you put in place now will define whether your project is still standing five years from today.

In a new interview with Jimmy Conor, Alden says she’s expecting more or less “stagnant” markets in the near future. However, Alden says there will be “pockets of opportunity” – one of which is US financials, which she says she’s bullish on. “I think that’s kind of the phase we’re entering, so that’s why I expect a generally more stagnant market with pockets of opportunity. I’m public that I’m actually bullish on US financials at the current time. Ironically, as the US enters a slow-motion fiscal crisis, one of the winning sides is the private sector financials because everybody is fighting the last battle of what banks are going to be in trouble, or are we going to have a big credit event… I think that the biggest one is on the sovereign level, and that tends to be pretty decent for the private entities in the ecosystem… Basically, this gets taken out in terms of fiscal dominance, running things hot for a long period of time, taking it out on the currency rather than through major private sector deleveraging. So I think right now US banks on average are pretty cheap and they’re pretty well capitalized, so outside of certain rare pockets, I’m pretty bullish on US financials and US banks in particular. No one’s really interested in buying them right now, but I find them interesting. It’s not the only asset I’d own, but I’m a lot less bearish on them than the market seems to think.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Mostly seen as the Bitcoin proxy stock now boasts a staggering $101 billion market cap. However, its recent bet on Bitcoin might have opened a crack beneath the surface. 10X Research warns that Strategy’s days of high-flying volume may be over. Retail traders who were chasing the rally could soon shift toward even riskier, more volatile names like Metaplanet. This comes in when BTC went on to hit a fresh all-time high (ATH) of over $111,900 on May 22 before tracing back to the $107k zone. Strategy risks steep pullback Options traders say the days of 200–300% implied volatility are gone. Strategy’s at-the-money options now sit at 76%, which is still high, while the realized volatility is collapsing. For MSTR, declining volume also means less opportunity to source cheap volatility and sell it at a premium. The report highlighted that the market could enter a phase where Strategy can acquire significantly less Bitcoin than it has over the past six months. 10x Research stated that it would “consider shorting MicroStrategy at $400, setting a stop loss at $430, and risking $30 to potentially gain $100 if the stock retreats to $300.” It added that the momentum is fading as bearish divergences are flashing, and all three major reversal indicators have flipped negative. The 21-day moving average is sitting at $390, and below that level, long positions start looking shaky. A pullback could happen simply due to a compression in net asset value or, more broadly, if Bitcoin begins to consolidate. It is inevitable unless Strategy continues to drive it higher. If MicroStrategy fails to hold the $400 level, the door to $300 swings is wide open. And as BTC volatility cools, the upside chase might move elsewhere, it added. MSTR’s Bitcoin bet grows As of May 2025, Strategy holds 568,840 Bitcoin (approx. worth $60 billion), after adding a massive 80,715 BTC just in Q1. It is suggested that the pace of Bitcoin accumulation may slow as the past six months saw unprecedented BTC purchases. Maintaining that momentum will be tough without further capital or massive Bitcoin price surges. Strategy stock price has dropped by 7.5% in the last trading session to stand at $369.51. After-hours trading data shows that it might drop by another 3% to touch the $366 zone. However, it is still up by 23% year to date (YTD). Bitcoin has seen a week full of fluctuations. On Monday, BTC was trading around $103K and went on to knock $106K in a few hours and saw a dump to straight $102K area. The original crypto then hovered above the $111K, trying to breach into $112K, but failed. Bitcoin is trading at an average of $107,380 at press time with a trading volume of $45 billion.

Table of Contents Dogecoin price analysis: Sluggish movement indicates losses Memecoin enthusiasts flock to Unilabs for 100x opportunity Future outlook for DOGE hints at a rebound soon Can Unilabs beat Dogecoin’s 2018 breakout? Conclusion As DOGE holders regain confidence in the Dogecoin price, Unilabs (UNIL) is shifting the spotlight to its next-generation DeFi asset management system. With over $30.8 million in AUM, this investment protocol is positioned to lead most investment platforms in the upcoming sessions. So far, Unilabs has raised over $800,000 in its ongoing presale at $0.005 per token. You might also like: Why was Dogecoin up 8% on Wednesday? Dogecoin price analysis: Sluggish movement indicates losses Dogecoin (DOGE) experienced major volatility throughout May. After rallying near the $0.26 range in early May, the Dogecoin price slumped to $0.21–$0.22 by mid-month. Currently, DOGE holds a key support zone between $0.21 and $0.21, with notable rebounds backed by high trading volume. This sentiment indicates active buying interest at this level. The $0.21 mark is seen as a critical threshold; a breakdown below this level could trigger further downside in the Dogecoin price and push it toward $0.20. On the upside, DOGE would need to break through resistance levels at $0.22 and $0.23 to re-establish a bullish trend. A sustained move above $0.23 could help the Dogecoin price make a comeback and reinforce a recovery. According to technical data, the next Dogecoin price key support levels are at approximately $0.21 and $0.20, while the $0.23–$0.24 area stands out as a significant resistance zone to watch. The daily chart also shows the formation of a “bull flag” pattern for DOGE, which typically suggests a continuation of the prior uptrend. Memecoin enthusiasts flock to Unilabs for 100x opportunity While the Dogecoin price performance hints at a reversal in the near term, Unilabs is leading an optimistic narrative among the broader investor community. This new AI entrant is gaining recognition for its cutting-edge fundamentals and AI-backed trading analysis that deliver explosive gains and top-notch crypto projects before they hit the market. Unilabs defies market trends and investment norms with the modern-gen AI technology that takes DeFi asset management to a whole new level. With the platform’s creative AI integration, investors and retail traders no longer have to hunt the crypto market for a breakthrough project, just put Unilabs in charge, sit back, and relax. Future outlook for DOGE hints at a rebound soon If confirmed by strong buying momentum, the current technical setup could propel the Dogecoin price toward a target around $0.35. As for momentum indicators, both the RSI and MACD are showing neutral to mildly bullish signals. The 14-day RSI is hovering around 55, close to neutral territory, and not indicating any clear overbought or oversold conditions for DOGE. Meanwhile, the MACD line on the daily chart formed a bullish crossover in mid-May, echoing patterns seen before previous DOGE breakouts. The altcoin’s current trading volume is still up, particularly during retests of the $0.21–$0.22 support area, suggesting that investors’ dip-buying activity is still on full throttle. Dogecoin’s on-chain data further reinforces the technical analysis, supporting a bullish outlook. Whale wallets holding large amounts of DOGE have shown a massive buying trend in recent weeks. In April and May 2025 alone, these whale addresses collectively purchased over 1 billion DOGE, bringing their total holdings to roughly 25.97 billion DOGE coins. Can Unilabs beat Dogecoin’s 2018 breakout? Dogecoin may have shown a recovery in its price trend lately, but Unilabs has got analysts talking about it. The main reason behind the buzz is its explosive presale debut, which raised over $800,000 before the estimated time, and is projected to land an even stronger rally in the upcoming trading sessions. The platform’s investment protocol makes it the world’s first AI-powered DeFi asset manager with up to 2,000 weekly signups on the platform. As most memecoin lovers add UNIL to their portfolios, this $0.005 is poised to show a breakout bigger than Dogecoin’s 2018 cycle that marked its all-time high. Conclusion While most memecoin buyers are rejoining Dogecoin for better gains, AI enthusiasts are joining Unilabs for up to 100x opportunities with its AI-powered Launchpad.

Ethereum (ETH), continues to dominate the DeFi and NFT sectors. Cardano (ADA), now trading near $0.74, remains a solid choice due to its peer-reviewed tech and real-world partnerships in education and healthcare. Ripple’s XRP is gaining traction again as cross-border payments go mainstream, especially following positive regulatory momentum. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL), stands out for its blazing speed and expanding dApp ecosystem. For those eyeing high upside potential with lower entry costs, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the rising coin poised to ride this utility-driven rally. Already in the fifth phase of presale, this fast-rising altcoin is priced at $0.03 and has already seen $9.1 million worth of funding. As the price is set to increase to $0.035 in the next stage, more than 11000 investors already have their positions ahead of a 16.67% price increase. Utility Giants Poised for Growth: ETH, ADA, XRP, and SOL in 2025 As the next crypto bull cycle approaches, some of the best cryptocurrencies to buy right now are those with proven utility and long-term thought. Ethereum (ETH) at about $2,496 is still the basis for decentralized finance, and it is predicted to be as much as $10,000 by the year 2025 because of constant upgrades and institutional investor uptake. Cardano (ADA) trading at about $0.74 is known for its academic approach and real-world applications in regions like Africa, where blockchain technology solves the problems of identity and access to money. XRP trading at $2.35 keeps expanding its footprints within the field of cross-border payments, especially with growing legal clarity boosting investor morale. In the meantime, Solana (SOL) is cheering around $166 on speedster transactions and growing DeFi universe, with price targets reaching for the $1,000 handle if the uptrend holds. While these behemoths are out in front on fundamentals, upstart low-price coin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are becoming increasingly popular for asymmetrical upside. A DeFi Powerhouse Gaining Traction Mutuum Finance is withdrawing from mainstream lenders by using a dual-lending structure, leading to its fast adoption rate. There are more than 11,000 investors supporting MUTM by investing $9.1 million during the presale. Phase 5 of the offering has brought Mutuum Finance to $0.03 and with Phase 6 about to happen, investors in this stage can expect big gains. Because of its unique loan systems and popularity among traders, experts predict that the token will reach a value over $5 after launch at a price of $0.06. Reshaping DeFi Lending with a Dual-Model Approach Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing DeFi lending by integrating Peer-to-Contract (P2C) as well as Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. Through the P2C model, customers can gain passive income by being part of USDT liquidity pools while having smart contract-based automatic lending. P2P method provides direct lending where customers are able to do business without the involvement of intermediaries and remain in full possession of their capital. A Secure and Trustworthy Financial Ecosystem In addition to supporting its ecosystem, Mutuum Finance will also introduce a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike algorithmic stablecoins, this token is over-collateralized, minimizing risks and offering long-term stability. Coupled with open and fully audited smart contracts by Certik, this approach guarantees investor confidence while negating the vulnerabilities that have derailed other DeFi projects. As the bull run approaches, utility-focused altcoins like ETH, ADA, XRP, and SOL lead the charge, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the breakout to watch. With $9.1M raised, 11,000+ investors, and a presale price of just $0.03, MUTM offers early buyers a 2x ROI at launch and potential $5+ upside by Q3 2025. Buy MUTM now at the official presale before the next price jump. Don’t miss your chance to join 2025’s top DeFi project.

With Chainlink steady and XRP whales accumulating, institutional and retail investors are zeroing in on MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Bitcoin as the top contenders to watch for Q3 2025’s breakout. CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Moves, 50% Bonus, and Early-Stage Surge MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming 2025’s most-watched presale, with over $8 million raised and a record-setting 72.95 ETH whale buy marking the largest early-stage purchase of the year. The project’s capped supply, HashEx audit, and scarcity-driven tokenomics are driving unprecedented demand. Early buyers can still use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% bonus, making MAGA even more attractive for those seeking exponential upside. Analysts are projecting 25x–35x returns, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% if momentum continues. As Stage 8 nears completion, smart money is positioning ahead of listings, recognizing MAGACOIN FINANCE as a rare ground-floor opportunity before price discovery goes public. Bitcoin (BTC): Bullish Structure and Institutional Support Bitcoin is trading in the $110,000–$115,000 range, with technicals showing strong bullish momentum and support at $110K. The breakout above April’s highs has ended a long consolidation, and BTC is now in price discovery mode. Institutional inflows remain robust, and as long as BTC holds above $110K, analysts expect a push toward $112K–$115K in the coming sessions. This steady foundation is prompting investors to rotate some capital into higher-upside plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Whale Accumulation and Bullish Sentiment XRP is consolidating near $2.42, with recent whale transactions totaling over $300 million signaling confidence in the token’s future. The number of large XRP wallets has surged, reflecting growing influence from major investors. Analysts forecast a move toward $2.80–$3.40 in the coming weeks, with some bullish scenarios targeting $5.50 by year-end if momentum persists. As XRP holders seek sharper upside, many are reallocating to early-stage opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana (SOL) and Chainlink (LINK): Steady, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight Solana is trading between $158 and $175, consolidating after a recent high near $183, with technicals suggesting a potential breakout if resistance is cleared. Chainlink remains steady, with price forecasts between $10.32 and $16.47 for 2025. However, both are being outpaced in sentiment and capital flows by the explosive momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW Conclusion With Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana providing stability, the most dramatic growth potential is now unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE. As Stage 8 nears completion and the 50% PATRIOT50X bonus remains, this may be the last low-entry window before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. For those seeking the next breakout, MAGA is the name to watch for Q3 2025.

The company said that after Solana broke the resistance area at $159, it quickly rose to $188 and is currently entering a sideways consolidation period just below that area. According to MakroVision, Solana clearly broke out of a long-standing downtrend and subsequently displayed a strong bullish structure by forming higher lows and higher highs. According to the analysis, the current sideways movement is seen as a natural and constructive pause after the previous strong rally. Analysts list the key support levels to watch in the short term as follows: $159: It stands out as a short-term support level and there has been a reaction from this level before. $153: Coincides with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level and should be watched for possible reversals. $142: Key level that needs to be defended for Solana to maintain its bullish structure. MakroVision notes that if Solana achieves a sustained break above the $188 level, the price could gain new momentum towards the $204 and then $223 levels. On the other hand, the short-term technical outlook is thought to remain positive as long as the price stays above the $153 level. According to MakroVision’s assessment, Solana is in a healthy consolidation phase after its strong rally. This sideways movement could pave the way for a continuation of the uptrend, while a break above the $188 level could give the market new momentum. *This is not investment advice.

Token utility is the phrase we use to describe what a token actually does, and therefore the main reason why it’s worth having. The basic premise is that the more utility a token has, the more valuable it should be. So a token that allows you to do lots of different things, or obtain various benefits, is likely to be worth more than one that lacks any real utility. With that in mind, the decentralized computing infrastructure startup iExec has unveiled a masterplan to turbocharge the utility of its native RLC token . It came via a string of new updates delivered throughout last week’s Tokenomics Week event. It wasn’t a physical event per se, but rather a series of announcements on X that explore what iExec is doing to boost the utility of RLC in its ecosystem, as it strives to build a more productive, circular token economy where value flows to every participant. 5 days. 5 new ways to use & earn $RLC .

In case you’re not familiar with iExec, it can be thought of as an alternative to public cloud computing infrastructure giants like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Its primary customers are developers, who can pay to access its blockchain-powered computing resources, including servers, virtual machines, GPUs and storage, or whatever else it is they need, at much lower costs. To pay for those services, you’ll need RLC tokens, which act as the primary currency within its economy. The major difference between iExec and the likes of AWS is that its infrastructure is fully decentralized, meaning that the company doesn’t own any of the hardware it rents out. Instead, those resources are owned by the broader iExec community, which can earn rewards for providing idle computing power and unused storage to the network. It’s this unique business model that enables iExec to offer computing services at much lower costs than the usual cloud suspects. Another differentiator between iExec and Amazon et al is that its infrastructure is optimized especially for blockchain developers building decentralized applications. What Happened in iExec’s Tokenomics Week? The week-long event was nothing short of a bonanza for RLC token holders, with a series of high-impact announcements and initiatives being launched that are designed to transform the role of its native token. The idea is to amplify the role of RLC and put it at the forefront of iExec’s decentralized economy by increasing demand for the asset. For iExec, the best way to do that is to give every participant the opportunity to profit. Tokenomics Week kicked off with the simple announcement that more RLC has entered circulation , increasing liquidity within the ecosystem and eliminating the chances of any nasty surprises for token holders later on down the line. RLC has a fixed supply of 86 million tokens and the vast majority of them have already been distributed among the community to minimize the chances of any inflation occurring, reducing risk to the economy. The big news started on day two, when iExec revealed its new voucher scheme for application builders, designed as a way to simplify access to its infrastructure. So instead of buying tokens, which can be complicated to manage, users can instead buy a voucher, which gives them access to a guaranteed amount of computing resources with more predictable costs. What’s more, iExec says it’s giving away some of the vouchers for free to those projects that are still building and yet to release a final product. Only once they’ve got their project up and running and start generating real revenue will they need to acquire an Earn voucher, which gives them access to round-the-clock support and various other perks, such as the chance to talk to investors and so on. Tokenomics Announcement 2: The iExec VoucherFrom a dev’s first line of code to every time a user runs the app, $RLC circulates.This is how devs should interact with utility tokens. pic.twitter.com/R1UZ7MFweb — iExec RLC (@iEx_ec) May 20, 2025 The excitement mounted further one day later with iExec’s new revenue sharing model , which is linked to the voucher model. The way it works is that fees from voucher sales are redirected back into the iExec ecosystem in the shape of rewards distributed proportionally to builders and application users. So the more app users acquired by a builder, the greater the amount of RLC rewards they’ll be entitled to. The same goes for users, who can increase their rewards by engaging with iExec-based applications more often. The basic idea is to incentivize both usage and development, encouraging long-term adoption of iExec’s infrastructure. Tokenomics Announcement 3: $RLC Revenue SharingBuilders use RLC. Users engage with apps. Revenue flows back through the ecosystem.This is how a circular token economy is built. pic.twitter.com/Bfui8We00P — iExec RLC (@iEx_ec) May 21, 2025 RLC token holders will also get more utility in the shape of a new staking initiative that’s linked to one of iExec’s existing incentive programs, known as the Privacy Pass. By acquiring a Privacy Pass, users can sign up to receive marketing emails – which are delivered to their inbox without revealing their address to the marketer. For each email viewed, the user can earn a small amount of RLC as a reward. On day four, iExec revealed it’s extending this program, offering boosted rewards for some campaigns, with the exact amount determined by how many RLC is currently held in your wallet. The basic gist is that, the more RCL you hold, the more rewards you’re entitled to. Tokenomics Announcement 4: $RLC StakingThe more RLC you hold, the greater your rewards across the ecosystem.We're starting with a new mechanism for the iExec Privacy Pass. pic.twitter.com/WbHrUlht3V — iExec RLC (@iEx_ec) May 22, 2025 Last but not least, iExec wrapped things up with the launch of a new incentive program for builders that’s meant to encourage the development of privacy-focused applications. Success will be measured by the amount of sensitive data each application protects, meaning that those with more users should be entitled to greater rewards. As privacy is one of the major principles of iExec’s decentralized infrastructure, it makes a lot of sense to incentivize builders to protect user’s information. Tokenomics Announcement 5: Builder IncentivesEarnings scale with your impact. The more your project contributes to the iExec ecosystem, the more $RLC you unlock. pic.twitter.com/sBglyoCEjO — iExec RLC (@iEx_ec) May 23, 2025 What’s Next For iExec? To be honest, there weren’t any real surprises in iExec’s Tokenomics Week, as anyone following the project will have already been well acquainted with its plans. Many of the initiatives were outlined earlier this year when it published its 2025 roadmap , but it’s one thing to announce things, and quite another to actually get them done. iExec gets quite a bit of kudos for moving so fast. iExec is keen to expand the utility of RLC in order to boost adoption of its decentralized infrastructure, and in line with that it has also been making efforts to increase the token’s accessibility. Its roadmap calls for RLC to be listed on many more platforms, including both centralized and decentralized exchanges, and with the basic tokenomics structure now mapped out, we can look forward to seeing some new listings imminently. At the same time, there’s every reason to think we’ll see many more projects taking advantage of iExec’s infrastructure, which is designed for use cases including AI, confidential computing and DePIN. Earlier this year, it announced the creation of a new 1 million RLC developer fund to support early stage builders, and it shouldn’t be long before we start to see the fruits of that investment coming into bloom.

Just when the world thought XRP was free to roam, it turns out that the settlement with the SEC was a no-go . The XRP price prediction has suffered because of it and now investors are looking for alternatives to invest in. Hyperliquid is doing some interesting things and Sam Altman’s Worldcoin is back in the news. Could these tokens deliver on investment promises XRP could not keep? Maybe. But for a more definitive answer, Remittix makes a strong case. Hyperliquid (HYPE): Speed demon makes its mark The biggest challenge to making crypto fully transactional is speed. Transactions on older chains can take forever to clear, with Ethereum sometimes taking days, let alone hours. In steps Hyperliquid, a relatively new chain which only went live in December and is already at number 11 by market capitalization. Hyperliquid is currently in a massive upsurge, pushing its ATH further upwards by the hour. Hyperliquid is expected to lose a bit of momentum but to climb to $50 by the end of next year and from there, to continue going higher. Hyperliquid is definitely one for the books. Source: CoinCodex Worldcoin (WLD): Altman’s utopian vision gets cash injection Worldcoin is back in the spotlight after raising $135 million from a16z and Bain Capital Crypto, pushing its eyeball-scanning tech into the U.S. market. Sam Altman’s grand vision, a global digital identity system to separate humans from bots, now includes shiny new Orb Minis, rolling out in cities like LA and San Francisco. The Worldcoin token surged on the news, hitting $1.53 with bullish eyes on $2. But the biometric utopia isn’t without backlash: regulators in Spain, Portugal and Indonesia have already hit pause on Worldcoin over privacy concerns. Still, with over 26 million sign-ups, Worldcoin could be something for investors to keep a keen eye on. A word of caution, though. Even at the elevated price, Worldcoin is still well below its launch ATH of $11.78 and will have a ways to go before reaching the March 2024 high, but it would not be prudent to bet against Sam Altman’s capacity to create wealth. Source: CoinCodex Remittix (RTX): XRP alternative heads for the big leagues. XRP was supposed to make cross-border payments easy, but thanks to spending more than a decade in the development of promises of what was to come and then years spent handcuffed by the SEC, XRP failed to deliver. But thankfully, Remittix is here to pick up where XRP left off. Remittix is a PayFi platform that allows users to use cryptocurrency to make direct-to-fiat bank transfers. With Remittix, global payments are quick, painless, hassle-free and, above all, cheap. This is the biggest news in cryptocurrency since Bitcoin itself because, with Remittix, crypto can be used as a payment system. This democratizes global payments and lubricates the wheels of trade and industry. And, what’s more, it gives the world’s unbanked the capacity to participate in a growing economy. Remittix stands for more than what it can do for investors, but what it can do to truly set the markets free. Conclusion XRP’s prospects are as flat as a pancake, and investors will not be blamed for seeking greener pastures in coins with higher growth potential. Hyperliquid has already made a name for itself and Worldcoin is now back with a vengeance and both of these are projects to consider. The dark horse winner, though, is Remittix . It is already easing the administrative and financial strain of cross-border payments. With over $15.3 million in liquidity and a strong following on YouTube, Remittix is signaling its intent to be one of the big guns. Remittix is now available at $0.0781 directly from their website.

The recent price action hints at potential corrective consolidation toward the $2.2K threshold, before attempting a breakout. Technical Analysis The Daily Chart ETH has encountered strong resistance at the crucial 200-day moving average around $2.7K over the past week, reflecting a significant seller presence at this psychological level. The asset has lost upward momentum and is currently displaying a double-top formation—a classic bearish reversal pattern. This structure signals increased profit-taking and distribution, suggesting a probable short-term corrective phase targeting the $2.2K support zone. This retracement phase could serve as a healthy reset, attracting new demand at lower levels and providing the necessary momentum for a fresh breakout above the $2.7K resistance. Structurally, Ethereum remains confined between the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, setting the stage for a potential bullish breakout in the coming weeks. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Ethereum’s weakening bullish momentum is reflected in its price action within an ascending wedge, a bearish reversal pattern. This formation often signals diminishing buyer strength and increased seller dominance. Additionally, a clear bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator confirms this outlook, pointing to aggressive distribution near the current resistance. If ETH breaks below the wedge’s lower boundary near $2.4K, a pullback toward the $2.2K level becomes the most likely scenario. However, an unexpected breakout above the wedge could trigger a short squeeze, fueling a renewed rally toward higher resistance levels. Onchain Analysis Ethereum continues to hover below a critical resistance range, keeping investors on edge about the likelihood of a bullish breakout. While price action alone has provided mixed signals, insights from the futures market shed light on underlying sentiment shifts that could shape the asset’s next major move. One of the most telling indicators is the ETH Taker Buy-Sell Ratio, which measures whether aggressive market orders are dominated by buyers or sellers. Aggressive orders, those executed at market price, typically reflect urgency and strong conviction from market participants. Recently, this ratio’s 14-day moving average has seen a notable decline, pointing to increased aggressive selling activity. This trend suggests that bears are regaining control, triggering a wave of profit-taking and distribution as Ethereum struggles near resistance. If the selling pressure persists and the ratio continues trending downward, Ethereum could undergo a deeper correction, with the $2.2K support emerging as a likely target. However, if this aggressive selling is primarily driven by short-term players or “weak hands,” it could represent a healthy consolidation phase before a broader bullish breakout resumes. In short, Ethereum’s next direction hinges on whether the current selling momentum intensifies or exhausts, in the face of growing mid-term demand.

Many people online are speculating that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might soon approve several XRP spot ETF applications. Big companies like Bitwise, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, and 21Shares have already submitted their applications, and some important decision dates are coming up soon. The first major date to watch is June 17, 2025, when the SEC is expected to make a decision on Franklin Templeton’s spot XRP ETF application. Other decisions are also lined up — Grayscale’s deadline was May 21, 2025 and Bitwise is waiting for a decision on May 25, 2025. The crypto community is keeping a close eye on these dates because if any of these get approved, it could give a big push to XRP’s price and popularity. At the same time, another rumor is doing the rounds. Some people believe that the SEC and Ripple have already quietly settled their long-running legal battle, and they’re just waiting for the judge to approve it. But former SEC attorney Marc Fagel has cleared things up. He said that the judge actually rejected the request from both Ripple and the SEC. It’s not actually settled. The parties may have entered an agreement, but implementing the settlement requires court action. And the court indicated it would not simply do what the parties asked without further briefing. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) May 24, 2025 According to Fagel, while both sides may have agreed on a deal, it’s not official yet. The court wants them to explain why it should change the decision it had already made. He added, “It’s not actually settled. The parties may have entered an agreement, but implementing the settlement requires court action. And the court indicated it would not simply do what the parties asked without further briefing.” In short — both the XRP ETF decisions and the Ripple lawsuit situation are still up in the air.

According to the authorities, the hackers stole tons of company data and demanded a ransom of about Rs. 4.5 lakh (approximately $5,283) in Bitcoins. According to the police, the hackers, upon gaining access and stealing the data, threatened to delete the important ones if the company refused to comply with their ransom demands. This move is defined as ransomware, where hackers or malicious entities gain access to a system or important information and threaten to delete it if the victims do not comply with payments. Over the years, there has been a series of ransomware cases, involving even entities with the most sophisticated security. Hackers demand Bitcoin to return the company’s sensitive data According to the authorities, the issue came to light on May 3, after the company’s staff started encountering issues while logging into its servers. The police mentioned that after gaining access to the servers using the “forgot password” option, they realized that a lot of data was missing. The company proceeded to hire third-party IT contractors to look into the issue, and it was then that they found a note from the hackers detailing their activities. According to the police, the hackers left a note in the form of a text file for the company on their server, which stated that they were able to carry out the activity because the company lacked better security measures. They also added that the company would have to pay a big ransom in order to protect their files and not have them damaged beyond repairs. The text file also mentioned that the hackers would completely damage the stolen data should the company make any attempt to either recover them or delete files on its server. The hackers added that if the company refused to comply with their demands and pay the ransom soon, they would either delete the stolen data or leak it online. Finally, they said it was a one-time deal, adding that they could even go ahead to give the company tips on how to strengthen its security after the ransom is paid. Police to charge suspects as global crypto-related crimes rise According to the police, when the advertising agency enlisted the services of a cyber security expert to look into the issue, they submitted a report saying that the hackers had used the Brute Force Attack method to gain access into their server. The cyber security firm mentioned that the hacker used trial and error methods until they were in the company’s servers. The police mentioned that they received a complaint from 33-year-old Pranay Ramaiyaa, who is a resident of Thane and an employee of the advertising agency. The police have also proceeded to register a case against the unknown suspects, charging them under sections 43 (penalty and compensation for damage to the computer, computer system, etc.), 65 (tampering with computer source documents), and 66 (computer-related offenses) of the Information Technology Act and under sections 308 (extortion) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. Meanwhile, this is not the first case of ransom demands related to digital assets over the last few months, with criminal elements now upping their activities, targeting influential entities in the sector. For instance, some months ago, the father of a crypto millionaire was kidnapped, with his son urged to pay ransom in digital assets or else they would kill him. The criminals even went ahead to mutilate the man, using it as a pressure tactic to force his son to pay the ransom. Another incident that happened recently was that of crypto investor John Woeltz, who kidnapped and tied up a tourist for weeks, forcing him to give up the passwords to his account. The tourist, who coincidentally was a long-time business partner of the suspect, said the assailant inflicted many wounds on him and took pictures of it to either blackmail him into giving up his assets or scare his family into paying a ransom.

The Human Rights Foundation (HRF), which hosts the annual summit for individual freedoms and human rights, confirmed Durov will address remotely by livestream instead. It’s unfortunate the French courts would disallow Mr. Durov from joining a platform where his voice is so needed,” said HRF founder and CEO Thor Halvorssen. Durov, who has long spoken about digital freedom of speech, has been a vocal figure in the crypto and technology space because he refused to succumb to censorship demands from authoritarian regimes. Durov Accuses French Censorship Request Before Romanian Elections The travel ban follows disputed claims by Durov of being threatened by French spies to censor rightwing voices on Telegram. Durov, in a May 18 telegram post, accused Nicolas Lerner, head of France’s General Directorate for Internal Security (DGSI), of asking him to ban political voices related to Romania’s upcoming presidential elections. The meeting took place at Paris’s Hôtel de Crillon, where Lerner supposedly requested moderation of speech that was conservative-leaning, stated Durov. “You can’t ‘defend democracy’ by destroying democracy,” Durov replied with rejection of the request. He went on to tweet on X that Telegram would not begin censoring when it rejected demands to do so in Russia, Iran, or Belarus. Telegram’s Unwavering Stand on Free Speech Durov reaffirmed Telegram will never succumb to political pressure to censor and would sooner leave a market than sacrifice its very foundations. Calling the request a blatant violation of human rights, Durov maintains freedom of expression must be safeguarded everywhere—not on an ad hoc basis based on politics.

As Memorial Day approaches this Monday, thin liquidity in the crypto market is raising questions about potential price moves. Could a post-holiday dip push ETH down toward $2,300, or will it find support to hold current levels? ETF Flows Show Renewed Optimism; Ethereum Supported? May 23 was a big day for crypto ETFs. Bitcoin ETFs saw $211M in inflows, Ethereum ETFs $58.63M. 22,000 ETH were bought, so institutional investors are still paying attention. Bitcoin ETFs : $211.74M in inflows , 1,900 BTC added. Ethereum ETFs : $58.63M invested, 22,000 ETH added. https://twitter.com/PushpendraTech/status/1926294065248657446 These flows show ETH is back in favor. The renewed interest is likely due to recent regulatory clarity, improving macro and network upgrades. Ethereum Technical Analysis: Caution on Key Levels On the 2-hour chart, ETH has broken the trendline and is stuck below the 50-period EMA at $2,555 which is now resistance. Given the bearish breakout of an upward trendline at around $2,500 area, the Ethereum price prediction remains bearish. Candlestick patterns at $2,523 are showing hesitation and the widening MACD histogram is bearish momentum. Key levels to watch: Support : $2,378, $2,272, $2,172. Resistance : $2,555, $2,626. Indicators : Bearish MACD, EMA acting as resistance, trendline break is bearish. For traders, patience is key. A confirmed break below $2,378 could mean more downside until $2,300. Above $2,555 and we could see a rally back to $2,800. Will Memorial Day Liquidity Cause a Ethereum Price Squeeze? With volume likely to be thin over the long weekend, ETH could see bigger moves. If ETF flows continue and sentiment stays positive, we could see a break above resistance. But if the market is hesitant, we may see ETH test lower support early next week. BTC Bull Token Nears $7.33M Cap as 65% APY Staking Draws Interest With ETH/USD falling below $2,500, attention is shifting to altcoins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . So far, $6.33 million has been raised out of a $7.33 million cap. The presale is closing in on its limit, next presale price jump closes in fast. Bitcoin Rewards and Supply Reductions BTC Bull Token operates with a built-in system: the higher Bitcoin’s price, the more BTC airdrops are distributed to token holders. Notably, presale participants receive priority. The system also features: Token burns every $50K BTC increase, reducing supply. Current token price at $0.00253 before the next bump. This approach aligns token value with Bitcoin’s price moves while maintaining scarcity through programmed burns. Staking Terms for Passive Returns BTCBULL’s staking pool holds 1.62 billion tokens offering 65% APY, with: No lockup periods or fees. Full access to funds at any time. This structure appeals to holders looking for yield without complex requirements or risk of illiquidity. Momentum Before the Cap Fills With just over $1 million remaining in the presale, buyers are positioning early. The token’s mechanics of Bitcoin-tied rewards, supply adjustments, and staking options are driving participation. Key figures: USDT raised : $6,329,314.26 / $7,332,195 Token price : $0.00253 BTCBULL offers a whopping ~65% APY on its Ethereum-based staking pool (currently holding 1.61B BTCBULL), with no lockups or withdrawal fees. That means passive yield — with full liquidity.

Codename:Pepe isn’t here to ride the hype, it’s engineered to hunt alpha. Here’s what sets it apart: AI trend-tracking to spot breakout tokens before the crowd Real-time data analysis for smarter trades Insider-style forecasts based on deep data mining Early signal alerts to give holders a first-mover edge And soon, Codename:Pepe will unleash an automated AI trader — a bot designed to execute trades autonomously, aiming to generate passive income from real market patterns, not speculation. The Power of AGNT: Codename:Pepe’s native token At the heart of this ecosystem is AGNT, an access pass to: A private DAO where investors vote on strategies and manage portfolios Premium tools, staking perks, and AI-generated analytics An AI-powered launchpad for new token releases Currently, AGNT is in its 20th presale stage, priced at $0.023809 — with the final stage set to hit $1. That’s over 40x potential upside for those who are early. Audited, trusted, and meme-tested Security matters — and Codename:Pepe has already passed an audit by Pessimistic, one of the most trusted blockchain security firms. While many memecoins collapse under their own hype, this one is built on solid tech — and meme magic. Could Codename:Pepe break into the memecoin elite? With a bold vision, real AI infrastructure, and early community momentum, Codename:Pepe isn’t just another token — it’s a contender. The blend of humor, data, and decentralized ambition positions it to become one of the Top 10 memecoins of this cycle. From meme to mainstream: Shiba Inu’s future potential Shiba Inu (SHIB) has gained 4.65% in the past week and 14.20% over the past month. This recent upward trend suggests growing interest in the token. Despite these gains, SHIB is still down 40.24% over the past six months. The current RSI of 55.34 indicates moderate buying pressure, which could support further price increases. The price is currently between $0.00001344 and $0.0000171, nearing the resistance level at $0.0000192. If SHIB breaks this resistance, it could see additional gains. The support level is at $0.00001188, which, if breached, may lead to a decline. Based on recent performance and RSI data, SHIB may rise toward the resistance level. Breaking above $0.0000192 could result in further percentage gains. However, the significant six-month decline shows volatility remains. The coming days will be crucial in determining SHIB’s price direction. Dogecoin gains 37% this month: What’s next? Dogecoin is currently trading between $0.21 and $0.25. Over the past week, its price has increased by 12.02%. In the past month, it has surged by 37.00%. However, over the last six months, the price has decreased by 42.97%. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 55.52, indicating neutral momentum. This suggests there may be room for further price appreciation before reaching overbought levels. Dogecoin’s nearest resistance level is at $0.28. If the price climbs to this point from the current range, it could see gains of up to 33%. The nearest support is at $0.19. A drop to this level would represent a decrease of up to 24%. Given the recent positive momentum, Dogecoin may continue its upward trend toward the resistance level. A break above $0.28 could signal further growth. Traders are watching these key levels closely to see where the price heads next. Conclusion Recent price swings in SHIB and DOGE suggest limited potential for significant short-term gains. These cryptocurrencies may not offer the rapid returns that investors are seeking in the current bullish market. In contrast, Codename:Pepe crypto introduces true intelligence aimed at maximizing profits. By leveraging advanced AI to analyze trends and execute trades, it presents a promising opportunity for investors looking for substantial growth beyond traditional memecoins.

Solana (SOL): Positive Trend and Ecosystem Expansion Solana is trading between $158 and $175, with analysts watching for a breakout above $175 to retest $183. The network’s high throughput, low fees, and expanding DeFi ecosystem are attracting both users and developers.

Bitcoin (BTC): Market Anchor and Steady Inflows Bitcoin is holding above $110,000, with forecasts suggesting a range of $111,000–$115,000 for late May and potential highs of $140,000 if bullish momentum continues. While BTC remains the market’s anchor, its upside is now more measured—making MAGACOIN FINANCE the clear destination for investors targeting higher-growth opportunities. Stellar Lumens (XLM): Quiet Strength, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Stellar is projected to trade between $0.65 and $0.80 in 2025, with technicals and institutional interest supporting long-term gains. While XLM’s fundamentals are strong, its near-term upside is less dramatic than the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which continues to set the standard for early-stage excitement. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF Conclusion Ethereum and Solana’s steady advances are noteworthy, but the heaviest community surge and most dramatic growth potential are now unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE.

Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is highly volatile and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification and research are advised. The coin is expected to touch the $0.491 level by 2026. Why is DOGE down? DOGE’s price decreased to $0.219 over the last 24 hours as bearish pressure rose around immediate resistance channels. Moreover, sellers are currently dominating the price action. What is the expected value of Dogecoin in 2025? Dogecoin is expected to trade at an average price of $0.263401 in 2025. Will DOGE reach $0.50? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by January 2027. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support for this meme coin can push it to $1 by 2029. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 2,849.48 DOGE in May; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading above its average price of the last two years. Currently, the coin is following a downward pattern since it peaked at $0.414 on January 17, 2025, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.37 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial.

By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March’s bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February.

Despite this, the price exhibits slight bullish momentum, suggesting a potential consolidation at this level for the short term. Technical Analysis The Daily Chart Bitcoin has officially broken above its previous all-time high of $109K, establishing a new peak around the $112K region. This breakout underscores strong buyer interest and highlights the bullish sentiment that continues to fuel this cycle. However, the recent price action suggests that bullish momentum is softening, with BTC beginning a minor pullback toward the broken $109K level. This area now acts as a crucial support zone. If renewed demand materializes at this level, Bitcoin could resume its upward trajectory toward the $115K mark and potentially higher. Conversely, if selling pressure intensifies and the $109K level fails to hold, a deeper correction may unfold. In this scenario, a retest of the psychological $100K support becomes increasingly probable, potentially classifying the breakout as a bull trap, shaking investor confidence, and introducing volatility in the short term. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour chart, BTC maintains a bullish market structure, with a clear sequence of higher highs and higher lows. The price has consistently respected an ascending trendline, which remains a key dynamic support. Following the breakout, Bitcoin is currently retracing toward this trendline as well as the broken $109K swing high. This confluence zone will play a pivotal role in determining the next move. Should it hold, a renewed rally toward the $115K resistance zone becomes highly likely. However, if Bitcoin fails to hold this level and breaks below the trendline, it would signal short-term weakness, opening the door for a correction toward the $100K range. On-chain Analysis By ShayanMarkets While BTC has reached a new all-time high at $112K, a wave of profit-taking is naturally expected, particularly from short-term traders securing gains. However, a deeper look into on-chain metrics reveals a contrasting narrative among long-term holders, investors who have held BTC for over 150 days. The LTH-SOPR has remained relatively low during this rally, especially when compared to the levels seen during Bitcoin’s surge to $73K in late-2024. Despite the price now being significantly higher, long-term holders are not showing signs of major profit realization. This indicates ongoing accumulation behavior, reflecting confidence in higher future valuations. This divergence in behavior highlights that the current consolidation phase is likely driven by short-term holders and retail participants, rather than broader market distribution. If long-term holders continue to display conviction, Bitcoin is well-positioned to resume its uptrend following this short-term pause, with the potential to set new ATHs in the mid-term.

If you’re still haunted by the missed chance to ride Solana before it surged or wished you’d bet on Injective Protocol ($INJ) when it was in pennies, you’re not alone. The crypto market has always rewarded early conviction and punished hesitation. Now, as another powerful contender emerges, one with a fully built development environment and rising ROI charts, those who missed earlier trains might finally have their redemption. That next big move might just be Qubetics . Qubetics ($TICS) isn’t just another speculative token riding hype—it’s building real infrastructure for developers, businesses, and future blockchain utilities through its robust QubeQode IDE. With a rapidly moving presale, a major mainnet launch scheduled for Q2 2025, and an ROI projection that’s already catching fire, Qubetics could be a rare second chance for those who missed out before. The best cryptos to buy this month aren’t based on noise—they’re built on value, use case, and timing. And right now, the timing for Qubetics couldn’t be more critical. Qubetics’ Early Rise Proves It’s One of the Best Cryptos to Buy This Month Early adopters of Qubetics saw something the market is just now waking up to. Those fortunate enough to jump in back in September 2024 when the Qubetics presale quietly opened snagged $TICS tokens at only $0.01. Since then, multiple low-price phases have been completely sold out, rewarding early believers. Still, the best cryptos to buy this month include Qubetics not just for nostalgia, but because the opportunity hasn’t yet left the station. At Stage 35, with $0.2785 as the current token price, you’re still positioned for exponential returns. The presale has already raised over $17.3 million with more than 513 million $TICS sold and 26,900+ token holders on record. And with a 10% discount available before the next stage price hike in just seven days, urgency isn’t optional—it’s required. This top crypto presale is still one of the best cryptos to buy this month. With a mainnet rollout expected in Q2 2025 and 12.85% of total token supply allocated to early-stage backers, Qubetics continues to reward those who act, not wait. Let’s break down the ROI: If you buy $2,000 worth of $TICS at today’s price, you’re getting approximately 7,180 tokens. Should the token hit $1, your holding grows to $7,180. But if it reaches $10 or $15 after the mainnet launch, your returns hit $71,800 or $107,700 respectively. That’s a 3,489.47% to 5,284.21% ROI—figures that make Qubetics undeniably one of the best cryptos to buy this month. Beyond the numbers lies its core product—QubeQode IDE. This visual blockchain development environment allows users to build complex decentralized applications without writing extensive code. Think of a fintech startup wanting to tokenize real estate, or an educational platform building secure student ID systems on-chain. With drag-and-drop components, form-based configuration, and a vast library of smart contract snippets, Qubetics’ QubeQode IDE reduces development barriers for non-technical entrepreneurs and saves development time for blockchain veterans. It’s real utility, not vaporware, which further solidifies Qubetics’ position among the best cryptos to buy this month . Injective’s Past Explosive Growth Shows Why Qubetics Could Be Next Injective Protocol ($INJ) is now well known, but its beginnings didn’t forecast the rise it’s experienced. Launched with a modest ICO, Injective initially raised under the radar attention. Its initial coin offering was priced at just around $0.40. Fast forward to its all-time high of over $50, and it’s clear many investors seriously underestimated its potential. The missed ROI on Injective became a textbook case of why early-stage bets on real utility projects can generate staggering wealth. The journey from its token launch to integrating with various DeFi platforms and gaining listings on major exchanges wasn’t luck—it was execution. And those who dismissed it early missed one of the most lucrative growth stories in crypto. Today, Injective is a key player in the decentralized finance ecosystem. Its interoperability, low transaction costs, and ability to support custom-built dApps have cemented its place in the market. But for all its current prestige, those who joined late are left watching from the sidelines. The explosive trajectory of Injective is a reminder that crypto markets are built on early conviction. It sets a clear precedent—projects with real utility, early access, and strong fundamentals can grow by thousands of percent, and often the “missed” coin of yesterday becomes the benchmark of tomorrow. Conclusion: A Second Shot at a First-Mover Advantage The crypto market is brutally honest—it rewards action and punishes delay. If Injective was the one that got away, Qubetics might just be your shot at redemption. With a solid presale foundation, real technological infrastructure in place, and a mainnet just around the corner, it’s quickly earning its place among the best cryptos to buy this month. Missing out on another thousand-percent ROI would be hard to justify a second time. Qubetics is offering more than just tokens—it’s offering tools, innovation, and early-access upside. While others are still waiting for “the next big thing,” you have the opportunity to join this top crypto presale before it makes its next leap. As history shows, it’s not just about spotting opportunity—it’s about seizing it before the market catches on.

According to Pakistan’s Finance Minister, Muhammad Aurangzeb, this is the country’s first significant step towards becoming a digital economy. He said, “This allocation of power is not just about crypto or AI—it’s about shaping a digital future for the country.” The minister added that excess electricity could now be used as a “source of national income.” A Finance Division statement mentioned that the initiative, backed by PCC (Pakistan Crypto Council), a government-backed body, is following a broad strategy to create high-tech jobs, attract billions of dollars in foreign direct investment, and generate billions in government income. PCC CEO, Bilal bin Saqib said, “This energy-backed digital transformation not only unlocks high-value investment but enables the government to generate foreign exchange in USD through bitcoin mining.” The statement further added that Pakistan is both economically and geographically positioned to become a “global hub for data centers” because it is a digital bridge between the Middle East, Europe, and Asia. Pakistan government to introduce tax incentives Sources close to the Ministry mentioned that the government may soon introduce tax exemptions to boost the development of blockchain infrastructure and AI. These incentives may include an easing of income tax and import tariffs for companies investing in data centers. The government also revealed its plans to develop renewable energy-powered data centers in the next phase. Officials have already confirmed that the new Africa-2 Submarine Sable Project will boost the country’s internet connectivity. This undersea cable links 46 landing stations with 33 countries across Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East. It is expected to boost the country’s bandwidth, add backup routes, and lower latency, all of which are essential for data-intensive blockchain and AI operations. Earlier this week, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir met with Pakistan Crypto Council CEO Bilal Bin Saqib to explore the country’s move into digital finance. During the meeting, Saqib highlighted the key part young Pakistanis will play in this shift. He said, “The Pakistan Crypto Council exists because our youth demand a seat at the global tech table. We are building for a generation that sees digital finance, decentralization, and AI as opportunities to lead, innovate, and uplift the nation.” Saqib then briefed the army chief on the council’s recent activities. He noted a visit by a World Liberty Financial delegation and by Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. He also spoke about ongoing talks to shape regulations and about partnerships meant to build digital skills and boost the country’s standing on the world stage. Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLF) has also signed a Letter of Intent with the Pakistan Crypto Council. The goal is to speed up blockchain projects, stablecoin use, and wider DeFi adoption in Pakistan. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

45076407,https://zycrypto.com/?p=106533,1748168949,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,"Elon Musk’s Company Tesla (TSLA) Owns 11,900 BTC Worth $1.2 Billion",https://zycrypto.com/elon-musks-company-tesla-tsla-owns-11900-btc-worth-1-2-billion/,"Tesla (TSLA), an Electric Vehicle company owned by Elon Musk, has 11,900 BTC worth around $1.2 billion. Arkham Intelligence revealed the latest estimates after analysing blockchain data. Tesla first announced its strategy to buy Bitcoin in Q1 2021. In a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, on February 8, 2021, Tesla reported the purchase of 43,200 BTC worth around $1.5 billion. At the time, Tesla introduced various measures to incorporate Bitcoin into the company, such as an option to pay for EV cars with BTC. However, Tesla abandoned this option when there were concerns regarding Bitcoin’s use of proof-of-work methods that negatively impact the environment. In May 2021, the option to buy Tesla cars with Bitcoin was removed. Tesla employs Coinbase Prime Custody to handle its large Bitcoin treasury. The company has been interested in cryptocurrencies for some time, but has had to reconsider some use cases due to the ongoing concern regarding Bitcoin’s use of fossil fuels. Tesla aims to promote EV cars to support sustainable practices. Bitcoin’s proof-of-work algorithm relies on large amounts of electricity, which still depend on fossil fuels and coal production. There is speculation that Musk will integrate tokens such as Bitcoin and Dogecoin into his businesses. Musk bought $1.5 billion Bitcoin in 2021, but had to sell many of the tokens to pay for expenses. Musk may be reconsidering his sales due to the increasing wealth that crypto adds to his balance sheet. On April 22, Tesla revealed that it owned 11,509 BTC, worth around $1.05 billion on its balance sheet. However, due to the current rise in price and an all-time high (ATH) of $111,000 for Bitcoin, Tesla’s holdings have gone up to around $1.2 billion. Tesla may have missed many opportunities due to its back-and-forth policy regarding digital assets. For example, in March 2021, Tesla added the option to buy electric cars with Bitcoin. However, the EV maker flip-flopped in May 2021 because of concerns that Bitcoin was reversing the positive aspects of Tesla due to its reliance on fossil fuels. Further, during Q1 2021, Tesla sold 10% of its Bitcoin holdings, making a $272 million profit. Then Tesla sold 75% of its remaining Bitcoin in Q2 2022, leaving only 9,720 BTC in its treasury. Elon Musk said that he sold Bitcoin because the company needed the money. However, if Musk held onto the 43k BTC, the company would have nearly $5 billion worth of Bitcoin. Other companies also hold Bitcoin treasuries, which can be compared to Tesla’s approach. Strategy holds 576,230 BTC and made its latest purchase of 7,390 BTC on May 19 for around $764 million. With a Bitcoin price of $111,000, Strategy would own around $63 billion. Metaplanet, a Tokyo-listed company, also creates a large Bitcoin treasury. Metaplanet recently added 1,004 BTC to its treasury, falling short of 2,000 BTC from its target of 10,000 BTC. Governments are also interested in Bitcoin treasuries. President Trump has approved a Bitcoin treasury that uses seized assets from federal investigations. Meanwhile, at the state level, New Hampshire and Texas have approved local treasuries, further boosting the popularity of cryptocurrencies. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) changed the rules regarding digital asset holdings. Many investors complained because the old rules required a public company to use cost accounting methods to list crypto assets. The problem with cost accounting methods is that the crypto assets are listed at their bought price and are changed if the asset drops in value, which may severely undervalue the asset. The new changes allow companies to report the fair value of their digital assets. For example, when Tesla bought Bitcoin at $30k, the company reported the value of each Bitcoin at $30k. When the price fell to $15k, Tesla reported the value of each Bitcoin as $15k. However, when Bitcoin bounced back up in value, Tesla continued to report that it had a value of $15k. In fact, from 2022 to 2024, Tesla reported the same amount of $184 million in Bitcoin holdings, despite a price change.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Elon Musk,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-25 10:29:09

With its AI-powered investment engine and growing community, Unilabs could be a formidable force in the DeFi market. The platform seeks to introduce AI technology into DeFi investments, making it smarter and easier. Dogecoin breaks out of cup and handle pattern According to Trader Tardigrade, the Dogecoin price is about to explode. The analyst noted that the memecoin has broken out from a cup and handle pattern. If the uptrend continues, the Dogecoin price could cross the $0.25 resistance to $0.30. Another analyst known as Glory2GloryX told their followers the Dogecoin price is breaking out of a bullish flag. They say the value of DOGE could rise to $0.35 as the next target. Meanwhile, CryptoKaleo forecasts that the Dogecoin price could climb to $1.00 in the coming months. The value of DOGE is historically known to skyrocket after a Bitcoin halving, his chart showed. So, the analyst told his followers not to sleep on DOGE. The Dogecoin price is now consolidating between $0.21 and $0.25. Its value has skyrocketed by 12.0% on the weekly level, signaling a massive hike in buying momentum. The monthly and yearly Dogecoin price charts are also bullish with gains of 37.7% and 48.3%, respectively.

In terms of future trajectory, Crypto Beast says the Ripple price could soar to $3.14 soon. With more buying pressure, the analyst expects the Ripple price to surge to $4.29. Another analyst called Dominus believes the Ripple price could climb higher. They argued that a God Candle is coming, which could push the Ripple price to $7.00. RipBullWinkle is another expert who believes the Ripple price is ready to skyrocket. They posted a Ripple price chart where the value of XRP shot up to $5.40. Technical analysis currently shows that bulls are in control. The relative strength index, which is above 50, signals that bulls are in charge. Unilabs: Promoting AI-driven DeFi investment AI is changing the cryptocurrency sector. In 2025, AI-focused crypto tokens have surged, adding nearly $10 billion in market capitalization, with several top assets rallying over 50%. Amid this AI boom, a new DeFi project is gaining momentum. Unilabs is a standout project offering an AI-powered platform designed to optimize crypto investments through intelligent automation.

The trader had been bullish on Bitcoin, predicting it would reach as high as $118,000. According to on-chain analyst EmberCN, Wynn liquidated his $11,588 BTC ($1.2 billion) long position on Bitcoin after the flagship asset dropped to $107,000. His actual liquidation price is $105,180, but he chose to close all positions, complete the process within 47 minutes, and take over $13 million in losses. Interestingly, the decision to liquidate comes less than 24 hours after he posted on X that Bitcoin would reach $110,500 today and should climb up to $121,000 by next week. While many people praised his bullish post then, his decision to close all his positions was a surprise. However, Wynn justified closing the positions, noting that technical analysis showing a golden cross spooked him and made him close his positions. While the golden cross is considered a bullish signal, it is usually preceded by a dip in price. Crypto analyst Kyle Chasse had predicted that Bitcoin could drop between 10% and 15% before seeing another liftoff that could send it to a new high. Chasse added that altcoins could even fall further. Despite closing his biggest Bitcoin at a loss, the trader reportedly made $8.45 million in combined profits on all his Bitcoin positions over the last few days, benefiting from BTC’s recent rally. Market volatility leaves Hyperliquid whales with mixed result Meanwhile, this is not the first time Wynn would take a loss on a trade, even though his cumulative PNL remains positive. According to Lookonchain, the trader took a $5.3 million loss after closing his ETH and SUI long positions on May 24. However, he also made $25.19 million in total profits on his PEPE memecoin longs, which were held for more than 2 months. During that period, PEPE gained a 62% increase in value. Another popular whale, Machi Big Brother, made $2.1 million in profits on Hyperliquid after opening long positions on ETH and HYPE tokens with $6.04 million. He made over $669,000 on the trade and used all his funds to buy almost 219,000 HYPE tokens, which he staked. With all the massive trading on Hyperliquid, which has seen the decentralized exchange dominate trading volume for decentralized perps, the HYPE token has been rising in value. In fact, it is up more than 5% in the last 24 hours and trades around $35 after gaining more than 100% in the last two months. Interestingly, HYPE’s performance, which has seen it gain 30% in the past week, has forced some traders who short the token to capitulate. One trader has lost $23.5 million on shorting HYPE on Hyperliquid and had to close all their short positions after more than four weeks. Over $180 million liquidated in 24 hours as crypto futures dominate trading Meanwhile, Wynn’s decision to close his long positions is unsurprising, given that the recent price correction has liquidated several long positions. According to CoinGlass data, $182.82 million of positions have been liquidated, and $138.57 million are long positions. ETH bulls are the most affected, with $43.46 million in liquidations, followed by Bitcoin with $20.82 million. SOL bulls also lost $7.20 million in liquidation after the recent drop in price. With longs getting liquidated, it is not surprising that short positions over the last 24 hours have increased and now account for almost 52% of open positions. Meanwhile, the market volatility is attracting more speculative trading, with the Spot to Futures ratio on Binance now at 4.9, the highest in 18 months. The 4.9 ratio means the futures volume is 4.9 times bigger than the spot volume. Futures to Spot Volume Ratio on Binance hits 18-month high (Source: CryptoQuant ) Despite the volatility, experts believe that Bitcoin would still go higher. Crypto analyst Crypto Dan said a few days ago that the market had not reached overheated territory as metrics such as short-term capital inflows and funding rates remain low compared to previous peaks. Thus, BTC might still set a new high in this cycle. The recent drop appears only to be a price correction in reaction to the announcement of a potential 50% tariff against the European Union and a 25% tariff on Apple iPhones if it continues to manufacture outside the US.

As we head into the Memorial Day weekend all eyes are on whether reduced liquidity will lead to big moves to $115,000. Bitcoin ETF Inflows Signal Renewed Institutional Confidence Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw significant inflows between May 17 and May 23, totaling $2.75 billion, a 4.5× increase from the previous week, according to Farside Investors. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) stood out, continuing its eight-day streak of inflows. Supporting this, Coinglass data reveals heightened spot exchange activity. On May 23, the BTC spot exchange net inflow heatmap shows Binance leading with $19.87 million in net inflows over a 1-hour window, while Bybit, OKX, Kraken, and Bitstamp saw smaller inflows. Bitcoin Spot Data Analysis – Source: Coinglass Spot exchange volume heatmaps confirm Binance’s dominance with $92.84 million, followed by Bybit’s $42.71 million. Bitcoin Spot Data Analysis – Source: Coinglass Key highlights: Spot ETF inflows : $2.75B between May 17–23; $5.39B total for May Spot exchange inflows : Binance $19.87M net inflow, Bitstamp $1.91M Exchange volume : Binance $92.84M, Bybit $42.71M, OKX $22.34M This data aligns with Bitcoin’s recent rally to $111,970 on May 22 and suggests renewed institutional and exchange-driven interest. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index cooled from 78 (“Extreme Greed”) to 66 (“Greed”), reflecting a slight pullback in sentiment. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Key Levels for the Weekend On the 2 hour chart Bitcoin is testing supports as it’s below the 50 period EMA at $108,315. Price is pressing against the ascending trendline at $107,000 and the Fibonacci retracement levels from the $102,190 low to the $111,958 high have $107,074 as a key pivot. Supports : $107,074, $105,905, $104,289 Resistance : $108,315, $109,637 Indicators : Bearish MACD crossover, indecision candles, trendline pressure If BTC goes below $107,000 expect drops to $105,905 or $104,289. But if it goes above $108,315 it could regain bullish momentum and target $109,637 and above. Hence, Bitcoin price prediction remains bearish under $107,.000 and vice versa. Will Thin Liquidity Cause a Weekend Spike? With the long weekend ahead reduced liquidity will amplify price movements. If ETF inflows continue and technicals recover BTC might go to $115,000. But if indecision and low volume persists BTC could move big in either direction. BTC Bull Token Nears $7.33M Cap as 65% APY Staking Draws Interest With BTC/USD falling below $108,000, attention is shifting to altcoins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . So far, $6.33 million has been raised out of a $7.33 million cap. The presale is closing in on its limit, next presale price jump closes in fast. Bitcoin Rewards and Supply Reductions BTC Bull Token operates with a built-in system: the higher Bitcoin’s price, the more BTC airdrops are distributed to token holders. Notably, presale participants receive priority. The system also features: Token burns every $50K BTC increase, reducing supply. Current token price at $0.00253 before the next bump. This approach aligns token value with Bitcoin’s price moves while maintaining scarcity through programmed burns. Staking Terms for Passive Returns BTCBULL’s staking pool holds 1.62 billion tokens offering 65% APY, with: No lockup periods or fees. Full access to funds at any time. This structure appeals to holders looking for yield without complex requirements or risk of illiquidity. Momentum Before the Cap Fills With just over $1 million remaining in the presale, buyers are positioning early. The token’s mechanics of Bitcoin-tied rewards, supply adjustments, and staking options are driving participation. Key figures: USDT raised : $6,329,314.26 / $7,332,195 Token price : $0.00253 BTCBULL offers a whopping ~65% APY on its Ethereum-based staking pool (currently holding 1.61B BTCBULL), with no lockups or withdrawal fees. That means passive yield — with full liquidity.

Right now, meme coins are lighting up the charts again, riding the wave of social hype, whale moves, and bold presale launches. With Bitcoin teasing a breakout and ETH and Solana heating up with ecosystem upgrades, eyes are shifting to low-cap meme plays with explosive upside. The game’s no longer about waiting; it’s about catching the next moonshot before the herd arrives. Meet BTFD Coin (BTFD) —a fresh contender that’s rewriting the playbook with its electric presale, buzzing P2E game, and a monster 300% bonus offer. With just two days left until its May 26 presale close, BTFD has stacked over $7.14 million, sold 75 billion tokens, and onboarded more than 12,300 holders . Analysts aren’t whispering anymore—they’re shouting: this could be the biggest meme coin explosion of 2025. If you’re hunting for the top 5 meme coins to buy and hold during this pre-summer bull push, here’s your short list. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD): A Must-Have Meme in 2025 What happens when you mix a cheeky crypto name, real play-to-earn gameplay, and a firecracker of a presale? You get BTFD. This isn’t just some degen pump—it’s a meme coin with strategy. Launched on Ethereum for serious scalability, BTFD’s built-in P2E game is already live, letting players smash through levels and earn real tokens. The game isn’t a gimmick; it’s already drawing thousands thanks to a 4-level setup, in-game upgrades, and wallet-connected rewards. But the real sizzler? That ROI math. Right now, in Stage 15, $BTFD is priced at $0.0002. If you chuck in $2,500, you get 12.5 million tokens. Slam in the 300% bonus code LAUNCH300, and boom—you’re sitting on 50 million BTFD. At the listing price of $0.0006, that’s $30,000. But if it hits its predicted moon price of $0.006, that bag’s worth a wild $300,000. That’s an eye-popping 11,900% ROI, all from jumping in before May 26. With just one stage left, whales are already circling. This meme coin presale is gaining heat fast, and once it ends at 23:59 UTC on May 26, there’s no going back. Plus, 90% APY staking is live, the referral program gives 10% in tokens, and withdrawals post-launch are vested to ensure a solid runway. BTFD isn’t a coin—it’s a moment. Why are buyers stampeding toward BTFD? Because it’s the last big dip before a massive bull launch. 2. Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) This one’s pure meme madness with a gladiator twist. Goatseus Maximus brings ancient Roman flair to the crypto circus, backed by a community that thrives on chaos. Their latest community vote just approved a token burn to limit supply, which is causing bullish sentiment to spike. No roadmap, no problem—it’s a culture coin, and it’s pulling meme whales in droves. Why’s GOAT on this list? Because sometimes the loudest coins win—and this one’s screaming. 3. SPX6900 (SPX) SPX6900 blends finance memes with ultra-sticky branding. With references to stock market traders and Gen Z culture, it’s carved a niche where Bloomberg readers meet Reddit degen posters. The devs recently teased a staking model and merchandise line, and the token’s been trending in Twitter spaces thanks to community-led campaigns. Why’s SPX getting picked? Because it’s got virality and utility brewing in the same pot. 4. Bonk (BONK) Solana’s first meme coin isn’t slowing down. BONK got its start from an airdrop frenzy but has since matured into an ecosystem player. It’s now being integrated into multiple Solana wallets and DEXs, and its developers just released a community dashboard showing wallet distribution. BONK’s been used to test tokenomics experiments on Solana’s testnets too. Why is BONK still a contender? Because it’s baked into Solana’s meme culture, and that’s not fading. 5. Popcat (POPCAT) The sound might be silly, but the strategy isn’t. Popcat’s devs just launched the second phase of their Cat-Munity Rewards system, giving extra tokens to users who participate in games and polls. It’s riding a wave of TikTok hype again after a recent meme war with KEYCAT. Plus, the upcoming POPDEX platform could bring its own liquidity tools for meme tokens. Why did Popcat make the cut? Because it’s got momentum and meme loyalty on lock. Conclusion: Missing Out is Not an Option! Can you afford to sit out while the next meme coin rally kicks off? With the crypto market getting louder by the day, opportunities like BTFD don’t knock twice. It’s not just a coin—it’s a community, a live game, and a presale that’s bringing in over $7M in real-time buys. Use code LAUNCH300 and 4x your tokens instantly . Stake them at 90% APY, play to earn, or refer and stack even more. This weekend is your shot—presale ends May 26 at 23:59 UTC. If you’re shortlisting the top 5 meme coins to buy and hold, this is it.

In his recent post, the Australian senator questioned the value of the asset because he feels it can’t be eaten, adding that it is a Ponzi scheme. Senator Rennick’s reaction came after Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22. In his post he noted his criticism of the asset, saying: “You can’t eat Bitcoin,” in response to a user who talked about his stance. In his post, Rennick mentioned that Bitcoin has a better chance of going to $1 million, noting that this could happen because it is a Ponzi scheme. Australian senator draws the ire of the Bitcoin community According to the Australian senator, his main reason for calling Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme is because he feels the asset cannot produce anything. “What exactly will this product produce? Absolutely nothing and nor will the thousands of people buying and selling it,” he said. He also added that Australia needs real engineers, not financial engineers. “We need infrastructure that delivers essential services, particularly energy, water and transport,” he added. Yes I do – Bitcoin will ultimately go to a $1 million dollars. Why because it’s a Ponzi scheme whereby Blackrock will pump more and more dollars into a supply constrained product. What exactly will this product produce? Absolutely nothing and nor will the thousands of people… — Senator Gerard Rennick (@SenatorRennick) May 23, 2025 The statement did not go down well with the Bitcoin community, as they were quick to call out the Australian senator. According to a post by the Australian Bitcoin Industry Body (ABIB), the senator’s remarks showed a deep lack of understanding about the asset and what it stands for. The group also mentioned that the lack of understanding leads to the senator not realizing what he is missing. ABIB also mentioned that it matters because misunderstanding often leads to misrepresentation, which in turn leads to bad policy. The group added that the government needs to look into how Bitcoin can enrich the country. “This isn’t about whether Australians can use Bitcoin—we already do. This is about whether our government is capable of understanding how Bitcoin can enrich the nation, drive innovation, and build long-term resilience for Australians,” ABIB added. Unchained podcast host Laura Shin also had words for the senator, noting that people cannot eat the internet and asking if he is opposed to that, too. Bitcoin Marathon team lead Jimmy Kostro also said, “This is definitely going to age well. Please enlighten us with more of your deep and nuanced understanding of Bitcoin.” Rennick responds to his critics amid wider anti-Bitcoin criticism The Australian senator did not take the criticisms lying down as he responded to everybody who needed a response. He mentioned that he didn’t need to explain anything to anyone because it’s his opinion and he holds onto it. “It’s pathetic how the Bitcoin community needs reassurance from a politician – the very people they claim they want to be free from,” Rennick said. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin community has been quite active over the last few months, going after prominent individuals with dissenting views about the asset. A few weeks ago, the group was all over Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs, criticizing her decision to veto a bill that would have allowed the state to hold Bitcoin as part of its official reserves. According to Hobbs, she made the decision because the Arizona State Retirement System is one of the strongest in the country, noting that it makes the best investments. “Arizonans’ retirement funds are not the place for the state to try untested investments like virtual currency,” she added. The decision was met with backlash from prominent Bitcoin proponents, with Bitcoin entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano saying, “Imagine the ignorance of a politician to believe they can make investment decisions.” Casa co-founder Jameson Lopp also said the decision will age poorly. Meanwhile, the decision did seem to please some analysts, including Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff. Schiff has been a long-standing critic of the asset and didn’t waste time jumping to Hobbs’s defense.

45077114,https://timestabloid.com/?p=68301,1748170849,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Ripple (XRP) Price To Touch $5, But Is This New Altcoin Drawing Away Interest?",https://timestabloid.com/ripple-xrp-price-to-touch-5-but-is-this-new-altcoin-drawing/,"Ripple (XRP) is gaining traction with its recent Hidden Road acquisition, unlocking access to $11 trillion in daily securities clearing volume. This monumental deal positions XRP to potentially capture a slice of this colossal market, fueling speculation of a price surge to $5 in 2025. Yet, a new altcoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is quietly pulling investor focus with its practical DeFi lending model. Currently in phase 5 of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised $9,300,000, sold over 510 million tokens, and attracted 11,500 holders. As Ripple (XRP) eyes ambitious heights, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a compelling project, offering tangible utility and promising returns. Ripple (XRP) and Hidden Road’s Potential Ripple (XRP) is leveraging its Hidden Road deal to tap into the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation’s (FICC) massive $11 trillion daily volume. This integration could channel significant transaction flow through the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Even capturing 1% of this volume, or $110 billion daily, could amplify demand for Ripple (XRP). The platform burns small amounts of XRP per transaction, tightening supply over time. If institutional adoption grows, Ripple (XRP) could see its price climb toward $5, driven by network effects and liquidity needs. However, regulatory uncertainties linger, potentially slowing this ascent. Meanwhile, another project is quietly shifting investor attention toward a different opportunity in the crypto market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Ignites Interest Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche in the crypto market with its decentralized lending platform. Phase 5 of its presale is underway, offering tokens at $0.03, a 200% jump from the opening phase’s $0.01. Investors purchasing now are guaranteed a 100% return at the $0.06 launch price. Analysts project Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could hit $2.50 post-launch, promising a staggering 8,233% ROI. The project has raised $9,300,000, with over 510 million tokens sold and 11,500 holders onboard. As phase 6 looms with a 16.7% price hike to $0.035, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing significant interest for its structured growth and real-world utility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Lending Utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is delivering practical value through its lending and borrowing system. Users deposit assets like ETH to receive mtTokens, such as mtETH, which accrue interest over time. These tokens are transferable across DeFi platforms, enhancing liquidity and flexibility. Borrowers lock collateral exceeding loan values, ensuring stability and minimizing default risks. The platform’s buy-and-distribute mechanism uses revenue to repurchase Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens, redistributing them to stakers. This creates steady buy pressure, supporting price growth. The team is also developing a leaderboard dashboard, rewarding the top 50 holders with bonus tokens, further incentivizing long-term commitment to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Security and Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is prioritizing trust by pursuing a Certik audit for its smart contracts. The team will announce the audit’s completion on social platforms, reinforcing investor confidence. The platform’s overcollateralized lending model ensures robust security, appealing to cautious investors. Dynamic interest rates adjust to market conditions, balancing returns for lenders and borrowers. With crypto prices fluctuating, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a stable entry into DeFi. Its presale success signals strong market faith, positioning it as a standout in the crypto market. As phase 5 progresses, investors are seizing the chance to join before prices rise further. Crypto Prices and Market Outlook While Ripple (XRP) rides institutional momentum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing attention with its accessible presale and real-world utility. Crypto prices today reflect growing interest in projects with tangible applications. Ripple (XRP) could benefit from its $11 trillion volume access, but its $5 target hinges on adoption. Conversely, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) guarantees a 100% ROI at launch, with projections of $2.50 post-launch. The crypto investment landscape is shifting, with investors eyeing projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for sustainable growth. As crypto prices stabilize, early entry into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a strategic opportunity. Weighing the Altcoin Opportunity Ripple (XRP) holds promise with its institutional backing, potentially reaching $5 in 2025. Yet, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stealing the spotlight with its robust DeFi model and presale momentum.

According to the report, the attacker bypassed security checks by creating an overflow error in the system with cleverly designed parameters and managed to obtain a huge amount of liquid assets in exchange for a very small amount of tokens. SlowMist stated that the attacker used a vulnerability in the checked_shlw function by choosing carefully calculated parameters and obtained billions of dollars worth of liquidity by spending only 1 token. The report said that this was an extremely complex mathematical attack. The SlowMist security team stated that in order to prevent similar incidents, developers who develop smart contracts should meticulously check the boundary conditions in all mathematical functions.

Speaking at the Solana Accelerate event in New York on May 23, Wood explained that ETFs serve as a simple and accessible option for investors who find the process of managing wallets too complex. “I think ETFs are an important stepping stone because, you know, wallets seem so complicated, so much friction for consumers, they just wanna push a button,” Wood said. She emphasized that while crypto wallets offer added protection and independence, the ease and convenience of ETFs will keep them popular among traditional investors. “So ETFs for those who want the convenience, I don’t think, will lose a lot of their luster,” she added. ETH ETFs See Slower Growth, SOL Faces Image Challenges Bitbo data indicates that there are roughly 200 million active Bitcoin wallets globally. Meanwhile, U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded approximately $2.75 billion in inflows during the trading week ending May 23, coinciding with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high of $111,970. Since their launch in January 2024, spot Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated nearly $44.5 billion in inflows. Wood also commented on the performance of spot Ether ETFs, which have seen around $2.77 billion in inflows since their July 2024 debut. She suggested that these products were “less successful than people were expecting,” largely because the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) did not permit staking—a key feature of Ethereum’s ecosystem. The SEC recently delayed a decision on Bitwise’s proposal to include staking in its Ether ETF . Still, Wood believes Ether can be a starting point for new investors interested in smart contract platforms. “So they might start in the smart contract world with Ether, but once they study the technology, and follow the developers, and see the uptake by consumers, I think they will get there,” she explained. Cathie Wood on TRUMP Memecoin When asked about the impact of President Donald Trump’s memecoin , launched on Solana, Wood acknowledged that such events may deter institutional investors. “I think they might be a little turned off by what happened with the Trump memecoin,” she said, referring to the coin’s 50% plunge shortly after launch due to the absence of immediate crypto policy action. Wood concluded by noting that she’s still finalizing her Solana price forecast, while ARK recently raised its 2030 Bitcoin target from $1.5 million to $2.4 million.

Durov remains under legal restrictions in France after being indicted on six charges tied to Telegram’s misuse. He accused French intelligence of pressuring him to censor political content Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov will not appear in person at the Oslo Freedom Forum after a French court denied his request to travel to Norway, despite his scheduled role as a keynote speaker. The Human Rights Foundation (HRF), which organizes the annual event focused on civil liberties and dissent, confirmed that Durov will deliver his speech remotely. “It is unfortunate that French courts would block Mr. Durov from participating in an event where his voice is so needed,” said HRF founder Thor Halvorssen . France Blocks Durov’s US Trip Amid Legal Dispute Last week, Durov was also barred from traveling to the United States for investment-related meetings after French authorities ruled the trip was not essential. Durov, who was indicted on six charges in September 2024 following his arrest at a French airport, remains under strict legal supervision and cannot leave France without prior approval. Although Durov was previously granted permission to travel to Dubai earlier this year, the Paris prosecutor’s office denied his recent requests, citing a lack of justification. Durov holds multiple citizenships, including France and the UAE, but remains tied to France due to ongoing legal proceedings.

On May 18, he alleged that Nicolas Lerner, head of France’s domestic intelligence agency, personally requested that he suppress conservative political voices on Telegram ahead of Romania’s presidential elections. Durov claims the meeting took place at the Hôtel de Crillon in Paris and that he refused to comply. “You can’t ‘defend democracy’ by destroying democracy,” Durov wrote in a post, adding that Telegram would rather leave entire markets than participate in political censorship. He emphasized that the platform has never blocked protesters in countries like Russia, Belarus, or Iran and will not begin doing so in Europe. While Durov will miss the forum in person, his remote keynote is expected to address the growing pressure tech companies face from governments, especially in election cycles. Telegram Removes $35B Crime Networks Telegram has taken down thousands of channels linked to Chinese-language cybercrime hubs Xinbi Guarantee and Huione Guarantee, following an investigation by blockchain analytics firm Elliptic. These groups have been tied to over $35 billion in illicit USDT transactions, offering services ranging from money laundering and fake IDs to stolen data and cyber extortion. Huione, allegedly linked to Cambodia’s ruling elite, has facilitated $27 billion in criminal activity, while Xinbi has processed $8.4 billion since 2022. These marketplaces used Telegram’s encrypted infrastructure to operate openly, selling tools for fraud and laundering crypto from scams such as “pig butchering” and even hacks like the WazirX breach tied to North Korean actors. The platforms have also been connected to human trafficking compounds in Southeast Asia, where victims are coerced into romance scams and financial fraud. These compounds, disguised as job offers, exploit vulnerable individuals and force them into operating cybercrime schemes under duress. Telegram’s role in enabling this ecosystem has come under scrutiny. While the app was designed for privacy, its structure has increasingly been leveraged by organized crime.

Familiar crypto fractals suggest HYPE could spark similar momentum-driven hype. Hyperliquid's native token, HYPE , is mirroring a strikingly similar price structure to Solana’s ( SOL ) early 2021 breakout—one that preceded a 300% rally. HYPE chart fractal targets 240% rally by July In January 2021, Solana broke out from a prolonged consolidation phase just as marketwide interest began accelerating. The breakout, highlighted by a decisive flip above key Fibonacci retracement levels, triggered a vertical rally that saw SOL jump to the 4.618 Fib retracement line at around $19 from roughly $4.90 in under two months, marking a 291% surge. SOL/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView Fast forward to May 2025, HYPE’s daily chart is showing the same bullish structure following its 270% rebound from $10 lows in April, aligning with its 0.0 Fibonacci retracement line. On May 23, HYPE broke above its 1.0 Fibonacci retracement level (~$35.88), echoing the early stages of SOL’s explosive run in 2021. HYPE/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) for HYPE has entered deeply overbought territory (above 84), which, while suggesting caution in the short term, also underscores the strength of the current momentum, much like Solana’s RSI profile during its 2021 breakout. If HYPE continues to follow this fractal, the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level near $51.68 appears to be the next logical target. Beyond that, the 4.618 level at around $128 could mark the peak of this potential rally, a 240% move from its recent breakout zone near $35. Hyperliquid is like Solana and FTX combined — analyst Popular analyst and commentator Ansem highlights that Hyperliquid’s vision is very similar to what Solana and FTX aimed to build during their early partnership: a high-performance, low-cost crypto trading experience. He argues that, unlike FTX’s centralized architecture, Hyperliquid is fully onchain. Source: X/Ansem Nearly 97% of all trading revenue goes directly back to HYPE tokenholders, Ansem noted, adding that such fundamentals will assist the Hyperliquid token to reach “all-time highs soon.” Psychologically, traders are often drawn to familiar and previously successful patterns.

She said that while there can be no doubt the crypto wallet space is expanding at a breakneck space, crypto ETFs are likely to hang on to their glory because of how easy they make it for users to participate in crypto. Keep reading to find out more about Cathie Wood’s ETF vs. wallet stance, and how it probably doesn’t take into account new-age crypto wallets like Best Wallet that’s simplifying crypto investing. We’ll also tell you how you can make the most of Best Wallet’s rise to mainstream use by investing in Best Wallet Token ($BEST) . Rise of Crypto ETFs Spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in the US in January 2024, and they’ve since then posted around $45B in inflows. According to a Bitwise report , net inflows in Bitcoin ETFs have comfortably surpassed the early success of gold ETFs, which were one of the biggest catalysts behind gold’s historic rise. Moreover, Bitcoin ETFs reached $125B in assets under management (AUM) in less than 12 months, whereas gold ETFs took around 20x more time to reach the same milestone. If Bitwise’s projections hold true, Bitcoin ETFs could record $100B in annual net inflows by as early as 2027. In addition to highlighting the performance of Bitcoin ETFs, Cathie Wood also spared a though for Ether ETFs, which, according to her, have been ‘less successful than people were expecting’ because the SEC didn’t allow staking. All in all, though, Cathie Wood pinned the rising popularity of crypto ETFs on their simplicity. I think ETFs are an important stepping stone because, you know, wallets seem so complicated, so much friction for consumers, they just wanna push a button – Cathie Wood While there’s some merit to the argument that crypto wallets have historically not been as user-friendly as ETFs, modern solutions like Best Wallet are offering some of the simplest self-custody alternatives the world has ever seen. For instance, Best Wallet’s first-ever ‘direct purchase’ functionality makes it super convenient to buy new meme coins on presale . There’s a lot to unpack here, so let’s dig into Best Wallet and see why it could shift the narrative around crypto wallets being mere insurance policies. What Is Best Wallet? Best Wallet is one of the newest Web3 wallets that delivers on every single count, including ease of use, security, and functionality. As a non-custodial and free crypto wallet , Best Wallet gives you full control over your passkey without asking you to spend a dime. Being non-custodial means no one other than you will be able to access your Best Wallet account. Additional security features include a huge assortment of 2FA/MFA options, including biometrics, advanced cryptographic technology, built-in scam protection, and protection against hacks, theft, and other vulnerabilities thanks to complete crypto insurance. What’s more, Best Wallet also deletes inactive data every 24 months, massively limiting the amount of sensitive data that gets leaked into the wild in case of a hack. It’s worth noting, though, that Best Wallet has never been hacked, which is a huge confidence booster. How Best Wallet Is Simplifying Crypto As we laid out in our complete Best Wallet review , it’s one of the most user-friendly and intuitive crypto wallets on the market right now, allowing users to buy, sell, swap, or receive cryptos across multiple blockchain networks. One of Best Wallet’s standout features is that it allows you to directly buy new presale cryptos from within the app. All of the available coins are listed under the ‘Upcoming’ tab. Even better, you’ll also find all relevant presale information in this section. This will help you make an informed decision. Inside the app, you can create multiple Ethereum wallets to organize your crypto. For instance, you can create separate wallets for airdrops and holding the best meme coins . And you’ll be able to easily manage all your wallets through the ‘Manage your wallets’ tab. In addition to convenience, purchasing presale tokens directly from Best Wallet is also a security-friendly option. That’s because the internal Best Wallet team vets every single crypto before publishing it on their app. Ride the Best Wallet’s Growth by Investing in $BEST Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the native cryptocurrency of the Best Wallet ecosystem. As such, it’ll directly benefit from this crypto wallet’s rising popularity. Speaking of Best Wallet’s bright future, it’s on its way to capturing over 40% of the non-custodial crypto wallet market by 2026. What’s more, it already boasts over 500K users. According to our Best Wallet Token price prediction , the token can reach $0.07 by the end of 2030 – an eye-watering 280% gain from current prices. Of course, to make the most of $BEST’s upward trajectory, you’ll need to get in as early as possible. Luckily for you, Best Wallet Token is currently in presale, meaning you can grab it for some of its lowest-ever prices. Each token is available for just $0.025075, and the project has emerged as one of the best crypto presales in 2025, with over $12.6M in early investor funding. Although becoming a $BEST owner is pretty straightforward, check out our detailed guide on how to buy $BEST if you need any assistance.

That means over half of the country’s entire debt market is now held by the central bank. Life insurers only hold 13.4%, banks hold 9.8%, and pension funds carry just 8.9%. In raw numbers, Japan’s total government debt sits at $7.8 trillion, with the BOJ alone holding $4.1 trillion of that. The only governments with bigger debt loads are the United States and China. This level of ownership didn’t just happen overnight. Japan has been relying on its central bank to support the market for years. But now, it’s hitting a wall. The government is boxed in by rising costs, falling demand, and an economy too fragile to carry the weight of this much debt. Every new bond it issues just deepens the hole. BOJ is by far the largest holder of Japanese bonds. Source: Bloomberg Long-term yields jump as market liquidity breaks down Since April, the spread between Japan’s 10-year and 30-year bond yields has grown by about 50 basis points, a sharp move that’s bigger than what’s been seen in the US, the UK, or Germany. The jump is tied to rising global uncertainty, especially with Donald Trump back in the White House. Germany’s new spending program has also pushed up global long-end yields. But Japan’s curve is moving faster and more violently than the rest. Some investors aren’t waiting around to find out where this goes. Takashi Fujiwara, chief fund manager at Resona Asset Management Co., said , “The rise in volatility worsened dealer sentiment and caused liquidity to dry up. Super-long yields have peaked and are likely to stabilize.” That’s one view, but not everyone agrees. Others are still buying. Vanguard and RBC BlueBay Asset Management have both been picking up 30-year Japanese government bonds. Ales Koutny, head of international rates at Vanguard, said, “We think the curve will flatten. Two-year to 10-year maturities will sell off and the long end has found its new clearing level of 2.5% to 3%.” He sees recent trade calm as a reason the BOJ could finally start tightening. But demand is shaky. Shinichiro Kadota, head of FX and rates strategy at Barclays Securities Japan Ltd., pointed out, “Life insurer demand is the key to the eventual stabilization of 30-year bonds, and we haven’t really heard of any intention to buy.” If insurers stay on the sidelines, there may not be anyone left to catch the falling knife. Foreign investors step in but fall short of filling the gap Foreign demand is growing, but it’s still not enough. Overseas investors reportedly added a record amount of Japanese bonds in the first quarter, but they still make up a small part of the market. Tomoaki Shishido, senior yen rates strategist at Nomura Securities Co., said: “It is unlikely that overseas investors and pension funds will become stable buyers of super-long JGBs as a substitute for life insurers, and it will be difficult to completely offset the shortfall in demand.” The government isn’t making things easier. Net supply—that’s new bond sales minus redemptions—is being funneled into the long end. There’s more supply of 30-year debt than anyone wants. The result is higher yields, weaker prices, and growing pressure on the BOJ to either buy more or back off. Omori from Mizuho warned, “For the BOJ, the question is how far and how fast they can let these long-term rates run before it puts too much strain on the rest of the economy.” The central bank is walking a tightrope, trying to balance rising inflation, fiscal needs, and global interest rate pressures, all without letting the financial system unravel. Meanwhile, the government is facing insane debt servicing costs. With Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba preparing for upper house elections expected in July, he has to spend in the short term to win votes. At the same time, defense spending is on the rise, adding long-term pressure to a budget that’s already strained beyond breaking.

This happens as prices near and record all-time highs (ATHs), suggesting investors are more intent on holding than selling. Selling Pressure on a Low On May 22, BTC hit an ATH of $111,861. When the digital asset surged close to and surpassed $100,000 in November 2024, the number of bitcoins flowing into exchanges daily stood at 121,000. This time, however, daily bitcoin inflows to exchanges have plunged to roughly 22,000 BTC. Higher exchange inflows have often signaled increased selling pressure, so low inflow levels among investors signal reduced intent to sell. Also, the number of individual deposits to trading platforms has plummeted from 98,000 in November to just 29,000 currently. This shows that fewer investors are selling despite the rally in prices. ETH is also seeing low inflows to exchanges. The number of coins moving into these trading venues daily has fallen 70% from 3.2 million ETH in November to roughly 1 million ETH now. Individual daily deposits are not exempted, as they have dipped from a recent peak of 135,000 ETH in early April to 15,000 currently. Similarly, XRP exchange inflows have dropped, especially since the coin’s founding company, Ripple, settled its years-long legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Daily XRP deposits have fallen from 4 billion in late March to 46 million. Deposits, on the other hand, have also declined 99.5% from 2.1 million in December to 9,000 today. The decline in BTC, ETH, and XRP deposits shows improving investor sentiment. Exchange USDT Reserves Hit ATH Although ETH and XRP have not hit new ATHs recently, they have recorded notable growth. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that both assets are up 55% and 11% monthly. While the broader crypto market continues to gain positive momentum, the inflows of Tether (USDT) into exchanges have continued to grow. The total USDT reserves on exchanges have now hit an all-time high of $46.9 billion. “The growth in stablecoin balances signals increasing market liquidity, which is typically supportive for digital asset prices,” stated CryptoQuant.

Start With These Cheap Coins in 2025,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/want-long-term-crypto-gains-start-with-these-cheap-coins-in-2025/,"If you’re asking what’s the best crypto to buy now for long-term growth, it’s time to look beyond the usual headlines and focus on undervalued assets with serious upside. Shiba Inu (SHIB), still trading under $0.00002, has transformed from meme status to a full-fledged ecosystem with Shibarium, its own layer-2 blockchain. PEPE, hovering below $0.000015, has captured the imagination of meme coin investors and continues to ride high on community hype and rapid social engagement. These ultra-low-priced tokens are no longer just speculative plays, they’re growing into the best cryptos to invest in for those willing to weather the market’s ups and downs. But for those seeking the next crypto to hit $1, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the breakout contender in 2025 with real DeFi use case potential. Meme Coins with Staying Power: SHIB and PEPE in 2025 Shiba Inu (SHIB), priced around $0.000015, has moved beyond its meme origins to build a robust ecosystem that includes its own blockchain layer, Shibarium, fueling renewed investor interest. Meanwhile, PEPE, trading below $0.000015, continues to gain traction with a passionate community and viral momentum, making it one of the best cheap cryptocurrencies to buy now for long-term potential.

With XRP and Cosmos (ATOM) also on traders’ radars, smart money is positioning ahead of the next altcoin wave. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: Leading Presale, 50% Bonus, and Explosive Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the most dominant presale of 2025, outpacing new launches with unmatched early demand and momentum. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral narrative have made it a magnet for both retail and institutional capital. Analysts are forecasting 25x–35x returns from current entry levels, with some models projecting up to 18,500% upside if momentum holds. A recent $132,000+ whale buy highlights the conviction behind MAGA’s breakout potential. With a $0.007 listing target and a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using PATRIOT50X , MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting the pace for early-stage gains before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. Solana (SOL): Technical Inflection and Ecosystem Strength Solana is trading in a bullish range between $158 and $175, testing resistance near $175 as it recovers from April’s lows. Technicals indicate a possible breakout above $175 could lead to a retest of $183, with further upside toward $212 if momentum persists. The network’s high throughput, low fees, and expanding dApp ecosystem continue to attract users and developers. While Solana’s outlook is optimistic, traders seeking sharper returns are increasingly rotating into early-stage plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Ethereum (ETH): Bullish Momentum and Institutional Rotation Ethereum is consolidating near $2,500–$2,650, with analysts projecting a move toward $2,750–$2,900 if bullish momentum sustains. The network’s technicals are strong, with a recent surge in volume and a breakout above key moving averages. Institutional adoption and Layer 2 growth are fueling long-term optimism, but the most aggressive capital is now flowing into early-stage opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is even more compelling. XRP and Cosmos (ATOM): Steady Performance, MAGA Steals the Spotlight XRP is holding steady around $2.37, with price targets of $2.85–$3.87 for 2025, while ATOM consolidates as ecosystem upgrades progress. Both assets remain in focus, but neither matches the viral momentum or community buzz surrounding MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF Conclusion Solana’s bullish setup and Ethereum’s steady climb are impressive, but the real excitement is building in MAGACOIN FINANCE . With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 18,500% ROI, MAGA stands as the breakout contender for 2025.

Trump took to Truth Social to announce the measures and threatened a 25% levy on imported Apple iPhones. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency plunged to a low of $106,816 before recovering on Saturday and during the ongoing session. Crypto Bulls Lose $500M As Bitcoin (BTC) Plunges Below $110,000 Bullish crypto bets saw investors lose over $500 million after Bitcoin (BTC) tumbled below $110,000 following President Trump’s fresh tariff threats on European imports and overseas Apple products, triggering a wave of liquidations. Bitcoin, which traded above $111,000, quickly slid to around $108,000 following the threats, wiping out gains and disrupting investor sentiment. The broader crypto market mirrored BTC’s decline, with futures tracking Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Dogecoin (DOGE) showing losses from $30 million to $100 million. Meanwhile, Bitcoin futures registered losses of around $181 million, while ETH futures registered losses of around $142 million, with altcoins adding another $100 million in liquidations. Large-scale liquidations generally indicate panic selling and a cascade of liquidations could suggest a market turning point and an imminent price reversal. Bitcoin (BTC) Analyst Makes Bold Prediction An analyst has predicted Bitcoin could surge to an astonishing $325,000 peak. The analyst also provided an accelerated timeline for the flagship cryptocurrency to accomplish this feat. The analyst based their prediction on a technical analysis chart spanning BTC’s movements from 2009 to 2025, applying the Elliot Wave Theory on a High Time Frame and tracking a five-wave impulsive structure, with each wave representing a major bullish cycle. The analyst stated that Bitcoin is currently in Wave 5, the last wave of this cycle, suggesting the market is on the verge of a final parabolic price increase. According to the analysis, Bitcoin’s past bull markets have ended with a near-vertical explosive surge, where the price accelerates before entering a corrective phase. The $325,000 price forecast comes with an exceptional near-term timeline. The analyst predicts that Bitcoin could reach this target as early as July 2025, a little over a month away. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to recover after Friday’s sudden decline, triggered by President Trump threatening to impose 50% tariffs on all goods imported from the European Union. The drop saw BTC plunge to an intraday low of $106,816, leading to the liquidation of $594 million in crypto derivatives. As a result, crypto bulls lost $507 million, while shorts accounted for the remaining $87 million. The pullback occurred despite BTC registering increased institutional interest and increased ETF inflows. Funding rates also signal caution as traders wait on the sidelines. Glassnode data revealed that despite BTC trading above $108,000, funding rates have been relatively muted at 0.0079%. While short-term sentiment indicates caution, on-chain data reveals support emerging at lower levels. According to Glassnode, over 420,000 BTC has a cost basis around the $94,000 level, forming one of the strongest support zones in the cycle. This massive accumulation suggests strong buying interest at this price level. “More than 420K $BTC now have a cost basis around the $94K level, forming one of the strongest support zones in the current cycle. This dense cluster of accumulation has held firm through consolidation in early May - providing the launchpad for #Bitcoin’s breakout to new highs.” BTC started the previous week in the red, dropping 1.04% on Monday before rebounding on Tuesday and settling at $104,123. The price was back in the red on Wednesday, falling 0.53% and settling at $103,568. BTC fell to an intraday low of $101,459 on Thursday but recovered to register a marginal increase and settle at $103,816. Price action was bearish on Friday and Saturday as the price declined marginally to $103,235. However, BTC recovered on Sunday to register an increase of over 3%, cross $106,000 and settle at $106,489. Source: TradingView BTC plunged to an intraday low of $102,135 on Monday as the week got off to a bearish start. The price recovered from this level to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,572. Sentiment changed on Tuesday as the price registered an increase of 1.21% and settled at $106,854. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday, with the price rising 2.57% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,603. BTC surged to a new all-time high on Thursday, rising to $111,917 before settling at $111,582. However, markets turned bearish after President Trump threatened to impose 50% tariffs on goods from the EU. As a result, BTC plunged nearly 4% to $107,356. The price recovered on Saturday, registering a marginal increase and settling at $107,855, but not before reaching an intraday high of $109,567. The current session sees BTC marginally up as it looks to build momentum and reclaim $110,000. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

After weeks of steady momentum and bullish consolidation, the breakout marks a major shift in market structure, confirming that bulls are now in full control. The move has reignited optimism across the market, with sentiment turning decisively positive as BTC enters price discovery once again. Related Reading: Tron Bulls Regain Control – On-Chain Data Shows Fresh Buying Pressure The breakout wasn’t just technical—it was backed by strong positioning across derivatives markets. According to data from Coinglass, Bitcoin’s weekly liquidation heatmap reveals a dense cluster of liquidity around the $105,700 level. This area could act as a magnet in the short term, with some traders expecting a brief sweep into that zone before BTC resumes its upward trajectory. This environment now favors bulls, with both technical levels and on-chain data aligning to support further upside. As long as Bitcoin continues to close above $100K and dips remain shallow, the path of least resistance appears to be higher. With liquidity, momentum, and macro sentiment aligning, the coming weeks could be critical as BTC sets the tone for the rest of the market—and potentially the start of a full-blown bullish phase. Bitcoin Remains Strong Amid Tight Conditions Bitcoin posted another bullish week, reaching a new all-time high of $112,000 before pulling back slightly to hold above the key $100,000 level. Despite the strength, market sentiment has yet to flip fully euphoric. A cautiously bullish tone dominates as macroeconomic conditions remain tight, with high US Treasury yields and growing instability in global trade continuing to weigh on risk assets. Unlike many altcoins, which are still trading well below their previous cycle highs, Bitcoin appears to be thriving in this high-stress environment. Its resilience is being closely watched, as capital continues to favor BTC over smaller, more volatile assets. This relative strength reinforces Bitcoin’s status as a macro hedge, especially in uncertain economic conditions. Top analyst Ted Pillows added to the discussion by highlighting data from Coinglass, which shows significant liquidity sitting around the $105,700 level on the BTC weekly liquidation heatmap. According to Pillows, this cluster could serve as a short-term magnet, suggesting that a quick sweep of that zone may occur before Bitcoin resumes its upward move. “Liquidity at $105K is thick. A dip into that area could clear out late longs before the next leg higher,” he noted. With Bitcoin holding key levels and sentiment remaining grounded, the setup is favorable for continuation, but not without potential volatility. If BTC can defend the $100K–$105K range and reclaim $110K, the next push toward new highs may arrive sooner than expected. For now, bulls remain in control, but traders are staying alert as global markets remain on edge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pulls Back To Daily EMA 8 – Can Bulls Hold Momentum? BTC Holds Above Key Averages Bitcoin is trading at $108,249 on the 4-hour chart after a strong push to $112,000 earlier in the week. The chart shows BTC currently consolidating above a confluence of key moving averages, including the 34 EMA ($108,046), 50 SMA ($106,840), and 100 SMA ($105,109), all of which are trending upward. These levels now serve as dynamic support zones, keeping the short-term structure bullish as long as price remains above them. Despite the rejection near $112K, BTC has avoided any aggressive selloff and continues to respect the mid-range levels of its recent breakout. The $103,600 level, marked in yellow, is a key horizontal support and previously acted as a resistance ceiling. It now provides a strong base if any deeper correction occurs. Volume has declined during this pullback phase, indicating that the selling pressure is likely corrective rather than the start of a trend reversal. If bulls can maintain control above $106K and reclaim momentum above $110K, a retest of the recent highs is likely. Related Reading: Ethereum Climbs Back To $2,700 – Bulls Ready For A Breakout?

In a new interview on the Less Noise More Signal YouTube channel, Gromen says if the US brings in capital controls as a way to sustain its trade war, the dollar’s world reserve status could be severely weakened, pushing capital into gold and Bitcoin. Capital controls refer to the measures taken by a government to regulate the flow of money in and out of the country’s financial system to prevent capital flight amid economic uncertainty. Gromen, founder of the investment firm Forest For The Trees (FFTT), says gold and BTC will stay bullish until the dollar gets weak enough to finally attract foreign direct investment. “The dollar’s reserve status will basically be relegated to gold at one point. Gold will be reserved, dollars will not be, because Europeans can’t have it, the Chinese don’t want it. It’s not like people are going to switch to European bonds or Chinese bonds or British bonds or Japanese bonds, there’s no one else there that can do it. So it’s going to go to gold, gold is going to go to the moon, which is probably actually in US interests in a number of different ways at this point. But until the dollar gets weak enough to really bring back foreign direct investment here, there’s a period of time, politically, where the people are going to be very unhappy because they’re going to come in every day, and stocks will be down until the dollar is weak enough… It’s very possible that, really, the Fed is forced to cut, the Treasury market breaks in five days, stocks go down for five days, and quite honestly, as I talk through it, that’s probably what’ll happen. We put those capital controls in, gold goes to the moon, Bitcoin goes to the moon, stocks tank, bonds tank, dollar tanks, five days later, bond market breaks, Fed comes in or Treasury comes in, and stocks go to the moon, gold and Bitcoin go to the moon even more. Then it can work, and I think that’s actually probably where we’re headed.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The idea is being discussed at the highest levels of government in both countries, and it’s already been brought up directly with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Talks are still in early stages, but both sides have raised the proposal repeatedly in recent weeks as part of wider trade negotiations. The US Treasury and Japan’s Ministry of Finance would act as co-owners of the fund, each holding a large stake. It would also allow for additional limited partners to invest and might even give ordinary citizens from both countries the chance to buy in. One official familiar with the conversation allegedly said the fund would need to be “enormous,” estimating an initial capital pool of $300 billion, and that it would likely be heavily leveraged to increase its reach. The fund would directly invest in profitable projects, delivering returns to the governments rather than relying on indirect benefits like tax revenue from private builders. Bessent looks for new revenue sources, Ishiba eyes G7 milestone Scott Bessent is reportedly pushing for new streams of government revenue that don’t involve raising taxes. “The theory is that Bessent is looking for revenue streams for the Treasury that do not involve raising taxes, and however far out this joint fund may sound, it would in theory provide that,” one person briefed on the talks said. The goal is to design a new kind of sovereign financial partnership, where Japan would be protected from political volatility in the US while still profiting from shared ventures. Shigeru Ishiba, who leads Japan’s government, has shown strong interest in this structure. On Friday, he spoke with Donald Trump for 45 minutes by phone to talk about security, tariffs, and diplomacy. Afterward, Ishiba told reporters he expects their upcoming face-to-face meeting at the G7 summit in Canada this June to be a major moment for both the investment fund talks and the stalled tariff negotiations. Japan has made clear it wants zero tariffs, while Trump’s team has drawn a line at a 10% minimum rate. Ishiba, speaking Sunday in Kyoto, said there had been “progress” on a range of issues including non-tariff measures and economic security. Japan’s top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, had been in Washington that same Friday for the third round of official tariff talks with US officials. Trump and Son connect through Stargate, shipbuilding also on the table Masayoshi Son has been actively involved in shaping the proposal. He’s been a frequent visitor to Mar-a-Lago, where he’s met directly with Trump. The SoftBank founder was also one of the key figures standing beside Trump in January, during the announcement of the $500 billion Stargate project . The plan includes building AI infrastructure and data centers across the US, with Oracle and OpenAI named as major players. That project, according to people who’ve spoken with Son, is exactly the kind of initiative this US-Japan wealth fund could back. If the fund becomes reality, it would replace the old playbook where governments gave tax incentives to attract factory builds or private construction. Instead, this one would cut the middleman and give direct investment returns based on the share owned by each government. Bessent wants it to be the model for future deals with allies, while Japan wants protections baked in to avoid dealing with random White House policy swings. Shigeru Ishiba also brought up military shipbuilding cooperation during his Sunday briefing. He said Trump’s administration had shown interest in letting US warships be repaired in Japan, and Tokyo is open to it. He mentioned icebreaker technology, a Japanese specialty, as a potential link — especially for Arctic trade routes, which are becoming more important. “We will continue to further refine our discussions with the G7 summit in mind,” Ishiba said.

That surge was led by BlackRock’s IBIT, which ran a 30-day streak with no outflows, according to MilkRoad, using data tracked by Bloomberg. As of press time, IBIT has brought in $9 billion in net inflows for 2025, putting it among the top five ETFs in the US for the year. That’s a huge jump considering it was ranked #47 just a month earlier. On May 7, it had already reached $6.96 billion, making it the sixth-largest ETF at the time. It bypassed SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), which had $6.5 billion and sat at #7. By mid-May, BlackRock’s product climbed higher, while GLD slipped to #14. Bitcoin price surge drives institutional interest in ETFs BlackRock’s rise in ETF flows came right as Bitcoin hit $112,000, drawing in more institutional cash. Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg, posted on Friday that, “All the BTC ETFs are elevated, most are gonna see 2x their daily average flows incoming.” Bitwise, which runs crypto index funds, expects even more activity ahead. In their recent report Forecasting Institutional Flows to Bitcoin in 2025/2026 , they project $120 billion in inflows this year and $300 billion more in 2026. They pointed out that $36.2 billion already flowed into spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024, outpacing how fast the gold ETF GLD gained traction when it first launched. Bitwise reported that Bitcoin ETFs hit $125 billion in assets under management within 12 months, which was 20 times faster than GLD. If things keep moving at this pace, Bitwise believes Bitcoin could attract $100 billion a year by 2027, easily pushing it far beyond gold as the go-to asset for institutions. Despite all that activity, around $35 billion in Bitcoin demand stayed on the sidelines in 2024. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, who manage a combined $60 trillion in client assets, held back because of internal compliance rules. Those companies want to see more performance history from the ETFs before diving in, but the growing adoption of BTC funds is expected to change that. Bitwise strategists Juan Leon, Guillaume Girard, and Will Owens modeled three scenarios. The bear case estimates inflows of over $150 billion, assuming governments shift 1% of their gold holdings to Bitcoin, US states build 10% BTC reserves, wealth platforms allocate 0.1%, and public companies move in with around $58.9 billion. Bitwise says the base case brings that total to $600 billion, assuming 5% gold-to-BTC reallocation by countries, 30% state-level adoption, 0.5% wealth platform allocation, and a doubling of public company holdings to $117.8 billion. This, with Bitwise’s forecasts of $120 billion this year and $300 billion next year, with nearly 20.32% of Bitcoin’s supply being absorbed. Governments moving 10% of their gold reserves to Bitcoin could unleash $323.4 billion, while US state adoption grows to 70% for another $45.8 billion. Wealth platforms could jump to a 1% allocation, or $600 billion, and public companies could ramp up to $235.6 billion. In total, $426.9 billion could pour into Bitcoin ETFs , representing 4,269,000 BTC, if that scenario plays out.

Why? Because it’s a Ponzi scheme whereby BlackRock will pump more and more dollars into a supply-constrained product,” Rennick said in his post. He added, “What exactly will this product produce? Absolutely nothing,” arguing that Bitcoin has no tangible output and suggesting Australia needs “real engineers, not financial engineers.” His remarks quickly drew sharp criticism from the global BTC community. The Australian Bitcoin Industry Body (ABIB) issued a formal response, stating Rennick’s opinions reflected a “deep misunderstanding” of Bitcoin’s fundamentals. “This matters, because misunderstanding leads to misrepresentation. And misrepresentation leads to bad policy,” the ABIB emphasized. Bitcoin Advocates Defend the Asset Bitcoin supporters were quick to defend the cryptocurrency and counter Rennick’s claims. Laura Shin, host of the Unchained podcast, sarcastically noted , “You also can’t eat the internet, so do you oppose that too?” Others, like Bitcoin Marathon team lead Jimmy Kostro, suggested Rennick’s take would not age well, asking him to elaborate on his views with more depth. Despite the pushback, Rennick doubled down, brushing off the criticism. “It’s pathetic how the BTC community needs reassurance from a politician — the very people they claim they want to be free from,” he responded. He also insisted he didn’t need to “explain anything.” The clash reflects a growing pattern of tension between traditional policymakers and digital asset advocates. Bitcoiners frequently call out public figures who oppose or misunderstand the technology. Not the First Clash Just weeks before Rennick’s remarks, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs faced backlash from the crypto community for vetoing a bill that would have allowed the state to include Bitcoin in its official reserves . Jameson Lopp, co-founder of Casa and noted cypherpunk, said her decision would “age poorly.” Likewise, the U.S. government faced heavy criticism from the BTC community in December 2024 for transferring $1.9 billion worth of Bitcoin to Coinbase, a move many saw as a missed opportunity for sovereign crypto adoption. For many the community, such government moves and statements only reinforce their belief in the need for decentralized financial systems.

Speaking during a surprise AMA Saturday, Hoskinson laid out a series of bold initiatives that he believes could reshape the Cardano ecosystem and the broader crypto and technology landscape. One of the standout revelations was his plan to develop a virtual city powered by AI agents that simulate real-world human behavior in a crypto economy. According to the pundit, this digital metropolis, inspired by the Altera project, will be used to test economic policies, regulatory interactions, DeFi integrations, and the scalability of blockchain-based systems in a live yet controlled environment. He described it as a place to beta-test stablecoins, model interactions between regulators and malicious actors, and move beyond the traditional TPS metric toward a more nuanced measure he called “concurrent cities.” “It would be a really cool exercise to run a virtual city. You can stop thinking of TPS and you can start thinking your your DeFi ecosystem as cities run concurrently.” He stated . “ Many cities can run concurrently comfortably in this meaning that there’s no disruption to the commerce inside the system.” Hoskinson also gave an update on Midnight, Cardano’s upcoming privacy-centric blockchain. Notably, with a focus on sectors like healthcare, Midnight will feature private stablecoins and trustless bridges to Cardano, allowing seamless and secure asset transfers. He emphasized that the native token for Midnight will launch with what he claims is the fairest and decentralized distribution model in crypto history. “It’s the most decentralized launch in the history of the cryptocurrency space. I am very proud of it. It’s a new distribution model. I think you guys are all going to like it.” He stated. Looking toward Bitcoin integration, Hoskinson teased an infrastructure project called BitVMX, timed ahead of the Bitcoin 2025 conference. He said the initiative will connect Bitcoin’s liquidity to Cardano ’s ecosystem using Hydra-powered fast finality and lending protocols that offer native Bitcoin yield. He also suggested a future where Bitcoin Ordinals are integrated with Cardano’s NFT infrastructure, enhancing both networks. Moreover, Hoskinson expressed frustration with the current decentralized structure’s inability to make timely decisions on governance. He called for a hybrid model, introducing an executive function complementing the community’s voice. He also preemptively addressed the forthcoming audit on Cardano’s early token distribution, dismissing online allegations of misconduct as politically motivated gaslighting.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano|Charles Hoskinson,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-25 12:24:52

In a new Bloomberg survey involving 20 market strategists, both JPMorgan and Citi predict that the Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP) will outperform the S&P 500 for the remainder of 2025, driven by an improving economic outlook in the EU. Among the polled analysts, JPMorgan has the highest target for SXXP, predicting that the Stoxx Europe 600 Index will soar to a high of 580 points in the coming months. At the same time, the bank forecasts a decline for the S&P 500. Meanwhile, Citi expects SXXP to surge to 570 points this year as the market gets more clarity on corporate earnings. Says Citigroup strategist Beata Manthey, “If we have already moved past peak earnings uncertainty, this could set the stage for additional upside and potential multiple re-rating, especially among more beaten-up cyclical sectors.” The SXXP is a stock market index that tracks the performance of the 600 largest publicly traded firms across 17 European nations. As of Friday’s close, the Stoxx Europe 600 Index is trading at 545 points, up about 7.60% year-to-date. The banks’ outlook comes as Big Four accounting firm Ernst & Young (EY) warns that the S&P 500 is rallying without pricing in the potential negative impacts of tariffs, reports Yahoo! Finance. In an investor note, EY chief economist Gregory Daco says that tariffs will likely pressure household demand by driving prices up. He also expects the US economy to lose momentum and approach “stall speed” in the fourth quarter of 2025, forecasting a year-over-year GDP growth of just 0.6%. “Equity markets have reacted with unwarranted optimism, overlooking the persistent economic drag posed by elevated tariffs.” As of Friday’s close, the S&P 500 is trading at 5,802 points.

Promising to verify human uniqueness through iris scans and distribute its WLD token globally, World positions itself as a tool for financial inclusion . However, critics argue the project’s biometric methods are invasive, overly centralized, and at odds with the ethos of decentralization and digital privacy. At the heart of the critique is the claim that biometric identity systems cannot be truly decentralized when they rely on proprietary hardware, closed authentication methods, and centralized control over data pipelines. “Decentralization isn’t just a technical architecture,” Shady El Damaty, co-founder of Holonym Foundation, told Cointelegraph. “It’s a philosophy that prioritizes user control, privacy, and self-sovereignty. World’s biometric model is inherently at odds with this ethos.” El Damaty argued that despite using tools like multiparty computation (MPC) and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs , World’s reliance on custom hardware — the Orb — and centralized code deployment undermines the decentralization it claims to champion. “This is by design to achieve their goals of uniquely identifying individual humans. This concentration of power risks creating a single point of failure and control, undermining the very promise of decentralization,” he said. When reached out for comment, a spokesperson for World pushed back against these claims. “World does not use centralized biometric infrastructure,” they said, adding that the World App is non-custodial, meaning users remain in control of their digital assets and World IDs. The project said once the Orb generates an iris code, the “iris photo will be sent as an end-to-end encrypted data bundle to your phone and will be immediately deleted from the Orb.” The iris code, they claimed, is processed with anonymizing multiparty computation so “no personal data is stored.” World’s disclosure regarding personal custody. Source: World Evin McMullen, co–founder of Privado ID and Billions.Network, said that World’s biometric model is not “inherently incompatible” with decentralization but faces some challenges in implementation around data centralization, trust assumptions, and governance. Related: Sam Altman’s World raises $135M from Andreessen, Bain, to expand network A pattern of tech overreach? El Damaty also drew a parallel between OpenAI’s large-scale scraping of “unconsented user data” and World’s collection of biometric information. He argued that both reflect a pattern of aggressive data acquisition framed as innovation, warning that such practices risk eroding privacy and normalizing surveillance under the banner of progress. “The irony here is hard to miss,” El Damaty claimed. “OpenAI built its foundation by scraping vast amounts of unconsented user data to train its models, and now Worldcoin is taking that same aggressive data acquisition approach into the realm of biometric identity.” In 2023, a class-action lawsuit filed in California accused OpenAI and Microsoft of scraping 300 billion words from the internet without consent, including personal data from millions of users, such as children. In 2024, a coalition of Canadian media outlets, including The Canadian Press and CBC, sued OpenAI for allegedly using their content without authorization to train ChatGPT, claiming copyright infringement. ChatGPT storing personal information against its claims. Source: Sandi Fatic World, however, rejects this comparison, emphasizing that it is a separate entity from OpenAI. The company said that it neither sells nor stores personal data, citing its use of privacy-preserving technologies such as multiparty computation and zero-knowledge proofs. The scrutiny also extends to World’s user onboarding. The project says it ensures informed consent through translated guides, an in-app Learn module, brochures, and a Help Center. However, critics remain skeptical. “People in developing nations, who World… has mainly been targeting up until this point, are easier to bribe and often don’t understand the risks involved with ‘selling’ this personal data,” El Damaty warned. Several global regulators have pushed back on World’s operations since its launch in July 2023 , with governments like Germany , Kenya and Brazil expressing concerns over potential risks to the security of users’ biometric data. In the most recent setback, the company faced challenges in Indonesia after local regulators temporarily suspended its registration certificates on May 5. Related: ‘Humans can tell when it’s a human’ — Community mocks Worldcoin’s Orb Mini The risk of digital exclusion As biometric systems like World’s gain traction, questions are emerging about its long-term implications. While the company promotes its model as inclusive, critics say the reliance on iris scans to unlock services could deepen global inequality. “When biometric data becomes a prerequisite for accessing basic services, it effectively creates a two-tiered society,” said El Damaty. “Those willing (or coerced) into giving up their most sensitive information gain access… while those who refuse… are excluded.” World maintained that its protocol does not require biometric enrollment for basic participation. “You can still use an unverified World ID for some purposes even if you do not visit an Orb,” it said, adding that the system uses ZKPs to prevent linking actions back to any specific ID or biometric data. There are also concerns that World could become a surveillance tool — especially in authoritarian regimes — by centralizing biometric data in a way that may attract misuse by powerful actors. World dismisses these claims, asserting that its ID protocol is “open source, permissionless,” and designed so even government applications cannot tie back a user’s activity to their biometric data. The debate also extends to governance. While World says its protocol is moving toward greater decentralization — highlighting open-source contributions and the governance section of its white paper — critics argues that meaningful user ownership is still lacking. “We need to build systems that allow individuals to prove their humanity without creating centralized repositories of biometric or personal data,” said El Damaty. “This means embracing zero-knowledge proofs, decentralized governance, and open standards that empower individuals, not corporations.” Related: Sam Altman’s eye-scanning crypto project World launches in US The need for secure identity systems The urgency behind developing secure identity systems isn’t without merit. As artificial intelligence grows more sophisticated, the lines between human and non-human actors online are blurring. “Risks at the nexus of AI and identity are not limited to any one kind of government system or region,” Privado ID’s McMullen said. She claimed that without reliable verification for both humans and AI agents, digital ecosystems face growing threats—from misinformation and fraud to national security vulnerabilities. “This is a national security nightmare, where unaccountable, unverifiable non-human actors may now be able to engage with global systems and networks, and legacy systems are not built for these types of verification and contextual logic,” McMullen added.

Although he didn’t provide much detail on what a potential partnership could look like among the three parties (Ripple, Hedera, and Bank Social), he called the meeting with the Ripple team “the greatest in the history of international settlements.” In a subsequent reply , Wingate explained that HBAR will be used for backend ops (state checks – app nets (HCS)), while XRP will employ its role for international money movement into certain jurisdictions. BSL will be used for loans, lending, staking, and social governance around the DAO. The zeros Wingate put in his original post raised some speculations among XRP investors whether he was referring to a potential price target for the asset. However, he quickly refuted this, saying he never gives price predictions. Instead, he said he was referring to the on-chain transaction volume relative to the usage today.

The announcement comes as financial authorities in Astana prepare to adopt comprehensive rules that will legalize and govern cryptocurrency investments and trading. Kazakhstan loses billions of U.S. dollars’ worth of digital currency Crypto assets for around $15 billion have been withdrawn from Kazakhstan , according to an estimate produced by the Central Asian nation’s monetary authority. The central bank’s Deputy Chairman Berik Sholpankulov unveiled the staggering total to local media this week, attributing the “leak,” in his words, mainly to the lack of proper regulations. Quoted by the Kazinform news agency, the official elaborated: “It’s a fact that administrative and legal regulation is not sufficiently structured so that citizens could invest safely.” At a press conference, Sholpankulov noted that financial regulators are now developing a more comprehensive approach that will tighten control over the circulation of digital assets and introduce criminal and administrative liability for illegal transfer of crypto funds abroad. In the future, the authorities in Astana will be able to track cryptocurrency transactions, he added, admitting it’s not currently possible to trace the $15 billion exported from the country so far. Kazakhstan now seeks to tap into a specialized system that will provide the technological means to do that. Sholpankulov also vowed to hold another briefing to share details about where the digital money was sent to and identify those who did it “name by name,” making it clear they will be subject to administrative and criminal prosecution. Kazakhstan moves to legalize crypto exchange and investment Cryptocurrency turnover has been growing in Kazakhstan since the country attracted a significant number of mining companies in the wake of the ban imposed on the industry by the Chinese government a few years ago. With a few available options to sell their coins in the country, miners have been transferring profits outside Kazakhstan, despite a requirement to exchange 75% of the minted crypto through trading platforms registered at the state-controlled Astana International Financial Center ( AIFC ). Existing regulations are significantly limiting opportunities for legal crypto trading and investing. According to government estimates, more than 91% of the $4.1 billion worth crypto transactions in 2023 were conducted in the gray market. However, the government seems to have finally realized it’s been losing money in the current circumstances, as it recently announced plans to legalize crypto trading beyond the jurisdiction of the financial hub in the capital city. Earlier this week, the National Bank of Kazakhstan ( NBK ) said it has developed legislative amendments aimed at achieving comprehensive regulation of the digital assets market. These envisage the licensing of cryptocurrency exchanges operating outside the AIFC. In the past three years, Kazakhstan has collected some $35 million in taxes from the crypto mining sector alone, the country’s Deputy Minister for Digital Development Kanysh Tuleushin highlighted. He emphasized that lifting the restrictions on trading would significantly increase budget revenues. In an op-ed piece published by the Kazakhstanskaya Pravda daily, Tuleushin called for adopting “flexible rules” for the crypto space and estimated: “Just a 10% tax could generate more than 190 billion tenge per year ($373 million), enough to build dozens of new schools and hospitals.” Former Soviet republics across Central Asia have been particularly active in the past months in efforts to tap into the growing crypto market.

Leading influencers and analysts predict a substantial price surge, comparing the digital asset to Bitcoin in its early days. Time Traveller, a prominent XRP advocate with over 10,000 followers on Twitter, recently shared a compelling message highlighting XRP’s potential upside. “Some of you think that your small bag of XRP will be nothing major in the future, but allow me to explain something to you,” he tweeted . Using Bitcoin’s historic price trajectory as a benchmark, the pundit pointed out that Bitcoin’s lowest recorded closing price was just $0.05 on July 18, 2010. Fast forward to today, and Bitcoin is trading at approximately $107,382 at press time, a staggering increase that highlights its meteoric rise. To put this into perspective, a mere $0.01 investment back then would have bought 0.2 BTC. At today’s price, that small investment would now be worth roughly $21,476. He concluded that XRP trading under $100, especially below $5, is akin to buying Bitcoin at its infancy, signaling significant future gains. Echoing this bullish sentiment, The Bearable Bull, a self-proclaimed millionaire mentor and crypto influencer, predicted on Friday that XRP’s price could reach $8, marking the “end of the generational wealth journey.” After years of anonymity, The Bearable Bull recently amplified this message, signaling a confident new chapter for XRP investors. Adding to the chorus of optimism is analyst Egrag ccrypto, who has made bold forecasts based on technical analysis and historical patterns. Egrag predicted XRP could surge by as much as 2,700%, reaching $45, or experience a more moderate rise of 1,050% to $19. He bases these predictions on XRP’s previous bull cycles in 2017 and 2021, where the asset saw gains of 2,772% and 1,052%, respectively. “Men lie, women lie, but charts don’t!” Egrag tweeted, emphasizing the power of historical trends in predicting future movements. He noted that key technical indicators like the 21 EMA and 33 MA have historically preceded XRP’s significant breakouts after periods of consolidation lasting around 770 days. According to Egrag, XRP’s current rally, which began in late 2024 and saw its price increase nearly sixfold, could be the start of another major bull phase. Despite the optimism, cautionary voices remain. Market analyst Koroush AK recently advised traders to consider shorting XRP, warning of bearish momentum and a possible price drop to $1.30. Similarly, analyst Cole Garner and trader Crashius Clay have expressed bearish views, with Clay disclosing a $1 million short position on XRP due to concerns about overvaluation and weakening demand.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-25 12:36:42

Pakistan allocates 2,000MW power for Bitcoin mining and AI centers Pakistan has allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity exclusively for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence centers. The move is part of a broader digital transformation plan spearheaded by the Pakistan Crypto Council and backed by the Ministry of Finance, according to a May 25 report by local news outlet 24NewsHD TV Channel. In the first phase, the government plans to channel excess power into AI infrastructure and crypto mining operations. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the decision is expected to attract billions in foreign investment while generating high-tech employment across the country. The initiative’s second phase will introduce access to renewable energy for mining operations, aiming to balance growth with environmental responsibility. Crypto ETFs won’t lose ‘their luster’ as wallet adoption grows — Cathie Wood ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood says crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will likely maintain their place in the economy no matter how big crypto wallet adoption becomes over the next decade. “I think ETFs are an important stepping stone because, you know, wallets seem so complicated, so much friction for consumers, they just wanna push a button,” Wood said at the Solana Accelerate event in New York on May 23. “So ETFs for those who want the convenience, I don’t think, will lose a lot of their luster,” she said. “But they will be a stepping stone into wallet-based.” Bitbo data suggests that there are around 200 million active Bitcoin wallets worldwide. Meanwhile, the trading week ending May 23 saw approximately $2.75 billion inflows into US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs , coinciding with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22.

In a wave of optimism not seen in months, Bitcoin recently surged past the $111K mark—powered by institutional support and the spotlight of U.S. political endorsement ahead of the anticipated crypto-focused dinner with Donald Trump. This renewed energy is stirring bullish sentiment across the market, sparking interest not only in top-tier coins but also in developing blockchain projects that promise real-world impact. Among those capturing attention right now is Qubetics ($TICS), a blockchain framework that’s pushing the limits of interoperability while reshaping developer access through its suite of integrated tools. Qubetics isn’t just part of the current conversation—it’s shaping it. This platform introduces simplified tools for blockchain development that solve some of the sector’s most persistent challenges.

Qubetics Presale: Why It’s One of the Best Cryptos to Invest in Today The ongoing Qubetics presale presents a compelling opportunity for community members and early adopters seeking structured, high-potential crypto exposure. Currently in Stage 35, the $TICS token is priced at $0.2785. With over $17.3 million already raised, more than 513 million $TICS tokens sold, and a growing base of over 26,900 token holders, the Qubetics presale reflects robust interest and community momentum. Each presale stage lasts a fixed seven days and concludes with a guaranteed 10% price increase, resetting every Sunday at 12 a.m. This built-in pricing mechanism not only rewards early participation but also brings a level of transparency and financial clarity rare in emerging crypto offerings—further validating Qubetics as one of the best cryptos to invest in today . For instance, an investment of $2,000 at the current price could yield significant returns: If $TICS reaches $1 post-presale, the ROI would be approximately 258.95%. At $5, the ROI increases to around 1,694.74%. A $10 valuation post-mainnet launch in Q2 2025 could result in an ROI of about 3,489.47%. These projections highlight the potential benefits of participating in the Qubetics presale, reinforcing its status as the best crypto presale currently available. Cosmos (ATOM): Advancing Interoperability in the Blockchain Space Cosmos continues to make strides in enhancing blockchain interoperability. Recent developments indicate a focus on expanding its ecosystem and facilitating seamless communication between different blockchain networks. These efforts are crucial in addressing the fragmentation within the blockchain space, aiming to create a more cohesive and efficient environment for decentralized applications and services.

45080238,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=734467,1748177729,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45080238.jpeg,Germany urges calm negotiations in worsening EU-US trade relations,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/germany-urges-calm-eu-us-trade/,"Germany’s finance minister, Lars Klingbeil, on Sunday called for calm talks to stop a fast-growing trade fight between the European Union and the United States after President Donald Trump warned he would place a 50% tariff on every EU import from June 1. “We don’t need any more provocations now, but serious negotiations,” Klingbeil told the German newspaper . He said he had already spoken “precisely” about the issue with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. “The US tariffs are endangering the American economy at least as much as the German and European economies,” he said. “This trade conflict harms everyone and must be ended quickly.” Still, he added, Europe is “united and determined to defend our interests.” Klingbeil’s warning matched the mood in Brussels after Trump’s online threat late Friday to raise duties. In his post, the president said the 27-nation bloc was dragging its feet and treating American companies unfairly, calling the EU “difficult to deal with” in “discussions that are going nowhere!” The threat rattled markets. On Friday, the S&P 500 Index and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index each fell about 1%. The dollar slipped toward its weakest point since 2023, while US Treasury yields dropped as investors looked for safety. Behind the public exchange sits an EU paper that was sent to the White House earlier last week. People familiar with the document say Brussels offered to cut or scrap tariffs on industrial goods, give more room for American farm exports judged non-sensitive, and work together on building AI data centers. The 11-page offer also suggested joint efforts in shipbuilding, port infrastructure, and an energy partnership covering gas, nuclear power, and oil. Although the text avoids naming China, it refers to “non-market practices.” It also mentions possible joint purchases of key goods such as AI chips and cooperation on 5G and other connectivity tools. Tensions between the US and the EU are on the rise Trump rejected the proposed plan, writing in his social-media post that the talks were “going nowhere” and repeated his pledge to impose the 50% blanket duty on June 1. Speaking later, Bessent said the EU proposal was “worse than other countries’” but added that he hoped the president’s warning “would light a fire under the EU.” The two chief negotiators, EU trade head Maros Sefcovic and his US counterpart, Jamieson Greer, were still due to speak by phone on Friday, officials confirmed, yet no breakthrough was announced after the call. EU officials say their offer replies to what one described earlier as a US “wish list of unrealistic and unilateral demands.” Brussels wants Washington to promise not to add new tariffs while talks continue. It is willing to lower duties in stages or through a quota system that would keep higher levies in place only once imports pass a set volume. The EU also proposes mutual-recognition deals in areas such as services and non-sensitive farm goods. Under such deals, each side would accept the other’s standards without changing its own rules. At the same time, Europe has prepared a safety net. The bloc has readied tariffs on €21 billion (about $23.9 billion) of US goods in response to earlier American metal duties, though their start has been paused until mid-July. Officials say that date could be brought forward if the talks break down. Should the dispute worsen, an extra list of tariffs on €95 billion worth of goods is waiting in reserve. Those tariffs would target industrial goods, including Boeing aircraft, US-made cars, and Kentucky bourbon. Some member states want the European Commission to prepare even wider steps if Trump widens his threat to sectors such as computer chips and medicines. With the calendar ticking down to the June 1 deadline and the EU’s own mid-July trigger date, diplomats on both continents say a breakthrough is needed within weeks. Until then, businesses on both sides are bracing for higher costs and fresh uncertainty. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Though it’s not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen. It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent’s behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs. That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions. Amazon- and Google-backed Anthropic dropped MCP on Nov. 25, 2024, to connect AI assistants to data systems. Source: Anthropic MCP attack vectors expose AI agents’ security issues According to VanEck, the number of AI agents in the crypto industry had surpassed 10,000 by the end of 2024 and is expected to top 1 million in 2025. Security firm SlowMist has discovered four potential attack vectors that developers need to look out for. Each attack vector is delivered through a plugin, which is how MCP-based agents extend their capabilities, whether it’s pulling price data, executing trades or performing system tasks. Data poisoning: This attack makes users perform misleading steps. It manipulates user behavior, creates false dependencies, and inserts malicious logic early in the process. JSON injection attack: This plugin retrieves data from a local (potentially malicious) source via a JSON call. It can lead to data leakage, command manipulation or bypassing validation mechanisms by feeding the agent tainted inputs. Competitive function override: This technique overrides legitimate system functions with malicious code. It prevents expected operations from occurring and embeds obfuscated instructions, disrupting system logic and hiding the attack. Cross-MCP call attack: This plugin induces an AI agent to interact with unverified external services through encoded error messages or deceptive prompts. It broadens the attack surface by linking multiple systems, creating opportunities for further exploitation. Sequence diagram showing potential cross-MCP attack vectors and risk points. Source: SlowMist These attack vectors are not synonymous with the poisoning of AI models themselves, like GPT-4 or Claude, which can involve corrupting the training data that shapes a model’s internal parameters. The attacks demonstrated by SlowMist target AI agents — which are systems built on top of models — that act on real-time inputs using plugins, tools and control protocols like MCP. Related: The future of digital self-governance: AI agents in crypto “AI model poisoning involves injecting malicious data into training samples, which then becomes embedded in the model parameters,” co-founder of blockchain security firm SlowMist “Monster Z” told Cointelegraph. “In contrast, the poisoning of agents and MCPs mainly stems from additional malicious information introduced during the model’s interaction phase.” “Personally, I believe [poisoning of agents] threat level and privilege scope are higher than that of standalone AI poisoning,” he said. MCP in AI agents a threat to crypto The adoption of MCP and AI agents is still relatively new in crypto. SlowMist identified the attack vectors from pre-released MCP projects it audited, which mitigated actual losses to end-users. However, the threat level of MCP security vulnerabilities is very real, according to Monster, who recalled an audit where the vulnerability may have led to private key leaks — a catastrophic ordeal for any crypto project or investor, as it could grant full asset control to uninvited actors. Crypto developers may be new to AI security, but it’s an urgent issue. Source: Cos “The moment you open your system to third-party plugins, you’re extending the attack surface beyond your control,” Guy Itzhaki, CEO of encryption research firm Fhenix, told Cointelegraph. Related: AI has a trust problem — Decentralized privacy-preserving tech can fix it “Plugins can act as trusted code execution paths, often without proper sandboxing. This opens the door to privilege escalation, dependency injection, function overrides and — worst of all — silent data leaks,” he added. Securing the AI layer before it’s too late Build fast, break things — then get hacked. That’s the risk facing developers who push off security to version two, especially in crypto’s high-stakes, onchain environment. The most common mistake builders make is to assume they can fly under the radar for a while and implement security measures in later updates after launch. That’s according to Lisa Loud, executive director of Secret Foundation. “When you build any plugin-based system today, especially if it’s in the context of crypto, which is public and onchain, you have to build security first and everything else second,” she told Cointelegraph. SlowMist security experts recommend developers implement strict plugin verification, enforce input sanitization, apply least privilege principles, and regularly review agent behavior. Loud said it’s “not difficult” to implement such security checks to prevent malicious injections or data poisoning, just “tedious and time consuming” — a small price to pay to secure crypto funds. As AI agents expand their footprint in crypto infrastructure, the need for proactive security cannot be overstated. The MCP framework may unlock powerful new capabilities for those agents, but without robust guardrails around plugins and system behavior, they could turn from helpful assistants into attack vectors, placing crypto wallets, funds and data at risk.

As BTC continues to grow, however, recent on-chain data suggests that investors may need to check their optimism and approach the market with caution. Futures Surge, Spot Falls — Binance Data Signals Need For Caution In a May 24 post on social media platform X, on-chain analyst Darkfost reported that trader activity in the Bitcoin futures market on Binance has slightly increased since May 5, while the spot market activity has dwindled considerably. Related Reading: Technical Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Blow Off Top To $325,000 – The Timeline Will Shock You This on-chain observation is based on two metrics: the Daily Binance Future Trade Volume and the Trading Volume on Futures and Spot. As their names suggest, these metrics track the trading volume across various markets on the world’s largest exchange. When the Future Trading Volume metric has a high value, it typically suggests a growing appetite for short-term bets on BTC. On the other hand, a low value implies less willingness of futures traders to bet on Bitcoin’s movement in the short term. For the spot market, a high value on the metric mirrors investors’ inclination towards long-term bets on Bitcoin. Meanwhile, a low value often indicates that investors suggest reduced faith in the long-term promise of the flagship cryptocurrency. According to data shared by Darkfost, the increase in futures activity, combined with the decrease in spot market activity, has created an imbalance in market dynamics. This current imbalance hints at a rise in speculative trading, meaning investors are now more motivated by risk-on sentiment, rather than long-term belief in the cryptocurrency. According to the analyst, this inclination to place bets on BTC’s short-term movement can heighten volatility, especially when these bets are not backed by strong spot demand to support the trend. “This increase in risk-taking on the market makes the trend more fragile and calls for heightened caution before making investment decisions,” Darkfost ended with a warning note. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $107,770, reflecting a 0.2% increase in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the flagship cryptocurrency is up by over 4% in the past seven days.

The court accepted Eisenberg’s defense that he used flawed but legal smart contract mechanics rather than committing fraud. Despite the ruling, Eisenberg remains in prison on child pornography charges. A US federal judge has thrown out major convictions against Avraham Eisenberg, the man accused of exploiting decentralized exchange Mango Markets for $110 million. On Friday, Judge Arun Subramanian vacated Eisenberg’s convictions for commodities fraud and market manipulation, stating that prosecutors failed to prove he made materially false representations. The court also acquitted Eisenberg of a third charge, leaving the government’s case significantly weakened. Eisenberg Used Token Pump to Drain $110M from Mango Eisenberg had been found guilty in April 2024 after a jury concluded he manipulated Mango’s MNGO token price by over 1,300% within minutes. He then used the inflated value as collateral to drain the protocol of $110 million in crypto. While the Department of Justice framed the act as a calculated deception of a smart contract system, Eisenberg’s defense insisted he simply took advantage of flawed but open code — without lying or misleading the protocol. Judge Subramanian sided with this view, noting that the platform was “permissionless and automatic,” making it difficult to establish a legal basis for fraud. “There was insufficient evidence of falsity,” he wrote. Everything we've been told about ""Code is Law"" defense not standing a chance in court has been a lie. Mango Markets / Avi Eisenberg charges just been dropped by a federal charge. The same logic used to dismiss the case can be used for pretty much any permissionless DeFi… pic.twitter.com/yWIUnmAUxX — Trust (@trust__90) May 24, 2025 The ruling also rejected New York as the proper venue for the trial. Eisenberg was based in Puerto Rico during the trades, and the judge dismissed the DOJ’s attempts to tie the case to the state through a Mango user in Poughkeepsie and a third-party service provider in Manhattan. The vacated charges now leave the Justice Department to decide whether to pursue the case again. However, recent signals from the Trump administration suggest a cooling stance on crypto-related enforcement. Eisenberg Remains in Prison for Child Pornography Possession Despite the court win, Eisenberg remains in federal custody. Earlier this month, he was sentenced to nearly four years in prison on an unrelated charge of child pornography possession, based on evidence found during his 2022 arrest in Puerto Rico. Eisenberg still faces separate civil cases brought by the SEC and CFTC. On October 11, 2022, Mango Markets was the victim of an attack in which approximately $110 million was drained from its treasury. Shortly after the attack, Avraham Eisenberg came forward as the perpetrator , asserting that the exploit was merely a “highly profitable trading strategy” and claiming it was conducted within the bounds of legality and the protocol’s intended design. According to prosecutors , Eisenberg utilized two accounts to engage in manipulative trading involving futures contracts tied to the values of Mango’s token MNGO and the stablecoin USD Coin . Last month, US federal prosecutors asked for a prison sentence of up to 6.5 years for Eisenberg. In their filing, prosecutors emphasized the severity of Eisenberg’s actions, stating that his scheme not only defrauded investors of over $100 million but also forced Mango Markets to shut down.

Amid these wild conditions, a revolutionary AI-powered asset manager named Unilabs is also setting itself up for historic growth. This platform is speculated to revolutionize the DeFi world with its powerful machine learning AI models. As the momentum builds, Unilabs is expected to be among the best cryptos of this week, just like WIF and LTC. Why Unilabs Could Be the Best Crypto of This Week? With $1M already in hand, Unilabs continues to make a strong foothold in the industry. The reason behind this vast scale popularity is that this platform leverages artificial intelligence to make investment easier and more efficient for its users. For instance, the AI Portfolio Management tool automates the process of handling multiple assets using smart technology. This way, users don’t have to check the market sentiment and the prices of each asset manually, as the tool does it for them. One standout feature of Unilabs that positions it among the best crypto of this week, just like Dogwifhat and Litecoin, is its mining pool feature. This tool allows users to boost their returns on mining activity by leveraging the advanced computing power of H1000 GPUs. Similarly, the platform also incorporates four distinct types of funds, such as AI, RWA, BTC, and Mining funds, with which users can invest in a wide variety of assets on a single platform. Unlike the WIF token, Unilabs features a Flash Loan Accelerator that enables investors to get an instant loan without any deposit. This way, traders can leverage quick profit-generating opportunities in the market. For building additional sources of income, users can benefit from the tier-based rewards that give UNIL holders a share in the platform’s 30% fees, depending on their UNIL holdings. Dogwifhat Poised for Long-term Growth As the broader memecoin market is experiencing a bullish momentum, Dogwifhat (WIF) is also positioning itself for a strong bull run. Earlier this month, the WIF token lost most of its previous gains as it was trading at around $0.5. Nevertheless, with the improvement in market sentiment, Dogwifhat faced an enormous surge that took it to above $1.1. From a monthly perspective, the price of the WIF token recorded an almost 98% rise in its value. Source: CoinMarketCap On top of this, Dogwifhat also saw a positive momentum building in its network activity that took its trading volume past $1.73 billion. Because of this surging demand, the WIF token even touched $1.3 on 23rd May. However, Dogwifhat couldn’t break past this resistance and again fell to $1.1. Nevertheless, analysts are still optimistic regarding the WIF token’s long-term potential. Meanwhile, Unilabs is also gaining traction in the industry with its potential to maximize users’ profit with real-time AI insights. Litecoin Price Forecast: A Major Upswing on the Way Litecoin has also been caught under the larger April downtrend, which took its price to a critical support zone at around $69. This correction further reinforced the long-term decline of the LTC token. However, after this consolidation, Litecoin got back on the radar and recorded massive 18% gains in the last 30 days. Analysts believe that after its April low, the LTC token could possibly enter a potential ascending support channel, which would create a bullish structure for its price. However, in the previous two weeks, Litecoin has constantly tried to remain above $100 but has failed to do so. Source: CoinMarketCap Experts believe Litecoin has to break past $115 to confirm a breakout from its prolonged falling wedge. On the other hand, Unilabs is becoming a top pick by many leading crypto enthusiasts as it is offering AI innovations that could drive big profit margins. Final Thoughts As the crypto market is buzzing with renewed energy, analysts suggest three coins, including Unilabs, Dogwifhat, and Litecoin, to be the best cryptos of the ongoing week. Among these tokens, Unilabs stands out by offering a unique opportunity for traders to become part of this massive growth platform through its presale. Therefore, investors should act fast and not miss out on the WIF, UNIL, and LTC tokens to maximize their gains.

The suspect, 37-year-old John Woeltz, was arraigned on Saturday in Manhattan criminal court following his arrest the previous day. According to police, Woeltz, along with an unidentified accomplice, held the victim captive for weeks inside a rented luxury townhouse in Soho, reportedly costing $30,000 per month. The victim had arrived in the United States on May 6, and authorities believe he was abducted shortly afterward. Once inside the residence, the attackers allegedly stole the victim’s passport and electronic devices before demanding access to his Bitcoin wallet. When he refused to share his credentials, he was reportedly subjected to horrific abuse. The victim told police he was beaten, electrocuted, assaulted with a firearm, and even dangled from the upper floors of the five-story property. Graphic Abuse and Escape In a particularly disturbing detail, the victim claimed Woeltz used a saw to cut into his leg and forced him to smoke crack cocaine. The attackers also reportedly threatened the victim’s family. Photographs found at the property, including Polaroids showing visible injuries, appear to support the victim’s account. The man eventually managed to escape on Friday and contacted authorities, leading to Woeltz’s arrest. Woeltz has been charged with four felony counts, including kidnapping for ransom. He pleaded not guilty and was denied bail by Judge Eric Schumacher. He is scheduled to return to court on May 28. A 24-year-old woman was also detained in connection with the incident. However, she was seen walking freely the next day, and no formal charges against her appear in court records. Authorities have not yet revealed whether any crypto was successfully stolen or the nature of the relationship between the parties involved. Rising Security Concerns Among Crypto Figures This incident adds to a growing list of violent crimes targeting individuals involved in cryptocurrency. Amid rising wealth and limited regulation, crypto executives are increasingly turning to private security firms . Amsterdam-based Infinite Risks International reported a noticeable uptick in bodyguard requests from crypto investors, particularly in France. Authorities there have ramped up protections following several high-profile abductions , including that of Ledger co-founder David Balland in January 2025. As digital assets become more valuable, law enforcement and security agencies around the world are grappling with the new risks tied to holding and managing crypto.

The decision prevents Durov from delivering a planned address on digital surveillance, free expression, and online rights at the prominent human rights conference. The Human Rights Foundation, which organizes the annual activist gathering, expressed disappointment over the court’s ruling that restricts Durov’s movement despite his invitation to speak before an international audience of freedom advocates. You might also like: TRON’s Justin Sun vows to cement Trump, US crypto capital vision Pavel Durov faces ongoing legal constraints Thor Halvorssen, founder and CEO of the Human Rights Foundation, criticized the judicial decision. “Technologies like Telegram are basic tools for those resisting tyranny. This is more than a disappointment for our community; it is a setback for freedom,” Halvorssen stated . Pavel Durov, who created Telegram , has been subject to French legal proceedings since August 2024. Authorities arrested him over allegations related to criminal activities conducted through his platform. However, prosecutors have not charged him with direct wrongdoing. The case centers on questions of platform liability for user-generated content and activities. French officials argue that Durov bears legal responsibility for how others use Telegram’s services. He remains free on bail while the matter proceeds through the judicial system. The court’s refusal to permit travel reverses previous decisions. French authorities had previously authorized Durov to leave the country for international engagements. This unexpected restriction has affected discussions between Durov and human rights defenders from various authoritarian states about improving Telegram’s capabilities for resistance movements. Durov has maintained residence outside Russia since 2014, when he declined to provide the Federal Security Service with user information regarding Ukrainian protesters. His exit from Russia established him as a prominent voice against digital surveillance and governmental interference in private communications.

45080776,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=734473,1748179280,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45080776.jpeg,South Korea’s leading presidential candidate wants more time on US tariff deal,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/south-korea-wants-more-time-us-tariff-deal/,"South Korea’s top presidential hopeful, Lee Jae-myung, said on Sunday that the deadline for reaching a trade agreement with the United States over Donald Trump’s tariffs needs to be pushed back. According to comments made during a press conference covered by multiple South Korean news outlets, Lee called the July 8 target unrealistic and said it failed to account for the political transition currently underway in Seoul. The deal, which involves tariff negotiations and broader economic cooperation between the two countries, was originally set in motion in Trump’s second term as president. The trade minister of South Korea had already warned that delays were likely because of the election. Lee doubled down, saying the current timeline seemed to only reflect Washington’s interests. “There is not much time,” Lee said. “Isn’t diplomacy something that benefits both sides? If one country benefits and the other country suffers unilaterally, that is not diplomacy. It is called plunder.” He said South Korea should not be forced to meet a deadline that wasn’t mutually agreed upon, and added that both countries needed to act like equal partners. Lee vows economic task force, criticizes ex-president’s approach Lee, who is running under the Democratic Party of Korea, also talked about the country’s economic slowdown and said he would immediately assemble a team to respond. He said South Korea must roll out an extra budget as soon as possible to help jumpstart the economy. “I will swiftly prepare immediately actionable economic measures and actively respond to the domestic economic slowdown with the determination to fight the recession,” he told reporters. The presidential election, scheduled for June 3, was triggered by the impeachment and removal of former president Yoon Suk Yeol, who declared martial law in December during a period of civil unrest. The move led to widespread backlash and criminal investigations. Yoon’s ouster created a leadership vacuum and forced a rushed campaign that has now taken a sharp focus on tariffs, recession, and foreign relations. South Korea’s foreign policy depends on election results Lee currently holds a 9-point lead over his closest rival, Kim Moon-soo, who served as labor minister under Yoon. According to polling data released on Friday by Gallup Korea, Lee is supported by 45% of likely voters, while Kim stands at 36%. That gap used to be larger, and Kim has been slowly climbing. But Lee said he was not worried. When asked about the tighter margin, he said, “I am confident that South Koreans would not choose those who supported or staged the ‘insurrection.’” Lee also addressed national security, saying that while he supports strong defense capabilities and the South Korea-US alliance, he believes there must be a push for peace and diplomacy with North Korea. He blamed Yoon’s hardline approach for escalating tensions and creating problems for investors and businesses. Lee called for a better balance between military readiness and open communication with the North. “We should maintain and strengthen our powerful defense capabilities, military power, and strengthen the South Korea-US security alliance, but find a path toward dialogue, cooperation, communication, and coexistence where possible,” he said. The proposed deal with the US was meant to finalize terms on tariffs that were originally put in place during Trump’s first presidency and have since been reevaluated as part of his administration’s current foreign trade agenda. Lee insisted that rushing into an agreement without serious economic analysis and bipartisan consensus would damage South Korea’s long-term interests. He emphasized that the next government must take the lead in negotiations, not just inherit unfinished deals signed off by a lame-duck cabinet. With just days left before the vote, Lee is presenting himself as the candidate who will take back control of South Korea’s economy and foreign affairs. His main argument is that diplomacy should be based on fairness, not deadlines forced by bigger partners. “We need mutual respect,” he said. “That’s how alliances work. Not by forcing one side to move at the other’s pace.” Every word of Lee’s message reflected urgency, especially with the July deadline hanging over the country’s next administration. Whether he wins or not, whoever becomes president will have to deal with a stalled economy, an anxious electorate, and the looming pressure of US negotiations.

Coins like ADA and MATIC, once seen as reliable bets, have shown little price action or exciting developments recently. Despite their high market caps and brand recognition, their returns have been minimal. This trend has left many retail investors disappointed and searching for better opportunities. One emerging project that is beginning to attract serious attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . While it’s still flying under the radar, early adopters of MUTM have already enjoyed significant gains—and the token is still priced under $0.03. With eight more presale phases to go, a detailed roadmap, passive earning tools, and growing interest, this altcoin might outshine many of the crypto giants by the end of the year. MUTM outpaces 90% of low-caps MUTM launched its presale at just $0.01. Now, in Phase 5, it has reached $0.03—marking a 200% increase from its starting price. In comparison, the majority of low-cap tokens have seen either flat returns or declined during the same period. So far, over $9.1 million has been raised and more than 504 million tokens have been sold to over 10,900 holders. This strong early demand demonstrates both investor trust and momentum. For those entering at the current price, there is still major upside. With eight presale phases remaining and the final phase set at $0.06, the token price is expected to double before even hitting public exchanges. Investors waiting for later stages may find their profit margin reduced, making now a strategic time to get in early before major listing announcements push prices higher. Why Mutuum Finance is different Mutuum Finance is not just another lending platform. It is a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol that supports both peer-to-pool (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending models. In the P2C system, users deposit crypto assets into shared pools and earn interest based on the activity and demand in those pools. For instance, if a user deposits $10,000 worth of ETH into the platform during high utilization, they can earn competitive passive income—sometimes even more than traditional DeFi platforms offer, depending on pool activity. On the P2P side, Mutuum Finance allows users to lend directly to others, with full control over interest rates and loan duration. What makes this particularly exciting is that users can lend or borrow assets not commonly available on traditional platforms—such as meme coins like DOGE, SHIB, or PEPE—opening new doors for crypto enthusiasts seeking variety and flexibility. Utility, passive income, and mtTokens Mutuum Finance offers more than just speculation. Users who deposit assets into the protocol receive mtTokens, which are tokenized receipts of their deposits. These mtTokens automatically earn interest and reflect the real-time value of both the deposit and its returns. On top of that, users who stake mtTokens in designated safety modules are eligible for passive dividends in MUTM, funded by the platform’s revenue buybacks. This model rewards long-term holders with more than just token appreciation—it offers sustainable passive income. One of the biggest concerns in crypto investing is project reliability. Mutuum Finance has already undergone a full smart contract audit in its early phase. On top of that, the project is building its infrastructure in a transparent and professional manner. Its roadmap outlines every development phase, including core smart contract work, DApp front-end, analytics tools, exchange listings, and regional compliance efforts. A standout feature is its AI-powered helpdesk, which assists users with technical and general questions in real time, reducing support issues and improving user experience. Combined with future plans for multi-chain expansion and institutional partnerships, Mutuum Finance is setting itself up to compete with established platforms. Real numbers and real growth From a data perspective, MUTM is showing real momentum. With more than 10,900 holders and over half a billion tokens already sold, the numbers support the community’s enthusiasm. The rise from $0.01 to $0.03 represents a 200% return—something the majority of top 20 coins haven’t achieved in over a year. Imagine investing $1,000 at the current price of $0.03. When the token does a 35x after listing, that investment could be worth $35,000. These numbers are realistic considering the platform’s fundamentals, token utility, and current interest level from investors. And once institutions take notice, price growth could accelerate beyond expectations. Waiting for the later stages of the presale may mean missing the most profitable phases. The earlier you enter, the higher your potential return. Investors who bought in at $0.01 have already tripled their money. As each phase increases the price by a set margin, the chances of achieving large profits shrink with time. Getting in now means not only securing a lower entry point but also gaining access to staking, lending, and dividend features from the very beginning. The window of opportunity to catch MUTM under $0.03 is closing. Mutuum Finance is no longer just a presale project—it’s quickly becoming a serious contender in the DeFi space. With a real use case, active development, and strong tokenomics, it may soon leave its “under-the-radar” status behind and challenge some of the biggest names in crypto.

With speculation growing around a potential rally that could push Bitcoin to $150,000, investors are looking beyond BTC for projects that could experience even greater percentage gains. One such project is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising DeFi protocol that experts believe could soar to $5 if the crypto tide turns in Bitcoin’s favor. Why Bitcoin at $150K changes the game for DeFi Historically, when Bitcoin enters a strong bull run, it doesn’t rise alone. In 2021, as Bitcoin surged from $10K to nearly $70K, it ignited an explosive wave across decentralized finance (DeFi). Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols ballooned from under $1 billion to more than $250 billion. Lending and borrowing platforms were at the heart of this surge, driven by growing demand for liquidity and leveraged opportunities. Mutuum Finance is built to thrive in these conditions. As a decentralized, non-custodial protocol that facilitates lending and borrowing, it is positioned to attract liquidity from both retail and institutional players. When markets rise, users prefer borrowing instead of selling their appreciated assets, fueling borrowing demand. This in turn benefits lenders, who earn higher yields—creating a self-sustaining cycle of capital flow. Why MUTM at $0.03 looks like a rare opportunity At its current price of $0.03, MUTM presents a case that’s hard to ignore. With over 504 million tokens already sold and more than 10,900 holders on board, the project has already established a significant early footprint. Mutuum is currently in Phase 5 of its presale, raising over $9.1 million in total. Importantly, the team plans to launch a beta version of the platform around the token’s public release—a sign of serious commitment to delivering functionality, not just hype. For early investors, the math becomes exciting when applying compounding logic. If MUTM reaches $5, that would represent a 16,566% gain from its current price. A $1,000 investment at $0.03 would grow to approximately $166,666. Such growth is not unprecedented. In 2021, similar DeFi tokens like AAVE and COMP saw meteoric rises in response to the DeFi explosion. The belief that MUTM could repeat this trajectory is not far-fetched—especially if Bitcoin triggers a new TVL wave. Understanding MUTM’s role in the ecosystem MUTM isn’t just a speculative asset. It serves as a critical part of the Mutuum Finance ecosystem. Holders benefit in several ways, particularly from the protocol’s dividend mechanism. A portion of Mutuum’s revenue will be used to buy MUTM from the open market, and those tokens will be distributed to users who stake mtTokens in designated contracts. This model incentivizes long-term participation and aligns rewards with the platform’s success. Moreover, as the platform gains more users, both borrowing and lending activities are expected to scale, increasing revenue—and thus the value and utility of MUTM. Token holders who actively stake their assets will be in line to receive a consistent stream of dividends, turning MUTM into a passive income-generating asset in addition to its appreciation potential. The roadmap is more than just promises Another reason for optimism is Mutuum’s commitment to delivery. The beta launch scheduled near the token’s go-live date demonstrates a product-first approach. Unlike many projects that launch tokens without a working product, Mutuum is aiming to ensure that functionality is available from day one. This builds trust in the protocol and encourages adoption. To further drive awareness and community growth, the team is currently running a $100K giveaway campaign. This move not only rewards early supporters but also helps attract new participants to the ecosystem, increasing visibility just as the broader market sentiment starts to shift. While there are many lending protocols in the DeFi space, Mutuum takes a hybrid approach by offering both pool-based and peer-to-peer (P2P) borrowing options. This gives users the flexibility to choose between automated liquidity models and custom lending agreements, catering to a wider range of investor preferences. Its dynamic interest rate model ensures that capital remains efficiently utilized. When borrowing demand is high, rates rise to protect lender incentives. Conversely, during low demand periods, borrowing becomes more attractive—helping maintain balance within the liquidity pools. For both lenders and borrowers, this adaptive system ensures a fair and competitive environment. A realistic road to $5 for MUTM The $5 target may seem ambitious at first glance, but historical data and current market conditions suggest it’s within reach. If Bitcoin hits $150K, and if DeFi again draws billions in liquidity, protocols with strong fundamentals like Mutuum stand to benefit the most. MUTM doesn’t need to capture the entire market to see explosive growth—it only needs to capture attention, volume, and steady user adoption. Given the $0.03 starting point, even moderate adoption could push MUTM into the $1–$2 range. But with the right mix of rising TVL, consistent dividend payouts, and a functioning platform at launch, $5 becomes a reasonable projection for those entering early. For investors seeking a high-upside play with tangible utility, a committed team, and a market environment that may soon turn wildly bullish, Mutuum Finance looks like a name to remember.

33767162,[object Object],1748179598,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Solaxy Presale Heats Up as Traders Hunt the Next Hyperliquid,https://bitcoinist.com/solaxy-presale-heats-up-as-traders-hunt-the-next-hyperliquid/,"Crypto X is buzzing. Headlines are flying. Everyone’s talking about Hyperliquid and its so-called ‘Solana moment.’ It’s the kind of narrative that kicks off altcoin season fever – memories of 2021-style rallies, where coins you’d never heard of turned into overnight giants. This type of hype isn’t just noise. It moves markets. And right now, traders are scrambling to spot the next low-cap rocket before it takes off. That’s where Solaxy ($SOLX) comes in. It’s a wild, meme-fueled new crypto project with a clever twist – and it’s starting to show the same early signs of explosive potential. The crypto presale is live, the buzz is building, and the clock is ticking. With 22 days left, Solaxy might just be the next unexpected hero of this cycle. The Hype Machine Is Back On So why is everyone suddenly talking about ‘Solana moments’ again. Hyperliquid ($HYPE) surged as much as 240% in recent weeks before settling at a 95% gain over the past 30 days, climbing to $36.61 and grabbing serious attention across X and crypto Telegram groups. But it’s not just about one coin mooning – it’s about the return of narrative-driven trading. People aren’t just scanning charts anymore. They’re chasing stories. They’re hunting for the next Solana or Pepe. Back in 2021, coins didn’t pump because of utility – they pumped because of memes, momentum, and madness. Solana had the ‘Ethereum killer’ badge. Dogecoin rode Elon’s posts like a SpaceX shuttle. Shiba Inu sold the dream of a decentralized meme empire.These coins had a vibe, a cult following, and a sense of being in on something big before the rest of the world caught on. Now, that same playbook is working again. Hyperliquid’s rally showed that you don’t need a blue-chip label to skyrocket. You just need attention, the right narrative, and perfect timing. And that’s exactly the wave Solaxy is ready to ride. What Is Solaxy ($SOLX) and Why Is Everyone Talking About It? Solaxy ($SOLX) isn’t just another meme coin – it’s a full-blown blockchain revolution dressed up in memes and chaos. It’s the first-ever Layer 2 built on Solana, and it’s here to do what Solana alone couldn’t: fix its traffic jams, smooth out its failed transactions, and push the speed to new levels. Solaxy unlocks Solana’s full potential by adding scalability, reliability, and an Ethereum-sized opportunity.That’s right – $SOLX is a multichain token, native to Solaxy (the Solana Layer 2), but launching on both Solana and Ethereum, the two biggest crypto ecosystems on the planet. Ethereum has unmatched liquidity. Solana has meme coin mania . Solaxy gives you access to both. And it’s not just for developers or whales. Solaxy democratizes the meme coin game. Its infrastructure gives everyday traders the same kind of power and speed that sniping bots use – making it easier to catch a mooning coin before it takes off. Whether you’re in it for the tech, the memes, or the gains, Solaxy hits the sweet spot. In a week where $HYPE showed us the power of narrative trading, Solaxy fits perfectly into the ‘next breakout’ conversation. Why You Need to Buy Solaxy Right Now The $SOLX presale is live at just $0.001734, and it’s already raised over $40M. That alone tells you it’s gaining real traction. But here’s the real reason to act now: there are only 22 days left before the presale ends – and this is the last chance to get in before the open market decides the price. Let’s do the math. Price forecasts for 2025 place $SOLX between $0.0024 and $0.032. At the low end, that’s a 38% gain from today’s price. At the high end, that’s a 1,745% increase. Now let’s say you buy $1K worth of $SOLX at the current presale price. That gets you about 576,800 tokens. If you stake them with a 15% APY, you’ll have around 663,320 tokens in a year. If the price stays flat, you still hold $1,150 worth of tokens – easy passive income. But if $SOLX hits just $0.032 in 2025, your tokens could be worth $21,226. That’s a 2,000%+ ROI, without lifting a finger – just for buying early and staking smart. The window is closing. The hype is building. Solaxy isn’t just another coin – it’s a layer 2 rocket with a countdown. The Next Breakout Isn’t Coming – It’s Already Here Crypto traders are chasing the next Solana moment, and Hyperliquid’s breakout just reminded everyone how fast things can move. The market is hungry for momentum, stories, and underdogs with explosive upside. Solaxy fits that narrative perfectly – messy, meme-driven, and built on real tech that solves Solana’s biggest pain points. It’s not just playing the game – it’s rewriting the rules.

Farina, well-known in the XRP community for his relentless promotion of the asset’s capabilities, emphasized that the transaction was not only instant but also remarkably cheap, positioning XRP miles ahead of competitors like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) when it comes to payments at this scale. This revelation has renewed excitement among the XRP community and the broader crypto ecosystem. As blockchain networks continue to battle for dominance in the payments space, Farina’s post underscores what many XRP enthusiasts have long claimed: XRP’s superior speed and cost-effectiveness make it a natural fit for high-value transactions. Paying for a $300k watch with $XRP Instant. Cheap. No way BTC or ETH could handle that. pic.twitter.com/3mAjdix1oe — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) May 25, 2025 XRP’s Edge Over Bitcoin and Ethereum in Payments While Bitcoin and Ethereum are the largest and most recognized cryptocurrencies globally, they often face criticism for their high transaction costs and slower settlement speeds, especially under heavy network load. Bitcoin’s ‘digital gold’ status notwithstanding, it processes an average of 7 transactions per second (TPS) with confirmation times varying from 10 minutes to over an hour due to network congestion and fees. Ethereum fares slightly better with 15–30 TPS but still struggles with scaling issues and fluctuating gas fees that can soar during peak activity. XRP, on the other hand, was specifically designed for fast , cheap, and scalable cross-border payments. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) can handle 1,500 transactions per second, with settlement times as fast as 3-5 seconds and fees as low as fractions of a cent. These features make it uniquely positioned to handle micropayments and large-value transactions, such as the $300,000 luxury watch purchase highlighted by Farina. The Importance of Real-World Use Cases The crypto industry has long faced criticism for its limited practical applications beyond speculation and investment. High-profile use cases like this luxury watch purchase prove that payments are maturing beyond the hype. According to Farina, the XRP transaction was smooth, efficient, and cost-effective, a testament to the asset’s power in real commerce. This kind of adoption is crucial as Ripple, the company closely tied to XRP, continues to expand its network of financial partners and payment corridors globally. Ripple’s institutional focus notwithstanding, high-net-worth individuals also use XRP for personal transactions, capitalizing on its speed and efficiency. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Competitive Landscape for Crypto Payments The race to become the dominant cryptocurrency for payments is intensifying, with new solutions like Ethereum’s layer-2 networks (e.g., Arbitrum, Optimism) and Bitcoin’s Lightning Network aiming to overcome native limitations. However, XRP’s advantage lies in its readiness: it requires no additional layers, upgrades, or workarounds to deliver instant, low-cost payments. This makes it highly appealing for merchants and buyers who want frictionless transactions without worrying about technical complexity. Moreover, XRP’s resilience has been notable despite its regulatory battles in the U.S., particularly the lawsuit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which partly dampened its institutional momentum. Yet, the XRP community, led by figures like Farina, has remained unwavering in promoting its strengths, often highlighting its unique technical design, longstanding market presence, and growing international adoption. The Road Ahead for XRP Payments The growing number of high-value transactions, like the $300,000 watch purchase, showcases XRP’s real-world potential. It’s not just about theoretical advantages or whitepaper promises; it’s about actual, verifiable transactions that deliver on the vision of cryptocurrency as a better medium of exchange. While the crypto space continues to innovate, the core metrics of speed, cost, and scalability remain pivotal. With industry veterans like Edo Farina championing XRP’s use for significant, high-value purchases, the asset solidifies its reputation as a payment-focused crypto ready for mainstream adoption. As the ecosystem advances, XRP’s unique blend of technological efficiency and practical usability positions it for continued leadership in digital payments.

In a new CNBC interview, the investor points out that Apple has made a smart move by creating a manufacturing base in India to diversify its supply chain and reduce reliance on China. But with President Trump threatening to slap 25% tariffs on iPhones manufactured outside the US, Ives says Apple investors are now in a tough spot because he doesn’t think it’s feasible for the tech giant to uproot its global supply chain. “It’s a Pinocchio story – the reality of actually having iPhone production in the US. Because in my opinion, that will take four to five years, $20 to $30 billion, even to move 15% to 20% of the supply chain. And then if you actually produce the iPhone in the US, you’d be looking at $3,500 iPhones. So I view it as Apple’s situation, they tried to pivot around India and that was a smart strategy and now their backs are against the wall. It was a Twilight Zone day today for any Apple investor, given Apple has done all the right things in terms of pivoting out of China and now [they’re] saying come to the US – that’s a fairy tale.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Various factors have converged to push up the price of Bitcoin (BTC), including macroeconomic tailwinds, massive ETF inflows, and corporate purchases. Amid this bullish momentum, it might be the perfect time to capitalize on projects that could offer more bang for your investment, such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the perfect buy Rarely do projects so complete in their development, and conceptualization as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) appear in the crypto sector. The project covers all existing pain points that face current DeFi projects, while also introducing new and innovative features that could revolutionize DeFi for the better. One of its standout features is the dual lending mode, which incorporates both P2P and P2C. Under P2P (Peer-to-Peer), lenders can lend tokens with low liquidity, such as meme coins like DOGE. This mode allows lenders and borrowers to engage in direct negotiations, where they can set the loan duration, interest rate, and partial fills. The upside is that lenders could potentially access higher yields while helping to boost protocol participation. The other mode is P2C (Peer-to-Contract), where assets are deposited in pools governed by audited smart contracts. For instance, a user can opt to deposit $800 worth of ETH in one of these pools. They will then receive annual percentage yields based on the pool’s utilization. Borrowers can take over-collateralized loans from these pools, whose interest rate rises as utilization rises. Over time, the rising rates discourage borrowing, while encouraging more lenders to sign up. The result is that it creates a self-stabilizing loop of capital efficiency. When lenders use the P2C mode, they get mtTokens in exchange for their assets. These tokens represent both the interest and principal amount. The tokens can also be used as collateral for borrowing assets, and can be traded on secondary markets since they conform to the ERC-20 token standard. Both modes are governed by smart contracts whose security has been verified via comprehensive audits. The entire ecosystem is on the verge of going live, with the presale phase of the tokens currently in phase 5. At the current time, all tokens are going for $0.03 per token, with plans to increase the price to $0.035 in phase 6. In short, everyone could be part of this revolutionary ecosystem at the low entry point of just 3 cents. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) dtablecoin To further bolster the attractiveness of Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the team behind this innovative project plans to launch a decentralized stablecoin. One standout feature of this stablecoin is that it will be powered by multi-asset collateralization. Traditionally, DeFi systems create stablecoins backed by single-asset vaults. In these vaults, each collateral type exists in a silo. For Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a basket of assets will be used to mint stablecoins. This will be a pre-approved list of assets that can be used as consolidated collateral. Since multiple assets can back one borrowing position, it will ensure the value of the stablecoin is backed by a diverse asset base. For stablecoin users, the borrowing process will be simplified, and easy to navigate. They will supply collateral to the protocol, and use it to borrow the stablecoin. It helps to boost flexibility, when it comes to managing price movements. When debt is backed by an array of assets, it can allow them to top up their assets without having to close a position. This will create the gold standard for decentralized stablecoins, further helping to cement the position of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) within the greater DeFi ecosystem. This is your chance to capitalize momentum During periods of upward price movement, the crypto sector attracts a lot of capital, as more people pay attention to the sector. It often leads to a renewed interest in new utility-based projects that show promise. By getting into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now, while the price is at a low $0.03, you can benefit from the coming surge in interest in MUTM tokens and triple or quadruple your potential payout. With MUTM tokens, the future of finance could be part of your future too. Thus far, over $9,2 million has made its way into the presale, which is a fraction of the potential capital influx that will enter the crypto markets in the coming weeks. With the team feverishly working to list MUTM on as many public exchanges as possible, this could be the perfect vehicle to ride the BTC bull run wave.

With a listing price of $0.06, most experts give in a modest price increase to $2 shortly after it goes live. Examining the presale progress so far, you will find that it is currently in phase 5, with a current price of $0.03 per token. It has managed to raise over $9 million from nearly 11K unique buyers, who continue to express support for the project online, organically. Thus far, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has one of the biggest organic followings on X for a project still in the pre-launch phase. It has managed to acquire over 10K supporters who are playing a huge role in speeding up the presale to the current heights. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price is set to increase by 16.67%, slightly reducing the potential payout on listing day. However, realistic investors have no plans to sell their assets on listing day. Let us take a look at why. Potential value increase for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) A major driver of demand for crypto projects in 2025 is utility. With Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) deep focus on giving its community as much utility as possible, this could be a game changer. A unique aspect of this project is its lending protocol, which allows users to earn passively from their assets while still unlocking their value. The value unlock is made possible, thanks to ERC-20 token standard mtTokens. When a user deposits $6,000 worth of ETH into a lending pool, they receive mtETH tokens of a commensurate value. These tokens can be used as collateral for other assets within the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem, or traded on secondary exchanges. Consequently, this means that users do not have to withdraw their assets from the utility pool, if they suddenly develop a need for their assets. Instead, they can leave them in the utility pool to continue earning interest, while still able to access their full value. A major reason one would wish to leave their assets in the lending pool is the dividend returns offered by Mutuum Finance (MUTM). These dividends represent a share of the revenue collected from various streams within the platform. The revenue is used to purchase MUTM tokens from secondary markets, and these tokens are distributed to lenders. Naturally, the biggest lenders, who make the largest contribution to the health of the ecosystem, receive the biggest rewards. Thanks to the success of the presale, the developer team at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has pushed back the timelines. They now plan to launch a beta version of their platform on day one of the token listing. The beta version will serve as an important demonstrator of progress, and proof that the team is serious about revolutionizing the DeFi world forever. This beta platform is expected to simulate most of the promised features, helping to inspire even more interest in the project and pushing prices to new highs. As such, experts predict the price will reach $2 from the launch price of $0.06, representing an over 3,200% increase in value in just a few weeks or days. With a massive following across social media, that is helping to spread the word about Mutuum Finance (MUTM), experts have no doubt about this prediction. Now the question is not about potential, it is all about timing. If one chooses to get in now at the $0.03 price of phase 5, they are guaranteed a 100% return, wait a little longer until phase 6, and it drops slightly to a guaranteed 71.43%. While still impressive, nothing beats a 100% return. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) giveaway While nothing beats the massive returns guaranteed on listing day, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised the stakes with a $100K giveaway. The giveaway will reward 10 lucky winners, each receiving $10K. To participate, you can find all the details and instructions on the official Mutuum Finance website.

With its Move-based programming model and focus on scalability, Sui appealed to developers building DeFi and dApps. However, as the network matured, retail participation in SUI became largely passive. Without built-in staking rewards for small holders or mechanisms for earning from network activity directly, many early users began seeking opportunities with more accessible and consistent value distribution. That pivot is now leading many to Bitcoin Solaris, a protocol built from the ground up to reward users through mobile mining. Unlike token price speculation or validator staking, Bitcoin Solaris allows anyone with a smartphone to earn BTC-S tokens daily via the upcoming Nova App. The system’s structure has started to redefine participation — not just by making crypto accessible, but by delivering real income to everyday users. Nova App Turns Any Smartphone into a Reward-Generating Device Bitcoin Solaris uses the Nova App to decentralize token distribution. Users allocate a small amount of device storage (1–5 GB) and idle CPU to the app, which operates in the background — usually during charging or idle times. In return, BTC-S tokens are issued automatically based on device uptime and activity. There’s no validator complexity, no staking lockup, and no requirement to time the market. Mobile mining returns the control of earnings to the user, creating a system where participation equals reward. This model has already drawn attention from Sui investors who found themselves holding tokens with limited protocol engagement options. Bitcoin Solaris Scales Rewards Without Centralization Behind Nova App mining is a dual-layer blockchain designed for decentralized throughput. The Base Layer secures the chain using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Capacity (PoC). The Solaris Layer handles execution using Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Time (PoT) — enabling 10,000+ transactions per second and 2-second finality. This layered design means that as more users adopt mobile mining, the system can scale without delays or congestion. It also ensures that reward distribution remains fast, fair, and decentralized — unlike traditional staking networks where control often consolidates around early validators or large token holders. Audited and Verified Infrastructure Builds Investor Confidence Bitcoin Solaris has completed full third-party validation to ensure smart contract logic, emission rules, and mobile mining architecture function as designed. The Cyberscope audit confirmed the integrity of its contracts, while the Freshcoins audit tested the system’s mobile scalability. The team has also completed KYC verification , bringing transparency to project leadership and governance. These verifications position Bitcoin Solaris as a compliant and secure protocol with fully disclosed rules — essential for a network promising decentralized daily income. Strategic Entry Point With 5x Return Potential Bitcoin Solaris is now in Presale Phase 4, with BTC-S priced at 4 USDT. The launch price is set at 20 USDT, offering early participants a projected 5X return before the Nova App mining platform activates publicly. Out of the fixed 21 million BTC-S supply, 4.2 million tokens (20%) are allocated to presale buyers. This stage offers more than discounted access. It gives buyers first positioning ahead of the public launch, where mining difficulty will rise as the network scales. The ability to enter before this transition mirrors the advantage held by early Bitcoin participants — before mining competition reduced individual returns. In a recent video, Crypto Nitro compared the passive holding model behind Sui to the active earning structure of Bitcoin Solaris. He outlined how Nova App mining gives users direct rewards without technical friction — and why mobile-first participation is driving renewed investor attention. Sui brought early innovation to smart contract performance — but left many retail users without direct earning tools. Bitcoin Solaris changes that by delivering protocol rewards straight to smartphones, offering real, decentralized income through mobile mining. Now in Presale Phase 4 at 4 USDT, BTC-S gives early participants access to token appreciation and network mining before difficulty and demand scale. For those seeking more than passive price exposure, the system is already in place — and the window is still open.

45081933,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-leaders-wrong-about-property,1748181600,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png,Crypto leaders are wrong about tokenized property,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-leaders-wrong-about-property?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealth During Paris Blockchain Week, Securitize Chief Operating Officer Michael Sonnenshein made headlines by dismissing real estate as a sub-optimal asset class for tokenization. This isn’t the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein’s contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization’s transformative potential. Real estate represents the world’s largest asset class and is projected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion this year, according to Statista. When industry leaders claim that this massive market isn’t suitable for tokenization, they overlook today's transformative infrastructure and the core value proposition that extends far beyond liquidity, transforming access to the asset class. Replacing traditional foundations Sonnenshein argues that “good systems” already exist for traditional assets. He implies that tokenization offers marginal improvements at best, but this assessment overlooks fundamental inefficiencies in today’s real estate market that tokenization addresses. The current real estate transaction process involves weeks of paperwork. Within the UK, there are a number of purchasing fees which can easily add 10% to the total bill . Settlement periods can extend to months and complexity multiplies exponentially for cross-border transactions. These aren’t minor flaws. They’re systemic failures that tokenization technology is uniquely positioned to solve. Take smart contracts’ ability to automate compliance , for instance, enabling verification and payment distribution while reducing fraud through immutable record-keeping. Redefining demand beyond liquidity When Sonnenshein says “the onchain economy is demanding more liquid assets,” he misinterprets what everyday investors truly demand. For the 99% excluded from institutional-grade real estate investments, the primary task is not Bitcoin-like liquidity; it’s meaningful access to an asset class that has built more wealth than any other over the past century. Traditional real estate investment vehicles require significant sums as minimum investments, accredited investor status and multi-year capital lockup periods. These barriers effectively exclude teachers, nurses and middle-class families from participating in prime real estate properties that have historically delivered consistent returns for investors. Recent: Dubai Land Department begins real estate tokenization project Tokenization fundamentally changes this equation. Fractionalizing ownership through tokenization, investors can now participate with as little as $100, receive proportional income distributions and eventually trade their positions on specialized secondary markets. The demand for this democratized access is enormous, even if secondary market liquidity initially lags behind liquid markets. Translation problems? Not quite Sonnenshein also suggests that tokenization does not “translate well” to representing ownership in real estate. This assessment overlooks the blockchain’s revolutionary capability to enable fractional investments in properties that were previously accessible only to institutional investors. Tokenization technology excels precisely at creating transparent, secure fractional investment opportunities with minimal overhead. A $50 million residential development project can be divided into 500,000 tokens, each getting an equal share of the rental income and potential appreciation. This dramatically lowers barriers to entry while maintaining the core benefits of real estate as an asset class. This fractionalization fundamentally transforms how people can build wealth through real estate. Previously, REITs offered the only realistic path to diversified property exposure, often with high fees, no control and limited transparency. Tokenization allows investors to build personalized portfolios across multiple property types, all managed through a single digital wallet. What does not “translate well” isn’t the technology. Outdated regulatory frameworks and incumbent business models resist this necessary evolution. The UAE government recognizes this reality, supported by its recent initiative to tokenize $1 billion in real estate assets. Building tomorrow’s infrastructure The conservative stance on RWA growth projections misses the accelerating infrastructure development underway. BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund BUIDL is quickly approaching $3 billion in assets , demonstrating a significant institutional appetite for tokenized investment vehicles. This isn’t an isolated case. UBS Asset Management, Hamilton Lane, Franklin Templeton and many more have launched tokenized investment vehicles, signaling a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views tokenization technology. What critics consistently underestimate is the network effect of financial infrastructure. Each institutional entrant doesn’t just add linearly to the ecosystem. It exponentially increases connectivity and liquidity pools. We’re witnessing the early stages of a self-reinforcing cycle where each new participant reduces friction for subsequent entrants. The narrative shouldn’t center on current limitations. Instead, there should be a spotlight on what’s being built. Secondary marketplaces optimized for real-world assets are emerging, regulatory clarity is increasing in key jurisdictions, and each development strengthens the foundation for mass adoption at a pace that will likely surprise today’s skeptics. Democratized wealth creation Institutional investors have enjoyed privileged access to the most profitable real estate investments for decades, while retail investors were limited to residential properties or high-fee REITs. Tokenization breaks this paradigm by allowing anyone to build a diversified property portfolio spanning commercial, residential and industrial assets across multiple geographies. When crypto leaders dismiss real estate tokenization based solely on liquidity metrics, they apply the wrong measurement standard. The transformative potential lies in democratizing access to an asset class that has created more millionaires than any other investment vehicle in history. The endgame of real estate tokenization is making institutional-grade property investments accessible to everyone. The adoption of tokenized real estate and other real-world assets will continue to grow despite skepticism from executives who miss the forest for the trees.

The Binance Coin (BNB) price was $660 on Sunday, up 13% from its lowest level this month. However, it remains a few points below this month’s high of $692. BNB price reacted to the ongoing demand of the BNB Smart Chain ecosystem. Data shows that DEX protocols on its network handled over $100 billion in the last 30 days. This growth means that BSC has flipped top chains like Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ), which handled $67 billion and $97 billion in the same period. Most of BSC’s volume happened in the last seven days, when it jumped by 133% to over $55 billion. PancakeSwap is handling most of this volume as it continues to dominate the ecosystem. It handled $50 billion in the last seven days and $92 billion in the last 30 days. It also crossed the $1.62 billion cumulative volume mark. You might also like: SYRUP price rallies as Maple TVL, staking market cap, whale purchases rise Other top DEX networks on the BSC Chain, such as Uniswap, THENA, Dodo, and SquadSwap, have also seen higher volumes in the past few weeks. The BSC Chain has had more activity after its last two protocol upgrades: Pascal and Lorentz. Pascal deepened its integration with Ethereum network, while Lorentz reduced its block time from 3 seconds to 1.5 seconds. The next key catalyst will be the Maxwell upgrade, which will improve its speeds further and make it better than Ethereum and Solana. While the date has not been announced, the developers noted it will happen in June. BNB price technical analysis BNB price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the BNB token bottomed at $510 in February and March. It neared that support level in April, forming a triple-bottom pattern with a neckline at $645. BNB has now formed a golden cross pattern as the 50-day Weighted Moving Average has moved above the 200-day one. A golden cross often leads to more gains in the long term. Therefore, more gains will be confirmed when the BNB price rises above the key resistance level at $690, its highest level this month. If this happens, it will increase the chances of it soaring to the next resistance level at $795, the highest point on Dec. 4 and 20% above the current level. The long-term BNB price forecast is as bullish as crypto.news wrote here , citing the cup and handle pattern formation on the weekly chart.

For years, Beijing leaned on exports and state-led investment to fuel growth. But with that model losing steam, President Xi Jinping is looking inward — at a population that’s hesitant to spend and quick to save. And while the call to increase consumer demand has grown louder, nobody’s really sure if Xi can make that happen. According to the Financial Times, there are questions about whether Beijing’s top-down approach can unlock the massive spending power that’s been sitting idle for years. The size of China’s consumer market is massive — the second largest globally after the U.S. — but that doesn’t mean people are buying enough. Right now, consumer spending makes up only 40% of the country’s economy, far below the 60% seen in other countries. Before the pandemic, it was growing at a 9% annual pace. Still, confidence hasn’t returned. People are anxious. A collapsed housing sector and the scars from the zero-Covid strategy have pushed families to save more and spend less. Big economy, small confidence Retail sales inside China are ten times bigger than exports to the U.S., but that hasn’t translated into strong domestic demand. Rory Green, chief China economist at TS Lombard, said, “China is the largest market in terms of volume and value for almost any consumer product, ranging from vehicles and smartphones to luxury goods and cinema.” Even with economic pressure, younger Chinese aren’t shying away. Keyu Jin, an economist at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said Gen Z and millennials are still buying. “Gen Z and millennials are still eagerly spending on travel, outdoor experiences and gaming,” she explained. “The bulk of consumer credit goes to people under 35. With one click on Alibaba, you can borrow to buy a lipstick.” Boston Consulting Group predicts China’s middle- and upper-class population will grow to over 500 million by 2030. That’s more than the entire population of the United States. But even that won’t matter if people don’t feel safe spending. The government needs people to trust that a fall won’t bankrupt them — and right now, that trust isn’t there. Policy changes haven’t been enough Some small fixes have landed. The People’s Bank of China lowered bank reserve requirements in September. Mortgage rates were also cut, and stock markets got a bit of support. In March, Beijing rolled out a “special action plan” with promises like wage increases and childcare subsidies. There’s also a trade-in plan offering cash to replace old goods with new ones. It’s a start, but not enough. A Deutsche Bank survey in Q1 found that 52% of Chinese consumers said they were ready to spend more, the highest figure in a year. But any real, lasting shift would require deeper reforms. Households aren’t going to drain their savings until they feel protected. That means better welfare, healthcare access, and pension systems — things China doesn’t have in place right now. Xi’s signature slogans — “dual circulation” and “common prosperity” — are supposed to shift the focus toward domestic growth and less inequality. But slogans don’t fix broken systems. The government’s heavy hand in production has led to too many factories and not enough healthy demand. BCA Research noted that China’s capital spending is now inefficient, creating deflation and too many unprofitable businesses. Urban growth, aging population, and the tax problem Urbanization might help. About two-thirds of the population lives in cities. In developed countries, it’s closer to 80%. Getting more rural residents into urban jobs and services could help boost spending. But the hukou system — China’s residency permit rules — blocks rural migrants from accessing city benefits. Rhodium Group found that when migrants are fully integrated into city life, their spending jumps by 60%. China’s welfare system is also far behind. It only collects about 1% of GDP from income taxes — way below international standards. Even the United States, a capitalist state, spends more on social programs. Beijing doesn’t want to lean into “welfarism,” as Xi puts it. Aging might actually help though. As more people retire, fewer will be saving, and that could shift money into the economy. Rory said countries like Japan and South Korea hit peak savings when their working-age populations topped out. “Even if policy reforms are ineffective, China is going to save less,” he said. Xi has also been pushing “new quality productive forces” — a phrase nobody outside China uses — to describe the change toward high-end manufacturing. But boosting productivity doesn’t guarantee more consumer demand, especially when workers don’t feel the benefit.

According to the company, after the recent price increase, Short-Term Investors (STH) stopped saving and started distributing their coins. According to Alphractal, the decline in STH supply historically indicates that Bitcoin is approaching major cycle peaks. As the price rises, slowing demand and increasing selling pressure are classic signs of a bull market approaching its end. Currently, the STH Realized Price is at $94,500. This level is considered the last support point for short-term investors before they lose again. On the other hand, the Realized Price of Long-Term Investors (LTH) has reached $33,000 and continues to rise. Related News: Solana (SOL) Makes a Weekend Announcement: New Feature Revealed Alphractal also shared an interesting onchain observation: “Whenever the STH Realized Price broke above the LTH Realized Price, it signaled the start of a new bull market.” Alphractal reminds us that despite the selling tendency of short-term investors, Bitcoin was able to reach all-time highs in a similar environment in 2021. However, according to the company, current macro onchain signals and symmetry in the halving cycle indicate that a significant market correction may begin after October 2025. *This is not investment advice.
