Bitcoin (BTC) has reached new highs before retracing slightly, but investors’ interest in the flagship crypto keeps growing. Ethereum (ETH) has shown mild recovery. At the same time, more people are buying and selling NFTs. However, total sales are down. Bitcoin Reaches New High, Then Falls Bitcoin recently touched a new all-time high of $111,000 before slipping to $108,000. This drop is partly caused by market worries about a 50% tax increase on imports from the EU. Ethereum also rose to $2,700 this week but is now back to over $2,500, according to CoinMarketCap data. The total crypto market is now worth $3.42 trillion, which is higher than last week’s $3.29 trillion. This means more people are investing in crypto, even though NFT sales are slightly lower. NFT Sales Drop, But Participation is Rising. NFT sales dropped by 0.05% this week to $129.8 million. Ethereum is still the top NFT network with $29.6 million in sales, 26.22% less than last week. Wash trading also dropped to $2 million. Even with lower sales , more people are active in the NFT market. NFT buyers increased by 61.18% to 443,548. Sellers went up by 31.87% to 199,129. Total NFT trades also rose by 15.39% to 1,697,343. Avalanche and Polygon See Big Growth While Ethereum still leads in total NFT sales, Avalanche has taken second place with $22.3 million, a jump of 202.92%. Polygon is third with $21.3 million, growing by 45.98%. These chains are becoming strong players in the NFT space. Bitcoin NFTs fell to fourth place with $18.2 million, a 21.85% drop. Solana is now seventh, with $6.4 million in sales, a 26.36% decrease. Meanwhile, more people are buying NFTs on different chains. Avalanche had the most significant buyer growth at 79.08%, followed by Bitcoin at 72.98% and Solana at 71.09%. Furthermore, there has been a big shake-up in Non-Fungible Token collections. XSY Deposit on Avalanche is now the top NFT collection with $22.1 million in sales. However, most of this comes from just one buyer and seller. Courtyard on Polygon is second with $14.4 million in sales, up 23.23%. DMarket is third with $8.8 million, up by 7.07%. Bitcoin’s BRC-20 NFTs are now fourth with $6 million, dropping by 15.78%. Guild of Guardians Heroes is fifth with $5.9 million. CryptoPunks is sixth with $4.8 million in sales. It fell by 30.94%, as it now has fewer trades, fewer buyers, and fewer sellers than before.

This update enhances the network’s appeal for large-scale investors by streamlining infrastructure, increasing security, and enabling more efficient staking and withdrawals. While Ethereum strengthens its position as a blockchain leader, another innovative project is gaining traction in the blockchain and AI sector. Say hello to Ruvi AI, a cutting-edge platform that merges blockchain security with the intelligence of AI to tackle complex problems in today’s industries. Ruvi AI Redefines Blockchain Innovation Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,724.68 and has just released its Pectra upgrade which improves native staking for institutions. This makes the network more attractive for big players by simplifying infrastructure, increasing security and making staking and withdrawals more efficient. While Ethereum is strengthening its position as a blockchain leader another project is gaining traction in the blockchain and AI space. Say hello to Ruvi AI, a platform that combines blockchain security with AI to solve complex problems in today’s industries. Ruvi AI Redefines Blockchain Innovation Ruvi AI is going to disrupt healthcare, finance and logistics by combining the best of AI analytics with blockchain transparency. The goal is to create tools that make better decisions, simplify operations and drive real world impact. The Beta is live and users can access advanced tools for business workflows. Ruvi AI is listing on its first exchange and more to come. This means the platform is serious about getting its solutions out there and establishing itself in the tech world. Presale Success Means Confidence Ruvi AI has already captured the attention of early adopters through its presale. The Phase 1 presale was $0.01 per token and sold out in 2 weeks. Investors who got in early have already seen their token value increase by 50% as the price has risen to $0.015 in Phase 2. Analysts are bullish on Ruvi AI’s long term and many are projecting a $1 token soon after listing. This is a strong sign of confidence in Ruvi AI’s approach. Investment Opportunities Ruvi AI is offering presale bonuses for investors. Here’s what’s on offer: VIP 2 50,000 tokens during presale gets a 40% bonus and adds 20,000 tokens to total 70,000 tokens. This is a $750 investment at $0.015 per token. At listing price of $0.07 the investment would be worth $4,900 and if Ruvi AI reaches $1 per token the value would be $70,000. VIP 3 100,000 tokens gets a 60% bonus and adds 160,000 tokens. A $1,500 investment would be worth $11,200 at listing price of $0.07 and $160,000 if the token hits $1. VIP 5 500,000 tokens gets a 100% bonus and doubles to 1,000,000 tokens. At listing price of $0.07 this is $70,000 and at $1 per token it would be $1,000,000. Building a Community Ruvi AI’s roadmap is not just about technology; it’s about building a community of supporters and contributors. Through a leaderboard program the project rewards engagement: Top 10 contributors get 500,000 tokens each which would be worth $500,000 at $1. Top 50 contributors get 250,000 tokens which would be worth $250,000 at $1. Top 100 contributors get 100,000 tokens which would be worth $100,000 at $1. This encourages active participation and a collaborative ecosystem that benefits all. What’s Next Ruvi AI’s achievements so far show just how much it can shake up the intersection of blockchain and AI. That’s clear from its live Beta platform, its successful presale-and where it’s headed with those upcoming exchange listings. That makes it a project to watch in the tech innovation space. Right now, at $0.015, Ruvi AI is offering early supporters a pretty compelling reason to get in on the ground floor. With a confirmed listing price of $0.07 and the potential to reach $1 per token, the potential for growth is huge. Ethereum leads the way in blockchain advancements with updates like Pectra but Ruvi AI is showing how blockchain and AI can work together to create solutions that are both scalable and efficient.

While the world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, reached a new all-time high, LTC failed to capitalize on the injection of bullish momentum into the crypto market. However, a prominent crypto expert has come forward with a claim that Litecoin might be the most undervalued asset in the market at the moment. Interestingly, the altcoin’s price seems set to enjoy a period of strong bullish impetus over the next few months. Here’s Why LTC Price Could Be Set For An Extended Rally Chartered Market Technician Tony Severino has put forward an exciting prediction for the price trajectory of Litecoin in the coming months. According to the crypto expert, the digital asset could be preparing for an extended bull rally of at least 1,000% — and up to 2,000% — price growth. Related Reading: Traders Pile In: Bitcoin Open Interest Hits All-Time High As Price Nears $112K This bullish projection is based on the movement of the Stochastic Oscillator on the 3-month LTC price chart. The Stochastic Oscillator is an indicator used in technical analysis to gauge price momentum and pinpoint potential trend reversals. The indicator is usually represented by two lines: %K and %D. %K is a faster line while %D is a smoothed moving average of %K, and they both oscillate between 0 and 100. When the Stochastic Oscillator falls below 20, it implies an oversold market; while values above 80 often indicate an overbought market. According to Severino, the Litecoin 3-month Stochastic is approaching the 50 mark, which signals rising bullish sentiment for the altcoin’s price. The indicator failed the last time it attempted to cross this level in 2021. However, the successful breach of this 50 mark is still historically significant, as it has marked the start of substantial bull rallies in the past. For instance, the altcoin’s price grew by 4,900% when the Litecoin Stochastic crossed the level in 2017. Severino noted that it is highly unlikely for the price of Litecoin to surge by nearly 5,000% from its current level if the Stochastic Oscillator crosses the 50 level. Nevertheless, the market expert believes the asset’s price could rise by at least 1,000% and up to 2,000% by the end of 2026. Finally, Severino mentioned that the Litecoin price is in an interesting place, with the asset being one of the most undervalued crypto assets at the moment. Litecoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of LTC stands at around $96, reflecting an over 5% decline in the past 24 hours.

The event was held for holders of his meme coin, who collectively spent $148 million just to attend. Guests were promised access, luxury, and a moment with Trump. What they got instead was bad food, weak security, and a brief fly-by appearance from the president himself. According to CNBC , it was a night that left many attendees frustrated — and some outright angry. Among the 220 people who showed up were crypto figures like Sandy Carter from Unstoppable Domains and former NBA star Lamar Odom, who used the occasion to promote his own token, $ODOM. Trump showed up, said a few words, and left in a helicopter without greeting most of the room. One guest, 25-year-old Nicholas Pinto, said , “He didn’t talk to any of the 220 guests — maybe the top 25.” Pinto added that he had nothing to drink besides Trump-branded wine or water. “I don’t drink, so I had water. My glass was only filled once,” he said. As for the food? “The food sucked,” he said plainly. Guests ignored, wallets tracked, and complaints everywhere The top 25 wallets were promised a special reception and tour. But others like Pinto — who was driven there in a Lamborghini by his dad — left unimpressed and hungry. Trump only stayed 23 minutes, gave a quick speech recycling old crypto lines, then flew off without taking pictures or answering any questions. Pinto noticed that phones were not locked in RFID pouches and said security became an afterthought once Trump was gone. “Once Trump left, they didn’t really worry about anything else,” he said. Inside the ballroom, guests flaunted money. “Richard Mille watches weren’t even rare,” Pinto said. “I saw at least 16 people wearing them.” But he said the energy was off. “Lots of people didn’t even hold the coin anymore. They were checking their phones during dinner to see if the price moved.” Outside the gates, about 100 protesters gathered. One of them was Senator Jeff Merkley, who showed up to support a new bill with Chuck Schumer. The bill — called the End Crypto Corruption Act — aims to stop presidents and high officials from profiting off crypto ventures while in office. Protesters held signs saying “Crypto Corruption” and “Trump is a traitor.” Inside the event, the #1 holder of the $TRUMP coin was Justin Sun, the Chinese-born crypto billionaire. Justin holds over $22 million in the $TRUMP token and $75 million in World Liberty Financial’s token. He’s currently facing SEC fraud charges, although the case has been paused. Justin didn’t seem worried though. “As the top holder of $TRUMP and proud supporter of President Trump, it was an honor to attend the Trump Gala Dinner,” he posted. “Thank you @POTUS for your unwavering support of our industry!” The chaos around the dinner added fuel to what’s becoming a mess on Capitol Hill. Representative French Hill, a Republican from Arkansas, said the Trump family’s involvement in meme coins is “making his work in Congress harder.” Hill is one of the lawmakers behind the GENIUS Act, a bill designed to finally regulate stablecoins. But now, with Trump’s name tied to controversial tokens, he says the gala was “a distraction from the good work we need to do.” The GENIUS Act now faces a serious risk. Senator Josh Hawley added a clause that would limit credit card late fees, which banks hate. It’s now being called a poison pill that could kill support for the whole thing. While the gala was happening, Senate Democrats said they would push for new rules blocking US presidents and top officials from profiting off crypto — a direct challenge to USD1, a stablecoin linked to Trump and launched this spring. If the bill collapses, the damage could go global. JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Citi are reportedly in early discussions about building a US digital dollar. Their plan is to compete with Tether, which now dominates 60% of global crypto transactions. But those banks are waiting for legal clarity. If the GENIUS Act doesn’t pass, the US could lose momentum in the international crypto race.

Data from leading European alternative asset manager CoinShares revealed that inflows into Ethereum hit $205 million, marking a major increase from the previously reported $1.5 million. James Butterfill, a researcher at CoinShares , explained that the new development might be directly tied to Ethereum’s recent Pectra upgrade and the recent appointment of a new co-executive director as part of its leadership reshuffling process. “Ethereum was the standout performer, with US$205m in inflows last week and $575 million YTD, indicating renewed investor optimism following the successful Pectra upgrade and the appointment of new co-executive director Tomasz Stańczak,” The researcher wrote. Meanwhile, the broader cryptocurrency market saw inflows hit a staggering $785 million the previous week. The new metric, significantly topping outflows recorded earlier in the year, particularly between February and March, suggests that the market has been recovering steadily. Notably, year-to-date cryptocurrency inflows (YTD) have hit an impressive total of $7.5 billion. Despite the new figures marking a drop from last week’s total inflow of $882 million, the United States remarkably outperformed Hong Kong and Germany, which saw inflows totaling $24.2 million and $86.2 million, respectively. Acknowledging the mild decline in Bitcoin inflows recorded in the last week, CoinShare’s James Butterfill made the following assertion in the report: “Bitcoin attracted $557 million in inflows, a decrease from the prior week, likely due to continued hawkish signals from the US Federal Reserve. Short-bitcoin products saw a fourth consecutive week of inflows, totaling $5.8 million, reflecting investor positioning amid recent price gains.” With last week’s development reflecting five consecutive weeks of positive inflows, it remains to be seen how much the positive sentiment can grow and how much the current trend could influence price action for Bitcoin and altcoins alike.",Ethereum|News|Ethereum News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-24 21:04:41

However, according to the analyst, a key signal that a bearish formation is in play could be if the 21 exponential moving average (EMA) experiences a bearish cross with the 33 Simple moving average (SMA) on the weekly chart. “The top was in, and we’re heading into a bear market. Many will still believe we’re advancing, but that cross signals a major trend shift.” He asserted. Taking a step further, the analyst outlined key historical trends validating a potential bearish outcome for the altcoin. In May 2018 and November 2021, the crosses mentioned above were observed on the XRP chart, after which an 87% and 72% drop in price value was recorded. If the average cross movement is considered, the analyst sees the next major drop sending XRP down by 79.5% from the bearish cross point. Conversely, the analyst highlighted other bullish possibilities, stating that the aforementioned bullish patterns displayed in XRP’s technical chart could trigger another price rally for the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This anticipated bull run could send XRP way ahead of its $3.84 all-time high and instead place the asset at a never-before-seen price value of $27 . “Based on these bullish signals, I believe XRP could see another major pump—similar to the 1600% move—this time pushing us toward around $27 from the current level.” The analyst wrote. Despite recording a 5% decline in price value over the last week, XRP has managed to sustain momentum above $2.

With Ethereum and Avalanche also showing positive momentum amid recent news, the crypto market is heating up and Solana has hit $176, reflecting renewed confidence and setting the stage for a breakout summer—and MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the standout presale of 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Explosive Presale, 50% Bonus, and 9,800% Upside CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to dominate early-stage watchlists, with Stage 8 live and record buy volume as investors rush to secure positions before listings. The project’s scarcity-driven model, capped supply, and HashEx-audited contracts provide a secure foundation for growth. Analysts are forecasting up to 9,800% upside, with on-chain data showing skyrocketing wallet activity and repeat buyers signaling strong conviction in the project’s long-term trajectory. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the clear standout for early-stage returns . Early participants can now use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% bonus on token purchases, making MAGA even more attractive for those targeting transformative gains. Solana (SOL): Bullish Momentum and Technical Strength Solana has surged from $100 to $176 since April, with technical indicators like RSI and MACD signaling sustained momentum and possible further gains. Analysts predict a potential move toward $200–$210 if bullish sentiment holds, especially as network activity and DeFi TVL continue to rise. Even with this strong performance, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers higher-multiple upside for early investors. Ethereum (ETH): Surge in Capital Inflows and Price Momentum Ethereum recently saw a dramatic 8.2% price surge in 24 hours, reaching $3,850 as trading volume spiked by 35% to $18.5 billion. This influx is attributed to institutional interest and a broader risk-on sentiment in tech markets, with ETH now testing resistance at $3,900. While Ethereum remains a core holding for DeFi and Web3, its near-term upside is steady compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Avalanche (AVAX): Ecosystem Growth and Price Outlook CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Avalanche is trading around $24–$25, with bullish patterns and strong DeFi activity hinting at continued growth. Analysts see AVAX potentially reaching $30–$56 in a bullish scenario, but its trajectory is steadier than the presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which stands out as the top pick for outsized returns . Conclusion Solana’s rise to $176 and the surge in Ethereum and Avalanche are impressive, but the real excitement is in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearing completion, a 9,800% upside forecast, and the PATRIOT50X 50% bonus still available, MAGA is the breakout contender for 2025.

The first batch of brain chips is expected to arrive in late 2025. The company, incorporated in 2019, published its first blog post about the new brain chip, positioning itself as a new competitor to Elon Musk’s Neuralink. Starfish stated that the custom electrophysiology chip will interact with multiple brain regions simultaneously. This means that the chip will read and write to connected parts of the brain, making it possible to help people with neurological disorders. Starfish is making a miniaturized brain chip Most existing brain chips are fairly bulky. Each side usually measures more than 5 mm (about the width of two stacked pennies) and may reach 10 mm or more per side. In addition, such chips consume a high power of 10s of milliwatts (mW). Starfish stated that the upcoming brain chip will be miniaturized, making it much smaller than expected. The chip will have physically small dimensions of 2 x 4 millimeter (mm) and a 0.3 mm-pitch Ball Grid Array (BGA) package. A BGA is simply a type of chip carrier used for integrated circuits (ICs). In terms of power consumption, the chip will operate at an ultra-low power range. During normal recording of brain spikes, the chip will consume a total of 1.1 milliwatts (mW). This is equivalent to powering a single LED or a low-power temperature sensor. By having a tiny chip that consumes ultra-low power, Starfish aims to reduce the surgical impact of brain implants. Other features include recording neural spikes and local field potentials (LFPs), which are the slower, smoother voltage fluctuations in the brain. Moreover, the chip will stimulate the brain by sending tiny electric pulses that go positive and then negative, known as biphasic pulses. The chip will also include 32 electrode sites that interface directly with brain tissue. It will record from 16 of these sites simultaneously. Each active channel samples at 18.75 kHz to capture rapid neural spikes and waveforms with high precision. There will be one current source for stimulating any pair of electrodes. Also, the brain chip will monitor impedance and measure voltage transients onboard. It will process data digitally, detect spikes in real-time, and transmit relevant data over low-bandwidth wireless links. The chip will be fabricated using TSMC’s 55 nm process for optimal size and efficiency. Starfish announced that it is “interested in finding collaborators for whom such a chip would open new and exciting avenues.” The company is looking for people who work in fields like wireless communications or people who design custom implanted neural interfaces. However, any person who believes the brain chip is useful to their field of work is welcome to collaborate. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Yet among these giants, a new coin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is turning heads with its explosive potential. The fifth phase of Mutuum Finance presale continues as this high-growth altcoin sells at $0.03 and has collected $9.1 million. The next stage of the presale will boost MUTM’s price to $0.035 while attracting more than 11,000 investors. This phase’s investors will receive a 100% profit when the launch price reaches $0.06. For investors looking beyond SOL, ETH and XRP, MUTM could be a pivotal play in the 2025 crypto boom. For investors searching for the best altcoin to buy now, MUTM is shaping up to be one of the top cryptocurrencies to watch. Ethereum, Solana, and XRP Gear Up for 2025 Altcoin Season Surge Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Ripple’s XRP all enter 2025 with a lot of steam behind them, each one backed by niche fundamentals that will catalyze massive gains during the next altseason. Ethereum, currently trading at approximately $2,496, will probably break through the $10,000 mark with scaling enhancements like Pectra that cut through inefficiencies in its network. Solana, trading around $166, is rapidly emerging as a fast, inexpensive network powering DeFi and meme coins, and that’s where bullish projections believe it has a chance to break out to $500. XRP, in the meantime, remains an anchor for cross-border payments, and regulatory news in its favor can finally push it up to $5 from its current position at $2.35. While these giants prepare for liftoff, new tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are picking up steam with the capability of outperforming in ROI. A DeFi Giant on the Rise Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 11,000 investors have joined the presale funding to support the project which has received $9.1 million in total. Mutuum Finance’s price has currently reached $0.03 in Phase 5 even though investors anticipate a 16.67% price increase in Phase 6 which will generate considerable profit potential. Analysts forecast MUTM to surge beyond $5 in upcoming months when it launches at $0.06 because its distinctive lending approach meets rising market requirements thus making it an underappreciated yet promising DeFi resource. The Dual-Model System for Enhanced DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts. The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi. Driving Community Growth with Investor Rewards To attract more community members Mutuum Finance implements profitable incentive programs at an aggressive pace. The program will use $100,000 to give ten investors $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and the referral system gives rewards to users who bring in new investors to the platform. The platform gives early supporters exclusive benefits including VIP-exclusive updates to enhance their connection with the platform. Mutuum Finance is quickly gaining momentum with over $9.1 million raised and 11,000+ investors buying in at $0.03 during its presale. With a projected 100% profit at the $0.06 launch price and a forecasted surge beyond $5, MUTM presents a compelling alternative to Ethereum, Solana, and XRP in the 2025 altcoin season. Its innovative dual lending model combines automated liquidity pools with direct peer-to-peer loans, maximizing yield and decentralization. Backed by strong community incentives and transparent governance, Mutuum Finance is well-positioned to outperform established players and capture significant market share in the coming months.

Cardano is now inching toward $0.76, signaling renewed confidence among investors, but it is MAGACOIN FINANCE that is rewriting the playbook for early-stage success in 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Unprecedented Presale Momentum and 13,000% Upside CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing the imagination of the crypto community, with Stage 8 attracting record participation from both retail and institutional buyers. The project’s innovative tokenomics—a fixed supply, rigorous audits, and a compelling narrative—are setting a new benchmark for presale projects. Early backers can leverage the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code to secure a 50% bonus, amplifying the appeal for those seeking exponential gains. Analysts are now pointing to a potential 13,000% upside, fueled by robust on-chain activity and a rapidly expanding investor base. In a market hungry for innovation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the frontrunner for outsized early-stage returns . Cardano (ADA): Testing Resistance and Building Momentum Cardano is trading just shy of $0.76, with technical indicators hinting at a possible breakout if buying pressure persists. Recent developments in the ecosystem, including new DeFi integrations and partnerships, are bolstering sentiment. While ADA’s fundamentals remain solid, its growth trajectory is more gradual compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which continues to set the pace for early-stage excitement. XRP: Institutional Interest and Price Resilience XRP is holding steady above $2.35, supported by ongoing regulatory progress and growing institutional interest. Market watchers are eyeing a potential move toward $2.85–$3.40 if bullish trends continue, with some forecasts even suggesting higher targets by year-end. Despite its strong position, XRP’s upside is outpaced by the dynamic growth and presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE, making MAGA the preferred choice for those seeking rapid appreciation. Bitcoin (BTC): Stability and Institutional Backing Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of the crypto market, trading above $110,000 with strong institutional backing and ETF inflows. Analysts anticipate a potential push toward $115,000 if current momentum holds, but the scale of BTC’s market cap means its growth is now more measured. In contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a unique opportunity for investors to participate in a project still in its formative stages, with far greater upside potential. Hedera (HBAR): Steady Progress and Future Prospects Hedera is consolidating near $0.21, with technicals indicating a period of stability after recent gains. Analysts are optimistic about a move toward $0.25–$0.30 in the coming months, but the pace of growth is expected to be steady rather than explosive. For those seeking the next major breakout, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the clear leader for high-growth early-stage investments. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion Cardano’s approach to $0.76 and the steady performance of XRP, Bitcoin, and Hedera are noteworthy, but the spotlight is firmly on MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearing completion, a 13,000% growth path, and the PATRIOT50X 50% bonus still available, MAGA is the breakout opportunity of 2025.

Crypto community sounds alarm about Ledger phishing letter scam Industry executives and crypto community members are raising the alarm about a new phishing scam in the form of physical letters sent to crypto holders made to look like communication from the Ledger hardware wallet company.

Judge overturns fraud convictions in Mango Markets exploit case A US federal judge has vacated key fraud and manipulation convictions against Avraham Eisenberg, the trader at the center of the case involving a $110 million exploit of the decentralized exchange Mango Markets. On Friday, US District Judge Arun Subramanian ruled that the evidence presented at trial failed to support the jury’s conclusion that Eisenberg made materially false representations to Mango Markets. The decision vacates Eisenberg’s convictions for commodities fraud and market manipulation and acquits him of a third charge, significantly weakening the government’s case. Eisenberg, a self-proclaimed “applied game theorist,” was convicted in 2024 for artificially inflating the price of Mango’s MNGO token by over 1,300% in a matter of minutes and using the resulting gains as collateral to withdraw $110 million in crypto assets from the platform.

After reaching a 24-hour high of $3.9599, the pair encountered strong resistance, triggering a sharp pullback. SUI’s rejection has led to a notable 6.64% decline over the past day, raising questions about whether SUI can stabilize or if further downside is ahead. SUI Uptrend Peaks At $4.20 Before Sharp Reversal MAB’s recent analysis highlights that from May 20 to May 23, SUI experienced a clear uptrend, marked by consistently higher highs and higher lows. The steady upward movement peaked around the $4.20 level, reflecting strong bullish momentum during that period. Related Reading: SUI Preparing For Another Leg Up – Is $5 The Next Target? However, shortly after reaching its peak, SUI faced a sharp reversal. Large red candles appeared on the chart, indicating heavy selling pressure and a rapid loss of value. This sudden downturn from the recent highs caught many by surprise, with profit-taking triggering fears in the market. Volume analysis further supports this narrative. There was a notable spike in volume at the peak and during the sell-off, showing strong market participation in the decline. Currently, trading volume remains elevated at around 462.57 million USDT, which indicates continued activity. SUI is now testing a critical support zone between $3.6000 and $3.6500. A break below this area might pave the way for further losses, pushing the price down to the 24-hour low near $3.5233 or even lower. Market Sentiment: Fear Or Opportunity? Crypto Man MAB elaborated on the market dynamics by pointing out clear bearish signals alongside potential bullish opportunities. He noted that the sharp decline from the $4.20 peak and the inability to maintain levels above $3.8000 signal that bearish momentum is dominating. This is supported by the 7-day performance, which shows a 5.62% drop, underscoring the prevailing short-term weakness. Related Reading: SUI Hype Grows As Price Action Points To A Rally: $4 Level In Focus On the bullish side, the analyst pointed out that if the crucial $3.6000 support level holds firm, there could be a rebound toward $3.8000, a previous resistance turned into a support level. This support could encourage SUI buyers to re-enter the market, setting the stage for upward movement. Looking beyond the immediate fluctuations, the analyst emphasized that the 30-day gain of 20.29% and the 90-day gain of 5.90% reflect an overall positive trend for SUI. Despite recent setbacks, this suggests that a sustained recovery remains possible if buying pressure strengthens. To sum up, he highlighted that SUI stands at a crucial crossroads, and a drop below the $3.6000 support could lead to additional downside pressure. However, a strong bounce from this zone might pave the way for a recovery supported by increasing volume, whereas growing volume on a decline would reinforce the bearish outlook.

45058615,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=734277,1748126574,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45058615.jpeg,"Dubai picks XRP Ledger for real estate tokenization as 3,000 investors register",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/dubai-picks-xrp-ledger-for-real-estate-tokenization-as-3000-investors-register/,"More than 3,000 investors have registered for Dubai’s flagship real estate tokenization program. Mahmoud AlBurai, a senior executive at the Dubai Land Department (DLD), disclosed this in a post on LinkedIn. According to AlBurai , the massive number of participants who have joined the waitlist highlights their interest in the project. The real estate tokenization project is the first in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. With the pilot launched on March 16, the DLD partnered with Prypco Mint and Ctrl Alt to tokenize ownership deeds of real estate properties owned by the government. The department now plans to offer fractional ownership of these properties to investors. Presently, only holders of an Emirates Card, i.e., official residents of the United Arab Emirates, can participate in the program. Despite the eligibility limit, many investors have shown interest in the project. This is likely because several regulators are playing key roles in the actualization of the project. Beyond the DLD, the Dubai Future Foundation, Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), and the Central Bank of UAE are also involved, giving potential investors confidence in the project. While the project remains in the early stages, DLD already has big projections. In its earlier announcement, it predicted that it could become a $16 billion market by 2033, noting the effectiveness, transparency, and accessibility that blockchain could enable for the real estate market. Dubai picks XRPL to tokenize real estate assets Interestingly, Dubai chose Ripple’s XRP Ledger as the blockchain for tokenizing the deeds. According to AlBurai, XRPL is the pilot phase network. This has led to speculations as to whether XRPL would be the only choice or if it plans to expand to other networks. For now, the choice of XRPL represents a momentous milestone for the blockchain network. While it has seen minimal activity compared to other major smart contract networks, its use for the project represents an opportunity to show its ability for tokenization. Ripple has been actively pushing for tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) on XRPL. Last year, it invested $5 million into a tokenized money market fund on XRPL by UK-based firm Abrdn while investing $10 million into tokenized US treasury bills by OpenEden after the platform launched on XRPL. With real estate tokenization entering the mix, XRPL looks poised for more institutional adoption. Ripple recently secured a payments provider license from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) and has started onboarding institutions into its payments service, which is enabled through XRPL. UAE could emerge as a leader in real estate tokenization Meanwhile, the DLD Tokenization Project, while still in the pilot phase, could allow the UAE to become a pioneer in the real estate tokenization sector. While tokenization of RWA has become one of the most exciting sectors globally, most financial institutions and regulators are currently focused on tokenization of financial products such as securities and bonds. This means that the real estate sector has seen limited tokenization efforts, allowing Dubai to dominate with its Real Estate Tokenization Sandbox. So far, the UAE has seen about $3 billion worth of real estate assets tokenized, according to local reports . Interestingly, regulatory involvement in the Dubai real estate tokenization efforts could also prove to be an advantage after a recent lawsuit by the US Securities and Exchange Commission against real estate tokenization company Unicoin executives. The SEC alleged in the lawsuit that Unicoin, which claimed to own several tokenized estate properties, did not own any of the assets and inflated their value. It added that the firm also misled investors about returns and exaggerated sales. With the lawsuit likely to shake investors’ confidence in the tokenized real estate sector, a government-backed project with regulatory support from several agencies could be an alternative to private projects.

Ethereum is steadily climbing, while Bitcoin’s robust rally above $111,000 is fueling optimism across the board. In this environment, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE and established assets such as XRP are emerging as top contenders for outsized gains—offering strategic entry points for those willing to act before major catalysts unfold. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Unrivaled Presale Momentum and 10,500% Upside JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly establishing itself as the breakout presale of 2025 , drawing unprecedented demand from both retail and institutional investors. With over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearing completion, the project’s capped supply, audited contracts, and viral political narrative are driving a surge in participation. Early backers can now use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code to secure a 50% bonus on token purchases, amplifying the opportunity for transformative gains. Analysts are projecting up to 10,500% upside, with some models even suggesting a $1 valuation by year-end if momentum continues. In a market hungry for innovation, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the clear leader for early-stage returns. Ethereum (ETH): Steady Climb and Institutional Adoption Ethereum is trading between $2,400 and $2,900, with bullish technicals and ongoing upgrades supporting its long-term outlook. The network’s recent Layer 2 expansion and anticipation of ETF approvals are fueling institutional interest, with analysts forecasting a potential move toward $4,000–$6,000 by late 2025. While Ethereum remains a core holding for DeFi and Web3, its near-term upside is steady compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Regulatory Clarity and Price Resilience XRP is consolidating above $2.30, buoyed by regulatory clarity, CME futures speculation, and significant whale accumulation. Analysts forecast a move toward $2.41 in June, with some bullish scenarios targeting $5 and beyond if ETF approvals and adoption accelerate. Despite its strong fundamentals, XRP’s growth trajectory is steady—underscoring why MAGACOIN FINANCE is the preferred choice for those seeking rapid appreciation. Bitcoin (BTC): Institutional Strength and Price Range Bitcoin is trading above $111,000, with analysts predicting a range of $110,000–$115,000 for May and potential highs of $140,000 if bullish momentum sustains. Institutional inflows and ETF demand are reinforcing BTC’s dominance, but its upside is now more measured—making MAGACOIN FINANCE the clear destination for investors targeting higher-growth opportunities. Litecoin (LTC): Steady Performance and Market Position Litecoin is trading near $82, with recent volatility following news of a delayed ETF decision. Analysts expect LTC to reach up to $92.69 in May, but its growth is gradual and its market position remains subdued compared to the explosive presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which continues to set the standard for early-stage excitement. CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE Conclusion Ethereum’s steady gains and XRP’s bullish momentum are noteworthy, but the real excitement is in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearing completion, a 10,500% upside forecast, and the PATRIOT50X 50% bonus still available, MAGA is the breakout contender for 2025. Bitcoin and Litecoin provide stability, but for those seeking the next crypto supercycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands as the defining early-stage opportunity.

While Bitcoin and Injective maintain their appeal among institutional players, market participants are increasingly drawn to the dynamic potential of early-stage projects—with MAGACOIN FINANCE at the forefront. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Surge, Whale Activity, and 50% Bonus JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE is commanding attention as its Stage 8 presale progresses, amassing over $8 million in contributions. The initiative’s capped supply, rigorous auditing by HashEx, and compelling narrative are driving unprecedented engagement. Traders are noting accumulation patterns that echo previous cycle breakouts, while analysts project returns between 25x and 35x, with some models even suggesting up to 18,500% gains if current trends persist. Early supporters can access a 50% token bonus via the exclusive PATRIOT50X code, further enhancing MAGA’s allure for those pursuing rapid appreciation. Each new phase sparks heightened activity and enthusiasm, solidifying MAGACOIN FINANCE as the community’s breakout contender for the coming year . Bitcoin (BTC): Institutional Demand and Market Leadership Bitcoin continues to anchor the market, hovering near $111,500 amid robust institutional inflows and optimistic technical signals. Forecasts indicate BTC could test $121,000 by late May, yet its more stable trajectory is prompting savvy participants to diversify into high-growth alternatives—where MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the preferred choice for outsized returns. XRP: Steady Performance and Shifting Trader Focus XRP remains resilient at $2.37, consolidating after recent advances. While regulatory clarity and ETF speculation keep sentiment positive, short-term volatility has led to a rotation of interest among holders. Many are now directing attention and capital toward early-stage ventures such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is rapidly becoming the most talked-about opportunity in online trading circles. Ethereum (ETH): Technical Rebound and Community Sentiment Ethereum has rebounded to $2,489, reflecting a 4% intraday gain and signs of renewed momentum. Despite its strong fundamentals and institutional adoption, ETH’s appreciation is outpaced by the excitement surrounding MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is now the focal point for traders seeking the next major breakout. Injective (INJ): Consistent Growth and Emerging Trends Injective trades near $17.74, with analysts predicting a rise to $18.56 in June as DeFi activity expands. Although INJ’s growth is steady, its presence in trading discussions is overshadowed by the surging popularity of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which continues to dominate as the most trending asset across crypto communities. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Trading forums are agog with MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has overtaken XRP and Ethereum in both conversation and sentiment. With Stage 8 nearing completion, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst projections up to 18,500% ROI, MAGA is the undisputed early-stage standout for 2025.

According to a report from SCMP citing HSBC official statements, the settlement service allows the conversion of bank cash deposits into digital tokens on the blockchain. This will allow the bank’s corporate customers to make real-time payments using US Dollars (USD) and Hong Kong Dollars (HKD). The service is expected to reduce the cost of client transactions and ensure that payment can happen within a shorter period and at all times. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) supported the initiative through its Supervisory Incubator for Distributed Ledger Technology. Speaking on the achievement, HSBC’s global head of domestic and emerging payments for global payments solution, Lewis Sun, said it can improve payments and cash management. Sun said: “Tokenised deposits, when supported by regulated financial institutions, can offer a safe and fully compliant approach to improving payments and cash management for [companies].” The service already has its first user, with Alibaba affiliate Ant International using it for an instant fund transfer. Ant noted in a separate press release that the pilot test of the product using Ant’s blockchain-based global treasury management platform, the Whale. HSBC integrated the experience from the pilot testing into the tokenized deposit service before the full launch. Currently, the service is only available in Hong Kong, but HSBC plans to expand it to other countries in Asia and Europe by the year’s second half. Big banks are embracing tokenization Meanwhile, the launch of the tokenized deposits is only another step in the long-term tokenization plan for HSBC. The bank launched gold tokenization as far back as 2023 and plans to use the blockchain network and technologies to create a new digital transfer and settlement infrastructure. Part of its planned use cases include digital currency settlements and other forms of tokenization. The bank has been exploring various uses of digital ledger technologies with initiatives such as tokenized bonds, the Orion blockchain platform, and several others. However, it is not alone; several other major banks and financial institutions have identified tokenization as the next frontier for the financial markets. Institutions such as BlackRock, JP Morgan, Visa, Mastercard, and others are all exploring the incorporation of tokenization into payments and financial markets. Several banks, including Bank of America, Euroclear, and Italian Central Bank, also recently tapped Solana as a tokenization layer after developer R3 partnered with Solana Foundation to connect its private blockchain Corda to the public network. The massive interest in the sector from every stakeholder, both traditional institutions and fintech companies, explains why researchers predict it could be worth $30 trillion by 2030. Hong Kong status as digital finance hub increases Meanwhile, HSBC’s choice of Hong Kong to launch the tokenized deposit service highlights how the city has become a major hub for global financial innovation. Hong Kong has been active in its efforts to attract financial technology and digital assets companies with regulatory clarity and government-banked initiatives. Unsurprisingly, the tokenized deposit service is a product of one of such initiatives, with HSBC being one of the key participants in Phase 2 of the city’s e-HKD Pilot Program. The program focuses on banks experimenting with how tokenized fiat currencies can be used in digital asset transactions. The bank has also been involved in HKMA projects such as mBridge and Ensemble. Interestingly, Hong Kong also recently passed a Stablecoin bill that expands its regulatory framework for digital assets by requiring all stablecoin issuers to get a license from the HKMA. The government claims that the new law, which is expected to come into force this year, will provide financial stability while encouraging innovation.

As the summer bull run of 2025 approaches, the spotlight is on SUI and Solana . Which of these cryptocurrencies holds the key to maximum gains? The answer could shape investment strategies in the coming months. Dive in to discover which coin is poised for significant growth. SUI’s Rapid Surge with Attractive Trading Levels SUI experienced a notable 44.75% gain over the past month and a solid 12.53% increase over the last six months. The coin's price behavior changed from slow and steady movements to a pronounced surge recently, indicating a rise in buyer interest and active trading participation. This shift from modest growth to a rapid upward trend highlights the evolving dynamics in its market performance. Currently, SUI’s price fluctuates between $2.19 and $4.34, with support at $0.88 and resistance at $5.19. Bulls maintain strength within this range, but mixed momentum signals suggest caution. Trading strategies could involve buying near the support level and targeting exits as the price approaches resistance while closely monitoring to mitigate risk. Solana Price Trends and Key Levels Over the last month, Solana showed strong upward movement with a 20.92% price gain, while over the past six months it experienced a downturn of nearly 29.28%. Price activity has been volatile, with significant positive movement in the short term counterbalanced by longer downturns. Historical data suggests periods of rapid recovery followed by marked corrections, emphasizing a fluctuating pattern in the coin’s performance. Current trading shows Solana in a range between $109.63 and $171.27. Immediate resistance stands at $194.93, with a secondary level at $256.57, while support appears at $71.65 and then at $10.01. Indicators like a 64.57 RSI combined with a slight negative momentum hint at cautious bullish control. Trades within these levels may favor buyers if prices hold above support and clear resistance is eventually breached. Conclusion SUI has shown solid performance and has promising technology, while SOL has a robust track record and strong community support. SUI may offer higher growth potential due to its innovative solutions and newer presence. SOL remains a reliable choice with established infrastructure and partnerships. Diversifying investments between both could balance the portfolio. Final decisions should align with individual investment goals and risk tolerance.

Amid this market downturn, popular market analyst CasiTrades has stated that XRP lies in danger of a further decline should a particular support level fail. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Above Key Prices – Data Points To $2,900 Level As Bullish Trigger XRP Must Avoid Crash Below $2.25 – $2.26 As Bitcoin prices reached a new all-time high in the past week, XRP followed suit, reaching as high as $2.45 before experiencing a price rejection driven by negative macroeconomic pressure due to the new international tariffs by the US Government. In the day, XRP price notably declined by over 5% from $2.45 to $2.33 before finding some stability to enter a sideways movement as seen in the last few hours. According to CasiTrades, XRP’s rejection aligns with a 1:1 Fibonacci extension of the corrective C-wave pattern in the Elliott Wave Theory, signaling the possible exhaustion of the previous relief rally seen earlier in the week. Notably, the analyst warns that XRP’s decline may lead to a retest of “major structural support” at the $2.25 – $2.26 price zone, which aligns with the Fibonacci retracement level 0.382. CasiTrades explains that Fib 0.382 has represented a key technical price level over the past six months. Therefore, a price break below this level could trigger deeper corrections, forcing XRP’s price as low as $1.55 – $1.90, a price move that would wipe out all price gains that have been recorded since the crypto market uptrend resumed in early April. However, if the $2.25 – $2.26 support zone holds, such market resilience could trigger a new price rally to around $2.70 and beyond. Thereafter, XRP is likely to return to the local peak of the current bull run at $3.84.

However, the altcoin is up by 9.77% in the past month, reflecting that the majority of new market entrants are still in profit. In other positive news, Volatility shares launched an XRP futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) on May 22. It is a 1x fund, indicating that it would track the daily performance of XRP futures contracts with no leverage. With a total market cap of $233.58 billion, XRP remains the 4th largest cryptocurrency and third-largest altcoin in the market.

Aptos (APT): Price Consolidation and Future Potential Aptos is consolidating around $4.09, with forecasts suggesting a trading range of $2.79 to $5.38 for May 2025.

Yet the fact that almost everyone can name a digital coin shows that Singapore’s trading scene is maturing. Singaporean Investors are increasing their XRP holdings.👇 https://t.co/ydq9PGwmXj pic.twitter.com/aK9H85ZVwb — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 22, 2025 XRP Ownership On The Rise Based on reports from Milieu Insight Market Research, XRP saw one of the strongest gains among altcoins. It now represents 17% of crypto holdings in Singapore, up from 14% last year. Ethereum grew even more, climbing from 41% to 48%. Solana ticked up from 17% to 19%, while Dogecoin rose only 1 point, from 18% to 19%. Still, XRP’s 3-point boost hints at growing trust in its payment-focused design. Monthly Investments Varied Widely Investors in Singapore are not all spending the same amount each month. About 57% put in less than $500. Another 29% contribute between $500 and $1,000. Only 10% dedicate more than $1,000 each month to steadier “dollar-cost averaging.” Those figures suggest that most people treat crypto as a side play rather than a full-time career. Stablecoin Trends And RLUSD Stablecoins are also part of the mix. Roughly 46% of respondents said they own—or once owned—these US-pegged assets. Of that group, 21% hold them now, while 25% have moved on. Eighty-three percent prefer USD-pegged coins. In that context, Ripple’s new RLUSD has reached a $310 million market cap in just a few months. Ripple’s APAC managing director, Fiona Murray, said the coin is not just for trading but also for cross-border payments and DeFi work.

Businesses worldwide had no choice but to quickly change how they manage supply chains, plan pricing, and choose global partners. Companies relying on overseas factories had to pass the new costs on to customers, find new suppliers in other countries, or figure out how to work with a confusing and constantly changing tariff system that made every shipment more expensive and difficult to track. Many businesses realized that their old systems weren’t fast or smart enough to handle all the changes because tariff laws could now shift overnight and expose their operations to risks they couldn’t predict. AI has become a lifeline for companies to understand their supply chains, reduce their tariff exposure, and find new ways to cut costs. Trump started a trade fight, and companies turned to AI Donald Trump’s administration introduced tariffs that made global trade more tense and unpredictable for companies that had spent decades building international supply chains. The Trump tariffs affected electric vehicles and batteries , while others targeted raw materials, machinery, consumer electronics, and simple goods like textiles and furniture. Since the US customs system has more than 20,000 product categories, each one could face a different rate or rule depending on the country of origin and trade status. This uncertainty forced companies to go back and analyze thousands of product categories, track long Harmonized Tariff Schedule codes, and figure out which parts of their inventory were now affected. Businesses quickly needed smarter tools to read tariff schedules, track product codes, analyze costs, and react instantly to customs office updates. So, they turned to artificial intelligence to survive a new era of fast, deep, and unpredictable tariffs. Companies turned to AI to keep up with tariffs Companies discovered that AI could read huge volumes of complex documents, connect the dots across departments, and react faster than human teams ever could. Salesforce created a powerful AI agent that could instantly scan and understand the US. Harmonized Tariff Schedule (4,400 pages) for businesses to identify every possible product category and associated duty. Kinaxis used AI to let businesses run live supply chain simulations that showed what would happen if they changed one part of their operation. This way, companies will know how to keep production running while lowering costs and avoiding new tariffs. Wipro combined traditional machine learning with new generative AI systems to quickly analyze global trade routes, supplier locations, shipping lanes, and tariff exposure. The system would then recommend how to reroute cargo, switch to cheaper vendors, or adjust sourcing strategies so businesses could stay flexible and competitive even as the rules kept shifting. These AI systems took over work that was simply too large, fast, and complex for human teams to manage independently. These tasks include tracking new trade policies as they happened, scanning global supplier data for vulnerabilities, modeling what-if scenarios for cost impact, and suggesting better decisions that balance speed, savings, and compliance. A lifeline for big companies, but what about everyone else? Large corporations have the money, talent, and data to train AI tools properly. AI made them flexible and intelligent enough to respond instantly to changing trade rules and protect their profit margins in ways that older systems or manual processes simply couldn’t match. But many small businesses don’t have enough money to buy AI tools, hire experts to build custom models, or collect the clean, real-time data AI systems need to work properly and deliver useful insights. AI is often portrayed as magic, but the truth is that it’s only as good as the data it works with. If a company can’t afford clean, updated, and well-organized data about its products, suppliers, logistics, and costs, then even the best AI system won’t be able to deliver the results that big businesses already see. AI has become a lifeline in this context, helping companies navigate unpredictable policies. But the deeper question going forward is whether this lifeline will also act as a ladder, giving smaller businesses and under-resourced players a way to climb into the future, or whether it remains just a crutch for the most powerful to keep their lead while others fall further behind.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) checks all those boxes, quickly earning its place among the best cryptocurrencies to invest in today. Unlike many tokens that rely solely on hype, MUTM delivers a robust DeFi platform designed to maximize yield opportunities while maintaining security and scalability. The project has hit phase 5 of its presale after selling out phase 4 at a higher pace than expected. MUTM will be launched officially at $0.06. The next phase prices will spike by 16.67% to $0.035. The tokens are available at $0.03, with listing at $0.06, offering early investors up to 100% potential returns. MUTM is rapidly taking center stage, with over $9.1 million raised and attracted more than 11,000 investors. With its competitive entry price and promising roadmap, MUTM is capturing attention as a top crypto to buy now, poised to challenge established giants and lead the next wave of decentralized finance innovation. Investors looking for the best crypto to invest in today should keep a close eye on MUTM as it gears up for major growth in 2025. Phase 4 Sold Out, MUTM’s Ascent Is Only Beginning The presale is in phase 5 with Phase 4 totally sold out. The tokens are available at $0.03, and listing for $0.06, early investors are looking at up to 100% potential returns. MUTM is rapidly taking center stage, with over $9.1 million raised and attracted more that 11,000 investors. As Phase 5 is in , the token price will rise to $0.035 in the next phase, providing current participants with a 16.67% profit. A Smarter DeFi Model: Hybrid Lending for a New Era Mutuum Finance stands out through its dual approach to crypto lending, which integrates Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) allows users to put stablecoins like USDT into smart contract liquidity pools and automatically earn passive income. In contrast, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) allows lenders and borrowers to communicate directly without intermediaries, with the ability to adjust loan terms and privacy advantages. This is a hybrid solution that provides more decentralization and flexibility but at the same time has strong yield opportunities, while liquidity providers receive over 10% today in passive return. Trust and Transparency: Stable, Audited, and Made to Last Mutuum Finance isn’t just innovating, it’s building trust. The platform’s smart contracts are open-source and undergoing rigorous audit by Certik. In addition to the native token, a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin is being developed, which circumvents the vulnerabilities of algorithmic stablecoins that have toppled other DeFi initiatives. The project is set to build a USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum network as one of the main features in the Mutuum Finance roadmap. Security and transparency are fundamentals of the ecosystem. Fostering Growth with $100K Giveaway and Gamified Community Tools To turbocharge adoption, Mutuum Finance is actively incentivizing its early adopters. Already underway is a $100,000 giveaway, where ten participants will receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens. Running in tandem is a gamified leaderboard, displaying and rewarding the top 50 token holders, to encourage greater investment and continued participation. This is supported through a referral program, a new level of grassroots expansion in this rapidly growing community. Mutuum Finance has raised over $9.1 million from 11,000+ investors, offering tokens at $0.03 with a launch price of $0.06—delivering up to 100% returns. The upcoming price increase to $0.035 provides an additional 16.67% profit for current buyers. Combining a unique hybrid lending model with Certik-audited smart contracts, MUTM ensures strong yields and security. With a $100,000 giveaway and active community rewards, Mutuum is set to lead DeFi growth into 2025. Don’t miss the chance to be part of this rising project.

While Bitcoin and Solana remain key holdings, the spotlight is increasingly turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP—two assets now seen as top contenders for 10,200% upside scenarios in 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Momentum, 50% Bonus, and 10,200% Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the standout early-stage opportunity of 2025, drawing both retail and institutional attention. The project’s unique blend of scarcity-driven tokenomics, audited contracts, and viral narrative is fueling record demand. Stage 8 Live: Over $8 million raised, with each presale stage filling faster than the last as investors rush to secure positions before price discovery. 50% Bonus with PATRIOT50X: Early buyers can use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% token bonus, amplifying potential returns. Analyst Targets: Industry experts forecast returns of up to 10,200%, with some models suggesting even higher upside if current momentum holds. With these catalysts, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now the go-to allocation for those seeking transformative early-stage gains. Ethereum (ETH): Bullish Technicals and Institutional Adoption Ethereum is trading between $2,400 and $2,900, with technical indicators signaling a possible breakout above $2,700 toward $2,800–$2,900 if momentum sustains. The Parabolic SAR and RSI both suggest renewed buying interest, while institutional adoption and Layer 2 growth underpin ETH’s long-term outlook. While Ethereum remains a core asset, its upside is now outpaced by the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin (BTC): Market Anchor and Capital Rotation Bitcoin is trading above $110,000, with institutional inflows and strong market structure reinforcing its dominance. Analysts see BTC potentially reaching $115,000 or higher if bullish momentum continues. As Bitcoin’s pace steadies, traders are diversifying into high-growth altcoins—where MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the top choice for outsized returns. Solana (SOL): Technical Strength and DeFi Surge Solana is consolidating between $158 and $175, with a breakout above $175 potentially leading to a retest of $183. The network’s high throughput and expanding DeFi ecosystem continue to attract users and developers. While Solana’s outlook is positive, its upside is more gradual compared to the presale-driven momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Stellar (XLM): Steady Growth, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Stellar is projected to trade between $0.65 and $0.80 in 2025, with technicals and institutional interest supporting long-term gains. While XLM’s fundamentals are strong, its near-term upside is less dramatic than the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which continues to set the standard for early-stage excitement. Conclusion Ethereum’s bullish chart patterns and Bitcoin’s stability are noteworthy, but the real excitement is in MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP—where early-stage momentum and analyst forecasts up to 10,200% ROI are drawing smart capital. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and strong community engagement, MAGA is the breakout contender for 2025.

The Russian technology entrepreneur will deliver his keynote speech remotely via livestream despite the travel ban, according to the Human Rights Foundation (HRF.) The Oslo Freedom Forum is organized by the Human Rights Foundation (HRF), a non-profit promoting freedom of speech and democracy globally. HRF founder Thor Halvorssen said the decision was disappointing, adding that it was a shame the French courts had banned Mr. Durov from attending an event where his voice was so critical. He has been the subject of legal investigation in France since August 2024. Durov was arrested while trying to leave the country at Le Bourget Airport near Paris. French prosecutors charged him with complicity in distributing child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and refusal of assistance to law enforcement. Telegram reportedly refused more than 3,000 law enforcement requests to provide evidence connected to criminal content. Following his arrest, the entrepreneur was released on 5 million euro bail . But the court laid down conditions. He has been ordered to stay in France and report to police twice weekly. Durov has said in court filings that the accusations are unfounded. He said that while Telegram has an EU-based legal representative to handle law enforcement requests, his company cooperates with such requests whenever possible. In a public post, Mr. Durov said that his detention was unconstitutional. He added that Telegram was not a lawless zone and that the company was committed to improving moderation while protecting privacy and free speech. Yet the court denied him permission to travel to Oslo. Judges ruled that the threat of him absconding was “high.” Durov claims pressure to censor political content on Telegram Telegram’s founder has claimed the French government has pressured the app to censor political content. Durov threw down a gauntlet in mid-May 2025 in a surprising maneuver. He said French intelligence chief Nicolas Lerner personally instructed him to ban conservative political content ahead of Romania’s upcoming presidential election. The meeting supposedly occurred at the Hôtel de Crillon in Paris, a grand luxury palace in the city. He said Lerner had asked him to “mute” voices of Romanian opposition on Telegram. In a post on Telegram, the tech entrepreneur said that democracy cannot be defended by denying people the right to express their opinions. The allegations have been denied by France’s DGSE (Directorate-General for External Security), under Lerner’s command. Officials said their discussions with Durov only touched on threats such as terrorism and child abuse material, not political content. But the assertions set off an uproar online. Public figures, including the tech mogul Elon Musk and the whistle-blower Edward Snowden, rallied to Durov’s defense, saying the episode is part of a broader pattern of Western governments attempting to clamp down on online speech. Supporters defend free speech amid Durov case Durov’s supporters say the French charges are calculated for political reasons. They caution that holding platform founders responsible for internet users’ posts could threaten internet freedom. One digital rights advocate said that if tech executives are going to be jailed every time they refuse to remove content that governments want taken down from social media, then no one is safe. Others say platforms like Telegram need to do more to remove illegal content and safeguard vulnerable communities. Durov says Telegram strikes the correct balance. He said that they did not censor protesters in Russia, Belarus, or Iran and that they would not start doing so in Europe. Having Durov present, even virtually, is key to conversations around digital rights, according to the Human Rights Foundation. For now, he remains in France, fighting legal charges and what he claims is Europe’s shift toward political censorship.
