This move follows similar withdrawals from Kentucky, Vermont, and South Carolina, signaling a potential shift in the regulatory landscape surrounding crypto staking in the United States. Is this the relief the crypto world has been waiting for? Let’s dive into what this means for Coinbase, the broader crypto market, and the future of crypto staking. Understanding the Coinbase Staking Lawsuit Saga For those unfamiliar, Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, offers a staking service that allows users to earn rewards on their crypto holdings. Staking, in simple terms, is like earning interest on your crypto. You commit your crypto assets to support the operations of a blockchain network, and in return, you receive rewards, often in the form of more of the same cryptocurrency. However, the legality of these services has been under scrutiny from various state regulators, leading to lawsuits like the one recently dropped by Illinois. These lawsuits generally revolve around whether crypto staking services should be classified as securities, which would bring them under stricter regulatory frameworks. Why is the Illinois Lawsuit Drop Significant for Crypto Staking? The decision by Illinois to drop the lawsuit is more than just a minor legal victory; it’s a potentially pivotal moment for the future of crypto staking in the US. Here’s why it matters: Precedent Setting: When multiple states like Kentucky, Vermont, South Carolina, and now Illinois drop similar lawsuits, it creates a pattern. This pattern can act as a precedent, making it harder for other states to pursue similar legal actions against Coinbase or other crypto platforms offering staking services. Positive Regulatory Signals: These withdrawals can be interpreted as a softening stance from state regulators on crypto staking. It might indicate a growing understanding, or at least a reassessment, of crypto services and a move towards more nuanced regulatory approaches rather than outright prohibition. Boost for Coinbase: For Coinbase, these dropped lawsuits are a clear win. The legal battles consume resources, create uncertainty, and can negatively impact public perception. Clearing these hurdles allows Coinbase to focus on its core business and continue offering its staking services with less regulatory pressure from these specific states. Market Confidence: Positive legal developments like these can boost overall market confidence in the crypto space. It reduces the fear of overly aggressive regulatory crackdowns and suggests a more constructive dialogue might be emerging between regulators and the crypto industry. Coinbase’s Stance: Staking is Not a Security Throughout these legal challenges, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Paul Grewal has consistently maintained that their staking services are not securities. This is a crucial point in the ongoing debate. The classification of crypto assets and related services as securities has significant regulatory implications. If staking is deemed a security, it would subject Coinbase and other providers to securities laws, requiring registration, disclosures, and potentially more stringent operational requirements. Coinbase’s argument, and the apparent shift in stance from some states, suggests a potential recognition that staking might not neatly fit the traditional definition of a security. The Broader Implications for Regulatory Clarity The withdrawal of these lawsuits contributes to a growing narrative around the need for regulatory clarity in the cryptocurrency space. For years, the lack of clear rules and guidelines has been a major impediment to the growth and mainstream adoption of crypto. Businesses struggle to operate in a legal gray area, and investors are hesitant due to uncertainty. Actions like these lawsuit drops, while not definitive policy statements, can be seen as steps towards a more defined and potentially more favorable regulatory environment. However, it’s important to note that this is a state-level development. Federal regulatory bodies like the SEC still hold significant influence, and the overall regulatory landscape remains complex and evolving. Illinois Lawsuit and its Context within State Regulations The Illinois lawsuit was part of a broader wave of state-level regulatory scrutiny targeting crypto staking services. Each state has its own securities laws and regulatory bodies, leading to a patchwork of regulations across the US. While the withdrawal in Illinois is positive, it doesn’t mean the issue is resolved nationwide. Here’s a look at the context: State Action on Coinbase Staking Status Illinois Lawsuit related to staking services Dropped Kentucky Similar lawsuit Dropped Vermont Similar lawsuit Dropped South Carolina Similar lawsuit Dropped Other States Ongoing regulatory discussions and potential actions Varying This table illustrates a trend, but it’s not a universal clearance. Other states may still have concerns or ongoing investigations. The crypto industry needs to continue engaging with regulators at both state and federal levels to advocate for clear and sensible rules. Navigating the Coinbase Legal Battle: What’s Next? While these dropped lawsuits are encouraging, Coinbase’s legal battle is likely far from over. The broader debate about crypto regulation in the US is ongoing, and various agencies are still formulating their approaches. Here are some key aspects to watch out for: SEC Scrutiny: The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) remains a major player in crypto regulation. Their stance on staking and other crypto services will be crucial in shaping the future landscape. Federal Legislation: There are ongoing efforts in the US Congress to create comprehensive crypto legislation. The outcome of these legislative efforts will have a profound impact on the industry. Global Regulatory Trends: The US is not alone in grappling with crypto regulation. Developments in other major economies will also influence the global regulatory environment and could indirectly affect US policy. Industry Advocacy: Continued advocacy from crypto companies and industry associations is essential to ensure that regulations are balanced, promote innovation, and protect consumers without stifling growth. Conclusion: A Sigh of Relief, But Continued Vigilance Needed The news of Illinois dropping the Coinbase staking lawsuit, following similar actions by other states, is undoubtedly a positive development for Coinbase and the crypto industry as a whole. It signals a potential easing of regulatory pressures at the state level and contributes to the ongoing quest for regulatory clarity . However, the journey towards a fully defined and stable regulatory environment for crypto is still underway. Stakeholders must remain vigilant, engage in constructive dialogue with regulators, and continue to advocate for policies that foster innovation while addressing legitimate concerns. This victory offers a moment of relief, but the broader Coinbase legal battle and the fight for sensible crypto regulation continues.

Despite today's market decline, some experts predict that BTC will rise to new highs before the end of the year. Bitwise’s Head of Research Ryan Rasmussen has confirmed the firm’s $200,000 year-end price target for Bitcoin, saying the recent market turbulence is merely a temporary setback. “Once the market recovers from this ‘Independence Day’ chaos, we will finally start to see the market pull back to the upside,” Rasmussen said. “We like to use the analogy that good news is dry powder stored for when this volatility and uncertainty eventually subsides.” Related News: Trump Imposed Heavy Tariffs: So What Will Happen to Bitcoin and Altcoins Now? Bitcoin’s correlation with the tech sector has strengthened in recent years, particularly as gold has reached record highs. But Rasmussen encouraged investors to take a broader view, noting that Bitcoin has outperformed gold, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq since Nov. 5. “We’ve had a great snowball of news over the last few months,” Rasmussen said, referring to the White House’s decision to create a Bitcoin reserve, regulatory changes and the increased involvement of sovereign wealth funds. “This market would have been at $150,000 by now if it weren’t for the fear of impending tariffs.” Rasmussen also noted that some of these tariffs could be rolled back and that he expects the Fed to cut rates later this year despite the current economic uncertainties surrounding trade and immigration policy. *This is not investment advice.

If you’ve been closely following the journey of Bitcoin ETFs and eagerly awaiting the next big leap, you’re in for a treat. Recent news suggests a potentially game-changing shift in how these investment vehicles operate, and it all centers around a concept called ‘in-kind redemptions’. Let’s dive into the heart of this story and explore what it could mean for the future of crypto investing. Why are BlackRock and SEC Discussing Crypto ETFs? As the cryptocurrency market matures, so does the demand for more accessible and regulated investment products. Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have emerged as a popular vehicle for investors to gain exposure to various assets, and crypto is no exception. BlackRock, a global investment management giant, has been at the forefront of this movement, actively engaging with regulatory bodies like the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) to refine and expand the offerings of crypto ETFs . This week, a delegation from BlackRock met with the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, according to a tweet by Eleanor Terrett, a well-regarded name in financial journalism. The core topic of discussion? Exploring the possibility of enabling ‘in-kind’ creation and redemption processes for their existing and future crypto ETFs. But what exactly does ‘in-kind’ mean, and why is it such a significant point of discussion? Decoding ‘In-Kind Redemption’ for Bitcoin ETFs To understand the significance of in-kind redemptions, let’s first clarify the standard creation and redemption process for ETFs, particularly Bitcoin ETFs . Creation Units: ETFs operate using a mechanism involving ‘creation units’. These are large blocks of ETF shares, typically created or redeemed by authorized participants (APs), which are usually large financial institutions. Cash Creation/Redemption (Current Model): Currently, many ETFs, including some crypto ETFs, use a ‘cash’ creation and redemption model. When an AP wants to create new ETF shares, they deliver cash equivalent to the value of the underlying assets (in this case, Bitcoin) to the ETF issuer. Conversely, when redeeming shares, APs receive cash. In-Kind Creation/Redemption (The Potential Shift): ‘In-kind’ redemption, on the other hand, means that instead of cash, APs would directly exchange the underlying assets – in this scenario, actual Bitcoin – when creating or redeeming ETF shares. Table: Cash vs. In-Kind Redemption Feature Cash Redemption In-Kind Redemption Asset Exchange Cash Underlying Asset (e.g., Bitcoin) Tax Implications Potential Capital Gains/Losses when selling assets to obtain cash Potentially more tax-efficient, deferring capital gains until the underlying asset is sold later Efficiency Simpler for some operations Potentially more efficient for managing underlying asset holdings and reducing transaction costs What are the Benefits of In-Kind Redemptions for Crypto ETFs? The shift towards in-kind redemptions for crypto ETFs , particularly BlackRock Bitcoin ETF , could unlock several advantages: Enhanced Efficiency: In-kind processes can streamline the creation and redemption mechanism. By directly exchanging Bitcoin, it reduces the need for APs to constantly convert between crypto and cash, potentially lowering transaction costs and operational complexities. Tax Advantages: For investors and APs, in-kind redemptions can be more tax-efficient. When using cash redemption, there might be taxable events triggered when APs sell the underlying Bitcoin to obtain cash for redemption. In-kind transfers could defer these capital gains until the actual Bitcoin is sold in the future. This is a significant draw for tax-conscious investors. Deeper Liquidity: By making the ETF mechanism more efficient and potentially cost-effective, in-kind redemptions could attract more authorized participants and institutional interest. This increased participation can lead to deeper liquidity in the ETF market, benefiting all investors through tighter bid-ask spreads and smoother trading. Closer Tracking of NAV: In-kind redemption can help ETFs track their Net Asset Value (NAV) more closely. Directly using the underlying asset in creation and redemption processes can minimize discrepancies that might arise from cash conversions and market fluctuations between the crypto and fiat markets. Challenges and Considerations for SEC Regulation While the benefits are compelling, enabling in-kind redemptions for crypto ETFs isn’t without its hurdles, particularly from a regulatory perspective. The SEC plays a crucial role in ensuring investor protection and market integrity. Here are some key considerations for SEC crypto regulation : Custody and Security: Handling in-kind redemptions means securely managing and transferring actual Bitcoin. The SEC will need to be confident that robust custody solutions and security protocols are in place to safeguard these digital assets throughout the creation and redemption process. Market Manipulation Concerns: Regulators need to be vigilant about potential market manipulation risks. They will assess how in-kind mechanisms could impact market surveillance and ensure fair pricing and trading practices are maintained. Valuation and Transparency: Accurate and transparent valuation of Bitcoin and the ETF units is paramount. The SEC will likely scrutinize the valuation methodologies used in in-kind transactions to ensure fairness and prevent any ambiguity. Regulatory Framework Clarity: Clear and consistent regulatory guidelines are essential for the widespread adoption of in-kind redemptions. The SEC’s engagement with BlackRock signals a potential step towards providing this much-needed clarity and adapting regulations to the evolving crypto landscape. Examples of In-Kind Redemptions in Traditional ETFs In-kind redemptions are not a novel concept in the broader ETF universe. They are commonly used in ETFs that track physical commodities (like gold ETFs) and even in some equity ETFs. For instance, many commodity ETFs allow authorized participants to create or redeem shares using the underlying commodity itself. This practice has been well-established and provides a framework that could be adapted for Bitcoin ETFs . The SEC can draw upon its experience regulating these existing in-kind ETF models to develop a suitable framework for crypto ETFs. Understanding the nuances of how in-kind works in other asset classes can provide valuable insights and best practices for navigating the regulatory landscape for digital assets. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? The discussions between BlackRock and the SEC regarding in-kind redemptions are a positive signal for the future of Bitcoin ETF approval and the broader crypto investment space. Here’s what you should consider: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on further developments regarding SEC regulations and ETF approvals. News about in-kind redemptions indicates progress and a potential shift towards more efficient and investor-friendly crypto products. Understand ETF Mechanics: Familiarize yourself with how ETFs work, including creation and redemption processes. Understanding in-kind vs. cash redemption will give you a deeper appreciation of the operational aspects and potential benefits of these investment vehicles. Consider Tax Implications: If in-kind redemptions become more prevalent, be mindful of the potential tax advantages. Consult with a financial advisor to understand how these changes might impact your investment strategy. Long-Term Growth Potential: The move towards in-kind redemptions suggests a maturing crypto ETF market. This could pave the way for greater institutional adoption, increased liquidity, and potentially contribute to the long-term growth and stability of the crypto asset class. Conclusion: A Promising Step Forward for Crypto ETFs The dialogue between BlackRock and the SEC about in-kind redemptions marks a significant and promising step forward for the evolution of crypto ETFs . While regulatory hurdles remain, these discussions signal a willingness to explore innovative mechanisms that could enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve the overall investor experience. As the crypto market continues to mature, such developments are crucial for fostering wider adoption and integrating digital assets into mainstream finance. The potential for in-kind redemptions is not just a technical detail; it’s a testament to the ongoing efforts to build a more robust, accessible, and investor-friendly crypto investment ecosystem.

The buzz is real, and the excitement is palpable as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially acknowledged the filing for a Solana ETF by none other than financial giant Fidelity. This is not just another headline; it’s a monumental step that could redefine how investors engage with Solana and the broader cryptocurrency market. Are you ready to dive into what this thrilling development means for you and the future of crypto investments? What is a Solana ETF and Why is it Potentially Revolutionary? First things first, let’s break down what a Solana ETF actually is. ETF stands for Exchange Traded Fund. In simple terms, it’s like a basket of securities that trades on an exchange, much like individual stocks. A Solana ETF, therefore, would be a fund that holds Solana tokens or derivatives, allowing investors to gain exposure to Solana without directly holding the cryptocurrency itself. Think of it as investing in gold through a gold ETF instead of storing gold bars at home. Why is this potentially revolutionary? Here’s why: Accessibility: ETFs are easily accessible to the average investor through traditional brokerage accounts. No need to navigate crypto exchanges, manage wallets, or worry about private keys. A Solana ETF would open the doors to Solana investment for a massive pool of investors who are comfortable with conventional investment vehicles. Regulation and Security: ETFs operate within a regulated framework, offering a layer of security and investor protection that some find reassuring, especially in the often-volatile crypto space. Having a Fidelity Solana ETF regulated by the SEC adds a significant layer of legitimacy and trust. Diversification (Indirectly): While a Solana ETF focuses on a single cryptocurrency, it diversifies the way investors can access this asset class. It can be part of a broader, diversified portfolio, blending traditional and digital assets. Mainstream Adoption: The approval of a Solana ETF could signal a major step towards mainstream adoption of Solana and cryptocurrencies in general. It sends a message that institutional players like Fidelity are taking crypto seriously, potentially encouraging wider acceptance and investment. Fidelity’s Bold Move: Championing a Fidelity Solana ETF Fidelity, a name synonymous with financial prowess and innovation, has thrown its hat in the ring, filing for a Fidelity Solana ETF . This isn’t Fidelity’s first foray into the crypto world; they’ve been gradually embracing digital assets, recognizing the growing investor interest and the transformative potential of blockchain technology. Their decision to pursue a Solana ETF is a strong endorsement of Solana as a significant player in the crypto ecosystem. Why is Fidelity’s involvement so crucial? Reputation and Trust: Fidelity is a well-established and respected financial institution with decades of experience. Their backing lends credibility to the Solana ETF and the underlying asset, Solana itself. Market Influence: Fidelity’s entry into the Solana ETF space could encourage other major financial institutions to follow suit, potentially leading to a wave of new crypto investment products. Investor Base: Fidelity has a massive existing client base. Offering a Fidelity Solana ETF provides these clients with a familiar and trusted avenue to invest in Solana. SEC Acknowledgment: Is the SEC ETF Filing a Green Light? The SEC acknowledging the filing is a crucial procedural step. It means the application is officially under review. However, it’s important to temper expectations. Acknowledgment is not an approval. The SEC will now rigorously examine the SEC ETF Filing , considering various factors including market surveillance, investor protection, and the nature of the underlying asset, Solana. What does the SEC’s review process typically involve? In-depth Analysis: The SEC will conduct a thorough analysis of the ETF’s structure, the underlying Solana market, and potential risks. Public Comments: The SEC often seeks public comments on proposed rule changes and filings, allowing stakeholders and the public to voice their opinions. Deliberation and Decision: After the review period, the SEC Commissioners will deliberate and vote on whether to approve or disapprove the ETF. The timeline for this process is uncertain. Previous crypto ETF applications have faced lengthy reviews and, in some cases, rejections. However, the fact that the SEC has acknowledged the filing for a Solana ETF is undoubtedly a positive signal. Why is This a Huge Deal for Crypto ETF Investment? The potential approval of a Crypto ETF Investment product focused on Solana is significant for several reasons. It signifies the maturing of the crypto market and the increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate investment assets. For years, Bitcoin ETFs were the holy grail, and now, the focus is expanding to include other major cryptocurrencies like Solana. Here’s why this is a big deal for the broader crypto ETF landscape: Diversification Beyond Bitcoin: For a long time, crypto ETFs were almost exclusively focused on Bitcoin. A Solana ETF opens the door for ETFs based on other cryptocurrencies, offering investors more diversified Crypto ETF Investment options. Broader Market Appeal: Solana is known for its speed and lower transaction costs compared to some other blockchains. A Solana ETF could attract investors who are interested in the technological advancements within the crypto space, not just Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative. Precedent Setting: If the SEC approves a Solana ETF, it could set a precedent for approving ETFs for other cryptocurrencies in the future, potentially leading to a diverse range of crypto investment products becoming available to mainstream investors. Potential Challenges and Roadblocks for Solana Investment via ETF Despite the excitement, it’s crucial to acknowledge that challenges and potential roadblocks remain for Solana Investment through an ETF. The crypto regulatory landscape is still evolving, and the SEC has historically been cautious about approving crypto-related investment products. What are some potential hurdles? Regulatory Scrutiny: The SEC will likely subject the Solana ETF application to intense scrutiny, focusing on market manipulation risks, custody solutions, and investor protection. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, including Solana, are known for their volatility. The SEC may be concerned about the risks associated with exposing mainstream investors to such volatile assets through an ETF. Custody and Security: Ensuring the secure custody of Solana tokens underlying the ETF is crucial. The SEC will want to be satisfied with the custody arrangements proposed by Fidelity. Market Maturity: While Solana is a major cryptocurrency, the market for Solana and its derivatives may be considered less mature than the Bitcoin market, which could raise concerns for regulators. What’s Next? The Approval Process and Keeping an Eye on Developments The SEC’s acknowledgment of the filing is just the beginning of a potentially lengthy process. Investors interested in a Solana Investment via ETF should closely monitor developments. Keep an eye out for: SEC announcements and updates: The SEC will likely issue updates on the review process and any decisions made. Industry news and analysis: Stay informed through reputable crypto news sources and financial analysts who are tracking the Solana ETF application. Fidelity’s communications: Fidelity may provide updates on the status of their ETF filing. The journey of a Solana ETF from filing to potential approval is a marathon, not a sprint. Patience and informed observation will be key for anyone following this exciting development. Conclusion: A Thrilling Step Forward for Solana and Crypto ETFs The SEC acknowledging Fidelity’s Solana ETF filing is undeniably a landmark moment for Solana and the broader cryptocurrency market. It represents a significant step towards mainstream adoption and offers a glimmer of hope for a more diversified and accessible crypto investment landscape. While challenges remain and approval is not guaranteed, this development is a powerful signal of the growing maturity and institutional interest in cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin. The prospect of a Solana ETF ignites excitement and anticipation within the crypto community and beyond, promising to reshape how investors interact with digital assets in the years to come. The future of crypto ETFs is looking brighter than ever, and Solana is poised to be at the forefront of this exciting evolution.

Today, @BankingGOP voted to advance the following nominations: Paul Atkins to lead @SECGov Jonathan Gould to lead @USOCC Luke Pettit to be Assistant Secretary @USTreasury Marc Molinaro to lead @FTA_DOT It's time for the Senate to confirm these well-qualified nominees. pic.twitter.com/tkVUpNTs2L — U.S. Senate Banking Committee GOP (@BankingGOP) April 3, 2025 “Paul Atkins, the former SEC Commissioner, will promote capital formation and provide much-needed clarity for digital assets,” Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC) said. “Under his leadership, the SEC will return to its core mission and will ensure our markets remain the envy of the world.” Paul Atkins and the SEC: A Shift in Direction However, some lawmakers voiced strong opposition to Atkins replacing former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized the nomination in an April 3 statement. “Mr. Atkins was dead wrong in the lead-up to the worst financial crisis in a generation and he has 20/0 hindsight about those mistakes,” she said. “He has spent his post-government career helping billionaire scammers like CEO Sam Bankman-Fried get even richer.” Paul Atkins began his career as a corporate lawyer and later co-chaired the Chamber of Digital Commerce’s Token Alliance. He has been viewed by some as a crypto-friendly candidate for the SEC role. Crypto Holdings and Past Affiliations Under Scrutiny Just last week, reports revealed that Paul Atkins currently holds nearly $6 million worth of digital assets . During a March 27 nomination hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, Senator John Kennedy questioned Atkins about Sam Bankman-Fried and his family’s potential financial ties to the failed FTX exchange. Atkins stated he was “concerned” about reports that Bankman-Fried’s parents and Stanford University may have profited from the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. With the Senate Banking Committee’s approval, Paul Atkins now awaits a full Senate vote to confirm his appointment as SEC Chair. If confirmed, his leadership would mark a departure from the SEC’s recent regulation-by-enforcement approach to digital assets under the Biden administration.

Similar decisions across states point to a reassessment of enforcement tactics in digital asset management. The change invites discussion on streamlining regulatory rules to foster a more unified national crypto framework. Illinois is preparing to drop its lawsuit against Coinbase over the exchange’s staking program, following the lead of three other U.S. states that have recently abandoned similar legal actions. A spokesperson for Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias confirmed the decision on April 3, but did not specify when the case would be officially dismissed. Illinois was one of ten states that sued Coinbase in 2023, alleging that the exchange had violated securities laws by offering staking services without proper registration. The case was part of a broader crackdown led by a multistate task force, which included regulators from Alabama, California, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin. Illinois Follows Other States in Dropping Coinbase Staking Case The legal battle over staking stems from concerns that Coinbase’s program, which allows users to earn rewards by locking up their crypto, operates without regulatory oversight. Regulators argued that Coinbase’s staking rewards program functioned as an unregistered securities offering, allowing the company to collect a share of staking profits before distributing the remainder to investors. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also sued Coinbase over its staking product, arguing it constituted an unregistered securities offering. However, the SEC dropped its case in February . SCOOP: The Illinois Secretary of State intends to drop its staking lawsuit against @coinbase , joining Kentucky, South Carolina and Vermont in backing down from litigation against the crypto exchange. @cheyenneligon reports https://t.co/f71kAbYrMm — CoinDesk (@CoinDesk) April 3, 2025 Since then, Kentucky , Vermont , and South Carolina have all moved to dismiss their lawsuits against the exchange. Despite these developments, not all states have backed down. A representative for the New Jersey Bureau of Securities confirmed that its case against Coinbase remains open, while Washington State’s securities administrator, Bill Beatty, said its case is still ongoing. The original lawsuit against Coinbase raised concerns that staking rewards accounts were not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), leaving investors unprotected from potential losses. Regulators in Alabama had initially ordered Coinbase to justify why it should not be forced to stop offering its staking services. Despite the legal challenges, Coinbase has maintained that its staking services do not constitute securities and has continued to oppose regulatory claims. With Illinois now set to drop its case, the pressure on Coinbase’s staking program appears to be easing, though ongoing cases in states like Washington and New Jersey suggest the legal battle is not yet over. Kentucky Drops Coinbase Staking Lawsuit, Signaling Shift in State-Level Crypto Policies Kentuck’y Department of Financial Institutions filed the joint dismissal with Coinbase on April 1 to drop its lawsuit , ending the legal battle nearly a year after joining 10 other state regulators in accusing the exchange of violating securities laws. Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, acknowledged the decision and urged Congress to replace the current “state-by-state” legal battles with clear federal regulations. Seven states, including Alabama, California,Maryland, New Jersey, Washington, and Wisconsin, are still pursuing cases against Coinbase. Meanwhile, Illinois has shifted its focus to Bitcoin adoption. The state is advancing a Bitcoin strategic reserve bill ( HB1844 ), which proposes creating a dedicated fund to hold Bitcoin as a financial asset for at least five years. Representative John Cabello introduced the bill, which follows Arizona’s push to allow public funds and pensions to invest in Bitcoin. As regulatory battles continue, Illinois’ pivot signals growing state-level interest in Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What broader trends does this shift suggest? Regulators moving away from state-specific crypto lawsuits indicates a trend toward unified oversight. The shift promotes aligned rules that better manage digital asset risks while enhancing market clarity overall. How might the legal easing impact investor trust? Easing legal pressures could increase investor trust in crypto services. With fewer state disputes, users may enjoy steadier offerings and a clearer compliance framework that reassures market participants. What future changes could result from dropping state lawsuits? This change could lead to more consistent legal frameworks that support market innovation and consumer safeguards statewide.

PEPE continues to thrive off its meme popularity, but Dragoin is stepping into the spotlight with a deeper offering—a working ecosystem, actual use cases, and a presale structure designed to reward early backers. As Dragoin enters public sale at $0.0000292, those aiming for longer-term growth are starting to shift from hype-heavy coins to meme coins that offer stronger functionality like Dragoin. While PEPE gained massive traction in 2023 based on its meme status and technical patterns, it has since entered a sharp downturn, currently over 74% below its peak. Dragoin, on the other hand, is still early in its journey and is building momentum fast. Here’s why Dragoin is quickly gaining attention as one of the more practical meme-themed cryptos of 2025. Public Sale Begins at $0.0000292: A Strong Early Entry Point Many meme coins tend to gain value after launch, but Dragoin takes a different route by offering real value from the beginning. Stage 1 of the public sale is now live at $0.0000292. The launch price will be $0.002, meaning early entries could see an approximate 6,700% return. Dragoin’s supply and pricing are designed to reward early action. The sale will unfold in 25 different stages, each bringing a higher price. To reduce excess supply, any unsold tokens will be permanently burned, reducing circulation and encouraging scarcity. This system pushes quicker participation and adds a deflationary mechanism not found in PEPE. Even though PEPE has a large base of holders, Dragoin brings a new dimension—a live Telegram game where users control dragons, earn rewards, and compete in a fantasy setup. This combination of meme energy, engaging gameplay, and limited supply is making Dragoin a strong project to watch this year. Utility and Engagement Give Dragoin the Advantage Dragoin goes beyond viral content by offering a reason for users to stay involved. The Telegram game is already functional, giving users the ability to dodge obstacles and collect $DDGN tokens in real-time. It’s one of the rare meme-themed coins to offer a playable game before exchange listings. PEPE, in contrast, continues to rely on social status and meme-driven appeal. While it does have a supportive community, it doesn’t offer interactive experiences that many backers now look for. Dragoin plans to roll out listings on both DEX and CEX platforms and expand its game later in 2025. This planned growth adds staying power to its appeal. Long-Term Token Structure Sets Dragoin Apart Dragoin’s supply is set at 200 billion tokens, with half (100 billion) going into presale. Liquidity will be locked, and the team tokens will follow a two-year vesting plan—helping build user confidence. With each stage of the presale, the price rises, giving those who buy early a stronger edge. This method contrasts with PEPE’s current model, which remains more vulnerable to price swings and concentrated control. PEPE’s top 20 addresses own around 50% of its tokens, which shows a somewhat even spread. However, Dragoin’s phase-based rollout and focus on fair distribution improve accessibility and reduce imbalance from the beginning. Meme Coin Interest Follows Social Activity Trends Social presence plays a huge role in meme coin success. During PEPE’s run in 2023, a spike in mentions on platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Telegram drove prices up fast. But when the talk dies down, so does the price—and PEPE has recently seen reduced online interest. Dragoin, on the other hand, is seeing a rise in social mentions. With the sale live and the game actively running, excitement is increasing across platforms. Historically, rising social activity often hints at coming price growth, especially when linked with real use, as is the case with Dragoin. Also, fantasy themes like dragons and online storytelling already have strong fan bases. Combining that with meme trends gives Dragoin a strong position to build on. As prices rise with each sale stage, this growing buzz is likely to continue. What Makes Dragoin a Better Choice Than PEPE in 2025 PEPE continues to hold attention in the meme coin scene, but its strength lies in its past viral success. Those looking for the next step in meme crypto are turning their eyes to Dragoin for its utility, structure, and future plans. Here’s how the comparison breaks down: PEPE depends mainly on meme strength and community attention. Dragoin offers storytelling, limited supply, real-time gameplay, and early purchase benefits for better long-term value. Now that the public sale is open, the $0.0000292 entry point, along with a functioning ecosystem, gives Dragoin a head start before broader awareness kicks in. Final Remarks! Meme-themed coins often come with high ups and downs, but those that mix entertainment with purpose tend to last. Dragoin fits that model. With rising social discussion, an active game, and built-in token burning, the shift in momentum is clearly moving its way. Instead of watching it grow from afar, this might be the time to get into $DDGN during Stage 1—before it begins gaining broader attention.

Amidst the market downturn, technical indicators suggest that Dogecoin could be setting the stage for an explosive rally, with analysts predicting a 270% surge to a new price high. Dogecoin Price Prepares For 270% Surge A Dogecoin price chart shared by crypto analyst Javon Marks reveals a critical shift in momentum. Following a prolonged downtrend that saw the meme coin’s price crash to significant lows, Dogecoin has now broken out of a descending trendline, signaling the potential end of its bear cycle. Related Reading: Cardano Price Could Be Set For 100% Rally As This Bullish Triangle Has Formed On The Daily Timeframe Since reaching a cycle low, Dogecoin has consistently posted higher lows — a common sign of growing buying pressure and a steady uptrend. Following the formation of its latest higher low, Marks believes that DOGE is now positioned in a bullish set-up. Historically, similar patterns have preceded parabolic moves in the Dogecoin price, suggesting that the meme coin could be gearing up for an uptrend continuation. According to Marks‘ analysis, if Dogecoin follows the established trend, the next impulsive wave could push its price to $0.653, marking an explosive 270% surge. While past higher low formations support the likelihood of the analyst’s projected rally, Dogecoin’s recent breakout from the descending trendline reinforces its bullish structure. Marks also suggests that a climb to the $0.63 level could serve as a launchpad for Dogecoin, potentially driving its price even higher to $1.25 if its momentum persists. Despite the ongoing market volatility, DOGE continues to hold key support levels as it eyes a fresh breakout. Notably, a surge to the $1.25 target would mark an impressive 681.25% increase from the meme coin’s current market value of $0.16. DOGE Faces Make Or Break Level According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the Dogecoin price is currently at a make-or-break point, meaning that its next move could determine whether it sees a significant breakout or a sharp decline. Sharing a price chart highlighting Fibonacci retracements and trend channels, the analyst revealed that Dogecoin is sitting on a key ascending trendline that has acted as support since 2018. Related Reading: Pundit Gives Dogecoin Price 30-40% Chance Of Crash To $0.165 As RSI Enters Oversold Levels This trend line aligns with the 0.796 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.16, marking it a crucial support zone. If Dogecoin holds above this level, it could trigger a bullish continuation, with the next major Fibonacci extension level at $0.57. Surpassing this price mark could also propel Dogecoin to the 1.272 Fib at $2.77. On the flip side, if Dogecoin breaks below $0.16, the next major support lies around the 0.618 Fib at $0.06. The analyst’s chart also highlights a possible breakdown to $0.0066 or even as low as $0.0016 if bearish momentum persists.

Hidden Road, a prominent player known for its crypto-friendly approach, is reportedly engaged in acquisition talks with a crypto-native firm. This intriguing development, first brought to light by CoinDesk, has sent ripples through the industry, raising questions about the future of Hidden Road and the broader implications for institutional investment in digital assets. Why is the Potential Crypto Acquisition of Hidden Road a Big Deal? The news of a potential crypto acquisition of Hidden Road is significant for several reasons. Firstly, Hidden Road has quickly established itself as a key prime broker in the cryptocurrency space. Prime brokers play a crucial role in traditional finance, offering services like securities lending, margin financing, and trade execution to institutional clients. In the burgeoning crypto market, these services are equally vital for institutional investors looking to navigate the complexities of digital assets. Hidden Road’s focus on serving institutional clients makes this acquisition particularly noteworthy. Secondly, the fact that a “crypto-native firm” is making the acquisition offer signals a growing maturity and consolidation within the crypto industry. As the market evolves, we are witnessing established crypto companies seeking to expand their reach and service offerings through strategic acquisitions. This trend underscores the increasing institutionalization of crypto and the desire of established players to capture a larger share of the market. The identity of the crypto firm remains undisclosed, adding an element of suspense to this unfolding story. Let’s break down why Hidden Road’s position makes this news so compelling: Institutional Focus: Hidden Road specifically targets institutional investors, a segment that is increasingly important for the sustained growth of the crypto market. Prime Brokerage Services: As a prime broker , Hidden Road provides essential infrastructure for institutions to trade and manage crypto assets efficiently. Recent Funding: Having reportedly raised $50 million in the past year, including from Dragonfly Capital, Hidden Road is not a struggling entity, making the acquisition offer even more noteworthy. Unpacking the Hidden Road Story: Dragonfly Capital and Institutional Investment The report mentions that Hidden Road secured approximately $50 million in funding over the last year from investors, including the well-known crypto venture capital firm, Dragonfly Capital . This detail adds another layer of intrigue to the acquisition talks. It is speculated that one of these investors might be the entity behind the acquisition offer. Dragonfly Capital’s involvement suggests strong backing and belief in Hidden Road’s potential. If an investor is indeed making the acquisition move, it could indicate a strategic decision to further capitalize on their initial investment and integrate Hidden Road’s services more deeply within their ecosystem. Consider these key aspects related to institutional investment and Dragonfly Capital’s role: Aspect Details Dragonfly Capital’s Reputation A prominent crypto VC firm known for backing successful crypto projects. Their investment in Hidden Road lends credibility to the platform. Investor Acquisition The possibility of an investor-led acquisition suggests a strong strategic alignment and potentially a desire to accelerate growth or integration. $50 Million Funding Highlights the significant capital already invested in Hidden Road, making an acquisition a substantial move. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Prime Brokerage? The potential acquisition of Hidden Road comes at a pivotal time for the prime broker sector in the cryptocurrency industry. As institutional interest in crypto continues to grow, the demand for robust and reliable prime brokerage services is also on the rise. An acquisition of this nature could lead to several potential outcomes: Market Consolidation: It could signal the beginning of a consolidation phase within the crypto prime brokerage space, with larger firms absorbing smaller, specialized players. Service Expansion: The acquiring firm might seek to integrate Hidden Road’s prime brokerage capabilities to broaden its service offerings and cater to institutional clients more comprehensively. Increased Competition: Alternatively, the acquisition could intensify competition if the combined entity becomes a more formidable player, challenging existing prime brokers. However, it is crucial to remember that these are still just acquisition talks. There is no guarantee that the deal will materialize. Negotiations can be complex, and various factors can influence the final outcome. The crypto market itself is known for its volatility and rapid changes, which can further complicate such deals. Navigating the Uncertainties of Crypto Acquisitions: Key Takeaways The situation with Hidden Road serves as a reminder of the dynamic and evolving nature of the cryptocurrency industry. Crypto acquisitions , like this potential deal, are becoming increasingly common as the market matures. For industry participants and observers, here are some key takeaways: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on developments in this acquisition story and similar deals within the crypto space. Market Trends: Pay attention to the broader trends of institutional investment and consolidation in the crypto market. Prime Brokerage Evolution: Understand the growing importance of prime brokerage services and how acquisitions might shape this sector. Due Diligence: For companies considering acquisitions, thorough due diligence and strategic alignment are crucial for success. While the future of Hidden Road remains uncertain pending the outcome of these acquisition talks, one thing is clear: this development underscores the increasing maturity and sophistication of the cryptocurrency market. The potential acquisition is a testament to the growing value and strategic importance of crypto prime brokers in facilitating institutional participation in digital assets. As the story unfolds, the crypto world will be watching closely to see if this hidden road leads to a new chapter for both Hidden Road and the acquiring crypto firm.

Forced Bitcoin liquidation shows vulnerabilities in corporate crypto reserves, challenging the viability of Bitcoin-first treasury strategies amid regulatory uncertainties. This case highlights the risks of cross-jurisdictional legal conflicts, where U.S. court actions threaten foreign companies’ ability to comply with local laws and governance structures. A New York court barred Genius Group from selling shares, raising funds, or using investor money to buy Bitcoin on April 3, forcing the company to liquidate parts of its Bitcoin Treasury to sustain operations. The ruling, issued by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), follows an ongoing legal dispute involving the education and AI-focused company. Court Blocks Genius Group from Raising Funds, Forces Bitcoin Treasury Sale Genius Group, which trades on the NYSE American under the ticker GNS, has been entangled in legal battles stemming from its attempt to terminate an asset purchase agreement with Fatbrain AI (LZGI). The dispute escalated when LZGI shareholders filed lawsuits alleging fraud against the company’s executives, Michael Moe and Peter Ritz. The SEC also launched a case related to shareholder fraud. On February 14, 2025, Moe and Ritz sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to prevent Genius from selling shares or using funds from its $150 million at-the-market (ATM) offering to buy Bitcoin. Genius Group has been blocked by the US District Court Southern District of New York from selling shares or raising funds, and specifically banned from buying Bitcoin, in direct opposition to the wishes and approvals of the Company's board and shareholders. We will keep fighting… pic.twitter.com/Lk6uXzfCx6 — Roger James Hamilton (@rogerhamilton) April 3, 2025 The court granted the injunction on March 13, effectively freezing the company’s ability to issue shares and raise capital. In response, Genius Group has filed multiple motions contesting the ruling, arguing that the injunction disrupts the status quo and was secured through false claims. The company also submitted a transcript of a meeting with Ritz, recorded in New York on February 27, in which he allegedly described a strategy to exploit the legal process to extract money from Genius. The transcript hasbeen included in a separate lawsuit against LZGI and its executives in a Florida court as well. As a result of the court order, Genius Group has been forced to sell portions of its Bitcoin holdings, reducing its treasury from 440 BTC to 430 BTC. The company has warned that further sales may be necessary if the injunction remains in place. The restrictions have also prevented Genius from issuing share-based compensation to employees, putting it at odds with Singaporean employment laws. The company has filed an emergency appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, seeking to overturn the injunction. At the same time, it is restructuring operations, cutting marketing expenses, closing divisions, and canceling event sponsorships to conserve resources. CEO Roger James Hamilton criticized the court’s intervention, stating, “We never dreamed that a U.S. court could block the company from issuing shares, raising funds, or buying Bitcoin—decisions that should be made by shareholders or the board, not the courts.” Genius Group’s Market Cap Falls Below Bitcoin Holdings Amid Court Battle Since the temporary restraining order was issued in February, Genius Group’s stock price has dropped 53%, from $0.47 to $0.22. The company’s market capitalization now stands at just 40% of the value of its Bitcoin holdings, raising concerns about its ability to continue operations. Source: YahooFinance Meanwhile, Hamilton reaffirmed the company’s commitment to Bitcoin, stating, “We will continue to fly the flag for Bitcoin, even when legally banned from building our Bitcoin Treasury.” Despite the court banning Genius Group from trading stocks and holding Bitcoin, the Singapore-based AI and education firm has been aggressively accumulating BTC. The company now holds 430BTC, worth $46 million, while its market cap is $33.1 million. Genius has spent $42 million acquiring Bitcoin, mirroring MicroStrategy’s treasury strategy . In just four months, it has allocated $40 million to BTC and plans to push that to $120 million using reserves, loans, and an ATM facility. As it stands now, with regulatory pressure mounting, the company’s Bitcoin-first approach faces an uncertain future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How does the court ruling highlight risks for foreign companies listed in the U.S.? It shows the vulnerability of international firms to U.S. legal actions, where court rulings can severely disrupt company operations regardless of home-country governance. Could this case transform corporate treasury strategies? Yes, it may push companies to diversify reserves beyond Bitcoin, balancing liquidity and regulatory risks to safeguard operational stability. What does this mean for Bitcoin’s role in corporate finance? The forced liquidation demonstrates how external legal pressures can compromise Bitcoin-first strategies, raising questions about its reliability as a primary reserve asset. What lessons can other crypto-focused firms learn from this situation? They should prioritize robust legal frameworks and contingency plans to mitigate risks from regulatory and judicial interventions.

42872315,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146234,1743721823,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Data Center Shift: Microsoft Rethinks Global Cloud Expansion,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/microsoft-data-center-cloud-rethink/,"In a surprising turn of events that has the tech world buzzing, particularly those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space who rely heavily on robust cloud infrastructure, reports indicate that Microsoft is pumping the brakes on its ambitious global data center expansion plans. This news, arriving fresh from Bloomberg, suggests a potential recalibration of strategy at the tech giant, leaving many to wonder about the future trajectory of cloud computing and the infrastructure that powers the digital age. Why is Microsoft Reconsidering its Data Center Strategy? According to the Bloomberg report, Microsoft has either halted discussions or delayed development for numerous data center sites across key global locations, including the U.K., Australia, North Dakota, Wisconsin, and Illinois. This pullback comes as a bit of a surprise, especially considering Microsoft’s previously stated commitment to invest heavily in capital expenditures, with a significant portion earmarked for AI infrastructure and related data center expansions in 2025. A Microsoft spokesperson offered a statement to Bloomberg, suggesting that these adjustments reflect the inherent flexibility built into their long-term planning. They emphasized that plans are made years in advance and that these changes are simply a demonstration of strategic agility. However, this explanation raises more questions than answers. Is this a temporary adjustment due to unforeseen challenges, or a more profound shift in Microsoft’s long-term vision for its cloud computing empire? Potential Factors Behind the Data Center Slowdown Several factors could be contributing to Microsoft’s reported pullback. Bloomberg highlights two primary possibilities: Diminished Demand Expectations? Could Microsoft be anticipating a slowdown in demand for cloud computing services? While the cloud market continues to grow, economic uncertainties and shifting business priorities could be influencing future projections. However, with the explosion of AI applications, demand for powerful computing resources would seem to be on an upward trajectory, making this explanation somewhat perplexing. Construction and Resource Challenges: The other potential factor is related to more immediate, practical hurdles. Shortages of power and building materials are real-world constraints impacting construction projects globally. Building and equipping data centers is a massive undertaking, and supply chain disruptions could certainly cause delays and necessitate strategic adjustments. This explanation aligns with Microsoft’s previous statement about shifting focus from new construction to optimizing existing facilities. Microsoft’s AI Ambitions and Data Center Implications Adding another layer of complexity is Microsoft’s aggressive push into Artificial Intelligence. The company has been vocal about its commitment to AI, investing billions in OpenAI and integrating AI across its product suite. AI, especially generative AI and large language models, demands immense computational power, requiring specialized data centers optimized for these workloads. It’s worth remembering that just recently, in February, Microsoft reaffirmed its intention to allocate over $80 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, primarily targeting AI data centers . This commitment underscores the strategic importance of infrastructure in Microsoft’s AI-driven future. Therefore, the current reports of a data center pullback seem contradictory to their stated AI ambitions. What Does This Mean for the Future of Cloud Computing and AI? Microsoft’s actions, as one of the giants in cloud computing , inevitably send ripples across the entire technology landscape. Here’s what this potential shift could signify: Strategic Realignment, Not Retreat: It’s crucial to avoid jumping to conclusions. This might not be a complete abandonment of expansion plans but rather a strategic realignment. Microsoft could be prioritizing efficiency, optimizing existing infrastructure, and focusing investments on the most critical areas, particularly those supporting AI.

Whether it’s PayPal rolling out Chainlink access or tokenized stocks shaking up traditional finance thanks to Ondo, there’s no shortage of big moves happening across the blockchain space. With mainstream platforms jumping into the game and legacy financial models getting disrupted, the hunt for the next big crypto just got a whole lot more real. While all eyes are glued to these headlines, Qubetics ($TICS) is busy building something next-level—something that actually solves real digital privacy problems instead of just repackaging old ideas. It’s offering tools people actually need, like a decentralized VPN powered by blockchain, and its token presale is creating waves that are too loud to ignore. The next big crypto might not just be the one with the most hype—but the one actually offering innovation and utility with serious growth potential. Qubetics’ dVPN: Privacy Without Compromise—The Real-World Fix You’ve Been Waiting For Privacy in today’s digital world feels more like an illusion, especially when traditional VPNs can log and leak user data. Qubetics is flipping that script. Its decentralized VPN (dVPN) runs on a peer-to-peer model where no central authority exists to monitor or restrict traffic. That means you’re not just masking your IP—you’re stepping into a fully secure, censorship-resistant network. This is where blockchain isn’t just a buzzword; it’s the backbone. Picture this: a remote journalist in a restricted region can now safely communicate with sources without risking exposure. Or a fintech startup dealing with confidential transactions gets full end-to-end encryption across all internal comms. That’s what the Qubetics dVPN unlocks. This isn’t just tech talk—it’s real protection for real people. No wonder it’s being watched as the next big crypto that could genuinely reset how we think about secure digital access. Qubetics Presale: The Next Big Crypto Opportunity That’s Heating Up Fast Right now, Qubetics is in its 28th presale stage, and the token is priced at $0.1430. Over $15.8 million has already been raised, with 506 million $TICS tokens sold and a thriving community of 24,300+ token holders. Each stage only lasts 7 days, and when that week wraps on Sunday at midnight, the price jumps by 10%. These limited windows have added urgency—and yeah, people are noticing. Now let’s talk ROI. If $TICS hits just $1, you’re looking at a 599.21% return. At $5, that spikes to 3,396.06%, and if it climbs to $15, early adopters could be sitting on an insane 10,388.18% ROI. A simple $100 investment today? That could become $699 at $1 or as much as $10,485 at $15. These numbers aren’t pulled from the sky—they’re based on solid projections from the current stage. It’s no wonder people are calling this Qubetics presale the best crypto presale of the year and watching it as the next big crypto breakout of 2025. Ondo Is Unleashing the Tokenized Stocks Era—and Wall Street Should Be Nervous According to 99Bitcoins, Ondo is shaking things up by introducing tokenized stocks, and it’s not just a passing trend. Experts are calling tokenized equities a “sleeping mammoth,” and Ondo is leading the charge by bringing traditional stock ownership into the Web3 era. These tokenized shares can be bought in fractional units, traded 24/7, and accessed globally—things Wall Street’s been way too slow to offer. The impact? Massive. Ondo is positioning itself as a bridge between outdated financial systems and the modern, always-on digital economy. The move has sparked renewed attention in how equity ownership is handled and could easily make Ondo the go-to platform for those wanting the convenience of crypto without letting go of real-world asset exposure. As the financial world keeps moving toward decentralization, Ondo might just be the pressure point that forces traditional finance to evolve—or risk getting left behind. Chainlink Gets a Major Boost as PayPal Adds It to the Crypto Lineup Chainlink just got a serious visibility upgrade thanks to PayPal. As reported by TronWeekly, the payments giant has now integrated Chainlink (LINK) into its digital asset offerings for U.S. users. That’s a huge move, signaling that major payment platforms are now embracing decentralized oracle networks as core components of their crypto strategy. Following the announcement, Chainlink’s value climbed 2.5%, a strong indicator of renewed market interest. The integration means Chainlink’s role in providing secure, real-world data to smart contracts is gaining traction with mainstream users—something that’s been years in the making. PayPal is already exploring Web3-compatible solutions and stablecoin integration, and now with Chainlink in the mix, they’re doubling down on making decentralized finance accessible to their massive user base. It’s a win not just for LINK but for the broader adoption of decentralized infrastructure in the U.S. financial landscape. The Final Verdict: A Trio of Titans in the Race for Crypto’s Future There’s no denying the momentum behind these three power players. Qubetics is making internet privacy real again with a decentralized VPN that actually works for everyday users and enterprises. Ondo is transforming how people think about stock ownership with its tokenized equities, and Chainlink is securing a front-row seat in mainstream finance through its game-changing integration with PayPal.

42872564,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146238,1743722419,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unlock AI Coding Power: Devin AI Unveils Affordable Pay-As-You-Go Plan,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/devin-ai-pay-as-you-go/,"The buzz around AI-powered coding assistants is deafening, and at the forefront of this revolution is Devin AI. Remember the viral sensation that promised to automate software development? Well, Devin, from the startup Cognition, is back with a twist that could make it more accessible to developers everywhere – a new pay-as-you-go plan. For those in the crypto and blockchain space, constantly seeking cutting-edge tech to streamline development, this could be a game-changer. Let’s dive into what this means for you. Demystifying Devin AI: Your Autonomous AI Coding Agent When Cognition first launched Devin AI , it wasn’t just another tool; it was a viral moment. Social media exploded with demos showcasing its autonomous software development capabilities. Imagine an AI coding agent that could tackle coding tasks independently – the possibilities seemed endless. While initial hype met reality checks regarding complex projects, the sheer potential was undeniable, even earning endorsements from AI visionaries like Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, significantly boosting Cognition’s profile. Initially, Devin AI was positioned as a premium tool for teams, priced at a hefty $500 per month. However, just weeks after a reported massive funding round, Cognition has introduced a more budget-friendly entry point: a $20 plan that transitions into a pay-as-you-go plan . But is this new plan truly affordable, and what does it mean for developers looking to leverage AI software development ? Breaking Down the Pay-As-You-Go Plan: Is it Worth the Cost? The allure of a pay-as-you-go plan is clear – flexibility and potentially lower upfront costs. But with Devin AI, the devil is in the details, or rather, in the ACUs (Autonomous Compute Units). Here’s a breakdown: Initial Entry: $20 gets you started with approximately 9 ACUs. ACU Cost: On the $20 plan, ACUs are priced at $2.25 each, a slight increase from the $2 cost on the $500 monthly subscription. Work Equivalence: Cognition states that 15 minutes of “active Devin work” consumes about 1 ACU. Limited Hours: 9 ACUs translate to roughly 2.25 hours of active Devin work. For developers wrestling with extensive codebases or complex projects, 2.25 hours might seem like a drop in the ocean. The pay-as-you-go plan ’s cost-effectiveness hinges heavily on usage patterns. If you anticipate sporadic use for smaller tasks, it could be economical. However, for intensive, daily coding assistance, the costs could quickly escalate. Consider this table for a clearer picture: Plan Initial Cost ACUs Included ACU Cost Approx. Active Work Time Pay-as-you-go ($20 plan) $20 9 $2.25 2.25 hours Monthly Subscription $500 ~250 (estimated, based on ACU cost) $2.00 ~62.5 hours (estimated) It’s crucial to evaluate your anticipated usage to determine if the pay-as-you-go plan truly offers savings or if the monthly subscription remains a more predictable and potentially cost-effective option for heavy users. Devin 2.0: Significant Improvements or Just Hype? Cognition emphasizes that today’s Devin – Devin AI 2.0 – is a substantial upgrade from its initial December release. Drawing parallels with GitHub Copilot, Devin now boasts enhanced capabilities: Project Planning: Devin can assist in generating comprehensive plans for coding projects. Code Q&A with Citations: Get answers to code-related questions with source citations for verification. Code Wikis: Devin can create documentation “wikis” for codebases, improving project understanding and collaboration. Silas Alberti from Devin’s development team even claims a “twofold increase in work output.” While these improvements sound promising for AI software development , it’s wise to approach such claims with healthy skepticism. Independent evaluations are crucial to validate these assertions. The Lingering Challenges of AI Coding Agents Despite advancements, the current landscape of AI coding agent technology, including Devin AI , isn’t without its hurdles. Studies consistently highlight potential pitfalls: Security Vulnerabilities: AI-generated code can introduce security weaknesses. Bugs and Errors: Flaws in understanding complex programming logic can lead to errors. Task Completion Rate: One recent evaluation noted Devin successfully completing only 3 out of 20 tasks. These challenges underscore that while Devin AI and similar tools are evolving rapidly, they are not yet a complete replacement for human developers. They are best viewed as powerful assistants, capable of augmenting and accelerating the development process, but requiring careful oversight and validation by experienced programmers. Actionable Insights: Should You Try Devin AI’s Pay-As-You-Go Plan? The introduction of a pay-as-you-go plan for Devin AI definitely lowers the barrier to entry. Here’s a practical approach to consider: Assess Your Needs: Evaluate your coding tasks. Are they small, frequent, or large and complex? Test the Waters: The $20 plan offers a low-risk way to experiment with Devin 2.0 and gauge its effectiveness for your workflow. Monitor ACU Usage: Carefully track your ACU consumption to understand potential costs beyond the initial $20. Compare with Alternatives: Explore other AI coding agent tools and compare pricing models and features. For crypto and blockchain developers, who often work on fast-paced projects and need to stay ahead of the curve, exploring Devin AI ’s capabilities could offer a competitive edge. However, a cautious and data-driven approach is recommended. Start with the pay-as-you-go plan , experiment with specific tasks, and measure the actual time and cost savings before committing to heavier usage. Conclusion: AI-Powered Coding is Evolving – Proceed with Prudence Cognition AI ’s new pay-as-you-go plan for Devin AI marks a significant step towards broader accessibility of advanced AI software development tools. While the promise of an autonomous AI coding agent is compelling, it’s essential to remain grounded in the current realities. Devin 2.0 shows improvements, but like all AI assistants, it’s a tool that requires careful evaluation and strategic implementation. The pay-as-you-go plan offers a tempting entry point, allowing developers to explore its potential without a hefty upfront commitment.

If you thought the crypto markets were volatile, take a look at Wall Street. Yesterday saw a significant shakeup in the traditional financial world as all three major U.S. stock indexes took a nosedive. Was it just a blip, or is this the start of something bigger? Let’s dive into what happened and what it could mean for your investments. Decoding the Stock Market Crash: A Sea of Red The numbers don’t lie. The trading day concluded with a stark reminder of market volatility. Here’s a snapshot of the damage: S&P 500: Dropped by a staggering 4.84% Nasdaq: Tech-heavy Nasdaq took an even bigger hit, plummeting 5.97% Dow Jones Industrial Average: The stalwart Dow wasn’t spared, falling by 3.98% To put this into perspective, these aren’t just minor dips. These are substantial declines that signal a significant shift in market sentiment. A near 5% drop in the S&P 500? That’s the kind of day that makes headlines and sends shivers down investors’ spines. This wasn’t just a bad day; it was a full-blown stock market crash for many. What Triggered This Market Correction? Unpacking the Reasons Behind the Fall So, what caused this sudden downturn? While pinpointing one single cause is often impossible, a confluence of factors likely contributed to this sharp market correction . Let’s break down some potential culprits: Inflation Fears Persist: Despite efforts to curb inflation, concerns remain about its persistence. Recent economic data might be suggesting that inflation is proving stickier than anticipated, leading to worries about more aggressive interest rate hikes. Interest Rate Hikes Loom Larger: The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates to combat inflation. However, the market is now bracing for potentially larger and more frequent rate increases, which can dampen economic growth and corporate earnings. Geopolitical Uncertainty: Global events always cast a shadow over the markets. Ongoing conflicts and international tensions can create instability and uncertainty, prompting investors to pull back. Weakening Economic Data: Concerns about a potential economic downturn are growing. If economic indicators start to weaken, suggesting slower growth or even recession, investors tend to become risk-averse and sell off stocks. It’s a complex web of interconnected factors, but the overarching theme is fear and uncertainty. The market hates uncertainty, and right now, there’s plenty of it to go around. Investor Sentiment Takes a Hit: Are Panic Buttons Being Pressed? Unsurprisingly, this market plunge has had a significant impact on investor sentiment . When markets experience such dramatic drops, fear and anxiety tend to creep in. Here’s how investor psychology might be playing out: Fear of Further Losses: No one wants to see their portfolio shrink. Large market declines can trigger panic selling as investors try to cut their losses and move to safer assets. Risk Aversion Rises: In times of market turmoil, investors generally become more risk-averse. They may shift away from stocks and other risky assets towards bonds, cash, or even precious metals. Long-Term vs. Short-Term Views: The market reaction often depends on whether investors are taking a long-term or short-term view. Long-term investors might see this as a buying opportunity, while short-term traders might be more inclined to sell and run. Understanding investor sentiment is crucial because it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. If enough investors panic and sell, it can exacerbate the market decline, creating a downward spiral. Is This Just a Dip, or a Deeper Stock Market Decline? Navigating the Uncertainty The million-dollar question everyone’s asking is: Is this just a temporary setback, a healthy stock market decline that will eventually recover, or is it the beginning of a more prolonged bear market? Unfortunately, no one has a crystal ball, but we can consider a few scenarios: Scenario Description Potential Impact Short-Term Volatility The market experiences a sharp drop but stabilizes and recovers relatively quickly. Could be a buying opportunity for long-term investors. Short-term traders face higher risk. Extended Correction The market remains volatile for a longer period, with ups and downs but no clear upward trend. Requires patience and careful portfolio management. Focus on quality assets and diversification. Bear Market A prolonged and significant market downturn, potentially lasting months or even years. More challenging for investors. Requires defensive strategies, risk management, and potentially adjusting portfolio allocations. Predicting the future is impossible, but being prepared for different scenarios is essential. It’s crucial to stay informed, monitor market developments, and adjust your investment strategy as needed. Actionable Insights: What Should Investors Do Now? Seeing your portfolio value decrease can be unsettling, but it’s important to avoid knee-jerk reactions. Here are some actionable steps to consider in the face of market volatility: Stay Calm and Avoid Panic Selling: Emotional decisions are rarely good in investing. Resist the urge to sell everything in a panic. Review Your Portfolio: Assess your current asset allocation. Is it still aligned with your risk tolerance and long-term goals? Consider Diversification: A well-diversified portfolio can help cushion the blow during market downturns. Ensure you’re not overly concentrated in any single asset class. Think Long-Term: Market corrections are a normal part of the investment cycle. Focus on your long-term investment goals and remember that markets have historically recovered from downturns. Seek Professional Advice: If you’re feeling uncertain or overwhelmed, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance. Remember, market downturns, even significant ones like this stock market decline , can present opportunities for savvy investors. It’s a time to be cautious, but also to be strategic. Conclusion: Navigating the Stormy Seas of the Stock Market Yesterday’s market plunge serves as a stark reminder of the inherent volatility of the stock market. The significant drops in the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones reflect deep-seated concerns about inflation, interest rates, and the potential for an economic downturn . While the immediate future remains uncertain, history teaches us that markets are cyclical. By staying informed, remaining calm, and focusing on a long-term investment strategy, investors can weather these stormy seas and position themselves for future growth. The key is to not panic, but to prepare and adapt.

BONK just flashed a double-bottom reversal, and DOGS dropped a hyped-up roadmap promising games, gift card utility, and global payment use cases. The meme coin scene is shaking, and traders are watching every wiggle. But while BONK fights resistance and DOGS builds community buzz, BTFD Coin (BTFD) is giving investors something far more predictable: an ROI roadmap that’s written in numbers. With a 90% APY staking setup, a 2900% ROI potential baked into its current presale price of $0.0002, and only one stage left before the final launch, BTFD isn’t just another meme coin—it’s your moon mission ticket. Presales like BTFD are where smart investors dodge volatility, skip the drama, and lock in coins at launchpad prices before the crowd catches on. From an active referral program to a fully live Play-to-Earn game, BTFD has won the hearts of over 11,700 Bulls. Want to turn a simple $4500 into life-changing returns? This article dives into why BTFD Coin might be the best meme coin to buy today while checking in on BONK’s recent surge and DOGS’ expanding roadmap. Time to stack, stake, and secure your shot at generational gains. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Is This the $0.0002 Dip You’ll Regret Missing? Here’s the million-dollar question: What if a $4500 investment today could grow into $135,000 in just months? That’s exactly what’s on the table with BTFD Coin . At its current Stage 15 price of $0.0002, every $4500 scores you 22.5 million BTFD coins. By the time the presale wraps and BTFD lists at $0.0006, your stash triples to $13,500. But that’s just scratching the surface. Analysts are eyeing BTFD’s potential “moon price” at $0.006. At that level? Your $4500 haul explodes into $135,000, a jaw-dropping 2900% ROI. And the window to get in at these prices is slamming shut—Stage 16 is next, then it’s full launch mode. Why the hype? First, BTFD gives you serious staking power. With a massive 90% APY, holders aren’t just betting on price hikes—they’re compounding their stack like clockwork. That kind of passive income is almost unheard of in meme coin land, and it adds long-term utility that most memes can’t match. Need more juice? The BTFD Play-to-Earn game is live, letting users earn tokens while playing. Over 72 billion BTFD coins have been sold so far, raising more than $6.45 million. And the community? It’s wild, with over 11,700 holders rallying behind the Bulls Squad and their dip-chasing mission. Add a killer referral program on top—offering 10% bonuses for both you and your referrals—and it’s clear: BTFD isn’t just a meme coin, it’s a movement. Want in? Here’s how to buy BTFD Coin before Stage 16 launches: Go to the BTFD Presale , connect your wallet, enter your purchase amount, and hit “Buy Now.” No rocket science, just smart timing. Secure your tokens before it’s too late. BTFD or get left behind. BONK (BONK): Reversal Pattern Spotted Amid Bearish Pressure After a brutal 50% drop over the past two months, BONK may be staging a comeback. Technical traders are eyeing a double bottom pattern around $0.00001112, signaling potential for reversal if BONK breaks above $0.00001240. While momentum is still shaky, BONK recently pumped over 10% in 24 hours, and trading volume surged 128% to $159.13M. It’s a short-term trader’s playground, but far less predictable than a presale play like BTFD. Dogs (DOGS): Roadmap Unleashed With Games, Gift Cards & Payments DOGS just dropped alpha on its roadmap, teasing DOGS-themed games and IRL payment utility with gift cards and travel bookings. Currently priced at $0.00012687, DOGS plans to expand community use cases by mid-2025. Some analysts predict DOGS could rally 227.43% by April 27. While promising, it lacks the staking income and ROI clarity that BTFD brings to the table. Claim This Huge ROI Before the Window Closes This might be your last shot to buy the best meme coin to buy today at launchpad-level pricing. BTFD Coin’s 90% staking APY and a potential 2900% ROI make it the most compelling meme coin presale we’ve seen in years. Presale started at just $0.000004. Today? Still only $0.0002. You do the math. The final stage is next, and listing is locked at $0.0006. Want more? Jump into BTFD’s referral program and earn 10% BTFD bonuses when others buy using your code. Share it. Stack it. Dominate the leaderboard. Just visit the presale site, connect your wallet, and your referral code is ready to roll. Don’t sleep on this one. Presales like this don’t stay quiet for long. Load your bull sack. Conclusion: Your Dip. Your Decision. Your Shot at 2900% Gains Based on current market moves, expert predictions, and raw presale numbers, BTFD Coin is easily the best meme coin to buy today. While BONK battles resistance and DOGS plays the long game, BTFD lets you stack coins at $0.0002, stake at 90% APY, and aim for a moonshot $0.006. Don’t be the person who reads about this coin after it’s already pumped. Join before the BTFD Coin presale ends—because the Bulls are charging, and this stampede doesn’t wait.

42873549,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146270,1743724210,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary AI Kindle Recaps: Never Forget a Book Series Plot Again!,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-kindle-recaps-book-series/,"Ever found yourself lost returning to a beloved book series after a break? It’s a common reader’s woe – trying to recall intricate plot details and character relationships. Amazon Kindle is stepping in to banish this frustration with a brand-new, incredibly helpful feature: AI Recaps . Imagine effortlessly refreshing your memory before diving into the next installment of your favorite saga. Sounds amazing, right? Let’s explore how this AI -powered feature is changing the reading game, especially for those of us juggling multiple book worlds. What are Amazon Kindle’s New AI Recaps? Amazon is rolling out a “Recaps” feature for Kindle users designed to solve a very specific problem: series amnesia! Before you jump into the latest novel in a series, this feature offers a quick way to catch up on key plot points and character developments from previous books. While Amazon ‘s official announcement played it coy about the tech behind it, Bitcoin World confirmed the secret sauce – it’s AI ! According to Amazon spokesperson Ale Iraheta, these recaps are AI -generated, utilizing “GenAI and Amazon moderators” to ensure accuracy. Think of it as having a super-efficient, AI -powered study guide for your favorite book series , right within your Kindle device and soon on the Kindle app for iOS. Why is Amazon Using AI for Book Recaps? Why turn to AI for something like book series recaps? It boils down to efficiency and scale. Manually creating summaries for thousands of eBooks in series would be a monumental task. GenAI offers a scalable solution, capable of quickly processing vast amounts of text and extracting key information. Here’s a breakdown of the likely benefits for Amazon and readers: Scalability : AI can generate recaps for a massive library of book series much faster than human editors. Efficiency : Automated AI recaps reduce the time and resources needed compared to manual methods. Consistency : AI algorithms can provide a consistent format and level of detail across all recaps. Reader Convenience : Ultimately, AI recaps offer readers a convenient and instant way to refresh their memory, enhancing the reading experience. Concerns and Accuracy: Are AI Kindle Recaps Reliable? The introduction of AI recaps hasn’t been without a ripple of concern. Readers on platforms like Reddit are questioning the accuracy of AI -generated summaries. Will AI truly capture the nuances of complex plots and character arcs? This is a valid question, especially considering the early stages of GenAI in content creation. Amazon assures users that they are taking accuracy seriously, stating they use “technology, including GenAI and Amazon moderators” to create recaps that “accurately reflect book content.” The involvement of human moderators is a reassuring sign, suggesting a hybrid approach to quality control. However, Bitcoin World has rightly requested more details about this moderation process to understand the checks and balances in place. It’s crucial to remember that AI is a tool, and its effectiveness depends on its training and oversight. While GenAI has made incredible strides, it’s not infallible. Reader feedback and ongoing refinement will be essential to ensure Kindle AI recaps become a truly reliable and helpful feature. How to Access and Use Kindle AI Recaps Eager to try out these AI recaps ? Here’s how you can access them on your Kindle device: Software Update : Ensure your Kindle is running the latest software version. Locate Series Page : Go to your Kindle Library and find the page for a book series you’ve purchased or borrowed. Look for “View Recaps” Button : On the series page, look for the “View Recaps” button. Alternatively, Use Three-Dot Menu : You can also find the “View Recaps” option within the three-dot menu when viewing a series grouping. Spoiler Warning : Before accessing the recap, you’ll receive a spoiler warning – a helpful heads-up that major plot points will be revealed. Enjoy the Recap : Acknowledge the warning, and you’ll be taken to the AI -generated recap for the book series . Currently, AI recaps are available for thousands of best-selling English-language eBooks in series for Kindle device users in the United States. Amazon plans to expand this feature to the Kindle app for iOS soon, bringing AI -powered convenience to even more readers. What Kind of Book Series Benefit from AI Recaps? Amazon highlights that AI recaps are designed to be useful across all genres, from epic fantasy sagas to intricate mystery thrillers. Think about series with: Complex Worlds : Fantasy, science fiction, and historical fiction series often have vast and detailed worlds that can be hard to keep track of. Large Casts of Characters : Series with many characters, especially those with interconnected storylines, benefit greatly from character recaps. Intricate Plots : Mystery, thriller, and suspense series with twisty plots can be easier to follow with a quick recap of previous events. Long-Running Series : For series with many books released over years, recaps are invaluable for refreshing your memory before each new installment. Whether you’re diving into a sprawling fantasy epic or catching up on a cozy mystery series, AI recaps promise to enhance your reading experience. The Future of Reading with AI Assistance Amazon Kindle ‘s AI Recaps feature signals an exciting direction for the future of reading. AI is increasingly being integrated into various aspects of our lives, and now it’s lending a hand to enhance our literary journeys. While concerns about accuracy and AI ‘s role in creative fields are valid, the potential benefits for readers are undeniable. Imagine a future where AI assists with personalized reading recommendations, provides deeper insights into literary themes, or even helps authors with research and writing tools. Kindle AI Recaps might just be the first step in a broader integration of AI into the world of books, making reading more accessible, engaging, and enjoyable for everyone.

But despite recent bullish sentiment, both coins appear to be losing momentum in early Q2 2025. Ethereum is hovering around the $1,700–$1,900 range, while XRP remains volatile, currently trading near $2.01 following a brief post-settlement rebound from the SEC case. While ETH’s technical indicators show signs of potential strength, analysts say the lack of volume and on-chain activity could stall a major breakout. Similarly, XRP’s settlement with the SEC brought some clarity, but long-term bullish momentum remains uncertain. That’s why many early-stage investors are now turning their attention to a new project showing real traction and upside: MAGACOIN FINANCE . MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Traction with Early Buyers Unlike legacy tokens that may have already priced in much of their growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE is a brand-new presale project with clear upside and growing investor demand. With a starting price of just $0.0002704 and a confirmed listing price of $0.007 , the early presale offers over +2,500% ROI for first movers — a return that’s hard to ignore in today’s sideways market. As of now, MAGACOIN FINANCE has raised over $5 million in early contributions and already surpassed 10,000 holders , signaling strong confidence from retail and early-stage crypto communities alike. Key Differences That Have Investors Paying Attention GET 50% EXTRA TOKENS INSTANTLY — USE PROMO CODE: MAGA50X BEFORE IT EXPIRES Here’s why MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly separating itself from the altcoin crowd: • New Presale Just Launched — not yet listed, so upside is still ahead • Over $5M Already Raised — momentum is building fast • Staged Price Model — rewards early participation with lower prices • Listing Price Locked at $0.007 — giving transparency for future valuation • Over 2,500% ROI Built In — based on current presale vs. listing price Investors are beginning to view MAGACOIN FINANCE as a potential breakout coin in the next cycle — especially while ETH and XRP continue to consolidate . The Bottom Line Ethereum and XRP still have long-term relevance, but their near-term upside looks limited. With both struggling to break key resistance levels, many investors are looking further down the market cap list for the next major mover. MAGACOIN FINANCE might be exactly that — a well-structured new project with real momentum, massive upside, and a dedicated early community. As the presale continues to gain attention, those who move early could be the ones positioned to benefit the most in 2025.

Cardano is on the verge of a surge with positive market indicators and heightened long-term holder interest. Ripple is finalizing legal issues with a smaller SEC fine, providing regulatory clarity but minimal expansion in immediate applications. BlockDAG (BDAG) is leveraging its Beta Testnet as a comprehensive ecosystem trial—facilitating user and developer activity, rolling out smart contracts, and integrating miners and users. With 19 billion coins already sold and $210.5 million collected in its presale, BlockDAG’s practical application of its testnet goes beyond theory, serving as a real-world model for blockchain’s immediate future. Cardano Eyes for Breakout Cardano (ADA) is currently trading between $0.699 and $0.75. A strong push beyond $0.76 could lead to a 13% price jump, aiming for $0.85. The 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at about $0.75 acts as a resistance point. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) near 60 signals a possible uptick. Meanwhile, traders have significant positions at $0.712 and $0.76, totaling $18.25 million in longs and $8.50 million in shorts. A rise above $0.76 might clear these shorts, propelling further advances. Ongoing withdrawals of ADA from exchanges since March 13 suggest accumulation by steadfast supporters, bolstering a bullish stance. Ripple Lawsuit Settled Ripple Labs has settled its lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), agreeing to a reduced fine of $50 million from the initial $125 million. This settlement, awaiting confirmation from both the SEC and the judge, closes a crucial chapter in ongoing discussions between regulatory entities and the crypto industry. Ripple has not conceded any legal errors in this settlement. Additionally, the SEC has withdrawn its appeal on a previous decision that XRP tokens traded on public exchanges are not securities. This resolution is a key development for Ripple and could impact the regulatory framework for digital currencies. BlockDAG Beta Testnet: Pioneering Real-World Use BlockDAG’s “Primordial” Beta Testnet is more than a testing ground—it’s a hub of active development. Developers are now deploying smart contracts, testing features, and using tools like a bespoke IDE, blockchain explorer, and wallet setup guide. Concurrently, miners and users engage in competitions with rewards of $2,000 in BDAG for top performers in transactions, mining, and wallet holdings. Additionally, the testnet is accelerating user engagement. Each participant in the presale is granted 10,000 test tokens, which mature over three weeks and can be tracked via a specialized dApp. This strategy encourages real interaction ahead of the mainnet launch. On the funding front, the momentum of the crypto presale is impressive. More than 19 billion coins have sold, amassing $210.5 million. Currently, in its 27th batch priced at $0.0248, the project boasts a 2,380% ROI from the first batch. With its EVM compatibility and comprehensive support infrastructure, the testnet serves not merely as a rehearsal but as a launchpad for BlockDAG’s ambitious future. Pioneers of Progress: BlockDAG Versus the Rest While Cardano focuses on potential price escalations and Ripple concludes its regulatory negotiations, BlockDAG rigorously tests its network in real-world scenarios. This isn’t just about validating technology—it’s about readying the community of users, developers, and miners for a fully operational mainnet. With incentives directly linked to active participation and tools already available for deploying contracts, BlockDAG’s testnet is far from just a temporary setup—it’s a critical component of their offering. As other blockchain initiatives balance visibility with practical utility, BlockDAG’s proactive approach during its Beta phase demonstrates it’s not merely preparing for mainnet functionality—it’s already proving its capabilities.

The latest updates on PI coin price and Hedera (HBAR) price outlook have stirred mixed emotions—one falling over 76% from its peak, the other rallying on institutional buzz. But while the noise builds around these names, a shift is happening elsewhere. All eyes are turning to BlockDAG , the top trending crypto that’s not just promising more—it’s already delivering. Keynote 3 changed everything. With a real beta testnet, 800K+ X1 miners, and 15,000 TPS potential, BlockDAG has leapfrogged Ethereum, Solana, and even Bitcoin in both performance and accessibility. It’s the first real hybrid of PoW + DAG, using Phantom and GhostDAG to confirm blocks in parallel. The future’s not coming—it’s already live. BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 Just Changed the Game BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 is the moment many in crypto didn’t see coming. While Ethereum still struggles with congestion and Solana faces repeated outages, BlockDAG introduced a network that delivers both power and simplicity. Its hybrid Proof-of-Work + DAG architecture is built to handle 15,000 transactions per second—far more than most major Layer 1s—without the energy cost you’d expect from a PoW system. That scalability makes BlockDAG not just another altcoin story, but a real Layer 1 alternative with substance. At the core of this performance is the Phantom + GhostDAG protocol. Instead of waiting for one block to be confirmed at a time, BlockDAG processes multiple blocks simultaneously. This parallel structure reduces confirmation times, boosts network throughput, and removes the bottlenecks that hold back most chains. It’s a major shift from how people have been told blockchains “should” work. And now that it’s live on beta testnet, it’s no longer theoretical. Keynote 3 delivered more than hype—it showed results. Over 800,000 users are now mining with the X1 app. BlockDAG’s TG Tap Miner has crossed 400,000 users with 100,000 active daily. Meanwhile, the presale has raised over $210.5 million, with 19.1 billion BDAG coins sold. Current pricing in Batch 27 is $0.0248, offering a 2,380% return since Batch 1. It’s one of the reasons BlockDAG is now a top trending crypto across multiple platforms. But it’s not just about numbers. The launch of BlockDAG Academy, ambassador programs, and global workshops points to something long-term. This isn’t about speculation—it’s about building. Keynote 3 proved it: your crypto bag is outdated. BlockDAG is already on the next page. No wonder it’s quickly becoming the top trending crypto everyone’s switching to. What’s Next for the PI Coin Price After Its Drop? The PI coin price hit $2.99 just days after its February 20 launch but has since dropped over 76%, now sitting around $0.70. The sell-off followed mainnet issues, listing rejections from major exchanges like Binance and Bybit, and a shift in user verification from phone numbers to email-based 2FA. These changes caused uncertainty and added pressure to an already volatile chart. Technically, Pi is still holding above key support at $0.6450. A bullish reversal could push the PI coin price back to $1, with $1.22 as the next short-term target. However, if sentiment turns bearish again, it could fall to $0.50. The MACD remains neutral, but EMA signals are hinting at a Golden Cross. Right now, traders are watching closely, but the hype has definitely cooled since launch week. Why the Hedera (HBAR) price outlook Just Got Interesting The Hedera (HBAR) price outlook saw a boost after the team announced HashSphere—a new private-to-public blockchain tailored for institutional users. It supports HBAR, stablecoins, and tokenized real-world assets, and will be compatible with Ethereum’s EVM. This triggered a 10% price jump, helping HBAR bounce off its recent low of $0.1568. Still trading around $0.1685, HBAR remains nearly 70% below its all-time high of $0.5692. Technical indicators show RSI levels at 45 and 33, pointing to a potential upward move if $0.20 is reclaimed. The Hedera (HBAR) price outlook now depends on whether HashSphere’s Q3 launch delivers more traction and usage. With backing from firms like Google and IBM, HBAR’s long-term potential is solid, even if concerns about validator centralization still linger. Summing Up The recent drop in the PI coin price and the cautious Hedera (HBAR) price outlook show how quickly momentum can shift. Both networks are facing major turning points—Pi with its tech updates and Hedera with its push into institutional use. But while they’re figuring things out, BlockDAG is already several steps ahead. Keynote 3 made it clear why BlockDAG is the top trending crypto. With real testnet progress, scalable performance at 15,000 TPS, and its hybrid PoW + DAG setup, it’s setting a new standard. Add in global workshops, the BlockDAG Academy, and 800K+ users on its X1 app, and it’s no surprise why users are switching. Your crypto bag is outdated. The next chapter is here—and BlockDAG is writing it.

42873892,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146277,1743724867,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Rejection: Teen AI App Prodigy with 4.0 GPA Denied by 15 Top Universities,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-app-teen-college-rejection/,"In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency and disruptive tech, we often celebrate young innovators breaking barriers and achieving remarkable feats outside traditional systems. But what happens when a prodigious teen, already making waves with a viral AI app , encounters a seemingly conventional hurdle: college rejection ? Meet Zach Yadegari, the 17-year-old co-founder of Cal AI, a calorie-counting application that’s taken the app stores by storm. Despite a perfect 4.0 GPA, a stellar 34 ACT score, and real-world success as a teen entrepreneur , Yadegari faced a wave of rejections from 15 out of 18 top-tier universities, sparking a massive online debate about the true value of traditional education versus entrepreneurial drive. The Viral Sensation: Cal AI and a Teen’s Triumph Before diving into the college rejection saga, let’s understand what makes Zach Yadegari’s story so compelling. He isn’t just another bright student; he’s a proven innovator in the tech space. Cal AI, the AI app he co-founded, isn’t some small project – it’s a viral hit. Reports suggest it has surpassed 1 million downloads and boasts overwhelmingly positive reviews, putting it on track for millions in annual revenue. While specific revenue figures are unverified, the app’s popularity is undeniable. But Cal AI wasn’t Yadegari’s first foray into entrepreneurial success. He previously sold a web gaming company for a substantial $100,000. This track record underscores his innate talent and business acumen, making his college rejection letters even more perplexing to many. Why College? A Hacker House Epiphany Interestingly, university admissions weren’t always Yadegari’s priority. After spending a summer in a San Francisco hacker house, immersed in building the Cal AI prototype, he initially leaned towards the path of a college dropout tech entrepreneur. However, this experience led to a crucial realization. He recognized that bypassing college meant missing out on a significant phase of personal growth and development. He eloquently described this shift in his viral essay, stating: “In my rejection of the collegiate path, I had unwittingly bound myself to another framework of expectations: the archetypal dropout founder. Instead of schoolteachers, it was VCs and mentors steering me toward a direction that was still not my own.” This epiphany motivated him to apply to universities, seeking a more holistic learning experience beyond coding and revenue streams. He articulated his desire to learn from diverse perspectives, not just digital resources, aiming to “elevate the work I have always done” through human interaction and academic rigor. His essay highlighted this evolved perspective, emphasizing his newfound appreciation for the value of a college education in broadening his horizons and amplifying his impact. The Essay That Sparked a Firestorm: Authenticity or Arrogance? Yadegari’s application essay, which he openly shared on X, became a central point of contention in the online debate surrounding his university admissions fate. In it, he candidly discussed his initial aversion to college, detailing his journey as a self-taught coder and the financial success he achieved. He recounted how venture capitalists and mentors reinforced the notion that college was unnecessary for him. This narrative, while honest, seemed to some as lacking the conventional eagerness for higher education that university admissions committees typically seek. Despite his impressive academic record and real-world achievements, rejections poured in from institutions like Stanford, MIT, Harvard, Columbia, Princeton, Duke, and Cornell. He did receive acceptances from Georgia Tech, University of Texas, and University of Miami, solid options, but not the Ivy League cohort that many expected for someone with his profile. X Marks the Spot: 22 Million Views and a Torrent of Opinions Yadegari’s tweet about his widespread college rejection went viral, amassing over 22 million views and thousands of comments. The reactions were diverse and often sharply divided: Essay Criticism: Many commenters labeled his essay as “arrogant,” suggesting it conveyed a lack of genuine interest in learning within a traditional academic environment. They argued that university admissions officers likely perceived him as someone who was applying to college almost as an afterthought, rather than with true enthusiasm. System Critique: Others directed their criticism at the university admissions system itself, echoing familiar complaints about its often opaque and seemingly arbitrary nature. They argued that a system that overlooks a proven teen entrepreneur with stellar grades and test scores is fundamentally flawed. Insightful Observations: Perhaps the most constructive feedback centered on the idea that colleges prioritize candidates who demonstrate a genuine thirst for knowledge and a high likelihood of graduating. Yadegari’s essay, in its candid portrayal of his initial reluctance towards college, may have inadvertently signaled a lack of commitment to the traditional academic path, despite his eventual change of heart. Garry Tan Weighs In: Ayn Rand and College Rejection Even Y Combinator’s Garry Tan chimed in on X, sharing his own experience with widespread college rejection and waitlists. Tan humorously confessed that his own application essays, heavily influenced by Ayn Rand’s philosophy after reading ‘The Fountainhead,’ might have contributed to his initial setbacks. While Tan eventually gained admission to Stanford, his anecdote highlights the subjective and sometimes unpredictable nature of university admissions , where even philosophical influences can play a role. Beyond Business Success: A Teen’s Evolving Perspective Speaking to Bitcoin World, Yadegari expressed his fascination with the diverse responses to his viral post. He acknowledged the varied perspectives and the inherent uncertainty in understanding the exact reasons for his college rejection . However, he emphasized his commitment to authenticity, stating, “At the end of the day, when I wrote my essay, I hoped admissions offices would perceive me as authentic because that’s all I ever want to be.” Importantly, Yadegari also revealed a significant shift in his priorities. Having achieved considerable business success at a young age, he now recognizes that “life was not just about financial success. It is about relationships, and about being a part of a larger community.” This evolving perspective underscores a maturity beyond his years, suggesting that his pursuit of higher education is driven by a deeper desire for personal growth and community engagement, rather than solely career advancement. While the college rejection saga of this teen entrepreneur has sparked debate and offered insights into the complexities of university admissions , it also highlights a crucial point: success can be defined in many ways. For Zach Yadegari, despite the initial disappointment, this experience seems to be shaping a more nuanced understanding of achievement and personal fulfillment, proving that even in the face of rejection, growth and learning continue.

The findings, which come from Glassnode’s newly published report titled “Rippling Away,” reveal that while Bitcoin market indicators edge closer to a bearish zone, XRP has seen remarkable inflows of capital and user activity—albeit with signs of waning momentum. According to Glassnode’s report, Bitcoin has been consolidating between the $76,000 and $87,000 price range. Indicators such as the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio are showing “signs of near-term seller exhaustion but not yet a renewal of sustained bullish momentum.” Furthermore, a longer-term on-chain “Death-Cross” suggests the market’s current weakness could persist for some time. “Supply in loss remains elevated at 4.7M BTC,” the report states, underlining the depth of investor stress. These conditions, as Glassnode notes, paint a picture of “deepening bearish conditions” for the leading cryptocurrency. Retail Flocks To XRP In contrast to Bitcoin’s cautionary signals, Glassnode points to XRP as a proxy for heightened retail speculation this cycle. The report highlights: “For this cycle in particular, Ripple (XRP) has been a preferred asset for trade amongst retail investors, and studying its behavior can, therefore, serve as a proxy for measuring retail speculative demand.” Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction For April: Analyst Explains What To Expect From the 2022 cycle low, XRP’s daily active addresses have “jumped by +490%” on a quarterly average basis, while Bitcoin’s rose by only 10%. This sharp divergence underscores the retail community’s enthusiasm for XRP, which Glassnode views as indicative of broader speculative appetite in the market. The enthusiasm for XRP translated into a near-doubling of its Realized Cap—leaping from $30.1 billion to $64.2 billion during its rally from December 2024 to early 2025. Glassnode estimates that approximately $30 billion of this new capital came in over the last six months, pointing to a fresh wave of market participants. Alongside the short surge in capital flows, there’s been a rapid concentration of wealth in the hands of new investors,” the report explains. However, Glassnode also warns: “When viewed together with the heavy retail participation, this sharp uplift in new holders raises caution signs.” Related Reading: XRP Bull Cycle Could End If This Happens: Analyst Glassnode warns that these new investors are vulnerable to downside volatility, especially as XRP’s cost basis becomes more top-heavy. Thus, despite initial excitement, the report notes a cooling of speculative interest since late February 2025. Glassnode’s Realized Loss/Profit Ratio for XRP has declined steadily since January 2025, suggesting a slip in profitability and “waning confidence.” This might reflect a more fragile market structure, where large swaths of relatively new holders face mounting paper losses. “The XRP market is showing signs of a top-heavy structure, with many investors caught on a relatively high-cost basis,” the report adds. This fragility in XRP’s positioning could also imply broader caution for retail-driven altcoin markets. Overall, Glassnode’s latest research underscores the dichotomy in today’s digital asset landscape. While Bitcoin’s drift below $80,000 spurred increased losses for long-term holders, XRP’s meteoric rise and subsequent slowdown depict a market driven by short-term retail enthusiasm that may be approaching saturation. “For more speculative assets like XRP, demand may have already peaked,” the report concludes, “suggesting caution may be warranted until signs of a robust recovery start to emerge.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.00.

During this time, the quarterly average of daily active addresses jumped by 490% and XRP price hit a 7-year high. XRP’s 1-day chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Fast forward to the present, and data shows that the speculative interest surrounding XRP is declining. Holders are increasingly facing losses rather than gains, which is dampening their risk appetite. “Retail confidence in XRP may be slipping” Since bottoming in 2022, Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP have gained 500% to 600%, but the bulk of XRP’s gains came from a parabolic price increase. Data from Glassnode shows that XRP daily active addresses jumped by 490%, whereas the same metric for Bitcoin increased by 10% over the past four months. XRP's new investor realized the cap. Source: Glassnode This retail-driven surge pushed XRP’s realized cap from $30.1 billion to $64.2 billion, with $30 billion of that inflow coming from investors in the last six months. The share of XRP’s realized cap held by new investors (less than six months) jumped from 23% to 62.8%, signaling a rapid wealth shift. However, since late February 2025, capital inflows have dipped significantly. XRP realized profit/loss ratio. Source: Glassnode The primary reason is that investors are currently locking in fewer profits and staring at higher losses. This can be identified by the realized loss/profit ratio, which has constantly declined since 2025. Glassnode analysts said, “Given the retail-dominated inflows and largely concentrated wealth in relatively new hands, this alludes to a condition where retail investor confidence in XRP may be slipping, and this may also be extended across the broader market.” Besides weakening confidence among newer investors, the distribution of XRP among whale addresses reflects a similar trend. Data shows a steady increase in whale outflows since the start of 2025, suggesting that large holders have been consistently trimming their positions. Over the past 14 days, over $1 billion in positions were offloaded at an average price of $2.10. Whale flow 30-day moving average.

A bullish divergence occurs when the price forms a lower low and the relative strength index (RSI) forms a lower high. With a fair value gap between $2.08 and $2.13, XRP might see a relief rally into this range, especially if the wider crypto market undergoes an oversold bounce. On the higher time frame chart, XRP appears bearish due to the formation of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, with a measured target near $1.07. There is a chance that the altcoin finds support from the 200-day moving average (orange line) around the $1.70 to $1.80 mark, but XRP price has not tested this level since Nov. 5, 2024.

The tariffs combine a 10% baseline duty with additional double-digit tariffs on key trading partners. Analysts note that the overall US tariff rate on imports would rise to 22%, a significant jump from the 2.5% seen last year. Donald Trump giving a ‘Liberation Day’ speech at the Rose Garden in Washington DC. Source: Sky News Olu Sonola, head of US economic research at Fitch Ratings, stressed that the tariff rate is now at its highest level since 1910, calling it a “game changer” for the US economy and the world. Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Liberum, warned, “The chances of a US recession over the next 12 months are materially higher as a result of the decisions last night.” Financial markets reacted swiftly. The US dollar fell 1.7% against a basket of currencies from key trading partners by early Thursday afternoon European time, reflecting growing concern about US growth prospects. The tariffs are expected to affect the economy through multiple channels. While companies may not pass on the full cost increase to consumers, the wide scope of the tariffs means that American households are unlikely to be spared. During Trump’s 2018 trade war, about 60% of a temporary 20% tariff on imported washing machines was passed on to consumers. Consumer sentiment has shown signs of weakness In March, the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index fell by 7.2 points to 92.9, the lowest level since January 2021, when some pandemic restrictions were still in place. At the same time, the consumer expectations index, which reflects views on income, business, and labor market conditions, plunged to 65.2 – the lowest reading in 12 years and well below the recession-warning threshold of 80. US economist James Knightley from ING estimated that the new tariff package could add roughly $1,350 in extra costs for every American, depending on how much of the cost is passed on by businesses. Marc Giannoni, an economist at Barclays, predicted that core consumer price inflation would likely exceed 4% this year and that real GDP would decline. Giannoni also warned that the unemployment rate might rise, forecasting a 0.1% contraction on a year-on-year basis in the final quarter of 2025 –a change he described as “consistent with a recession.” He further projected that unemployment could reach 4.6% by the fourth quarter. Paul Donovan, an economist at UBS, said that market expectations will adjust to price in recession. He stated, “If there is no retreat, markets will price a US recession. If there is a retreat, markets will assume US growth will weaken.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

With gas fees remaining high and alternatives gaining traction, many buyers are seeking new opportunities with higher upside potential. The fourth phase of Mutuum Finance presale continues while this high-growth altcoin sells for $0.025 and has collected $6.1 million. The next stage of the presale will boost MUTM’s price to $0.03 while attracting more than 7800 investors. The initial investors during this phase will receive a 140% payback when the launch price reaches $0.06. Experts predict MUTM could surge to $3.50 by late 2025, making it a better alternative for investors moving away from Ethereum’s stagnation. A DeFi Giant on the Rise Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 7800 investors have joined the presale funding to support the project which has received $6.1 million in total. Mutuum Finance’s price currently reaches $0.025 in Phase 4 even though investors anticipate a 20% price increase in Phase 5 which will generate considerable profit potential. The analysts forecast MUTM to surge beyond $10 in upcoming months when it launches at $0.06 because its distinctive lending approach meets rising market requirements thus making it an underappreciated yet promising DeFi resource. Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts. The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi. A Reliable and Secure Financial Network Mutuum Finance creates a launch plan for its new collateralized USD-backed stablecoin developed for Ethereum blockchain usage. Insolvency risks that threaten algorithmic stablecoins will not affect this over-collateralized asset because it will maintain long-term reliability. A complete audit system of smart contracts together with transparent financial mechanisms establishes trust with investors as it fixes numerous security problems observed with past decentralized finance projects. To attract more community members Mutuum Finance implements profitable incentive programs at an aggressive pace. The program will use $100,000 to give ten investors $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and the referral system gives rewards to users who bring in new investors to the platform. The platform gives early supporters exclusive benefits including staking pools and governance rights and VIP-exclusive updates to enhance their connection with the platform. Friendly Tokenomics for Lasting Expansion Tokenomics in the project follows a strategy designed for both limited token circulation management and continuous appreciation of value. The presale limitation combined with anti-inflationary procedures enables Mutuum Finance to establish scarcity which creates possible upward token value potential. Staking rewards users for token involvement by delivering valuable incentives that strengthen the ecosystem sustainability of its native token. Ethereum’s (ETH) uncertain outlook and increasing competition are driving investors toward high-growth alternatives like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With a unique dual-lending model, strong tokenomics, and a rapidly expanding community, MUTM has already attracted over 7,800 investors and raised $6.1 million. As its price climbs from $0.025 in Phase 4 to a projected $3.50 by late 2025, early participants stand to gain significantly. Don’t miss this opportunity—join the Mutuum Finance presale today and secure your position in the future of decentralized finance.

Brutal, isn’t it? That sting of missing out doesn’t just haunt your wallet, it messes with your head. You start thinking, “If I’d just thrown in a cheeky $200 back then…” But here’s the kicker—those chances aren’t gone. They’re just hiding in plain sight. Right now, while the big names are busy battling it out on the charts, a new wave of meme coins is quietly brewing in the shadows—and one in particular, BTFD Coin (BTFD) , is kicking up a proper storm. With only one presale stage left before launch and a wild 2900% ROI on the table, it’s the kind of moment you either grab or regret forever. If you’re hunting for the top new meme coins to invest in this month, you’re in the right place. Stick around—we’re about to unpack the meme coins catching fire this month, starting with the one everyone’s whispering about before it blows up. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Bulls Are Charging, Are You In? If your mates are buzzing about BTFD, they’re not just hopping on hype—they’re sniffing out something big. The BTFD Coin presale is now thundering through its 15th stage at just $0.0002 per coin, with a listing price locked in at $0.0006. That’s a 200% gain baked in already if you buy now. But here’s where it gets tasty—analysts reckon BTFD could moon to $0.006. If that happens, Stage 15 investors could bag a jaw-dropping 2900% ROI. Let’s break it down. Say you chuck in $4000 during this current stage. At $0.0002 per BTFD, that nets you 20 million coins. If the coin hits its projected presale price of $0.0006, that’s already $12,000. But if it moons to $0.006, you’d be looking at $120,000. That’s right—one smart move today could flip a used car budget into luxury-level gains. But it’s not just about the numbers. BTFD isn’t some faceless memecoin. This project is powered by the legendary Bulls Squad, a group of four bold characters—Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull—each symbolizing a key strength of the community. From community outreach to rock-solid tech, the Bulls Squad brings personality and purpose to this meme movement. And let’s not lie—who doesn’t love a coin with a mascot that vibes with the times? Then there’s the BTFD play-to-earn game, which is already live and fully functioning. You earn tokens while laughing, blasting through levels with the Bulls, and unlocking power-ups. It’s got all the bells and whistles Gen Z and crypto-native gamers love, plus an in-game economy that ties directly into the BTFD ecosystem . And if you like passive income, check this—staking rewards up to 90% APY are available, turning your bag into a yield-generating beast. With staking kicking in during the early stages, long-term holders are already seeing their bags bulk up before launch. Oh, and don’t miss the referral program. Share your link, get mates to invest $50 or more, and they get 10% extra in BTFD tokens. If you make it into the top 20 on the leaderboard, you’ll pocket 10% of what your referrals spend—paid in tokens. It’s proper community growth with a reward twist. With over $6.45 million, over 72 billion coins sold, 11,700+ holders, and only one stage left before it hits exchanges, this presale window is vanishing fast. Miss this best meme coin presale now, and you might be chasing green candles later like a punter at Ladbrokes. This coin’s made it to the list of the top new meme coins to invest in this month because the Bulls Squad is building a real movement, not just another meme flash in the pan. 2. Floki Inu (FLOKI) – From Viking Ship to VVIP Status Floki Inu’s been sailing strong this year with major ecosystem expansions. The team has doubled down on utility with FlokiFi Locker and Floki University, making it one of the few meme coins giving holders educational tools and DeFi security. With a die-hard Viking army and top-tier meme branding, Floki keeps storming into trending charts. It’s earned its spot among the top new meme coins to invest in this month for continuously proving that meme coins can pack brains and brawn. 3. Brett (BRETT) – The Smiley Face of Base BRETT is the native meme prince of the Base Chain, and it’s not shy about it. Inspired by Matt Furie’s cartoons, BRETT has surged in social media circles as the “friendly face” of on-chain vibes. It’s already cemented itself as a staple of the Base ecosystem. As the Base Chain rises, so does BRETT’s street cred. Think of it like catching Pepe before it went nuclear. BRETT lands on this list for mastering the art of relatability with meme-native flair. 4. Baby Doge Coin (BABYDOGE) – The OG Pup Still Barking Loud Don’t count out the baby of the Doge family. BABYDOGE continues making headlines with its burn strategy—burning over 200 quadrillion tokens recently—and ongoing efforts to push mass adoption via partnerships and donation drives. Its community-first approach and charity integration make it a crowd favorite even today. It deserves this spot among the top new meme coins to invest in this month for proving staying power and evolving in a competitive meme jungle. 5. Turbo (TURBO) – From Chat to Chart-Topper Turbo was born as a joke—literally created with AI help—but it’s become one of the most-watched meme coins in the space. Thanks to its clever branding and engagement-focused team, Turbo’s transformed from a meme into a movement. It’s quirky, cheeky, and consistently riding high on social trends, especially among younger investors. It’s made this list for flipping the script—starting as a joke and turning it into a gem. 6. Popcat (POPCAT) – The Click Heard Around the World POPCAT turned a meme of a cat opening its mouth into a full-blown crypto project. No, seriously. But this isn’t just a gimmick—the Popcat game saw crazy traction in Asia and beyond. The coin piggybacks off that viral fame, bringing in new users with gamified click-to-earn mechanics. If you believe in the power of meme virality, Popcat’s your bet for meme magic turning into market cap. Popcat pounced onto this list of the top new meme coins to invest in this month because it’s proof that meme virality can actually drive adoption. Conclusion: Still Sitting on the Sidelines? You Might Regret It! Meme coins have dominated crypto chatter lately, driving a massive chunk of retail search traffic and social buzz over the past couple of months. That’s not just noise—it’s a tidal shift in what retail investors are eyeing.

By investing during presales, you dodge the volatility storm of post-launch pumps and dumps. You get in before the madness, before bots and whales start playing games. Right now, the BTFD Coin is the crown jewel of the top new meme coins to invest in this month. The price is still at a juicy $0.0002, with only one stage left before launch. If you’ve ever wished you could go back in time and catch DOGE or SHIB at floor level, this might just be your second chance. Don’t dither. Grab your spot, stack your coins, and get in before the BTFD Coin presale hits the final stage. The Bulls are already charging—are you coming or what?

The space is buzzing with fresh presales, and investors are always on the lookout for the next hidden gem. While Dogwifhat and TST are making waves, one new meme coin is creating a storm of excitement in the crypto world— Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) . This project stands out because of its innovative approach to token burns, presale structure, and staking rewards. As Arctic Pablo enters new phases and climbs in value, the window to secure tokens at rock-bottom prices is narrowing. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, Dogwifhat, and TST. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Token Burn Revolution and Location-Based Presale When it comes to new meme coins, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is setting itself apart with an innovative presale structure and a deflationary approach that fuels excitement among investors. The presale is uniquely structured around geographical locations—the presale price increases each time Arctic Pablo “travels” to a new place. Currently, the coin is in its 17th stage at Glacial Glade, where the price stands at just $0.000087. But here’s the kicker—investors who enter now can expect a jaw-dropping ROI of 9,084.48% as the price reaches its listing point of $0.008. The excitement doesn’t end there. Arctic Pablo’s token burn mechanism plays a pivotal role in creating scarcity, ultimately enhancing the remaining tokens’ value. Every week, unsold tokens are permanently burned, and once the presale ends, any leftover tokens will also be burned. This continuous token burn strategy creates a deflationary cycle that can significantly increase scarcity and boost the value for early investors. On top of that, Arctic Pablo offers a robust staking program with a high 66% APY during the presale, enabling investors to earn rewards as they stake their tokens. Referral incentives are also available, creating a ripple effect as more investors spread the word about this exciting project. Community-driven competitions add to the excitement, with rewards in APC tokens or even USD up for grabs. The price continues to climb as the Arctic Pablo Coin presale advances through different phases. Getting in now while the price is still low can be a game-changer. With over $2 million already raised, Arctic Pablo is proving to be one of the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in April 2025 —but hurry, opportunities like this don’t last forever. Don’t Miss Out: Arctic Pablo’s Glacial Glade Presale Phase At present, Arctic Pablo Coin has reached its Glacial Glade stage, and the pressure is building. With only a limited amount of time left to enter at $0.000087, the opportunity to grab tokens at such a low price is slipping away. As the meme coin presale progresses, the price will continue to rise, especially as the project ventures into new locations. Don’t let this chance pass by—early investors who jump in now could experience significant returns once the coin hits exchanges at $0.008. The current ROI from Glacial Glade is over 9,084.48%, which makes this an unparalleled opportunity for those looking to invest in meme coins with massive potential. Remember, prices rise as Arctic Pablo “travels,” so getting in now could make all the difference. Dogwifhat: A Strong Community and Latest Updates Dogwifhat continues to make headlines with its strong community backing and its unique tokenomics. Recently, it announced the launch of its new staking platform, which promises high rewards for long-term holders. The platform has been well-received by its growing user base, making it an attractive option for those seeking steady growth. TST: What’s New in the Meme Coin Space? TST has also been making waves in the meme coin market, with the latest update highlighting its partnership with a leading blockchain project. This new partnership is expected to bring more exposure and investment to the TST ecosystem. Additionally, the team behind TST has announced that it will be launching a new NFT marketplace that will allow users to buy, sell, and trade exclusive TST-related NFTs. This move aims to expand the utility of the token beyond traditional use cases, making it an interesting player in the space. Final Words: Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Way In the fast-moving world of meme coins, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as a project that’s not only innovative but also offers significant ROI potential. While Dogwifhat and TST are making their mark with community-driven features and updates, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale structure, token burn mechanism, and staking rewards make it a unique and exciting investment for April 2025. With over $2 million already raised and a presale price that’s still at a bargain, now is the time to get involved. Don’t miss the chance to be part of Arctic Pablo’s journey—invest now and watch as this coin soars in value.

Cardano’s price is headed below 50 cents in search of a new support zone that can serve as a springboard to reach new highs. Cardano Price Can Still Clinch $1 Despite Price Slump Market technician Jonathan Carter in an analysis on X predicts that Cardano’s price can reclaim the $1 price point in the coming months. According to Carter, the recent ADA correction will not be a hindrance for Cardano’s price to reach $1. ADA has lost a jarring 13% over the last week and trades at $0.64 in an unremarkable week for the cryptocurrency. On the daily charts, prices have generally moved sideways, underscoring a lack of investor enthusiasm. For Carter, Cardano’s recent decline has seen it fail to stay above the $0.65 support level. The analyst opined that a downtrend is the offing for the Cardano price that could see a new support zone of $0.59. Carter says the new $0.59 support zone will hurl Cardano price to reach $1. “Despite the long correction, the price still has a chance to bounce off this support and rise towards $1,” said Carter. “Otherwise, we will fall to the lower border of the broadening wedge.” While some investors are eyeing an ADA bounce to $0.70 , a plausible play will be a slump below $0.60 before the start of a rally. A Slew Of Positives For ADA Despite the pervading negative sentiment around ADA price, the cryptocurrency has a wave of positive fundamentals going for it. Cardano price spiked following Charles Hoskinson’s confirmation of Ripple’s RLUSD on ADA. Furthermore, Charles Hoskinson reveals that Cardano will play a major role in Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi) application. In more positive technicals, Cardano price is forming a cyclical pattern from 2024 that can send prices to astronomical proportions in May. While the prediction pegged prices at $2.5, optimists say ADA price to $10 is not a crazy hypothesis. The report cites present solid fundamentals and ADA’s over 1,000% spike to set its all-time high back in 2021 as pointers for the seismic rally to $10.

BlockDAG, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coin are gaining significant recognition for their robust growth amidst a fluctuating market. Each project has carved a unique path to success, but their exceptional performance is a common trait. This overview highlights the key drivers behind the strong performance of these best crypto project contenders this year. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): The Remarkable 2,380% Rise BlockDAG (BDAG) has rapidly ascended in the market rankings, thanks to its modern Directed Acyclic Graph structure. This framework facilitates parallel processing, which enhances throughput and scalability significantly. Transactions are processed swiftly without delays, enabling scalable growth. From its initial offering price of $0.001 to the current $0.0248, BDAG has surged by 2,380%, accumulating over $210.5 million in raised funds. This growth is not just speculative—it”s supported by solid development. Looking ahead, the potential for BDAG is substantial. With its mainnet debut approaching this year and plans to list on 10 leading centralized exchanges, increased utility and user engagement are expected. This expansion is likely to further elevate the coin’s value, with experts predicting a potential rise to $1 in 2025 and reaching up to $30 by 2030. This trajectory is why BlockDAG is recognized as one of the best crypto project success stories of the year. 2. Litecoin (LTC): Combining Speed with Stability Litecoin (LTC) maintains its status as a best crypto project due to its established reputation and practical application. Originating as a Bitcoin fork, it delivers quicker transactions and reduced costs, which are perfect for regular payments. The creation of Charlie Lee, Litecoin is supported by effective leadership, robust liquidity, and a dependable network. Its limited total supply of 84 million and diminishing block rewards enhance its rarity. Currently valued around $95 and anticipated to approach $100, Litecoin’s stable valuation underscores its consistent efficacy and practical use, confirming its position as a leading alternative cryptocurrency. 3. Ethereum (ETH): Revolutionizing with Smart Contracts Ethereum (ETH) has revolutionized the blockchain landscape by introducing smart contracts, enabling the development of decentralized applications across numerous sectors. Co-created by Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum underpins a significant portion of the Web3 infrastructure, from DeFi systems to NFT marketplaces, sustaining high demand for ETH and securing its position as a best crypto project. With its current price at approximately $2,070 and predictions of future price increases, Ethereum continues to draw developers and long-term holders alike. Its vibrant ecosystem, extensive liquidity, and widespread usage underscore its enduring strength and versatility as one of the globe’s most utilized cryptocurrencies. 4. Binance Coin (BNB): Driving a Major Crypto Ecosystem Binance Coin (BNB) remains a best crypto project through its integral role within the Binance exchange ecosystem. Holders enjoy benefits such as trading fee discounts, access to launchpad events, and the expanding utility within Binance’s broadening services. Trading at about $630 currently, BNB consistently demonstrates robust trading volume and liquidity. Beyond many utility tokens, BNB presents continuous application and genuine demand. Those looking for a cryptocurrency with tangible utility and the backing of a leading platform find BNB to be a dependable and strategic choice. Closing Thoughts: What Sets These Coins Apart in 2025 Each cryptocurrency listed here has secured its spot for specific reasons. Litecoin offers simplicity and speed. Ethereum continues to lead with its foundational smart contracts. Binance Coin showcases the strength of a crypto ecosystem’s demand. However, BlockDAG sets itself apart by not merely enhancing existing frameworks but by innovating the foundational structure itself. Its remarkable ascent from $0.001 to $0.0248, marking a 2,380% increase, highlights its rapid scalability and burgeoning popularity. With such impressive advancements, it’s clear why BlockDAG is recognized as the best crypto project this year, with potential to maintain its lead.

Dive into the 25-Stage Dragoin Presale for 6,700% ROI Potential!",https://thecoinrise.com/on-the-hunt-for-massive-crypto-gains-dive-into-the-25-stage-dragoin-presale-for-6700-roi-potential/,"Dragoin is breaking the mold of traditional presales with an exciting 25-stage presale featuring fantasy storytelling and big rewards. The first stage is now live, with tokens priced at just $0.0000292. By the time the final stage closes at $0.002 per token, early buyers could see a potential gain of up to 6,700%. However, the appeal of Dragoin’s presale goes beyond discounted tokens and high percentages. Each of the 25 presale stages is themed around legendary fantasy stories, adding excitement with every passing phase. Buyers aren’t just securing tokens; they’re entering an adventure! As each stage progresses, the price of Dragoin tokens increases, rewarding early buyers and punishing those who wait too long. Hesitant buyers will face diminishing returns, paying more for fewer tokens. The longer you wait, the more you pay, and the fewer tokens you’ll get. An Adventure-Fueled Presale Unlike typical crypto presales, Dragoin’s model offers a unique journey that ties into well-known fantasy tales. Stage 1, “The Fall of Valyria,” offers the lowest price and the best value. Early participants at this stage can secure tokens at the ground level, positioning themselves for higher returns as the presale progresses. The excitement only builds as Dragoin reaches later stages. By Stage 10, “The Battle of the Bastards,” token prices will already have risen significantly. As the presale advances, for example, Stage 15, “The Trident Clash,” will clearly highlight the advantage of buying early, with tokens purchased at earlier stages becoming more valuable. Each new stage offers fresh excitement, more intricate storylines, and a higher token price, encouraging early action to maximize returns. The Cost of Waiting – Paying More and Getting Less It’s crucial to understand that delaying your purchase doesn’t just mean paying a bit more—it means paying much more. At Stage 1, tokens are priced at a low $0.0000292, but that price will rise significantly with each stage. Once a stage ends, the chance to buy at that price disappears forever. Late buyers will pay considerably more per token and receive fewer tokens for the same investment. For instance, those waiting until Stage 20, “Defending the Eyrie,” will pay several times the price per token compared to those who acted at Stage 1. This cuts into their potential profits and limits the number of tokens they can acquire. Each passing stage is a missed opportunity. The longer you wait, the fewer tokens you get and the lower your future profit potential. Strategic Scarcity – Tokens Burned at Every Stage Dragoin’s presale also introduces a scarcity factor that boosts the value of the tokens. Under this model, unsold tokens are burned at the end of each stage, permanently reducing the overall supply. This creates scarcity, which can drive up the value of the remaining tokens. As tokens are burned, early buyers benefit by holding a larger share of the available supply. Entering the presale early means securing more tokens, while later buyers will face the impact of limited availability and higher prices. This mechanism incentivizes immediate participation, as waiting through multiple stages will result in higher prices and fewer tokens to purchase. Early Buyers Reap the Rewards of Dragoin’s Tokenomics Dragoin’s tokenomics are especially designed to benefit those who act quickly. Out of the total 200 billion tokens, half (50%) are allocated to the presale. This ensures that early participants have exclusive advantages. The remaining 50% is allocated to other important functions such as ecosystem development, long-term liquidity, and token security. Of this, 5% is reserved for the team and locked for two years to prevent any immediate token sales by the developers. The remaining 30% supports community rewards, such as staking and gaming incentives, which will foster the growth of Dragoin’s ecosystem. This strategic allocation ensures a well-balanced and sustainable approach, giving early buyers the confidence that their involvement is supported by careful planning. Why Early Action is Key – Benefits for Fast Movers At Dragoin’s Stage 1 presale, tokens are priced at just $0.0000292, offering the best possible returns. By Stage 25, the price will reach $0.002, offering a substantial potential return of up to 6,700%. Each delay means a higher price per token and fewer tokens available. The presale’s 25 fantasy-themed stages, with their escalating prices, create a compelling reason to act fast. Delaying will only reduce potential profits and limit how much can be purchased. In summary, early buyers have a significant advantage in Dragoin’s presale. The opportunity to purchase tokens at a low price, paired with the potential for high returns, makes early action crucial. Don’t miss out on your chance to be part of the exciting journey—join now at Stage 1 for the best possible deal and biggest potential rewards.

Internet Computer continues to focus on reshaping the web through decentralization, while Bitget Token earns investor trust by delivering practical exchange benefits and maintaining clear financials. Both tokens have made progress. But neither has sparked the kind of investor reaction BlockDAG saw right after Keynote 3. Within just 48 hours, BlockDAG added $5 million to its presale. That spike wasn’t fueled by hype—it was about what buyers could actually see. With its Beta Testnet now live and mining gear already shipped, BlockDAG’s rise is grounded in delivery. For many buyers, that’s when interest turns into serious funding. Internet Computer (ICP): Pushing for a Web Built on Decentralization Internet Computer (ICP), a project from the DFINITY Foundation, is working to change how the internet functions. It aims to let developers build and run decentralized apps on the web without using traditional cloud services. Its smart contracts, called “canisters,” are designed to run at the speed of the web and scale efficiently. Launched in May 2021, ICP gave early investors access through presales and community distributions. As of now, ICP trades at about $5.29. Over the past year, the price has been unstable, ranging from a low of $6.66 to a high of $32.40. While the price has dropped from its peaks, loyal supporters continue to believe in its long-term goal of building a decentralized internet. New services such as decentralized social platforms and open web tools keep the project alive. Despite the price shifts, ICP’s bold vision and technical depth still attract developer and investor interest. Bitget Token (BGB): Powering Exchange Features with Steady Growth Bitget Token (BGB) supports the Bitget exchange by offering users multiple perks. These include reduced trading fees, staking, early access to Launchpad events, and exclusive features. Initially rolled out via private and exchange listings, BGB has built momentum. Currently, it trades at around $4.57 and holds a market cap of $5.49 billion. Over the past year, it’s steadily gained value, with some projections expecting a price of $5.41 before the year ends. BGB’s upward trend is linked to Bitget’s broader expansion, including improved copy trading tools and global sponsorships. A big factor in user trust is Bitget’s financial openness—confirmed by a 213% proof-of-reserve ratio in March 2025. For early holders, this mix of utility, exchange growth, and clear reserves makes BGB a strong long-term play within centralized platforms. $5M in Two Days: How Keynote 3 Caught the Attention of Crypto Whales Big traders rarely react to noise—they wait for clear signs of progress. That’s what made the two days after BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 so striking. In that short period, $5 million poured into the project’s presale, sending a clear message that large players were jumping in. BlockDAG isn’t selling promises—it’s delivering products. Its “Primordial” Beta Testnet is up and running. Wallet activity is growing. Mining equipment has already reached users. These aren’t concepts—they’re working parts of the ecosystem. For bigger buyers, seeing systems in action makes it easier to trust the project. The numbers reflect that trust. BlockDAG has raised $210.5 million through 27 presale rounds, selling over 19.1 billion coins. The current price is $0.0248, a 2,380% gain for those who bought during batch 1. That kind of return, supported by real updates and steady progress, is tough for buyers to overlook. Whales aren’t drawn to hype—they follow results. And Keynote 3 gave them exactly that. In crypto, visible progress often leads to serious investment. The recent increase in whale buying may point to more than just short-term interest—it could be a deeper belief in BlockDAG’s future. Key Highlights! Internet Computer and Bitget Token have both earned their places—one through its push for a decentralized web, the other by growing a trusted exchange utility. Each offers something real. But the jump in BlockDAG’s whale activity signals something different: response to action. With a testnet that’s already live, mining units shipped, and wallets active, the numbers speak for themselves. BlockDAG’s $5 million jump after Keynote 3 wasn’t about wishful thinking—it was a response to systems already working. When money starts flowing this fast, it usually means there’s nothing left to doubt. BlockDAG made that clear for everyone watching.

Despite a strong start to the year, where the crypto market experienced bullish momentum, ETH has failed to sustain its upward trajectory. Since slipping below the $3,000 level, the asset has largely ranged downward and has now breached the $2,000 support zone, signaling weakening demand and sentiment. While Bitcoin and other major digital assets still managed to see some recovery efforts in recent weeks, Ethereum’s price decline has been accompanied by decreasing network activity and weakening on-chain fundamentals. This divergence has raised concerns over ETH’s short-term outlook and prompted a fresh analysis of the underlying causes driving the asset’s performance. Related Reading: Whales Dump 760,000 Ethereum in Two Weeks — Is More Selling Ahead? Fee Decline and Network Inactivity Fuel Inflationary Pressures CryptoQuant analyst EgyHash recently published a report highlighting key on-chain metrics that suggest Ethereum’s current market weakness is closely tied to its declining fee economy and user activity. According to the report titled: “Why Ethereum Is Bleeding Value: Fee Crash Meets Hyperinflation Hellscape.” Ethereum’s network is experiencing its lowest levels of activity since 2020. Daily active addresses have declined steadily since early 2025, and average transaction fees have dropped to record lows. This reduction in activity has led to a sharp fall in Ethereum’s burn rate, a metric crucial in offsetting inflationary pressures following the network’s transition to proof-of-stake. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Approaches Resistance—Will It Smash Through? The Dencun upgrade, which was expected to enhance network efficiency, has coincided with an extended period of low transaction volumes, further reducing fee income and contributing to higher net ETH issuance. EgyHash concludes that the confluence of weak network engagement, reduced burn rate, and high token inflation is central to Ethereum’s declining valuation. Why Ethereum Is Bleeding Value “Ethereum’s recent underperformance can be largely attributed to diminished network activity, as evidenced by declining active addresses and reduced transaction fees.” – By @EgyHashX pic.twitter.com/fgQJYCrOIn — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) April 3, 2025 Ethereum Technical Outlook Signals Potential Support Despite on-chain headwinds, some technical analysts maintain a cautiously optimistic view. Trader Courage, a technical analyst on X, noted that Ethereum is currently testing a major support zone and could rebound toward the upper resistance of its current trading range. $ETH / #ETH 1H chart 📊 Back at the green support line.

As blockchain continues to transform industries, some projects are standing out more than others. Litecoin and Injective have long been considered strong assets in the crypto market, but a new player, Qubetics, has arrived with solutions to problems that even these established projects have yet to address. So, what’s next? Is Qubetics poised to become the best cheap crypto to buy now, offering solutions that blockchain developers and businesses need to thrive? Now, how does Qubetics fit into the world of blockchain, and what sets it apart from Litecoin and Injective? While Litecoin has gained traction with its use in digital transactions and Injective has pushed the envelope with decentralized finance (DeFi), Qubetics looks to bring a more comprehensive solution that not only integrates with existing systems but enhances them with true interoperability. The future of blockchain is all about efficiency, and Qubetics is leading the charge toward making digital finance smoother, faster, and more adaptable. Qubetics: Interoperability Revolutionizing the Blockchain World Qubetics stands as a solution to the fragmentation present in today’s blockchain networks. While other blockchain systems, such as Litecoin and Injective, focus on specific niches, Qubetics introduces a level of interoperability that directly addresses gaps in cross-chain communication. In simple terms, interoperability ensures that different blockchain networks can work together seamlessly—this is a game-changer. Imagine a business trying to integrate multiple digital payment systems but facing roadblocks due to the inability to connect different blockchain technologies. With Qubetics, this problem is a thing of the past. It enables businesses to execute cross-chain transactions effortlessly, allowing seamless operations between various blockchain ecosystems. This makes Qubetics the best cheap crypto to buy now for anyone looking to support innovation that solves real-world problems. Numbers That Speak Louder: Qubetics’ Presale Momentum and $200 Scenarios Qubetics is powering through Stage 28 of its top crypto presale . The numbers reflect a community that’s not just watching but acting. With over $15.8 million raised, 24,300+ token holders, and 506 million $TICS sold, the interest isn’t speculative—it’s strategic. Each $TICS token is currently priced at $0.1430, making it one of the most accessible and potentially rewarding presale tokens this year. Consider this: a $200 allocation at today’s rate secures approximately 1,398 $TICS tokens. If the price reaches $1 per token, that $200 turns into $1,398—a 599% return. At $5, the same tokens would be worth $6,990, showing the power of early entry. If $TICS climbs to $10, that initial $200 skyrockets to $13,980. And if it touches $15, the return would be an impressive $20,970. These numbers highlight the potential upside for those who position themselves early in a project with strong utility and growing adoption. These aren’t promises—they’re possibilities grounded in utility and community traction. When real-world solutions meet mass adoption, exponential outcomes aren’t fantasy—they’re the natural result. Litecoin: A Stable Player in Digital Finance Litecoin has always been one of the most reliable digital assets in the market. Created as a “lighter” version of Bitcoin, Litecoin has distinguished itself with faster transaction times and a more accessible entry point. Its recent integration into retirement accounts through Fidelity’s “Crypto IRA” service is a clear indication of its staying power in the digital finance ecosystem. This integration marks an important milestone, showing how Litecoin is becoming an integral part of long-term savings strategies. In the context of market volatility, Litecoin has managed to maintain its position as one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Analysts have noted that Litecoin’s performance is poised for growth, especially if it maintains support above $100. Recent developments, such as the addition of Litecoin to retirement plans, make it even more appealing to community members looking for a stable crypto asset to complement their portfolios. With its transaction speed and reliability, Litecoin remains a solid choice for those looking to hold long-term in the crypto market. Yet, while Litecoin offers stability, it lacks the level of interoperability that newer projects like Qubetics bring to the table. As such, it remains a strong option for those seeking a trustworthy and low-risk entry, but it’s clear that for blockchain developers and businesses craving more expansive solutions, Qubetics might soon take the spotlight. Injective: DeFi’s Leading Light Injective Protocol has firmly positioned itself as a leader in decentralized finance (DeFi), with its cutting-edge cross-chain trading solutions. Injective’s unique value proposition lies in its ability to allow traders to access decentralized exchanges (DEXs) with minimal barriers to entry. Its recent “Learn & Earn” campaign proves the project’s commitment to educating and expanding its user base, while the upcoming “Injective Builder Day” in Seoul showcases its continuous focus on community engagement. The strength of Injective lies in its technological advancements, particularly in its cross-chain trading mechanisms. By offering users the ability to trade assets across multiple blockchains seamlessly, Injective is catering to a growing demand for decentralized exchanges that work without the need for intermediaries. As a result, it’s quickly becoming one of the go-to solutions for DeFi enthusiasts. However, while its solutions are robust, they still rely on the ecosystem of DEXs to function. This is where Qubetics shines with its more holistic approach to interoperability across all blockchain sectors, making it a potential competitor to Injective’s position in the future of digital finance. Qubetics, Litecoin, and Injective: A Comprehensive Comparison When considering the best cheap crypto to buy now, all three of these projects stand out in their own ways. Litecoin remains a stable choice with its adoption in retirement accounts and quick transaction speeds. Injective is leading the charge in DeFi, offering decentralized trading and smart contracts that break down the walls of traditional finance. However, Qubetics brings a fresh, innovative approach to solving the key issues of blockchain interoperability and real-world applications. For developers and businesses looking for seamless connections across multiple blockchain systems, Qubetics offers the potential for transformative change. Its ability to integrate disparate systems into a unified, efficient process is exactly what the blockchain industry needs to scale. As more people begin to realize the long-term potential of this interoperability solution, Qubetics could very well surpass other assets in its category, offering significant returns for early community members. The current presale stage of Qubetics demonstrates immense potential for growth, especially as the technology evolves. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on the Future of Blockchain Solutions As the blockchain industry matures, interoperability will become more critical than ever. Qubetics is here to fill that gap, offering a practical solution to real-world challenges while showing early signs of a major impact on the digital finance sector. As the presale continues to gain momentum, now is the time to consider getting involved with one of the most promising projects on the market. In conclusion, while Litecoin and Injective continue to serve specific niches within the digital finance world, Qubetics is poised to become the go-to solution for bridging the gap between disparate blockchain ecosystems. The question isn’t whether Qubetics is the best cheap crypto to buy now —it’s whether you’ll be part of this transformative journey.

The NIA is responsible for promoting foreign investments and assisting international companies in identifying business opportunities within the country. Source: Changpeng Zhao “This cooperation marks an important step towards strengthening technological infrastructure, implementing innovative solutions, and preparing highly qualified specialists in blockchain technologies, virtual asset management, and cybersecurity,” Zhaparov said. The Kyrgyzstan president added: “such initiatives are crucial for the sustainable growth of the economy and the security of virtual assets, ultimately generating new opportunities for businesses and society as a whole.” Kyrgyzstan, which officially changed its name from the Republic of Kyrgyzstan to the Kyrgyz Republic in 1993, is a mountainous, land-locked country. It is considered well-suited for crypto mining operations due to its abundant renewable energy resources, much of which is underutilized. Over 30% of Kyrgyzstan’s total energy supply comes from hydroelectric power plants, but only 10% of the country’s potential hydropower has been developed, according to a report by the International Energy Agency. CZ has met with several other state officials in Asia Malaysia also recently tapped CZ for guidance on crypto-related matters, with Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim meeting him personally in January. CZ has also met with officials in the UAE and Bitcoin-stacking country Bhutan — however, it isn’t clear what those meetings entailed. Related: Is Bitcoin’s future in circular economies or national reserves? CZ’s latest pursuits come a little over six months after he was released from a four-month prison sentence in the US for violating several anti-money laundering laws. Since being released, CZ has made investments in blockchain tech, artificial intelligence and biotechnology companies. CZ also recently donated 1,000 BNB ( BNB ) — worth almost $600,000 — to support earthquake relief efforts in Thailand and Myanmar after the natural disaster in late April.

Based on estimates using tariff costs paid in 2024, American big tech companies could face daily expenses ranging from $1 billion to $2 billion. The new tariff policy is set to cost U.S. businesses an estimated $654 billion a year. That figure is projected to grow even further when considering up to an additional $300 billion in tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act on products like steel, aluminum, and autos. “If this holds up in court, then we are waking up to a new global economy with a different set of costs than we have known for the last several decades,” said Josh Teitelbaum, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce during the Obama administration.

The company has already seen its worst stock drop since the COVID-19 outbreak. While Apple is particularly vulnerable due to its heavy reliance on Asian manufacturing, the new tariff framework puts the entire tech sector’s trade surplus under the microscope. According to Cesar Hidalgo, a professor at the Toulouse School of Economics, tech giants have long benefited from a large trade surplus with the rest of the world. Alphabet exported $141 billion in services, followed by Meta with $71.2 billion, Oracle at $45.2 billion, Amazon at $40.2 billion, IBM at $31.9 billion, and Microsoft at $31.6 billion. Apple stock price. Source: Google Finance. The US exported $2 trillion in physical goods in 2024, while importing around $3.27 trillion. On the surface, this suggests a trade deficit of roughly $1 trillion. However, the digital economy is different. Every time a foreigner streams a movie on Netflix or purchases an ad on Facebook, the United States is effectively exporting its digital services. “We estimate that the U.S. enjoys a trade surplus of at least $600 billion in digital products,” Hidalgo explained. U.S. exports in digital advertising and cloud computing reached about $260 billion and $184 billion, respectively. Hidalgo noted that these figures are even larger than the country’s exports of crude or refined petroleum, which have long been considered one of its major export products. Trade retaliation, however, may not be limited to digital services. Jason Miller, an assistant professor at Michigan State University, warned that massive foreign countermeasures are likely. This means that U.S. exports in tech industries like aerospace, machinery, electrical equipment, computers and electronic products, and energy could all face significant tariff-based retaliation. Could big tech actually benefit from the trade war? The trade war has also raised questions about whether big tech companies could ultimately benefit from the administration’s aggressive tactics. With Wall Street in a state of panic and allies around the globe voicing their displeasure, the fallout from Trump’s trade policies continues to grow. Some of the world’s richest companies might see gains if Trump can successfully negotiate better terms. Issues ranging from the sale of TikTok to digital services taxes, and even Europe’s antitrust actions against Silicon Valley giants, have now become part of the broader trade dispute. Yet the question remains – What exactly does Trump want in exchange for easing these tariffs? Michael Froman, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, addressed the issue on the POLITICO Tech podcast. “Leverage is only good if you take it out for a drive,” Froman said, stressing that the administration must clearly outline what it expects in return from other nations. “You’ve got to be able to lay out for the other countries, for the other markets what it is you want them to change, or do, in order to reduce the tariffs, get rid of the tariffs,” he explained. He noted that, so far, the Trump administration has not provided a detailed plan outlining these demands. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Most of the survey respondents said they were turning to crypto in hope of making “big” returns on their investments. Brazilian Crypto Interest on the Rise The survey, conducted by Locomotiva, was commissioned by the crypto exchange Binance, the Portuguese-language media outlet Livecoins reported. Trading volumes on Bitso, one of Latin America’s most popular crypto exchanges, over the past year. (Source: CoinGecko) The researchers found that interest in cryptoassets has now risen higher than demand for stocks, private pensions, government bonds, and even foreign currencies. The survey compilers said that they spoke to 1,000 people aged between 25 and 45 with “investments in addition to cash savings.” The results showed that crypto investments are equal in popularity with investment funds. But crypto’s popularity outpaces high interest-bearing payment accounts and private bonds. The data also shows that 55% of respondents said they have made at least three forms of investment.” The remaining 45% said they have made “four or more types of investment.” Brazil's central bank chief sees need for reforms to unblock monetary policy transmission channels https://t.co/ft3xPZAIx5 pic.twitter.com/BCLkoKiwWS — Reuters (@Reuters) April 2, 2025 Liquidity a Draw While most investors said that the hopes of “high returns” had motivated them to buy crypto, others said they were attracted to the crypto market’s “high liquidity.” Others still said they felt crypto offered them “independence from the traditional financial system” and “secure transactions.” The study’s authors noted that crypto investment levels were noticeably higher among men, as well as people with higher levels of education. People with higher levels of income and knowledge about investments also tend to prefer crypto as an investment tool, the authors added.

This filing aims to launch XRP futures on April 21, 2025, offering both institutional and retail investors a regulated way to gain exposure to XRP in a more capital-efficient manner. The filing marks a significant development for XRP’s broader market acceptance, especially in regulated environments where futures contracts provide both liquidity and opportunities for risk management. XRP Futures: Regulatory Developments and Market Entry Through self-certification with the CFTC, Coinbase is allowed to bring in XRP futures without waiting for an explicit green light from the agency, so long as it complies with the necessary rules. This approach is normally used by exchanges especially when they are introducing new corporate securities in the market place. In launching XRP futures into its product line, Coinbase Derivatives is placing into the market a new structured trading product, which may enhance the liquidity and invite more institutional investors into the asset. We're excited to announce that Coinbase Derivatives has filed with the CFTC to self-certify $XRP futures – bringing a regulated, capital-efficient way to gain exposure to one of the most liquid digital assets. We anticipate the contract going live on April 21, 2025. Stay tuned… pic.twitter.com/nKUPjjnMKW — Coinbase Institutional (@CoinbaseInsto) April 3, 2025 The futures contracts are useful for the purposes of hedging or speculation, they can make XRP more accessible to new investors. At the same time, one of the largest US-based crypto exchange, Kraken, incorporated Ripple USD (RLUSD) among cryptocurrencies traded on the platform. Before that list, RLUSD was available only in Bitstamp exchange. The integration of Kraken into the list of XRP trading platforms increases trading volume in the asset and deepens the pool of institutional actors interacting with the asset. XRP Price Trend Amid New Futures Announcement At the time of this writing, various technical levels was observed for XRP. Earlier last night, in a live stream, experts pointed out that XRP price tested .382 retracement level which was a major resistance level. This level was tested on the higher end before being rejected and the current focus now lies at the possibility of a downside towards the $1.95 price level. Lately, $1.90 has been considered as another important support level, and in case of the XRP drop below this level, further correction should be expected. However, if XRP manages to establish or maintain a price above these levels, it can be expected that the market is positioning for a bounce, especially if there is the bullish RSI divergence. Source: X Consequently, the next XRP price move is critical. A successful retest of these lower levels, coupled with signs of strength from the relative strength index (RSI), could suggest that XRP is nearing a bottom before a potential breakout. If the price holds steady at $1.90, a strong rally into a new wave higher may be on the horizon. Community Reaction To Coinbase Filing Although the filing has attracted attention, it has also caused controversies in the cryptocurrency community. Coinbase first publicly mentioned the futures product as “Ripple futures” in a now-removed tweet which angered XRP holders. This confusion occurred because Ripple is the name of the company that developed the XRP blockchain, XRP on the other hand refers to the token itself. A user by the name of Adam on X (previously twitter) was able to differentiate the two and wrote to Coinbase asking them to edit the terms. In his response, he stressed that one should differentiate between Ripple and XRP by stating that “Ripple is a private company while XRP is its digital asset,” he said. Coinbase immediately amended the error and confirmed that it is actually offering XRP futures. Meanwhile, late last month, Crypto Options and Futures Exchange Bitnomial announced the launch of its XRP futures contract. This new product has been on the exchange’s radar since at least October 2024.

A New York District court issued the preliminary injunction (PI) and temporary restraining order (TRO) on March 13 in connection with a broader dispute surrounding its merger with Fatbrain AI, the Genius Group said in an April 3 statement. Fatbrain AI and Genius Group completed a merger and purchase agreement in March 2024, but by Oct. 30, Genius initiated arbitration procedures to terminate, alleging fraud by Fatbrain AI executives connected to the deal. Source: Roger James Hamilton In February, Fatbrain AI executives Michael Moe and Peter Ritz filed for the TRO and permanent injunction, blocking Genius Group from selling its shares, raising funds and buying more Bitcoin pending the arbitration outcome. The injunction has forced Genius Group to close divisions, halt marketing activities and sell 10 Bitcoin ( BTC ) from its stash of 440 , worth over $23 million at current prices, to continue funding its operations. The firm hasn’t ruled out more sales in the future. “Genius is taking all necessary measures to minimize Bitcoin sales but anticipates that it will need to downsize its Bitcoin Treasury in the coming months in the event the PI remains in place,” the firm said. Fatbrain AI shareholders also filed two lawsuits against Fatbrain AI executives, including Moe and Ritz, and Genius Group, in April 2024, alleging violation of federal securities laws in connection with the merger, ASX law said in an October statement. Two shareholder lawsuits against Fatbrain AI alleged conduct during the merger was fraudulent, which defrauded shareholders of $30 million. Source: ASX Law Genius Group was subsequently voluntarily dismissed from the suits on Feb. 14. Genius Group claims it’s breaking Singapore law by following order Genius Group says the US court injunction has also forced it to break Singapore law by halting share compensation to employees as part of its employment agreements. “We never dreamed that it was possible that a US court could block the company from being able to issue shares, raise funds or buy Bitcoin — all actions that would normally be decided by a public company's shareholders or Board rather than a court,” said Genius Group CEO Roger James Hamilton.

Back in March 2024, Slerf (SLERF) proved that even chaotic launches can make millionaires overnight. Early adopters saw a once-in-a-lifetime price run. But if you missed that moonshot, don’t beat yourself up. You’ve got another chance—this time, it’s called BTFD Coin (BTFD) . BTFD is the top new meme coin to invest in for short term .

SLERF (SLERF) – Chaos, A $10M Mistake, and a Legendary Launch Let’s take it back. On March 18, 2024, SLERF, a Solana-based meme coin, dropped into the scene with almost no plan. No roadmap. No promises. Just vibes—and a sloth mascot. It launched without a presale, and within 24 hours, trading volume exploded past $2.7 billion, hitting over 130,000 traders and 800,000 transactions. Then came the twist: the developer accidentally burned $10 million worth of presale and liquidity tokens. Absolute disaster? Not quite. The crypto community flipped the script. SLERF became a symbol of meme resilience. Despite the $10M burn, it surged to a peak of $1.30 by March 19. The story went viral. SLERF turned a disaster into gold. As of today (April 3, 2025), SLERF trades around $0.056 with a market cap near $27 million. It’s cooled off, but it’s still standing—and that’s saying something in meme land. Did people make 100x on SLERF? Yes. Did many miss it? Also yes. Now the question is—are you gonna miss BTFD too? Conclusion: The Dip That Could Change Your Portfolio Here’s something wild—SLERF taught us that even major screw-ups can spark meme coin moonshots. But BTFD Coin ? It’s got none of the chaos and all of the upside. This Ethereum-based meme beast is offering a chance to earn 90% APY just by staking, a jaw-dropping 2900% ROI if the price hits $0.006, and a referral program that literally pays you for spreading the word. The presale has already raised over $6.45 million, sold more than 72 billion tokens, and is now in Stage 15, with just one more level to go before launch. If you’re looking for the top new meme coin to invest in for short term, this is your golden window. Timing is everything in crypto—and right now, the timing couldn’t be better. Join before the BTFD Coin presale moves into Stage 16 and leaves you chasing candles instead of catching waves.

With Stage 15 almost at the finish line, there’s just one more left before listing—and the current price of $0.0002 is a ticket to up to 2900% ROI if it hits its predicted $0.006 moon shot. If you’re looking to hedge against the chaos while aiming for explosive gains, this might be your once-in-a-cycle chance. Let’s break it down: BTFD Coin: Can the Bulls Squad Really Take You to the Moon? Let’s cut to the chase: BTFD Coin ain’t just a vibe—it’s a movement. Right now, the Bulls Squad is rallying with horns up, charging through Stage 15 of the presale with one final step left. Current price? $0.0002. Moon price prediction? $0.006. That’s a jaw-dropping 2900% ROI potential if you ape in before Stage 16 hits. Over 72 billion $BTFD coins are already sold, $6.45 million raised, and 11,700+ Bulls have joined the stampede. This is the final stretch—miss this top new meme coin to join today, and you’re watching from the sidelines. The Bulls Squad isn’t some boring Discord title; it’s a hype-powered collective of degens, gamers, and crypto heads united under Baby Bull’s fearless guidance. From Nerdy Bull keeping the backend watertight to Raging Bull pumping the visuals, this squad ain’t here to play—they’re here to win. And when you join them, you don’t just buy a meme coin. You back a meme army. The meme coin presale launched on November 26 and has already proven it knows how to build serious traction. With a P2E game already live (since January 1, 2025), you can actually earn while you play. Plus, those staking rewards? 90% APY. That’s the kind of utility meme coins usually dream about. Let’s talk numbers. Invest $1500 right now at $0.0002 per token, and you’re bagging 7.5 million $BTFD coins. When BTFD lists at $0.0006, you’re already sitting on $4,500—a 200% ROI. But if it hits $0.006 like analysts predict? That’s $45,000. Off $1500. That’s what we call a moon mission. Want in? Here’s how to snag your $BTFD: Head over to the BTFD presale platform . Hit “Connect Wallet” (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, whatever you got), enter how much you wanna buy, and click “Buy Now.” No red tape. No whales. No delays. Just you, the Bulls, and the moon. And if you want to turn your referrals into rewards, don’t sleep on the BTFD Coin Rewards Program: Once you connect your wallet, you get a referral code. Share it. If someone uses it to buy $50+ worth of BTFD? They get 10% extra tokens, and you earn 10% of their purchase (if you’re in the top 20 that month). Simple, slick, and live till the last day of every month. Secure your tokens before it’s too late. BTFD or get left behind! SLERF (SLERF) – Full Send With No Presale? Here’s a plot twist: SLERF made headlines by accidentally burning its presale allocation, meaning every token is now fully in circulation. No whales, no early dumps—just pure market-driven madness. As of April 3, it’s sitting at $0.0554 with a 5.41% 24-hour drop. Still, the 24-hour trading volume is north of $16 million, showing people are watching. As a Solana-based meme coin, SLERF lives on volatility. Whether that turns into short-term gains or chaos depends on the market’s next move. But it’s earned a place on the watchlist of top new meme coins to join today. Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) – Volatility with Volume GOAT just took a 5.83% dip, but with a 24-hour volume of $22.46 million, it’s still got eyes on it. Built on Solana and tied to the AI bot Truth Terminal, GOAT hit its all-time high of $1.35 back in November 2024. It’s now at $0.0459, scraping close to its all-time low. The origin story is unique, and the hype is still simmering. But in a market this brutal, investors want more than memes. That’s why top new meme coins to join today need actual utility—like staking, gaming, and community. Final Word: Don’t Just Follow the Herd—Charge With the Bulls So here’s the deal: based on our research and real market activity, SLERF and GOAT are both wild rides—each with their own headlines and high-volume moves. But if you’re looking for real potential, a strong presale foundation, actual game rewards, and a 90% APY staking system, BTFD Coin is in a different league among the top new meme coins to join today. The Bulls Squad is calling. With only one presale stage left before listing, this is your moment to grab BTFD at $0.0002. Aim for that 2900% moonshot. Be part of a community that knows how to charge.

The firm intends to move into the new office in May. The size of the new office that Gemini agreed to lease is 8,840 square feet (821 square meters) at 545wyn, located in the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami. Wynwood has developed into a new business growth centre, attracting numerous firms Wynwood, a neighborhood in Miami well-known for its warehouses and graffiti murals, has developed into a new centre for residential and business growth. In support of this, several firms have established offices in the neighborhood in recent years. This includes Spotify Technology SA, Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, and Marcelo Claure’s investment firm. In addition, Amazon.com Inc. also signed an office lease in Wynwood. Its office was the largest in the district’s history this year. Furthermore, in 2020, Sterling Bay developed the 545wyn office building, a 10-story building, in Miami’s Wynwood neighborhood and accommodated Gensler, Sony Group Corp., and PwC. Following the firms’ addresses in the Wynwood neighborhood, Gemini’s address is 545 NW 26th St., while Gensler, Sony Group Corp., and PwC’s address are 545 NW 26th St. Based on Gemini’s decision to open a new office in Wynwood, a vice chairman of Blanca Commercial Real Estate, Florida’s top independently owned commercial real estate services company, Juan Ruiz, said: “Gemini’s decision to plant their flag at 545wyn speaks volumes about Wynwood’s evolution from an arts district to a magnet for top-tier technology and creative companies seeking a vibrant, walkable neighborhood.” Blanca also acted as the landlord’s agent in the deal. Gemini files for a confidential IPO application Gemini recently filed confidentially for an initial public offering (IPO). The crypto exchange and custodian is working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. on the offering, according to individuals whose identity was not revealed because the information was confidential. Notably, Gemini was thinking about going public as soon as this year. In February, Cameron Winklevoss posted on X that a listing would come after a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the exchange was concluded. According to a January filing, a lawsuit that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission earlier brought, the business paid $5 million to settle. If Gemini moves forward with the public listing process, it will be part of a small but growing number of crypto-native companies considering an IPO in the U.S. stock exchanges, including Kraken, Circle, Bullish (parent company of CoinDesk) and Blockchain.com. Gemini recently appointed a new chief financial officer as it positions itself for a potential initial public offering. The company’s latest hire, Dan Chen, who previously served as vice president of capital markets at Affirm, announced the move in a social media post. Sources said that discussions are still ongoing, and no final decision has been made regarding the IPO. Representatives from Goldman Sachs and Citigroup declined to comment, while a Gemini spokesperson did not respond immediately to requests for comment. Interestingly, since President Donald Trump’s administration has embraced cryptocurrency, the industry has seen a boom in IPOs.

ETH is now consolidating losses and might face resistance near the $1,840 zone. Ethereum failed to stay above the $1,850 and $1,840 levels. The price is trading below $1,840 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,810 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $1,820 and $1,840 resistance levels to start a decent increase. Ethereum Price Dips Further Ethereum price failed to stay above the $1,800 support zone and extended losses, like Bitcoin . ETH traded as low as $1,751 and recently corrected some gains. There was a move above the $1,780 and $1,800 resistance levels. The bulls even pushed the price above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,955 swing high to the $1,751 low. However, the bears are active near the $1,820 zone. The price is now consolidating and facing many hurdles . Ethereum price is now trading below $1,820 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $1,810 level. There is also a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,810 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The next key resistance is near the $1,840 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,955 swing high to the $1,751 low at $1,850. The first major resistance is near the $1,880 level. A clear move above the $1,880 resistance might send the price toward the $1,920 resistance. An upside break above the $1,920 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,000 resistance zone or even $2,050 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,850 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,765 level. The first major support sits near the $1,750 zone. A clear move below the $1,750 support might push the price toward the $1,720 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,680 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,620.

Analyst Predicts ETH To ‘Explode’ In Q2 2025,https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/is-ethereum-repeating-its-2020-trend-reversal-analyst-predicts-eth-to-explode-in-q2-2025/,"Although sentiment toward Ethereum (ETH) remains largely pessimistic, crypto analyst Mister Crypto predicts that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap could be on the verge of a parabolic rally, mirroring its historical price action from 2020. Ethereum About To Witness A Change Of Fortune? Following US President Donald Trump’s highly anticipated reciprocal tariff announcement, the crypto market took a sharp plunge, wiping out over $140 billion in the past 24 hours. During this period, ETH tumbled by 5% and is at risk of setting fresh cycle lows in the $1,700 range. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Breaking Free from the Bear Trap? Analysts Weigh In Despite the negative sentiment, crypto analyst Mister Crypto suggests that ETH may soon experience a sharp momentum shift. In an X post shared earlier today, the analyst noted that while retail investors may have abandoned ETH, large investors – commonly referred to as whales – have not. Mister Crypto shared the following chart, highlighting striking similarities between ETH’s current price action and its 2020 trajectory. He added that if history repeats itself, ETH could see strong bullish momentum in Q2 2025. Fellow crypto analyst CryptoGoos echoed Mister Crypto’s perspective, arguing that ETH is “extremely undervalued” at its current price levels. The analyst also shared a chart illustrating how ETH whales are accumulating the asset at a record pace. The data reveals that wallets holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH have been accumulating at an accelerated rate since early 2025. This trend persists despite ETH’s decline from approximately $3,350 on January 1 to around $1,700 at the time of writing. Another cryptocurrency analyst, Crypto Caesar, noted that ETH is likely approaching a bottom, as it is currently trading near the same price level it held four years ago. However, he cautioned that if ETH breaks below its current support, it could decline further to the $1,200 range. ETH May Have More Pain Ahead While whale accumulation suggests long-term optimism for ETH, some analysts warn that further downside may be imminent before a potential recovery. In a recent analysis, crypto market expert Cryptododo7 predicts that ETH may eye bearish targets around $1,130 to $1,200. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashing Bullish Signals, But Rising Exchange Reserves Raise Concerns – Details Similarly, analyst CryptoBullet highlighted that ETH has now touched the 300-week moving average for only the second time in its history – an event that has historically signalled a bearish trend. Despite these cautionary outlooks, market commentator Titan of Crypto recently stated that ETH is still on track to reach new all-time highs later this year. At press time, ETH trades at $1,777, down 5% in the past 24 hours.

While this breakthrough technology promises unprecedented computational power, it also poses a significant threat to current encryption systems. Cryptographic methods that secure our financial transactions, communications and sensitive data may become obsolete. This has led to the emergence of quantum-resistant cryptography, a crucial field focused on safeguarding digital assets against quantum-based attacks. Understanding the quantum threat Classical encryption methods, such as RSA and ECC (elliptic curve cryptography), rely on complex mathematical problems that would take traditional computers thousands of years to solve. However, quantum computers leverage Shor’s algorithm, which can break these encryptions within hours or even minutes. This means that once quantum computing reaches a practical level, many of today’s security protocols will no longer be viable. The urgency to develop post-quantum cryptographic solutions has never been higher. What is quantum-resistant cryptography Quantum-resistant, or PQC (post-quantum cryptography), refers to cryptographic algorithms designed to withstand attacks from quantum computers. Unlike traditional encryption, PQC methods do not rely on integer factorization or discrete logarithm problems, which are vulnerable to quantum attacks. Instead, they utilize advanced mathematical principles such as the following. Lattice-based cryptography – Uses complex lattice structures that even quantum computers struggle to solve. Hash-based cryptography – Relies on the security of cryptographic hash functions, which remain resistant to quantum attacks. Multivariate polynomial cryptography – Uses multivariable equations that are difficult to reverse engineer. Code-based cryptography – Implements error-correcting codes to create secure encryption schemes. The urgency for adoption Governments and organizations worldwide are already preparing for the post-quantum era. The NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) is in the process of standardizing quantum-resistant algorithms to replace current cryptographic systems. Financial institutions, healthcare providers and technology companies are also investing in post-quantum security measures to future-proof their infrastructure. A major concern is the concept of ‘harvest now, decrypt later’ attacks. Malicious entities can collect encrypted data today and decrypt it in the future once quantum computing becomes powerful enough. This makes it essential to implement PQC sooner rather than later to protect sensitive information from future threats. Current market trends and statistics According to a recent Allied Market Research report , the global quantum cryptography market was valued at $89 million in 2020 and is projected to reach $214 million by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 19.1% during the forecast period. The rising demand for cybersecurity solutions in industries such as finance, healthcare and government is driving this growth. Another study by Deloitte estimates that more than 25% of all encrypted data on the internet could be at risk once quantum computers become powerful enough. This alarming statistic underscores the urgency of transitioning to post-quantum cryptographic methods. Challenges in implementing PQC Despite its potential, quantum-resistant cryptography comes with its own set of challenges. Computational overhead – Some PQC algorithms require significantly more processing power, making them less efficient for low-power devices. Compatibility issues – Existing digital systems must be upgraded or redesigned to accommodate new cryptographic methods. Standardization delays – The process of establishing universally accepted quantum-resistant algorithms is still ongoing, slowing down widespread adoption. Cost of migration – Transitioning to post-quantum security involves significant investment in infrastructure and training. Industries at high risk Some industries are more vulnerable than others to quantum threats due to their reliance on secure communications and data protection. Financial services – Banks and payment processors rely on encryption for transactions. A breach due to quantum attacks could lead to financial chaos. Healthcare – Patient records and medical data must remain confidential. Quantum computing could make it easier to breach these databases. Government and defense – National security agencies depend on cryptographic security to protect classified information. Cloud computing – Cloud storage providers need quantum-resistant encryption to ensure data remains safe from future threats. Steps to prepare for a post-quantum world Organizations must take proactive steps to integrate PQC into their cybersecurity strategies. Steps include the following. Identifying vulnerable encryption methods in current systems. Testing and integrating post-quantum cryptographic algorithms into applications. Collaborating with cybersecurity experts and regulatory bodies to stay ahead of emerging threats. Educating stakeholders about the risks of quantum computing and the need for cryptographic transition. Adopting hybrid cryptographic solutions that combine classical and quantum-resistant encryption during the transition phase. The road ahead As quantum computing continues to advance, the race for quantum-resistant security solutions is intensifying. Companies like IBM, Google and Microsoft are heavily investing in quantum research, which means the reality of breaking current encryption standards is approaching faster than anticipated. The need for action is clear – organizations must prioritize quantum-resistant cryptography to protect their digital infrastructure. Conclusion Quantum computing is no longer a distant future – it’s an imminent reality that requires immediate attention.

42880804,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=390699,1743738247,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/42880804.jpeg,"Here’s Why Ethereum (ETH) Continues to Bleed, According to CryptoQuant",https://cryptopotato.com/heres-why-ethereum-eth-continues-to-bleed-according-to-cryptoquant/,"The past few months have been difficult for the Ethereum ecosystem, with ether (ETH) falling to levels not seen since 2020. ETH is significantly underperforming compared to bitcoin (BTC) and some major cap altcoins. Worse still, the bleeding does not appear to be stopping soon. According to a report by the market analytics platform CryptoQuant, diminished network activity is one of the major reasons why Ethereum has been losing value. This continued subdued activity is contributing to a high inflation rate for ETH, making the cryptocurrency lose its value over time. Diminishing Network Activity The number of active addresses on Ethereum has been reducing steadily since the beginning of the year. In addition, average fees per transaction and per block have plummeted to record lows. As a result of the low fees and fewer active addresses, the ETH burn rate has fallen to its lowest level since the Merge. Recall that Ethereum introduced a burn mechanism to remove a portion of ETH from circulation to ensure the asset remained deflationary over time. These coins are taken from Ethereum gas fees and permanently removed from the supply. The Merge, which marked the transition of Ethereum from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, aimed to bolster this concept by ensuring more ETH was burned than produced. However, after the Dencun upgrade last year, which introduced blobs and reduced transaction fees, less ETH was burned and more minted. This caused ether to become inflationary again. With the ETH burn rate hovering around its lowest level since the Merge, inflationary pressures on the cryptocurrency have intensified . “Ethereum’s recent underperformance can be largely attributed to diminished network activity, as evidenced by declining active addresses and reduced transaction fees. These factors, coupled with a low burn rate post-Dencun upgrade and a continuous high inflation rate, continue to exert downward pressure on the asset’s value,” said pseudonymous CryptoQuant analyst EgyHash. ETH Down 4% Daily Furthermore, EgyHash stated that Ethereum faces a chance at potential recovery if there is a positive change in the network’s activity—an increase in active addresses, which would lead to higher transaction fees and more ETH being burned. At the time of writing, ETH was worth $1,790, down 4% daily per data from CoinMarketCap. Notably, the asset was negatively affected by the announcement confirming the implementation of trade tariffs in the United States. Moreover, ether has lost 16% of its value in the past month and is down by more than 60% since this cycle’s peak at just over $4,000.

Their XO Swap platform generates about 85% of their revenue. This is mostly thanks to its security and partnerships with Ledger, without self-custody hassles. You see, EXOD's Passkeys and MPC technology significantly simplify self-custody, eliminating cumbersome seed phrases and making crypto much more user-friendly. Their balance sheet and runway also seem safe for now, though ideally, they should already be cash flow positive in my view. So, after the recent 60% price pullback, the Company now looks like a compelling play in crypto. Exodus Movement, Inc. ( EXOD ) is basically a financial technology company that offers self-custodial digital crypto wallets. These wallets allow users to swap between several blockchains and move between fiat and crypto using a user-friendly and secure platform. Interestingly, their wallets are also integrated with third-party providers that support their transactions with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, among others. Also, it has partnerships with other complementary platforms like Ledger and Magic Eden. One important feature of EXOD's wallets is the use of Passkey and multi-party computation [MPC] that are relatively user-friendly while maintaining secure self-custody standards. And after the recent 60% pullback, I feel it's fair to once again lean bullish on EXOD at these levels. A Crypto Wallet Play Exodus Movement is a fintech that was founded back in 2015 for self-custodial cryptocurrency wallets. Over time, they also added a multi-asset platform that's accessible and user-friendly. The company also aggregates third-party services for easy crypto swapping, productive stacking, and fiat-to-crypto onboarding. They're headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, but as you might imagine, their crypto exposure makes their services available virtually worldwide. Moreover, I believe EXOD's wallets have interesting features that distinguish them from others. Firstly, many wallets are custodial, meaning that a company or exchange saves the private keys. However, this does expose the crypto assets themselves to third-party security risks. In contrast, EXOD's wallets are self-custodial , which means that they are controlled directly by the users. Corporate Presentation - March 2025 In fact, EXOD's platform doesn't have access to users' private keys because they are stored locally on their devices. Other important features are that these wallets offer simpler interfaces, good customer support, and have so far a very strong security track record. Additionally, EXOD's wallets support all the major blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano in a single wallet. These crypto assets can be swapped within EXOD's wallet at relatively good prices and without major slippage costs. The company also offers tools to move funds between traditional money, like USD or EUR (i.e., fiat), and crypto. For this, EXOD's solutions use third-party API providers that check multiple offerings and choose the best prices available. This way, its users fulfill their buy/sell orders seamlessly at the best available prices. Also, EXOD's fiat on-ramps integrate providers such as MoonPay, PayPal, Blockchain.com, Ramp, Robinhood, and Sardine. These are all well-known payment processors with large ecosystems that make EXOD's crypto services highly accessible with traditional credit and debit cards, transfers, or even PayPal transactions. Corporate Presentation - March 2025 Furthermore, EXOD is also partnered with Ledger, which is a well-known provider of hardware wallets. For most crypto native users, hardware wallets are a must because these ensure funds are always safe and don't depend on any third parties. This allows users to store cryptocurrency offline much more securely. This is why EXOD's partnership with Ledger means their integrated XO Swap also has the same benefits as traditional hardware wallets without the hassles of self-custody. Note that XO Swap is EXOD's exchange aggregator, but it has the same security as a hardware wallet. This is because the connection from the users' ledger to XO Swap is via Bluetooth. Still, all signing operations are done inside the Ledger hardware wallet device. Since these signatures aren't performed inside EXOD's app, this basically ensures users always have end-to-end encryption in their transactions. Corporate Presentation - March 2025 At this point, the main risk comes from the human side. For instance, security breaches could involve users themselves accepting unknown pairing requests or approving malicious transactions without proper verifications on the hardware wallet's screen. Another interesting EXOD's partnership is with Magic Eden , which is a popular NFT marketplace on the Solana blockchain. Magic Eden users get access to EXOD's services to buy crypto with fiat money and then swap crypto across blockchains. EXOD's users can seamlessly interact with NFTs directly from their wallet, which is much more convenient than using the blockchain itself directly. Corporate Presentation - March 2025 More recently, in 2024, EXOD generated 85% of its revenue from XO Swap. And approximately 7% came from its partnerships with as Ledger or Magic Eden, which produce fees from swaps through those partners. Finally, around 8% of its full-year revenues came from non-exchange aggregation services like fiat onboarding and staking. So, overall, EXOD doesn't hold user funds but still produces fees through third-party services. And interestingly, roughly two-thirds of EXOD's users are international. Passkeys and MPC Simplify Self-Custody Having said that, I believe that one of EXOD's main innovations is that its platform uses Passkeys . These are a relatively new approach that simplifies access to digital wallets using biometric authentication, a PIN, or a password, without requiring a seed phrase. This way, other decentralized apps [dApps] can integrate EXOD's wallets into their systems to create or access wallets. Also, users can seamlessly use fiat onboarding tools, or even swap between crypto coins with self-custody and user control through multi-party computation [MPC]. In my view, Passkey wallet with MPC is probably going to be the future of crypto and decentralized assets in general. When users log in with biometrics or a password, EXOD's system coordinates a secure MPC protocol without needing a seed phrase. Corporate Presentation - March 2025 You see, MPC is a cryptographic method that enables multiple parties to manage a private key without accessing the full key itself. MPC allows for better security because to compromise a wallet, the attacker would need to compromise several different locations at once. And since the full private key is never in one place, there is no need to memorize a 12 or 24-word recovery phrase. Plus, if the user losses access, they can easily regain control by using cloud backups or device re-authentication instead of resorting to a long seed phrase again. The most important theme of all this is EXOD's focus on making the system safe, without sacrificing the decentralization and self-custody benefits that crypto brings. And all without expecting its users to have any technical skills. Valuation and Risk Analysis Now, from a valuation perspective, EXOD trades at a $1.3 billion market cap already, making it a mid-sized company in its sector. Its balance sheet holds $68.4 million in cash and short-term investments, against essentially no financial debt. And its book value stands at $257.5 million, indicating a somewhat high P/B of 5.1. For comparison, its sector's median P/B is just 3.1, so the stock does seem to carry a bit of a premium at these levels. After all, the stock has already retraced roughly 60% from its recent January 2025 highs. Seeking Alpha Charts Similarly, according to Seeking Alpha's dashboard on them, EXOD is projected to generate about $192.0 million in revenues by 2026. That would still price them at an expensive forward P/S of 6.8, which is also much higher than its sector's median forward P/S multiple of just 2.6 . Still, in a way, I do believe EXOD deserves a premium for its above-average topline growth of 106.9%, which vastly outpaces its peers' growth of 5.1%. Seeking Alpha And in fact, this is probably the main reason why I ultimately lean bullish on EXOD. However, looking at their latest quarterly cash burn of $5.3 million, it does imply a modest runway of 12.9 quarters. And that was back at year-end 2024, so by now their runway is probably closer to 11.9 quarters, or 3.0 years. Note that I got those figures by adding their Q4 2024 cash flows from operations and CAPEX. But ideally, I'd like to see EXOD generating positive cash flows already, given their sizeable top line, so I'm a bit concerned about their long-term margins. Similarly, if we see any margin deterioration or maybe a substantial revenue decline during this crypto downturn, EXOD's premium valuation could quickly vanish. Corporate Presentation - March 2025 And lastly, EXOD is quickly becoming a Bitcoin play in a sense, as it's actively accumulating as much Bitcoin as it can. As of 2024, they already held 1941 Bitcoins, which alone was worth as much as $194.1 million back when Bitcoin broke through the $100.0 thousand price milestone in Q4 2024. In other words, they're now directly exposed to Bitcoin's price fluctuations as well. Conclusion: Speculative Buy Overall, EXOD looks like a growth play in crypto, but that's not without its risks. Moreover, the current US administration has been vocal pro-crypto , but we don't know how this stance might change over time and with the following presidencies. Although, I would consider those more macro and long-term risks. As it stands today, I feel EXOD is a nice way to gain exposure to fees generated from crypto transactions. Plus, their focus on self-custody seems like a good strategic focus, since crypto natives tend to be very sensitive about this item as well. Thus, I rate EXOD a reasonably sound ""speculative Buy"" in this sector.",EXOD,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING|WALLET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-04-04 03:59:36
42881337,https://square.htx.com/?p=43614,1743739200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/100/default.png,Justin Sun: The Watchman of Web3,https://square.htx.com/justin-sun-the-watchman-of-web3/,"On April 2, 2025, Justin Sun once again set the crypto world abuzz. As reported by CoinDesk, Sun stepped in with a critical injection of liquidity to support TrueUSD (TUSD) amid a staggering $456 million reserve gap—averting a potential depegging crisis that could have rocked the stablecoin ecosystem. “Godzilla was destroying the city. I’m Ultraman—I came in and punched Godzilla to save everyone,” Sun told Hong Kong media outlet Sing Tao Daily, in his trademark flair. But behind the theatrics lies a much graver mission. Sun is taking on the alleged fraud by First Digital Trust (FDT) and its affiliated partners, urging Hong Kong regulators & and law enforcement agencies to take decisive measures to address these loopholes. “These assets are essentially public users’ money,” he said. “To protect users and uphold Hong Kong’s credibility as a global financial hub, I had to step in. The scale of the fraud shocked me. All fraudsters must be held accountable.” A Relentless Defender of Crypto Crypto has always been a volatile adventure. Bull runs feel like reaching for the stars, while crashes leave only wreckage. But in these uncertain times, Justin Sun has made it his role to keep the lights on. He’s not just a survivor—he’s a watchman. Someone who shows up when others hesitate. The Ethereum Showdown: Twice Tested, Never Broken Sun’s relationship with Ethereum has been nothing short of a saga. During the infamous May 19, 2021 crash, ETH dipped below $2,000 and Sun was inches away from liquidation. He repaid $300 million just in time to protect his 606,000 ETH position and threw in another $280 million to buy more ETH and BTC at fire-sale prices. “My assets were safe, but it felt like a bullet grazed my scalp. The wick was brutal,” he wrote on Weibo. It wasn’t just a trade. It was a battle of conviction. He shielded his own position while keeping the crypto dream alive. In 2024, ETH lagged in performance and Sun faced fresh rumors of massive losses and sell-offs. Instead of retreating, he proposed bold plans: Halt ETH Sales, heavily tax Layer 2 solutions, streamline foundation & optimize revenue. Wild? Maybe. But Sun has always married ambition with execution. Reviving HTX: From Burnout to Breakout Critics once joked that Sun “got burned” buying into HTX (formerly Huobi). When he stepped in as Global Advisor in October 2022, the market was reeling from FTX’s collapse, and centralized exchanges were under siege. HTX had lost ground—and users. Today, HTX is thriving. Trading volume and user activity are up, euro-stablecoin trading is on top three globally, and its CIS market share is dominant. It even made Forbes’ list of “Top 25 Most Trustworthy Crypto Exchanges of 2025.” The same exchange that once looked like a liability? Now a pillar of Sun’s empire. FTX Fallout: Standing in the Storm When FTX collapsed in November 2022, chaos swept the markets. Sun publicly pledged to support TRON-related tokens and HT assets with 1:1 redemption. He even told Bloomberg he was prepared to inject “billions” to help FTX, subject to due diligence. FTX ultimately folded, but Sun’s swift move bought time for users and preserved value within the TRON and HTX ecosystems. The Curve Crisis: DeFi Gets a Lifeline DeFi’s fragility was exposed again in 2023 when Curve Finance was hacked. Founder Michael Egorov faced possible liquidation on $100M in loans. As CRV tanked, Sun and allies stepped in, purchasing 72 million CRV for $28.8 million to shore up the protocol. He didn’t stop there—Sun launched a stUSDT pool on TRON, giving the ecosystem a boost. Some say it was strategic self-interest. But in a storm, does it matter who holds the umbrella, as long as someone does? Controversial but Unshaken Sun’s name always invites debate. Opportunist or idealist? Visionary or self-promoter? The truth probably lies somewhere in between. Yes, he’s bold. Yes, he’s ambitious. But when others flee, he steps forward. From converting $HT to $HTX, to partnering with WLFI on reserve-backed assets, Sun continues to bet on crypto’s long-term future. “I’m not here to make a quick buck,” he once said. “I want to build something that lasts.” Love him or not, in the darkest hours of Web3, Justin Sun has made a habit of showing up with a flashlight.

While Cronos and Ethereum Classic have earned solid reputations through steady progress and loyal communities, they often leave users to navigate systems on their own. Cronos has widened its use cases but is still recovering from a notable price slide. Ethereum Classic sticks to a stable system but doesn’t provide much support for active user engagement. What sets BlockDAG (BDAG) apart is its strong focus on usability. Participants in its testnet get access to a full set of tools and real-time guidance, placing user needs at the center of the experience rather than making them secondary. Cronos (CRO): Expansion Steps and User Returns Cronos (CRO) powers the Cronos blockchain, developed by Crypto.com. It began as a tool for handling transactions within the Crypto.com platform and has grown to become the gas fee token for Cronos EVM and zkEVM chains. CRO now supports DeFi services, NFT functions, and gaming apps, positioning it as a key asset within the expanding ecosystem. A key move occurred in March 2025, when the Cronos community voted to release 70 billion CRO over the next decade to fuel ecosystem growth. This includes work on a CRO-backed ETF designed to draw interest from major financial institutions. Alongside that, a proposal to burn 50 million CRO from reserves was made to reduce supply and potentially raise demand. These actions reflect a long-term goal of maintaining growth and increasing value. On March 30, 2025, CRO was priced at around $0.099. Compared to 2024 highs, this reflects a drop of nearly 50%, largely in line with wider corrections in the market. Still, outlooks from analysts remain mildly positive. Depending on how adoption progresses, projections suggest CRO could climb to between $0.124958 and $0.337643 by the end of 2025. Ethereum Classic (ETC): Steady Model with Market Resilience Ethereum Classic (ETC) came into being in 2016 after a split from Ethereum, following the principle of “code is law” to preserve blockchain integrity. It continues to rely on Proof-of-Work (PoW), allowing developers to create dApps on a secure platform. In terms of price action, ETC has held its ground. As of March 30, 2025, it trades at about $16.47. That marks a drop of roughly 50% from its 2024 peak, which mirrors the downturn seen across many cryptocurrencies. Forecasts for ETC in 2025 are mixed, with some suggesting a rise to between $50.28 and $60.03 if broader conditions improve. Its focus on consistency, along with generally lower transaction fees compared to Ethereum, appeals to those looking for a more stable option in the market. The fixed maximum supply of 210 million ETC also makes it an asset that could better resist inflation. Looking at both Cronos and Ethereum Classic, each has faced market shifts yet continued building with community support and clear plans. Though performance has been affected by larger trends, the long-term potential of both projects depends heavily on future adoption and market stability. BlockDAG Gives Testnet Users Full Access to Tools and Support BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet, named “Primordial,” is carefully designed for ease of use. It provides users and developers with a full set of tools to explore features, manage wallets, run smart contracts, and interact confidently with the system. Key resources include a Block Explorer to track live transactions, a user-friendly Wallet interface to check balances and vesting, and a no-code dApp Wizard for launching applications quickly. There’s also a built-in IDE for creating and deploying contracts, backed by detailed technical documentation. Whether someone is mining, building, or simply engaging with the platform, each process is clearly laid out and easy to follow. In addition to these tools, BlockDAG offers around-the-clock technical help through Freshdesk. This includes live agent support and the option to escalate technical concerns directly to developers. These services aim to lower entry barriers, encourage testing, and ensure users are not just part of the process—they’re in full control. The momentum from this tool-focused rollout is reflected in BlockDAG’s crypto presale . As of Batch 27, the project has raised $210.5 million, distributing over 19.1 billion coins at the current rate of $0.0248 per coin. Those who joined in Batch 1 have already seen gains of 2,380%, showing strong backing from the wider market. Yet this growth is not just based on numbers—it shows how people respond to systems that are easy to use, reliable, and scalable. With rewards for top testnet users, automated vesting features, and real BDAG earnings, BlockDAG continues to build a group of users focused on long-term goals. Final Remarks! Practical use isn’t only about transaction volume or total market value—it’s about how well a blockchain supports its users across every stage. While Cronos adds value through DeFi connections and Ethereum Classic stays true to immutability, both fall short in providing tools that bring users closer to the system. In contrast, BlockDAG hands over the tools and support people need to fully participate, create, and explore with confidence. It’s more than just building software—it’s about making sure people have what they need to take full part in the network. That core idea may be what shapes which projects truly last.

This is not a typical sales event. Half of Dragoin’s total supply is open only for presale participants. Here’s the key detail—any coins not bought during this period will be permanently eliminated through a burn process. This approach ensures a reduced future supply. The first stage is currently active, offering $DDGN at $0.0000292. By the final presale stage, the token is expected to reach $0.002. This progression reflects a built-in 6,700% growth potential. Early participants benefit from securing a larger amount at a significantly lower price. With each stage pushing the cost higher, those acting soonest gain the most. Dragoin Presale: Supply Burns Add Urgency Dragoin’s presale method includes a planned reduction in supply through permanent burns. A total of 50% of all Dragoin coins are made available only during the presale, spread across 25 structured stages. Any tokens left unsold during these stages are permanently removed, not hidden or stored for future use. This approach is rare among meme projects and gives a real edge to early movers. Rather than stretching supply to influence value later, Dragoin’s method does the reverse—every unsold coin lowers the overall supply. The strategy is clearly explained upfront, giving early users a chance to take action before availability drops. Stage 1 is now active, priced at $0.0000292. As each phase completes, prices move up, and available coins decrease. The final target is $0.002, offering early buyers a potential 67x increase before public trading begins. Those who join early aren’t just getting in—they’re stepping into a limited supply at the best rate available. Structured Presale Design Gives Early Entry an Edge The Dragoin presale is broken into 25 stages, each carrying a themed title like “The Battle of Harrenhal” or “The Final Battle for the Iron Throne.” These titles represent more than branding—they signify progression, where each stage carries a higher price. This design supports fast participation and rewards earlier involvement. Each stage releases a fixed amount of coins, and once those are gone, the next stage begins at a higher price. That means joining sooner results in receiving more $DDGN for the same payment. Those purchasing in Stage 1, for example, are paying over 60 times less than what is expected post-launch. This isn’t speculative; it follows Dragoin’s preset pricing model. The system ensures fairness while supporting community engagement. Early participants who understand the setup stand to benefit the most. This process isn’t driven by hype but by a calculated rollout that increases in cost the longer one waits. Why Permanent Token Burns Support Value The choice to remove all unsold tokens permanently after the presale carries real implications. Once taken out of circulation, the total number of $DDGN becomes smaller. That limited supply may lead to stronger pricing as more users discover Dragoin. Typical projects face the risk of future supply increases due to undisclosed team holdings or delayed distributions. Dragoin eliminates that issue. Its model allows everyone to see exactly how many coins exist and where they’re allocated. There’s no fear of surprise dumps or hidden supply. This clarity helps early buyers retain more stable value over time. Supply won’t unexpectedly rise. Additionally, the burn strategy sends a message that long-term scarcity is a priority over short-term gains. Those who join the presale at early stages are getting the lowest possible price. If Dragoin reaches $0.002 after its market listing, Stage 1 buyers could see gains of up to 6,700%. The structure is clear, ensuring those who act fast are positioned to benefit without relying on speculation. Scarcity Mechanism Drives Future Demand Dragoin’s permanent burn model doesn’t just reduce supply—it builds long-term value. When assets are harder to obtain, demand usually increases. Once the presale ends and leftover coins are burned, new participants must buy from existing holders at market rate. This creates a strong balance between availability and demand. As the Dragoin ecosystem expands—especially with the upcoming play-to-earn Telegram game—more users will compete for fewer available tokens. Those who joined early will hold a rare asset with added uses. They gain the benefit of being first. Scarcity strengthens Dragoin’s overall structure. The project avoids flooding the market and instead follows a planned rollout, increasing value over time. The path from $0.0000292 to $0.002 isn’t speculative—it’s outlined from the beginning. This clear pricing structure helps build anticipation and confidence, especially for those who understand supply economics. Wrapping Up! The Dragoin presale setup gives early participants a strong starting advantage. With 50% of supply available only during presale and all unsold coins permanently burned, the available supply shrinks quickly. Early stages offer the lowest pricing and highest volume for purchase. Stage 1 is already open at $0.0000292, with the final listing price set at $0.002, marking a built-in 6,700% growth. With every presale stage, prices go up and coin supply tightens. The structure is transparent and designed to reward early participation. Those exploring Dragoin now stand to gain the most. Once unsold coins are burned, there’s no bringing them back. Acting at the start locks in the best deal and the strongest potential gain.

Over the years, crypto narratives have contributed to shaping how people perceive and value cryptocurrencies, influencing investor sentiment, market trends, and the adoption of new technologies. Currently, some of the trending narratives influencing the crypto market and projects are artificial intelligence (AI), stablecoins, layer 1 blockchains (L1s), memecoins, real world assets (RWAs) tokens, DeFAI, AI agents and DeSci among others. A declining trend in key performance metrics According to trends data shared by Web3 analytics platform , Dexu.ai, DeSci, AI agents and DeFAI narratives price performance have seen a decline and are currently at -80.50%, -86.67% and -67.38% over the last 90 days. Other narratives, such as RWA and CEX performed marginally better, even though they also have negative figures of -52.08% and -18.01%, respectively. DeSci, AI agents and DeFAI narratives price performance have seen a decline in Q1 of 2025. Source: Dexu.ai. Under the sub-category for price performances, the data is also grim, showcasing a downward trend in the negative 90% region for the respective narratives that were touted to be the future of decentralized technology applications in late 2024. The three narratives continue to perform poorly, holding 4.51%, 3.35% and 0.29% for DeFAI, AI agents and DeSci, respectively, in terms of the mindshare performance category, a metric that tracks how these narratives are being actively discussed, including trends across social media, in this case X (formerly Twitter). The three narratives continue to perform poorly in terms of the mindshare performance category. Source: Dexu.ai. L1s lead the pack with a mindshare percentage of 18.89%. A high mindshare typically means a larger market share because users are more likely to invest in projects or narratives they recognize and trust. On the other hand, the decline in social media buzz suggests that enthusiasm around DeFAI, AI Agents, and DeSci might be fading. In terms of project volumes that fall under the three narratives, DeSci and DeFAI seem to be lagging with projects linked to them amassing $32.55 million and $36.68 million in volume. AI agents are doing better with a volume of $903 million, although it’s still a far cry from what stablecoin and L1 narrative projects pulled, with reported volumes of $86.59 billion and $67.92 billion. Project volumes for the DeSci and DeFAI narratives have fallen behind, although AI agents are doing better. Source: Dexu.ai. DeFi and memecoins, which have been around longer, continue to maintain significantly higher trading volumes, recording $2.15 billion and $4.13 billion in volume, indicating a major gulf between the volume of the highly touted narrative trio of late 2024 relative to their older counterparts. Among the three narratives, AI agents lead in market cap, with a valuation of $1.68 billion, while DeSci and DeFAI come last with market cap valuations of $171.57 million and $124.21 million. All three narratives don’t come close to the leader, L1, which has a $2.22 trillion market cap. DeSci and DeFAI only hold a small fraction of the market cap valuations of top narratives like L1. Source: Dexu.ai. In terms of market cap to volume ratio, AI agents are leading the pack at 53.72%, while DeFAI and DeSci are also performing well with 28.89% and 18.54%. According to Dexu.ai, this data was computed by taking the median value for all the projects across each narrative. The Web3 analytics platform highlighted that a higher value signifies increased interest in trading in that narrative. However, this metric doesn’t translate to a higher volume because narratives like DeSci with low market caps could easily amass high ratios. This works the other way for narratives with high market caps, a case in point being L1s, which had a volume to market cap ratio of 12.47%. The market caps of the narratives were also compared to the fully diluted valuation (FDV), a metric used to gauge a cryptocurrency project’s future value by considering its total token supply. This was to indicate the percentage of tokens from projects linked to each narrative that are currently in circulation. AI agents and DeFAI seem to be doing well in that department, with percentages of 81.51% and 78.75%, however, DeSci at 32.83% has a low market cap to FDV ratio. Understanding DeFAI, AI Agents and DeSci With the boom of artificial intelligence and the search for more use cases for the technology in the blockchain space, DeFAI emerged, enabling the integration of AI into DeFi platforms. The goal of this fusion was to bring ease to complex financial operations, lowering the entry barrier, providing better insights for trading and yield optimization to both experienced traders and newbies alike. AI agents are another application of AI in the crypto space. These agents are known for their widespread applications across various industries, and they are used to execute tasks ranging from trading strategies to managing decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Tokens related to AI agents have risen in terms of market capitalization, especially late last year and early this year, reflecting consumer willingness to invest in AI-powered solutions in the crypto space. DeSci also garnered attention by proposing decentralized models for funding, conducting, and sharing scientific research. This movement aims to address challenges in traditional research systems, such as high access costs and centralized control, by leveraging blockchain technology to promote transparency and collaboration. While these narratives gained sizable traction towards the end of 2024, with projects in these sectors experiencing significant market activity, the early months of 2025 have been telling a different story, as recent data indicates a downward trend across key performance metrics. The decline of DeFAI, AI Agents, and DeSci raises important questions about the sustainability of crypto narratives driven by hype. While their initial success showed strong use cases and technological potential, the current downturn may give credence to the assumption that investors are shifting their focus to more stable and established blockchain applications.

Ripple has agreed to pay a reduced fine of $50 million, slashing the original $125 million penalty. In return, the SEC will request Judge Analisa Torres to lift the “obey the law” injunction, which had forced Ripple to register future securities sales. Yet, despite this monumental win, XRP’s price has remained oddly stagnant, defying expectations of a post-settlement surge. This has left the XRP community in a state of suspense, eagerly awaiting an official statement from the SEC—similar to the responses seen in cases involving Kraken and Cumberland. In the latest development, an unexpected filing has surfaced in the SEC vs. Ripple docket. A man named Justin W. Keener has submitted an emergency request, claiming to possess “decisive evidence in favor of the defendants and in favor of liberty for the American people.” The filing is cryptic, offering little detail about the nature of the evidence, except that it involves physical investment contracts Keener has been collecting.

The SEC recently sued him for operating as an unregistered penny stock dealer, and a court has ordered him to pay over $10 million in damages. So, what’s the deal? Is this an attempt to sway the court in Ripple’s favor, or is it just another distraction in an already complex legal landscape?

On a Apr. 3 post in X, Sun said he had met with Hong Kong lawmaker Johnny Wu to report the case and submitted related materials to local regulators and judicial authorities. The alleged embezzlement centers on FDT’s handling of client assets, which Sun claims have been misappropriated.

FDT dismissed Sun’s claims as “false information” and a “smear campaign.” The company warned it would take legal action to defend its name and accused Sun of spreading false information.

The question is, is it a sustained rally that we will see for six to twelve months,” Real Vision chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts told Real Vision co-founder Raoul Pal on an April 3 X livestream . Network activity will be the ‘north star’ for how to trade crypto “At this stage, I am not too sure, but I do believe that quality altcoins where activity returns, activity drives prices …we will definitely see a recovery in some of these more high-quality names,” Coutts said. Cointelegraph reported in January that there were over 36 million altcoins in existence . However, Ethereum still holds the majority share of total value locked (TVL) with 55.56%, followed by Solana (6.89%), Bitcoin (5.77%), BNB Smart Chain (5.68%), and Tron (5.54%), according to CoinGecko data. Coutts said traders should watch where the network activity “is gravitating” and use that as their “north star” for how to trade in crypto, adding he sees an altcoin market upswing within the next two months. “I’m expecting by June to see altcoins really start to pick up again. Predicated on the fact that Bitcoin is back at all-time highs by that point.” On March 28, Coutts told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin could reach all-time highs before the end of Q2 regardless of whether there is more clarity on US President Donald Trump's tariffs and potential recession concerns. The total crypto market cap is down around 8% over the past 30 days. Source: CoinMarketCap Blockchain network activity across the board has recently experienced sharp declines amid a broader crypto market downturn. On Feb. 21, Cointelegraph reported that the number of active addresses on the Solana ( SOL ) network fell to a weekly average of 9.5 million in February, down nearly 40% from the 15.6 million active addresses in November 2024. Altcoin indicators are flashing red Meanwhile, several key indicators the crypto industry uses to determine an incoming altcoin season suggest it's still nowhere in sight. Capriole Investments’ Altcoin Speculation Index has dropped to 12%, down 53% since Dec. 25, the same period during which Ether fell 49% from $3,490, according to CoinMarketCap data. Related: When will altseason arrive? Experts reveal what's holding back altcoins CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index , which measures the top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin’s performance over the past 90 days, is reading a score of 14 out of 100, leaning toward a more Bitcoin-dominated market, referring to it as “Bitcoin Season.” The Altcoin Season Index Chart is sitting at 14 at the time of publication. Source: CoinMarketCap However, while Bitcoin dominance — a level often watched for retracements that signal an altcoin season — sits at 62.84%, some analysts argue it’s no longer as relevant as a signal for altcoin season.

Bitcoin dropped as much as 6%, briefly touching $82,000, while the broader crypto market shed around 3% amid rising fears of a global economic slowdown. The downturn came after Trump declared April 2 “Liberation Day ” and announced a sweeping 10% baseline tariff on all US imports. Higher duties were also imposed on several major trading partners. Following Trump's tariff announcements yesterday, the S&P 500 is currently down -4.02% in Thursday trading. In the 2020's, there have only been 5 worse performing days: March 16, 2020: -11.98%​ March 12, 2020: -9.51%​ March 9, 2020: -7.60%​ June 11, 2020: -5.89%… pic.twitter.com/TpTbYMDFZF — Santiment (@santimentfeed) April 3, 2025 S&P 500 Sees Worst Drop Since 2022 as Trump’s Tariffs Rattle Global Markets Trump framed the move as an effort to end “unfair trade practices.” His announcement triggered immediate volatility in both traditional and digital asset markets. Global equities fell across the board. US stocks mirrored losses seen in Asia and Europe. The S&P 500 slipped back into correction territory, shedding nearly $2t in value. It was the index’s worst single-day drop since Sept. 2022. Deutsche Bank has warned that the tariffs could shave 1% to 1.5% off US GDP this year. Crypto markets weren’t spared. Ethereum (ETH), XRP and Solana (SOL) also posted losses, and the ETH/BTC ratio slipped to its lowest point since June 2020 before slightly recovering. “We will likely continue to see the fallout of this strategy throughout Q2 and possibly throughout the summer, before Trump begins to ease off the pressure,” Ultra’s CEO Gus van Rijckevorsel said. While he expects Trump to eventually return to the negotiating table, Rijckevorsel noted that “he’ll end up being the firefighter, putting out the fires of his own making.” Trump Tariffs, Inflation and Budget Woes Stir Market Jitters Across Assets Traders are now trying to understand how the tariffs will affect trade, interest rates and investor willingness to take risks. Maksym Sakharov, co-founder at WeFi, said the business impact may be limited for now. However, he warned that inflation could make it harder for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Meanwhile, Washington’s upcoming budget debate is adding to market unease. The Treasury is currently using “extraordinary measures” to meet its obligations. Analysts warn that the US could face a funding crunch if a debt ceiling deal isn’t reached soon. While Bitcoin has occasionally moved independently of traditional markets, recent performance suggests it is still sensitive to broader risk-off sentiment. “Given the negative outlook in stock markets, we anticipate that selling pressure may also extend to cryptocurrencies,” said Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler. “Though we do not expect a dramatic selloff in the short term.” The post Crypto Market Slides 3% As Trump’s Sweeping Tariffs Rattle Assets, Recession Fears Mount appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|Crypto Market|tariffs,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-04-04 04:40:37

42882862,https://coingape.com/?p=247257,1743742257,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,How Soon Can Pi Network (PI) Coin Price Bounce Back?,https://coingape.com/how-soon-can-pi-network-coin-price-bounce-back/,"Pi Network’s (PI) coin price has been on a downward trend, hitting a new monthly low of $0.5376 on April 4, down 69%. This continues a sharp PI price decline from the March peak, sparking concerns among investors. However, technical indicators suggest a potential rebound in the short term, although broader challenges may limit any significant recovery. Will Pi Coin Price Bounce Back? The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Pi Network’s coin has dropped below 20, signaling oversold conditions on the hourly chart. Typically, when the RSI falls into this region, a short-term price rebound may follow. Historical trends in the market show that such oversold conditions often lead to temporary recoveries. Source: TradingView Any rebound in PI price is expected to face strong resistance near the $0.6817 to $0.6915 range. This level was once support but has now turned into resistance due to the price’s recent downturn. A break above this resistance would likely trigger a stronger rally, although the broader market environment might still limit the scope of any recovery. In addition to the RSI, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is currently at -0.23, indicating negative money flow. This suggests that selling pressure remains dominant, and there is more capital flowing out of the token than entering. A recent Pi Netwrok price prediction by CoinGape also revealed that bears currently remain dominant, as per the 3-month bias indicator. The chances of a recovery remain diminished due to the abovementioned concerning market dynamics. Broader Market Factors Could Limit Rebound Potential Although the technical analysis shows that Pi Network is highly likely to bounce from the current levels, factors in the broader market may halt a recovery for Pi Network. Currently, investors’ risk appetite is relatively low to moderate and most of them prefer to invest in less-risky assets than investing in other cryptocurrencies including the Pi currency. Moreover, the protracted trade dispute between the United States and the rest of the world as well as the general macroeconomic instability also contributed to the pressure on the crypto market. From within, Pi Network still suffers with a number of problems such as slow feature releases and doubts about its preparedness for the mainnet release. Some of the critics of the Pi Core Team include that the leadership cannot handle the increasing challenge of the project that has been expanding over the years since 2019. PiDaoSwap has voiced frustration over the delayed and dragged-out KYB process, even though their platform is already fully developed. This painful slowdown isn’t just affecting pioneers (with KYC approvals and mainnet migration)—it’s hitting the very ecosystems trying to build on… pic.twitter.com/tqPeLQ8oX6 — Pi Network – Open Mainnet (@Pi81Mall) April 4, 2025 The internal factors coupled with other market conditions might hinder Pi Network full recovery in the short run. Despite the positive outlook given by Craig Steven Wright and others, the community constantly complains about the lack of transparency, slow pace of the KYC integration, and the restricted access for third-party developers. Until these issues are fixed, even if the prices have recovered, it may only be a temporary phenomenon. Will Exchange Listings Boost Pi Coin Price? The overall market activity of Pi Network has been steadily rising and has now taken a promising turn. Trading volume has risen to $478 million, an increase of than 76% compared to its previous level. This is a clear indication that many are investing in the current downward trend waiting for better indicators of improve market performance. However, there is one disadvantage that may have an impact on the increase in optimism – the fact that Pi Network has not been included in the Binance Vote to List . Currently, in the second stage of voting, Binance is allowing only projects related to BNB coin to vote. Without a listing on major platforms like Binance or Coinbase, Pi Network could continue to face challenges in attracting new investors. This absence from large exchanges suggests that PI price may struggle to maintain upward momentum in the coming weeks unless it secures new listings or makes significant progress with its platform. Leadership and Community Concerns The members of the Pi Core Team are under pressure from the Pi Network community. Most people think that the leadership is out of touch with happenings within the network. Although over 125,000 sellers took part in the PiFest event some members of the community feel that the Core Team fails to respond to some profound issues such as mainnet delays, slow KYC, or the absence of listings. One of its critics has been claiming that the Pi Core Team should start with the transparent disclosure of information, as the monthly updates now look artificial and do not reflect the key issues the communities face. Some of the recommendations that have been made regarding the project include decentralizing the decision-making process to enhance accountability.

This week’s event is more modest than average and much smaller than last week’s massive end-of-month and end-of-quarter expiry event. The impact on spot markets is likely to be minimal as spot traders are still reeling from the Trump administration’s wide-sweeping global tariff announcement on Wednesday. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 1.27, meaning that there are more put (short) contracts expiring than calls (longs). There is also a max pain point of $85,000, which is where most losses will be made. Moreover, open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, is falling at higher prices, with around $850 million at $90,000 and $100,000 strike prices, according to Deribit. There is also more than $900 million in OI at the lower $80,000 strike price and over $700 million at $70,000 as derivatives traders lose confidence in higher prices and turn bearish on the longer time frames. Options Expiry Alert! Last week’s quarterly expiry brought the heat, this week’s setup is quieter, but positioning still matters. At 08:00 UTC tomorrow, ~$2.5B in crypto options are set to expire. $BTC : $2.16B notional | Put/Call: 1.27 | Max Pain: $85K $ETH : $371M… pic.twitter.com/zPezzcVn1B — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) April 3, 2025 Crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live said the group was “predominantly bearish, expecting continued choppy price action” in an options market update this week. “Traders are positioning for more blood and four more years of chop with many selling calls, particularly at the $87k and $90k to $94k levels for April 4th expiry,” it stated. Greeks noted the diminishing bullish sentiment, stating “There’s skepticism about upward movement with one trader noting nobody is ready to ‘bullieve’ anymore.” In addition to today’s tranche of Bitcoin options, there are around 204,000 Ethereum contracts that are also expiring today, with a notional value of $372 million, a max pain point of $1,850, and a put/call ratio of 1.32. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $2.5 billion. Crypto Market Outlook Spot markets have continued to retreat this week with a 6.5% decline in total capitalization since this time last Friday, dropping it to $2.75 trillion at the time of writing. Bitcoin remains weakened , having fallen below $81,500 in an intraday low before a minor recovery. It reclaimed $83,000 but fell below it again during Friday morning trading in Asia, suggesting that further downside pressure remains. Ethereum is at bear market lows, having dumped below $1,800 again and trading at levels last seen in October 2023. Meanwhile, altcoins across the board continue to weaken as market sentiment turns bearish.

According to a March 31 update from real estate firm Sterling Bay Properties, Gemini has signed a lease in Miami’s Wynwood Art District, a growing hub for tech and crypto firms, Bloomberg reported . The expansion marks a strategic move by Gemini to broaden its U.S. presence beyond its current offices in New York and Europe. Gemini Set to Open Miami Office as Early as May, Says Bloomberg Bloomberg reports the exchange could begin operating from the new location as early as May. The office opening comes as the SEC’s enforcement action against Gemini appears to be approaching a resolution. A federal judge recently ordered a 60-day pause in the case to allow both parties to explore a potential settlement. The lawsuit, initially filed in January 2023, accuses Gemini of offering and selling unregistered securities through its now-defunct Gemini Earn program.

Earlier this year, Gemini also agreed to pay a $5 million fine to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over alleged misrepresentations during its 2017 effort to launch Bitcoin futures. Gemini reportedly filed confidential paperwork for an initial public offering (IPO) in early 2024, potentially reviving plans first considered in 2021. Miami’s appeal to crypto firms continues to grow, thanks in part to Florida’s business-friendly policies and the absence of a state income tax.

Also brought a Head of State to X.” CZ’s tweet came shortly after he signed an agreement with the Kyrgyz National Investment Agency to help build the nation’s Web3 capacities. Kyrgyzstan’s A7A5 stablecoin, pegged to the Russian ruble and focused on emerging markets, is a cornerstone of that plan. Kyrgyzstan🇰🇬 Crypto adoption, one country at a time. Also brought a Head of State to X. https://t.co/jYYOdiJI4z — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) April 3, 2025 How CZ is helping Kyrgyzstan Thanks to the ton of experience he amassed as Binance’s CEO, CZ has claimed that he has been advising several governments “officially and unofficially” regarding crypto. More countries worldwide are becoming increasingly interested in crypto integration, so it is not surprising that Kyrgyzstan, which has not been a particular hub for crypto activity, is shifting its stance, too. According to recent announcements, the country is now in the process of developing a new A7A5 stablecoin pegged to the Russian ruble. CZ’s claim to be constantly working with world leaders who need his input on crypto holds up as he is a very influential figure in crypto and has been involved with a few official governments in his career. CZ finds the help he provides these people meaningful and has said as much about it on X. “I officially and unofficially advise a few governments on their crypto regulatory frameworks and blockchain solutions for gov efficiency, expanding blockchain to more than trading. I find this work extremely meaningful,” ~ Changpeng Zhao (CZ). His connection with Kyrgyzstan’s new A7A5 stablecoin is yet to be fully disclosed, but it would align with recent allegations of Trump dealings. “A Memorandum of Understanding has been signed between the National Investment Agency under the President of the Kyrgyz Republic and Changpeng Zhao (CZ). In accordance with the Memorandum, the parties intend to cooperate in the development of the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology ecosystem in the Kyrgyz Republic,” claimed President Sadyr Zhaparov in the MoU.

The president also stated that this agreement with CZ will strengthen Kyrgyzstan’s standing in the growing Web3 environment. The long-term plan is to help create new opportunities for Kyrgyz businesses and society as a whole. This will presumably involve some cooperation with Russia, as A7A5’s press release mentions “a new class of digital assets tied to the Russian economy.” Kyrgyzstan has strong ties with Russia. In 2012, both countries signed an agreement which led to the creation of a joint military base in Kyrgyzstan. Kyrgyzstan’s move may be part of its strategy to capitalize on emerging markets. At best, this is a novel experiment that could reveal new market opportunities and challenge the dominance of USD-pegged stablecoins in the region. Kyrgyzstan’s past relationship with crypto Like many other places in the world, Kyrgyzstan initially approached crypto with lots of regulations in an attempt to protect its citizens from scams and the like. Of course, a large part of it also stemmed from the fact that the government knew only the bad things the mainstream media said about crypto. Eventually, in 2020, the National Bank of Kyrgyzstan published draft legislation that would legally define cryptocurrency and how it may be used in the Central Asian nation. The legislation was the central bank’s way of following the call of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to regulate cryptocurrencies and prevent related money laundering and terrorism financing risks, according to an explanatory note . It was a necessary step to mitigate the risks as Kyrgyz’ citizens were becoming increasingly interested and exposed to cryptocurrencies, while the technology continues to gain traction in electronic commerce worldwide. The regulator announced the proposed legislation on December 31, 2020, publishing it with a package of drafts detailing why the new bill was needed and how it fits into Kyrgyzstan’s existing regulations. This laid the groundwork for Kyrgyzstan to adopt an even more comprehensive package of laws regulating the cryptocurrency market. This year, the country has introduced full legislation on digital assets, covering all major aspects of the industry — from exchanges to token issuers, thereby creating a new institutional infrastructure the market previously lacked. One of the unique innovations is the mechanism for registering token issuances under official state supervision. This gives regulators authority to ensure that token emissions comply with regulatory requirements, have fiat backing, undergo regular audits, and meet obligations to token holders. The first issuance of A7A5 (mint) was carried out in complete accordance with the new national legislation — under the control of regulatory authorities and directed to an officially registered, regulated broker. The A7A5 token can be traded on the regulated exchange Meer Exchange and is expected to be listed on decentralized platforms in the future. Its fiat backing is stored in bank accounts, and its volume is audited by an independent firm on a quarterly basis. However, the key advantage of A7A5 is the opportunity it offers to earn up to 20% annually, driven by its link to the refinancing rate of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and additional income strategies in DeFi.

The digital asset currently trades at $1.98, a daily trading volume of $10.50 billion and market value of $115 billion. Over the last 24 hours, XRP has declined by 7.7%, which mirrors larger market trends.

According to this analysis, if prices hit the anticipated bottom, a rally of as much as 70% might ensue. Lull Period Pre-Surge The price history of the cryptocurrency depicts cycles of protracted periods of quietness preceded by explosive bursts. With recent market conditions contributing to a perfect storm of inputs, investors are closely watching price charts for subtle early indications of XRP’s next big move. RP has tended to catch investors off guard with unanticipated action, and April could be a decisive month for the coin. Traders are bracing for a few different scenarios: more consolidation, a breakout, or a sudden market change. Related Reading: XRP To $27 In 60 Days?

A final test around the $2 level may be used as a springboard for what some expect to be a major breakthrough. While near-term uncertainty exists, the long-term picture is cautiously optimistic from the perspective of market observers. Technical signals alongside economic fundamentals indicate a phase of heightened price activity in the next few weeks.

With this, the US stocks had their worst day ever since 2020 . As a result, the investors are scared of further escalation and economic fallout. The negative impact has been seen over the crypto markets as Bitcoin & Ethereum remain consolidated within a range. While the technical implications suggest a bullish outlook for the ETH price rally, the whales do not appear to be confident enough. A major institutional tsunami is detected, which is expected to create serious atmospheric pressure. Millions of liquidity are hitting the exchanges, which suggests a storm is forming that may shake up the entire market. New on-chain data reveals a lot of ETH have been deposited into the exchanges in the past 24 hours. This could be a matter of concern, as it may mount enough pressure over the ETH price. As per data shared by The Data Nerd , an on-chain data provider, massive amounts of ETH have been transferred back into ETH. Grayscale deposited 16,247 ETH, worth $28.63 ETH; Blackrock deposited 10,000 ETH, worth $17.94 ETH; Wintermute deposited 34,634 ETH, worth $62.9 million; Andre Cronje deposited 2000 ETH, worth over $3.44 million; and James Fickle deposited 2.35K ETH, worth $4.19 million. On the other hand, yet another whale scooped nearly 6500 ETH , spending 11.5 million USDC that could have kept the price consolidated above the crucial support. While Ethereum faces equal pressure on both sides, will whale accumulation outweigh the uncertainty caused by institutional ETH transfers? Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis It’s a known fact that bears have been capitulating ETH price for over a period, which has kept the levels restricted within a descending range. However, a major change could be expected soon as the token has reached the end of the consolidation. However, the technicians do not suggest bullish reversal or display any bullish divergence, which raises concerns over the next price action. The ETH price in the daily timeframe is approaching the tip of the falling wedge, which is expected to trigger a huge breakout towards the immediate resistance. Meanwhile, the Accum/Dist suggests the token’s distribution is going on, and the price may begin to rise once the accumulation resumes. On the other hand, RSI remains consolidated within the lower bands, suggesting a massive drop in the strength of the rally. The bewildered on-chain data and skeptical technicals suggest that the Ethereum price volatility is expected to surge during the upcoming weekend, which could offer a good buying opportunity. However, in the long term, ETH price remains under acute bullish influence with the possibility of forming a new ATH.",Price Analysis|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-04 05:03:54

With the sweeping tariffs from Donald Trump, the stock and crypto markets have become correlated and are sensitive to macroeconomic developments. Regardless, the top trader notes that a breakdown of the US Dollar Index below a key support zone could spark the bull run for BTC price. Crypto Trader Says Breakdown of DXY Below 100 Could Spark Bitcoin Price Rally The US Dollar Index (DXY) has crashed 8% in the past 80 days, dropping from a high of 110.176 to 101.267. In the same period, Bitcoin price has shed 13%. Typically, a weak US dollar promotes risk-on behavior, allowing the stock market to rally. However, the recent intervention of Trump and his tariffs on more than 100 of US trading patterns has caused the US stock markets and BTC price to collapse.. Top trader CarpeNoctom explains that the recent crash from 103 to 101 should see crypto markets rally. Through his chart , the analyst notes Bitcoin price and the broader crypto market could ‘explode higher,’ aka restart the bull run. US Dollar Index Crashed 8% Since Jan 13 Arthur Hayes adds credence to this bullish Bitcoin price prediction by noting that BTC should decorrelate from the US tech stock. Why Collapsing DXY, Decorrelation from US Tech Stocks is Good for BTC Arthur Hayes, the recently pardoned founder of BitMEX exchange, said that he “loved tariffs.” Hayes explained, “Global imbalances will be corrected, and the pain papered over with printed money, which is good for $BTC.” The tariffs have caused the dollar to weaken while prompting foreign investors to sell US tech stocks to “bring money home.” Hayes notes that this is good for Bitcoin and gold over the medium term. Key Levels to Watch as Bitcoin Consolidates According to TraderMagus, a popular analyst and trader, the two key Bitcoin price levels to watch include $80K and $90K. Magus explains that a risk-on scenario would appear if BTC drips below $80K or if price climbs to $90K and shows strength above this level. The trader explains that intraday plays are the way to go and that investors should not get their capital chopped up. “I think it’s a massive buy opportunity once the dust settles on all this for equites & btc” To conclude, the crypto market outlook remains uncertain in the short term. In the mid-term, a sweep of $80K followed by a recovery could send Bitcoin’s value to $90K. However, a rejection at $90K could push BTC back into consolidation. On the contrary, a bearish outlook involves a breakdown of the $80K level without any support from buyers. Such a development could see the price crash to $69K, the next key foothold, where demand from long-term investors could come back.

DOGE is consolidating and might struggle to recover above $0.1680. DOGE price started a fresh decline below the $0.1750 and $0.170 levels. The price is trading below the $0.1680 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.170 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could extend losses if it breaks the $0.1550 support zone. Dogecoin Price Dips Again Dogecoin price started a fresh decline after it failed to clear $0.180, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE dipped below the $0.1750 and $0.1720 support levels. There was a break below a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.170 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair.

The next major resistance is near the $0.1740 level. A close above the $0.1740 resistance might send the price toward the $0.180 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.1880 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.1950. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.170 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.160 level. The next major support is near the $0.1550 level. The main support sits at $0.150. If there is a downside break below the $0.150 support, the price could decline further.

Pi has also hit a new All-time low of $0.53. This sudden decline comes after Binance once again excluded Pi Network from its latest round of the “Vote to List” initiative—a community-driven program that allows Binance users to vote on which cryptocurrencies should be listed on the platform. In the latest voting round, Binance selected 12 tokens: Virtual Protocol, Big Time, UXLINK, Morpho, Grass, Aethir, Walrus, Safe, Zeta, Story, Ondo, and Plume. In the first round, the chosen tokens were BANANAS31, BID, Broccoli, and KOMA (Koma Inu) among others. Despite being part of earlier community voting efforts, Pi Network’s absence from the latest list has sparked frustration among Pi holders, who feel overlooked in favor of meme coins and other projects with less utility-driven focus. This sentiment is amplified by the fact that Binance’s voting system is designed to reflect community preferences, yet Pi Network’s strong following was not enough to secure a spot. Pi Coin Price Analysis: Pi coin has hit record lows, dropping over 80% since its recent all-time high of $2.981 in February. The network’s mining rate has also fallen by 1.18%, indicating decreasing interest. With major exchanges like Binance still not listing Pi, its market momentum remains weak. However, a breakout above $0.71 could spark a short-term rally. Binance’s “Vote to List” initiative is intended to give the community more influence in listing decisions, but the exclusion of Pi Network raises questions about the criteria used for selection. While Binance has not yet provided an official statement regarding Pi’s omission, the market’s reaction has been swift, with Pi Coin’s price reflecting the disappointment among its supporters.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-04 05:13:47

This latest decline came after a former PI proponent alleged the project to be a slow rug pull, while others have questioned the team’s viability. PI Token Price. Source: CoinGecko PI’s Latest Plunge The first month and a half after PI’s official launch and ability to be traded are a perfect example of a typical ‘sell-the-news’ event in the cryptocurrency industry amid massive hype. Recall that the project actually started roughly seven years ago, and it was in development until February 20, 2025. Within this rather extensive time period, its community grew substantially even though it saw countless delays and controversial moves. After PI went live, its price shot up from under $2 to $3 to mark a new all-time high. That was on February 26. Since then, it has been nothing short of a spectacular downfall . At press time, PI trades at $0.55, which is 81.5% lower than its record. Hours ago, it charted a new all-time low of $0.54 (according to data from CoinGecko) after dumping by another 16-7% in the past day. Admittedly, the entire crypto market has struggled in the last 36 hours after Trump’s latest tariffs, but very few large or mid-cap alts have produced such massive declines. Actually, PI is the biggest loser from the top 100 alts. Next in line is SUI with -10% and all others are with single-digit drops, even the ever-volatile meme coins. PI has fallen out of the top 30 alts by market cap. Recall that the asset was close to the top 10 just over a month ago. Further Troubles Ahead? The new all-time low comes just a day after a former PI proponent did an 180 and called Pi Network a “slow rug.” Crypto X is full with analysts and commentators that are trying to make sense of what is happening with PI’s price and in the overall Pi Network ecosystem. Dr Altcoin was skeptical about PI’s long-term potential since most major exchanges, such as Binance, seem reluctant to list it, at least until the ‘Pi Core Team (PCT) becomes fully transparent about its tokenomics.’ ‘At such a low price, the Pi community will struggle to utilize DApps within the Pi Ecosystem. If this continues for months, most Pi holders will sell off their coins and shift to newer crypto projects.’ – Dr Altcoin added. The only move ahead, the X user concluded, is to ‘burn billions of Pi coins from its Pi Foundation wallets. This is the only way to push the price above $10 and sustain the network’s long-term value.’ The post Pi Network Under Fire: PI Token Plummets 16% to an All-Time Low appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Pi Network (PI),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-04-04 05:14:44

Ripple will pay a reduced civil penalty of $50 million , a 60% cut from the initially proposed $125 million. In exchange, the SEC has agreed to request the removal of a key injunction that previously required Ripple to register future securities sales. But the resolution has not sparked the market reaction many expected. XRP’s price has remained mostly unchanged, confounding speculators who anticipated a post-settlement rally. Meanwhile, the case has taken a new turn with an unexpected emergency filing from a third party. SEC drops injunction, Ripple to pay $50 million Under the terms of the settlement, Ripple avoids a prolonged legal process by paying a significantly reduced fine. The SEC will also ask Judge Analisa Torres to remove the “obey the law” injunction—an order that restricted Ripple from engaging in unregistered securities sales in the future. The decision comes months after the court ruled that Ripple’s XRP token was not, in itself, a security under federal law. While the resolution marks a legal win for Ripple, the broader crypto market has shown limited enthusiasm. XRP, which many traders expected to surge after the outcome, has remained stagnant. Unlike the price jumps seen in previous SEC settlements involving crypto platforms like Kraken and Cumberland, XRP has yet to respond, reflecting muted market sentiment or possibly pricing-in of the legal outcome beforehand. Keener files surprise evidence in case Just as the case appeared to be over, a new twist emerged. On 29 March 2025, an emergency motion was filed in the Ripple docket by a man named Justin W. Keener. Keener claims he possesses “decisive evidence in favour of the defendants and in favour of liberty for the American people.” According to his filing, this evidence is related to physical investment contracts he has been collecting, although no further details have been provided. Eleanor Terrett @EleanorTerrett · Follow 🚨NEW: An odd filing just now in the @SECGov vs. @Ripple docket — an emergency request to “present decisive evidence in favor of the defendants and in favor of liberty for the American people.” The letter, from a man named Justin W. Keener, doesn’t make clear what the so-called 4:13 AM · Apr 4, 2025 1.6K Reply Copy link Read 230 replies Keener, also known as “Jason W. Keener,” is not new to SEC enforcement. He was previously sued by the regulator for operating as an unregistered penny stock dealer and was ordered by the court to pay over $10 million in damages. His attempt to intervene in the Ripple case has raised questions about motive and relevance, especially given his own legal history with the agency. The emergency request does not appear to have any immediate bearing on the finalised settlement but has drawn fresh attention to the case file just as it seemed to be concluding. The filing has been listed in the public docket, and its inclusion may prompt further procedural clarifications from the court. XRP community awaits SEC statement Despite the closure, members of the XRP community are still awaiting a formal public statement from the SEC. In past settlements involving crypto entities, the Commission has issued detailed press releases outlining the rationale and implications. No such announcement has yet been published regarding the Ripple settlement. This silence has added to speculation around the implications of the deal, particularly regarding XRP’s legal classification in future transactions. As of now, the final judgement in favour of Ripple remains intact, including Judge Torres’ ruling that XRP is not a security when traded on public exchanges. However, the SEC retains authority over institutional sales and continues to monitor compliance with securities regulations across the digital asset space. XRP price flat despite settlement The most notable market reaction, or lack thereof, has been from XRP itself. Since news of the settlement emerged, XRP has traded sideways , failing to break past key resistance levels. Analysts suggest that the outcome may have already been priced into XRP, or that investors are awaiting further regulatory clarity before entering new positions. The absence of a price surge contrasts with patterns seen in similar cases. When Kraken and Cumberland reached their own settlements with the SEC, their associated tokens saw short-term gains. XRP’s flat performance highlights continued investor caution and possibly reflects a larger trend of uncertainty in the US crypto regulatory environment.

The meme coin space is heating up again, and the next wave of viral cryptos is already making noise. If you’ve been hunting for the best cryptos to buy now, you’re in the right place at the perfect time. Right now, BTFD Coin (BTFD) is stealing the spotlight with an ongoing presale that’s offering 2900% ROI potential, while other hot contenders like Toshi (TOSHI), SPX6900 (SPX), Notcoin (NOT), and Dogs (DOGS), continue to thrive in the meme coin mania. Among these, BTFD Coin is the real deal, and its presale is the golden ticket to maximum gains. The hype is real, the community is growing, and its ecosystem—including a fully launched P2E game and staking rewards—is making waves. Let’s break down why these best cryptos to buy now made it onto this exclusive list and why BTFD could be the best decision you make this year. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Meme Coin That’s Changing the Game with 3650% ROI Potential What if you could turn $3,000 into over $9,000 before a token even hits exchanges? That’s exactly the opportunity BTFD Coin is offering right now. The BTFD presale has already raised over $6.45 million, proving that investors are rushing in before the final stage closes. Why BTFD Coin is Breaking the Internet BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a movement. The name itself, “Buy The Dip,” embodies the trading philosophy of seasoned investors who know that fortunes are made during downturns. But what sets BTFD apart from the pack? Presale Frenzy and Referral Rewards: BTFD is currently at Stage 15, priced at just $0.0002. At the end of the presale, the listing price is set at $0.0006, delivering a massive 2900% ROI for early buyers. Staking Rewards (Live Since Dec 2nd): Investors can stake their BTFD tokens and earn high APY rewards, turning passive holding into an active income stream. Full P2E Game (Live Since Jan 1st, 2025): Unlike most meme coins that lack real utility, BTFD has launched a Play-to-Earn game where players earn rewards while engaging in the BTFD Bull Run adventure. Massive Community and Hype: With over 11,700 holders and more than 72 billion coins sold, the FOMO is real, and BTFD is building momentum as the next viral meme coin. How Much Can You Make with BTFD? Right now, $3,000 buys 15 million BTFD at $0.0002 per coin. If BTFD hits $0.0006 at the end of the presale, that same $3,000 would be worth $9,000—and if it reaches the projected moon price of $0.006, you’d be sitting on $90,000. That’s a 30x gain from the current price. BTFD Coin’s Referral Program – Free Tokens for Spreading the Word BTFD rewards early adopters with a 10% bonus in tokens if they refer investors. The top 20 referrers each month get a bigger cut, making this an easy way to earn extra crypto. The competition resets at the start of each month, so now’s the perfect time to get in and share your referral code. Why is BTFD the best crypto to buy now? Because it’s offering massive gains, real utilities, and a once-in-a-lifetime meme coin presale entry point that won’t last much longer. If you miss it, you’ll be kicking yourself when it explodes post-listing. 2. Toshi (TOSHI) – The Meme Coin Thriving on Coinbase’s Base Blockchain Toshi (TOSHI) is a meme coin built on Coinbase’s Base Layer-2 blockchain, gaining traction for its community-driven ecosystem and expanding utilities. Originally inspired by the pseudonymous Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s cat, TOSHI is more than just a joke—it’s evolving with DeFi integrations and strong community backing. Why did TOSHI make this list of the best cryptos to buy now? Because it’s one of the top meme coins on Base, leveraging Coinbase’s infrastructure to push for long-term growth. 3. SPX6900 (SPX) – The Meme Coin Fueling Decentralized Hype SPX6900 (SPX) has built a strong presence with its meme-driven culture and community-first approach. Backed by deflationary mechanics and a highly engaged user base, SPX has continued to grow while keeping its decentralization ethos intact. Why is SPX6900 here among the best cryptos to buy now? It’s proving that meme coins with active communities and scarcity mechanics can stay relevant beyond the hype. 4. Notcoin (NOT) – The Telegram-Based Crypto Taking Over Notcoin exploded in popularity as a tap-to-earn game within Telegram, allowing users to earn tokens by simply tapping a virtual coin. This gamified approach attracted millions of players, making it one of the fastest-growing interactive crypto projects. With continuous updates and Telegram’s massive user base, Notcoin is expanding its in-app utilities, keeping engagement high and positioning itself as a top short-term crypto pick. 5. Dogs (DOGS) – The Canine-Themed Crypto with a Loyal Following DOGS has exploded in popularity within The Open Network (TON), backed by over 17 million users during its token event. As TON’s first major meme coin, DOGS is gaining traction with NFT sticker trading and Telegram-based utilities, making it a standout in the growing TON ecosystem. Why is DOGS on this list of the best cryptos to buy now? Because it’s leading the meme coin wave on TON with massive adoption and real utility.

While TOSHI, SPX6900, Notcoin, and Dogs offer solid gains, BTFD Coin stands out as the top pick among the best cryptos to buy now for huge gains and beyond.

Bitcoin slipped below $82,000, while Ethereum and XRP saw steeper declines amid increased market uncertainty. The move triggered risk aversion across financial markets, tightening liquidity, and driving investors toward safer assets. With global trade tensions rising, market volatility remains high as traders assess potential macroeconomic impacts and regulatory responses in the coming weeks.

Gemini, the crypto exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, is expanding to Miami as a key SEC enforcement case against the firm sees signs of resolution. Meanwhile, decentralized exchange aggregator ParaSwap has rebranded to Velora, launching a protocol upgrade aimed at enhancing user control and minimizing MEV-related risks in DeFi trading. Gemini Expands to Miami as SEC Lawsuit Nears Resolution Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by billionaire twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, is setting up shop in Miami’s trendy Wynwood Art District — a move that comes as the firm appears to be putting major regulatory headwinds behind it. The expansion into South Florida may mark the start of a new chapter for the exchange, which has navigated intense scrutiny from US regulators over the past few years. Sterling Bay Properties post (Source: Instagram) According to a March 31 announcement from real estate developer Sterling Bay Properties, Gemini has officially signed a lease for office space in Wynwood. Bloomberg reported that the company expects to take occupancy by May, placing the New York-based exchange among a growing list of crypto firms planting roots in Florida. While Gemini has yet to issue a formal statement on the move, the strategic decision comes at a time when the company’s regulatory battles appear to be de-escalating. A Legal Cloud Begins to Clear Gemini’s Miami expansion follows a significant development in the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) ongoing lawsuit against the company. In January 2023, the SEC accused Gemini of offering unregistered securities through its now-defunct Gemini Earn program — a yield-bearing service that was popular among retail crypto investors before being abruptly shuttered during the 2022 crypto winter. However, in a recent court order, a federal judge granted a 60-day stay on the case, offering both parties time to “explore a potential resolution.” This pause may indicate that the long-standing legal dispute could soon reach a settlement or be dropped altogether. The news comes as a welcome shift for Gemini, which has struggled to grow amid an uncertain regulatory landscape. Adding to this narrative, Cameron Winklevoss revealed in February that the SEC had closed a separate investigation into the company. Earlier this year, Gemini also agreed to pay a $5 million fine to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) related to alleged misrepresentations during a 2017 application to offer Bitcoin futures contracts. The settlement removed another legal hurdle from Gemini’s path. The Miami office move is more than a geographical pivot — it signals Gemini’s intent to reaccelerate growth in the United States and potentially reenter public markets. In early 2025, the firm reportedly filed confidential paperwork for an initial public offering (IPO), reviving ambitions it had explored as early as 2021. Though details remain scarce, the IPO filing suggests that Gemini is preparing for a new phase of transparency, expansion, and investor engagement. Should the SEC lawsuit reach a favorable conclusion, Gemini would be in a stronger position to attract institutional partnerships, scale its products, and compete more directly with rivals like Coinbase and Kraken, both of which have been actively expanding their US and global footprints. Why Miami? Miami's appeal to crypto firms has only grown in recent years. The city offers a unique mix of tax incentives, tech talent, and cultural vibrancy — especially in Wynwood, known for its murals, galleries, and burgeoning tech community. Florida's lack of a state income tax makes it especially attractive for both companies and high-net-worth individuals seeking to relocate operations or headquarters. Ripple Labs already maintains an office in Wynwood, while Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), one of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin miners, is based in nearby Fort Lauderdale. The presence of these major players may have helped influence Gemini’s decision to choose the area as its new U.S. base of operations outside of New York. The move also aligns with broader trends in the industry. With regulatory uncertainty in states like New York and California, crypto companies are increasingly looking to regions with more favorable or clear-cut frameworks for digital assets. ParaSwap Rebrands to Velora as It Pushes Into the Future of Intents-Based DeFi Trading Gemini is not the only company making moves. ParaSwap, the prominent decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator, has officially rebranded to Velora, marking a significant transformation not only in name but also in function. Alongside the rebrand, Velora unveiled the latest version of its protocol — Delta v2.5 — designed to further the platform’s vision of “intents-based trading” and deliver a more customizable, efficient, and fair trading experience. The rebranding and protocol upgrade signal a deepening commitment to tackling one of DeFi’s most persistent challenges: Maximum Extractable Value (MEV). As bots continue to exploit transaction ordering for profit at the expense of users, Velora is doubling down on technical innovations meant to neutralize these exploitative dynamics. From ParaSwap to Velora: A New Chapter in DeFi Velora's new name and direction reflect a broader shift in the DEX aggregator’s mission. Since launching intents-based trading in mid-2024, the platform has focused on transforming how decentralized trades are executed. The Delta v2.5 upgrade builds on that by enhancing trade flexibility, unlocking advanced tools like limit orders, and making way for cross-chain execution — a key demand in today's multi-chain DeFi environment. Over the past year, ParaSwap (now Velora) saw over 4.3 million smart contract interactions and drew approximately 18,000 monthly active users, according to data from TokenTerminal . Paraswap daily active users (Source: TokenTerminal) This active engagement reflects strong interest in alternatives to traditional execution models, especially among users seeking deeper control over trades and better protection from predatory behavior on-chain. At the heart of Velora’s transformation is its unique approach to combatting MEV — a challenge that has long undermined fairness and transparency in decentralized markets. MEV bots typically front-run transactions, reorder trades for profit, or perform arbitrage in ways that extract value from regular users. The consequence isn’t just individual transaction losses — it’s a systemic erosion of trust in decentralized finance, according to Velora founder Mounir Benchemled. Velora’s response is an intent-based architecture that breaks down each order into three stages: Preprocessing the intent — defining what the user wants, including expected price and execution preferences. Submitting to an auction layer — where competing execution agents determine the most optimal path for the trade across liquidity pools, timing windows, and block constraints. Execution by the winning agent — chosen based on efficiency and MEV protection capabilities. This system is designed not only to neutralize malicious bots but also to abstract execution complexity away from users, allowing them to interact with DeFi in a more intuitive and safer manner. A Better UX for DeFi’s Next Wave Velora’s implementation of intents-based execution comes amid a broader DeFi trend toward user experience simplification. Despite DeFi’s explosive growth, many new users remain intimidated by the technical complexity of smart contracts, gas optimization, and transaction finality. In an interview, Sergej Kunz, co-founder of rival DEX aggregator 1inch, endorsed the broader movement toward intent-based systems: “An intent-based system is designed to shift all risk and complexity away from users and into the hands of professionals who specialize in executing advanced DeFi strategies,” Kunz said. “A true intent-based DEX must provide MEV protection at the protocol level and offload execution complexity to professional trading bots.” This philosophy underpins Velora’s Delta v2.5 upgrade, which promises to give users greater control over their trades without requiring them to navigate the nuances of block timing, gas fees, or routing logic. Features like limit orders and multi-block execution further expand the possibilities for strategic trading on-chain. The Velora rebrand and upgrade come at a pivotal time. With DeFi once again gaining momentum amid renewed institutional interest and rising crypto prices, users are demanding more from decentralized platforms — not just in terms of yields or trading pairs, but in security, fairness, and usability. Velora is positioning itself as a key player in this next wave of innovation, building on ParaSwap’s legacy while venturing into the frontier of intent-driven finance. If successful, it could usher in a more user-friendly and equitable DeFi experience — one where human intent drives market logic, not just bots and algorithms.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|FORKS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-04 05:30:00

China will be subject to an even steeper 54% levy. The announcement sent tech stocks tumbling, and analysts warned of far-reaching disruptions rippling through the digital advertising landscape, retail media and supply chains more broadly. Meta and Amazon at risk as tariffs threaten Chinese advertising ecosystem The broad tariffs, which cover all products entering the U.S. from abroad, are a distinct danger to companies like Meta and Amazon, which increasingly depend on advertising by Chinese sellers and brands. Meta, for instance, has about $10 billion in revenue from international advertisers, mostly from China, according to veteran advertising analyst Brian Wieser. Amazon is also exposed, however, because the Chinese merchants that dominate its marketplace are responsible for almost half of its top sellers. Many of these sellers use Amazon’s advertising ecosystem to target their products to American shoppers, an industry now threatened with disruption. “The biggest losers you’re going to see right now are companies based on Chinese-based advertising: social media and retail media,” said Eric Haggstrom, director of market intelligence at Advertiser Perceptions. He added that the most immediate effect would probably be in categories such as apparel and home goods, where Chinese sellers are a linchpin. Digital Ad ecosystem faces disruption as tariffs impact spending and shift priorities Ad analysts say the tariffs will send shock waves throughout the digital advertising ecosystem. With many consumer products manufactured in China and Vietnam, companies such as Meta and Amazon advertisers might trim spending amid higher prices. However, establishment ad-driven platforms, including Meta, Amazon, and Google, are said to be resilient thanks to their scale, precise targeting, and ability to deliver results that can be measured. “The retail media outlets are just going to continue to win,” said Nadja Bellan-White, the CEO of M+C Saatchi Group. However, she said that advertisers will expect clearer return-on-investment guarantees now. Pinterest, Reddit, and Snap may be at the most risk because they lack the scale and familiarity among advertisers that Meta and Google have, according to analysts at NewStreet Research. Reddit, in particular, has niche communities that are more difficult for brands to reach, making it potentially an easier ad budget cut. Media giants and digital platforms face economic uncertainty as tariff impact looms Non-tech giants are bracing for fallout, too, as media and entertainment companies react to the news. Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and Netflix were all mixed after the tariff announcement, with their stocks diving. Morningstar analysts warned that weakness in the economy caused by the trade war could weigh on consumer spending, which would hurt companies that depend on both direct consumer purchases and advertising revenue. Disney’s theme parks and experiences business, a big driver of profits, may feel the pinch if a recession follows the implementation of the tariffs, which could lead attendance to decline. Its streaming business is growing, which might soften the blow somewhat. Likewise, WBD’s recent streaming gains could offset ad-driven losses, though it carries a heavy debt burden and is therefore more vulnerable to tightening credit markets. While Netflix does not depend on physical goods, it may experience slower growth in Europe if retaliatory tariffs arise. Bernstein analysts flagged the threat of Europe responding with measures that could hurt Netflix’s dominant position in the continent’s biggest streaming markets. Among the biggest uncertainties surrounding the tariffs is what happens with TikTok. Known as the Tariff Man, Trump has teased that he could use the tariffs to push China into permitting the app’s sale. TikTok has made some strides in demonstrating its effectiveness as an advertising platform. However, many brands still appear hesitant to invest in the platform, presumably due to fear of regulatory scrutiny and the possibility of a ban in the U.S. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Technical indicators point to SOL getting prepared for a notable upward rise following a sequence of price swings and periods of consolidation. Expert analysis indicates Solana is creating a classic technical structure connected with bullish momentum—a cup and handle pattern on its weekly chart. This pattern usually signifies the end of a consolidation phase and the possibility of a fresh rise. Solana’s cup and handle formulation The development of the cup and handle pattern is a fundamental technical indicator for traders, especially on a long-term chart. For Solana, this trend started to show itself during the January rejection of Bitcoin at the $295 resistance level. SOL had a substantial downturn following this rejection, steadying at $125. This price action produced the “cup” part of the pattern, in which SOL circled the bottom as the market cooled off. The “handle” portion of the pattern is the phase that followed, which had a more minor consolidation of close to $125. The price goes sideways in this period, usually going through a last shakeout before a possible breakout. Analysts believe Solana might rocket toward new highs, aiming for the $400 mark, if she can break above the $295 resistance with significant volume. The path forward: a potential breakout? Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez thinks one key element will determine Solana’s future price action: volume. A breakout over the $295 neckline would need significant purchasing pressure to cement the positive trend. Should SOL sustain this increasing momentum, it may set off a rally pushing the token into unexplored territory based on analysts’ speculations about $400 being within reach. One significant drawback is that should Solana fail to break over this crucial barrier with considerable volume, the market may reverse. SOL may revert into a bearish trend without constant buying pressure, therefore revisiting reduced support levels. Traders and investors should be attentive to these events since the result could significantly affect SOL’s future. Rexas Finance (RXS) – the new market disrupter While Solana’s potential breakout generates excitement, a more significant rally might be underway elsewhere. A more recent venture in the cryptocurrency market, Rexas Finance (RXS), is attracting much interest for its creative method of tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs). Rexas Finance is building a unique ecosystem on the blockchain, hoping to make illiquid assets, such as real estate, commodities, and private equity, globally tradable. With 91.46% of the authorized tokens sold for its last stage, the project’s presale has succeeded dramatically. From $0.03 in Stage 1 to $0.20 in Stage 12, RXS’s price has surged, a 567% increase. The presale has generated $47.4 million; with the official exchange debut only over the horizon, analysts are projecting a significant increase in the token’s price once it lists on international platforms. The much-awaited Rexas Finance (RXS) exchange debut is on June 19, 2025. With a verified listing price of $0.25, the project intends to list on at least three of the top ten worldwide exchanges. This launch should generate significant liquidity, increasing demand for the token even more. Based on past performance following comparable high-profile events, analysts project a 30,000% increase in RXS’s price following launch. Rexas Finance’s creative use case—which provides concrete real-world applications—helps explain the growing curiosity about it. The concept immediately attracts investors and blockchain engineers since Rexas Finance guarantees the revolutionization of conventional finance through flawless tokenized asset trade. Avalanche (AVAX): gearing up for a comeback Avalanche (AVAX) has recently recovered from recent lows and indicates a possible rally. At $18.46, AVAX witnessed a slight 0.31% decline over the previous 24 hours, yet experts think it is about to recover. AVAX has demonstrated positive momentum following a rebound from the $16 support level; charts reveal a five-wave impulse pattern. Analysts believe AVAX may reach $200 if Avalanche surpasses important resistance levels. Developers find the platform especially appealing because of its quick and low-cost blockchain architecture; institutional demand for blockchain-based smart contracts and payments keeps growing. The bigger picture Projects like Rexas Finance (RXS) and Avalanche (AVAX) are becoming popular with their creative ideas and practical applications, even while Solana is still a major participant in the crypto scene and might witness a breakout to the $295 mark. Rexas Finance attracts much interest since it emphasizes tokenizing illiquid assets and creating new investment opportunities. These initiatives will lead the way in 2025 as the market turns toward more sensible uses of blockchain technology.

While its V-shaped recovery pattern is still intact, it is likely to resume bearish avtions if the price continues to drop daily. Last month saw most altcoins through a temporal halt in selling as they retraced significantly, but many short-lived the momentum following a sharp rejection and they quickly lost steam after tapping a month’s high. However, TON’s retracement is still looking intact on the daily chart as it continues to form a V-shaped pattern, but the crypto recently shed losses following a bearish weekly start. This loss came as a result of the retracement of the bullish impulsive movement, which came in the form of a higher high and higher low pattern on the hourly chart. If this bullish pattern continues to play, we can expect a bounce back soon. This should bring more increase to sustain the bullish V-shaped pattern on the daily chart. As mentioned in the previous analysis, this reversal pattern is capable of sending the price to $7, to form an inverse head-and-shoulder pattern after a major pullback. On the other hand, a sharp drop from the current trading level could bring us back to the recent bottom. Such a move would invalidate the current bullish signal daily, especially if the price breaks down. TON’s Key Level to Watch Source: Tradingview In the latest drop, there’s close support at $3.52. If this support fails to produce a bounce, the price may roll over to the $3.18, $2.74 and $2.36 levels before breaking lower. Retaking the weekly lost $4.21 high, TON may advance buying towards the $4.79 level. The higher resistance level to watch for a surge is $5.66.

Crypto markets saw high volatility on Wednesday and Thursday in the run-up to the tariff announcement, where President Donald Trump levied a minimum 10% fee on all imports to the country. Major tokens bitcoin (BTC) , ether (ETH) , Solana’s SOL , XRP (XRP) , and others, zoomed ahead of the speech and slumped as global markets fell, reversing all gains from the start of the week. Markets have since shown an uptick in prices on Friday morning, with BTC steady above $83,100, ETH retaking $1,800 and XRP, SOL and ADA rising over 2%. Ahead of Trump’s speech, investors transferred larger volumes of Bitcoin, ETH, and XRP into exchanges, suggesting a growing intent to sell, per a CryptoQuant note shared with CoinDesk on Thursday. Bitcoin transactions surged to as much as 2,500 BTC in a single block just hours after Trump began speaking. In the U.S., Coinbase also saw a rise in bitcoin deposits, particularly from large holders. Similarly, ETH inflows into exchanges spiked to an hourly peak of approximately 80,000 ETH. XRP transfers into Binance jumped to 130 million in one hour, up from under 10 million XRP per hour throughout most of the previous day. These rising exchange inflows reflected investor willingness to exit positions amid growing economic uncertainty, CryptoQuant said, with demand for Bitcoin and ETH declining in the perpetual futures market as traders closed their long positions to take profits. But with headwinds behind and a new economic data set to be released later Friday could provide the impetus for a short-term relief in markets. Attention is on the non-farm payroll report scheduled for a Friday release. The monthly U.S. economic indicator released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the change in employment, reflecting job creation, unemployment trends, and wage growth, offering insight into economic health. “Investors are bracing for signs of softness in the U.S. labour market,” Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast earlier Friday. “ A weaker-than-expected print would bolster the case for further Fed rate cuts this year, as policymakers attempt to cushion a decelerating economy.” Data shows markets are pricing in four rate cuts in 2025 — 0.25 bps each in June, July, September and December. Rate cuts occur when a central bank, like the Federal Reserve, lowers interest rates to stimulate economic growth by making borrowing cheaper. Bitcoin, and the broader market, tend to react positively to rate cuts, as lower rates reduce the appeal of traditional investments like bonds, driving investors toward alternatives like BTC. Additionally, a weaker dollar can enhance BTC’s value as a hedge against inflation or currency devaluation. QCP Capital said it continues to observe elevated volatility in the short term, with more buyers of downside protection. “That said, with positioning now light and risk assets largely oversold, the stage may be set for a near-term bounce,” the fund said.",Markets|Bitcoin|XRP|Trading,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-04 05:45:54

The letter claimed to have “decisive evidence” to settle pertinent questions in the lawsuit. FOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett first reported on the “odd filing” on social media platform X late Wednesday. She mentioned that Justin W. Keener, the one who filed the letter, said his plea was an “emergency request to present decisive evidence in favor of the defendants and in favor of liberty for the American people.” In the letter , Keener doesn’t explain what this “decisive evidence” is other than a vague reference to “physical investment contracts” he has collected. He described himself as a concerned citizen with no financial stake in the case, stating his aim is to expose what he sees as government overreach in the SEC’s legal strategy. Who is Justin Keener? According to a December 2022 published report on the SEC website, Keener was sued by the financial regulator in 2020, alleging that he acted as an unregistered dealer while transacting hundreds of millions in penny stocks. A federal court, led by US District Court for the Southern District of Florida Judge Beth Bloom, ordered him to pay more than $10 million in penalties. In its final judgment, the court ordered Keener to pay a total of $10.2 million, including $7.79 million in disgorgement, $1.43 million in prejudgment interest, and a $1.03 million civil penalty. The judgment also imposed a permanent injunction and a five-year ban on participating in penny stock offerings. Additionally, Keener was required to relinquish certain stock holdings and conversion rights tied to existing convertible securities. His request to the court seems like a self-serving attempt to restore his public image, although supporters may see that his filing proportionately touches on the SEC’s “unfair” actions. Keener’s letter argues that the SEC’s proposed $2 billion penalty is excessive, unfair, and threatens American innovation. He points to the July 2023 summary judgment, in which the court found Ripple’s past direct sales of XRP to institutional investors violated Section 5 of the Securities Act but also ruled that other sales, such as programmatic ones, did not. “ Ripple has represented that it ceased making institutional sales of XRP in the United States after the SEC filed suit. These facts make clear that any violation was limited in scope and duration, and there is no ongoing violation of the securities laws. Importantly, the SEC has never alleged fraud or misrepresentation by Ripple ,” he surmised. He also talked about past SEC settlements that involved far higher capital raises but resulted in far lower penalties: $24 million for Block.one, $18.5 million for Telegram, $5 million for Kik, and $21 million for Genesis. “ Given the absence of fraud and the limited violation scope, ” the letter continues, “ a $2 billion penalty appears designed to punish rather than remedy. This may violate the Supreme Court’s stance on civil penalties, which must remain remedial in nature .” XRP struggles continue post-SEC court battle Meanwhile, Ripple’s native token XRP has yet to register a profound positive price action. It is now trading at $2.05, 1.2% down in the last 24 hours, and well below moving averages, with signs of a growing distribution phase. Per TradingView’s technical analysis , momentum indicators reaffirm the downward trajectory, with a dangerously oversold Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 38.6, and a bearish Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) crossover signaling no immediate relief for bulls. Short-term traders are watching the $2.01 support level, which, if broken, could send prices down to $1.97. For any bullish rebound to take shape, the price needs to clear $2.16 with volume support. Mark watchers have pinned the most advantageous short entry in the $2.16–$2.27 resistance zone, with stop-loss orders recommended above $2.27 for a much lower risk.

In a 13-11 party-line decision, the committee approved Paul Atkins to be the next Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Jonathan Gould as Comptroller of the Currency. With this approval, their nominations now move to the full Senate for a final vote. If confirmed, they’ll officially take charge of these key financial regulatory agencies. Senator Tim Scott Praises Atkins and Gould Senator Tim Scott, who chairs the committee, spoke highly of both nominees, praising their experience in the financial industry. He emphasized that their leadership would help keep financial regulations focused on what’s best for the economy, without getting caught up in political agendas. “Paul Atkins, the former SEC commissioner, will promote capital formation and provide much-needed clarity for digital assets ,” Scott said. And of Gould, he noted that the nominee, once chief counsel at the OCC, will “put an end to the politically-motivated debanking” which is a major concern in the industry. Senator Warren Criticises the Nominations However, Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the committee, voted against the nominations, saying they’re too focused on deregulating for Wall Street’s benefit. She also pointed to recent government worker layoffs and efforts by Trump and billionaire Elon Musk to shut down agencies. “I won’t support these nominees while Trump and Musk are actively trying to destroy these agencies,” she said. She also noted that Paul Atkins messed up before the 2008 crisis while at the SEC and that Jonathan Gould weakened banking rules at the OCC, making the financial system less safe. Besides, the committee also approved Luke Pettit, a former Senate staffer, as assistant secretary of the U.S. Treasury, and Marcus Molinaro as the new federal transit administrator. Furthering its efforts, the SEC is hosting a series of roundtable talks from April to June to clarify crypto rules. The SEC’s crypto roundtable series features some exciting discussions. What’s Next? Coming up next, on April 11, the session titled “Between a Block and a Hard Place: Tailoring Regulation for Crypto Trading” will take place. This will be followed by sessions on crypto custody on April 25, tokenization on May 12, and decentralized finance (DeFi) on June 6.

Investors will be looking forward to next month’s FOMC meeting and whether Fed Chair Jerome Powell blinks for rate cuts amid the Trump-led market turmoil.

However, despite Nasdaq falling 6%, and S&P 500 falling 5% on Thursday, BTC and the broader crypto market have shown greater resilience recently. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted a key technical milestone for BTC’s potential market rebound. According to Martinez, the first clear signal that Bitcoin is ready to resume its bull run would be reclaiming the short-term holder realized price level, which currently sits at $90,570. Source: Ali Martinez Will Fed Rate Cuts Come During May FOMC? Traders are assigning just a 27.1% probability to a 25 basis point rate cut at the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting scheduled for May 7, according to the latest market data. The low odds suggest that investors believe the U.S. Federal Reserve is unlikely to shift from its current monetary policy path. Fed Chair Jerome Powell continues to strike a cautious tone, signaling that more evidence of cooling inflation may be needed before easing begins. Popular crypto analyst Titan of Crypto shows that Bitcoin price needs to break out from the falling wedge pattern. The analyst shared optimism noting: “Over the next couple of months, CPI and Core PCE are likely to improve, as Trueflation data shows inflation cooling off significantly”. Source: Titan of Crypto Will Altcoins Recover Anytime Soon? Since the beginning of 2025, altcoins have faced a brutal correction with Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and others dropping between 30-40%. Some market analysts believe that this could be the end to any further correction from here onwards. They also thinks that the bottom is in and altcoins are set for a further rally from here onwards. Crypto analyst Wimar.X has issued a bullish signal for the altcoin market, noting that a key technical crossover has now formed — historically preceding massive rallies. According to Wimar.X, similar signals in past cycles triggered altcoin market surges of 1,000% to 2,000%.

The firm added that it anticipates the contract going live on April 21. According to the certification filing , the XRP ( XRP ) futures contract will be a monthly cash-settled and margined contract trading under the symbol XRL. The contract tracks XRP’s price and is settled in US dollars. Each contract represents 10,000 XRP, currently worth about $20,000 at $2 per token. Contracts can be traded for the current month and two months ahead, and trading will be paused as a safety measure if spot XRP prices move more than 10% in an hour. “The exchange has spoken with FCMs (Futures Commission Merchants) and market participants who support the decision to launch a XRP contract,” the firm stated. Coinbase is not the first to launch XRP futures in the United States. In March, Chicago-based crypto exchange Bitnomial announced the launch of the “first-ever CFTC-regulated XRP futures in the US.” XRP futures trading is available on many of the world's leading centralized crypto exchanges, such as Binance, OKX, Bybit and BitMEX. Funding rates remain negative In late March, Cointelegraph reported that XRP derivatives’ funding rates had flipped negative as investor sentiment turned bearish. Related: XRP funding rate flips negative — Will smart traders flip long or short? Funding rates are periodic payments between traders in perpetual futures markets that help keep the futures price aligned with the spot price. Positive funding rates mean that long traders (buyers) pay short traders, while negative funding rates mean short traders (sellers) pay long traders. When funding rates go negative, it means short traders are willing to pay a premium to maintain their positions, indicating strong conviction from bearish derivatives traders.

EU regulators allege that X has violated the Digital Services Act and will use a section of the act to calculate a fine based on revenue that includes other companies Musk controls, according to an April 3 report by the newspaper, which cited four people with knowledge of the plan. Under the Digital Services Act, which came into law in October 2022 to police social media companies and “prevent illegal and harmful activities online,” companies can be fined up to 6% of global revenue for violations. A spokesman for the European Commission, the bloc’s executive branch, declined to comment on this case to The New York Times but did say it would “continue to enforce our laws fairly and without discrimination toward all companies operating in the EU.” In a statement, X’s Global Government Affairs team said that if the reports about the EU's plans are accurate, it “represents an unprecedented act of political censorship and an attack on free speech.” “X has gone above and beyond to comply with the EU’s Digital Services Act, and we will use every option at our disposal to defend our business, keep our users safe, and protect freedom of speech in Europe,” X's global government affairs team said. Source: Global Government Affairs Along with the fine, the EU regulators could reportedly demand product changes at X, with the full scope of any penalties to be announced in the coming months. Still, a settlement could be reached if the social media platform agrees to changes that satisfy regulators, according to the Times. One of the officials who spoke to the Times also said that X is facing a second investigation alleging the platform’s approach to policing user-generated content has made it a hub of illegal hate speech and disinformation, which could result in more penalties. X EU investigation ongoing since 2023 The EU investigation began in 2023. A preliminary ruling in July 2024 found X had violated the Digital Services Act by refusing to provide data to outside researchers, provide adequate transparency about advertisers, or verify the authenticity of users who have a verified account. Related: Musk says he found ‘magic money computers’ printing money ‘out of thin air’ X responded to the ruling with hundreds of points of dispute, and Musk said at the time he was offered a deal , alleging that EU regulators told him if he secretly suppressed certain content, X would escape fines.

Analytics Company Reveals Estimated Record Date,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-bitcoin-hit-a-new-record-this-year-despite-recent-declines-analytics-company-reveals-estimated-record-date/,"Cryptocurrency analytics firm Alphractal has assessed the market situation following Bitcoin’s recent decline. According to the firm’s analysis, Supply Age Bands data, which categorizes Bitcoin supply by age, shows a sharp decline in the Short-Term Trader (STH) supply of up to 3 months. This indicates that buying interest in Bitcoin is decreasing. Historically, high levels of this indicator are observed during periods of market enthusiasm and public interest, while low levels coincide with price corrections. Alphractal notes that by analyzing the supply of up to 6 months, it is possible to better understand the impact of Short-Term Investors on Bitcoin. If this supply increases, the price tends to rise, while when it decreases, declines are usually observed. Related News: Cardano (ADA) Announces New Initiative Amid Decline However, despite the decline in STH supply, it is possible for Bitcoin to reach new highs. In 2021, although the STH supply began to decrease in April, Bitcoin reached new ATH levels in October and November. Similarly, in 2013, this supply recovered within a few months, leading to new highs in the short term. In line with these analyses, Alphractal states that despite the current conditions, new ATH levels for Bitcoin are possible in 2025. However, it is estimated that it will take at least another 6 months for this to happen. *This is not investment advice.

The total value locked in DeFi fell 27% to $156 billion, as per DappRadar’s Q1 2025 report . DeFi’s decline was caused by several high-profile security breaches, falling crypto prices, and macroeconomic uncertainty. The biggest blow was Bybit’s $1.4 billion exploit, which the FBI connected to the TraderTraitor group from North Korea. In this exploit, hackers stole about 401,000 Ethereum ( ETH ), converted it to Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other assets, and distributed it among wallets. DeFi’s position was further affected by a 45% decline in ETH over the quarter. Except for Berachain ( BERA ), which grew as a result of its mainnet launch, a token distribution event, and a $142 million funding round, most of the major blockchains saw a drop in DeFi activity. You might also like: AI tokens Bittensor, Render, Grass plunge after key Microsoft news While DeFi struggled, AI-powered dApps thrived, as shown by the 29% increase in daily unique active wallets to 2.6 million. Furthermore, the number of social dApps grew by 10% to 2.8 million dUAW. This shift was largely due to sites like Pump.fun, which made it simpler for users to launch new tokens. Pump.fun saw a 112% rise in activity. NFTs had a weaker quarter as well, with a 24% decline in trading volume to $1.5 billion. The fact that sales only fell 10%, however, points to lower prices rather than a mass exit. PFP collections accounted for the majority of sales, making up 56% of the total NFT volume. In terms of transactions, OpenSea continued to be the most popular marketplace, but OKX had the highest trading volume. Meanwhile, over $2 billion was lost to scams and hacks. Rug pulls like LIBRA and MELANIA resulted in losses of $450 million, but Bybit’s $1.5 billion exploit was by far the largest security breach event. A $50 million hack of the Infini stablecoin platform also exposed underlying security flaws in the industry.

Videos on social media show a new “Dill Bit” server farm location in the game — made to look like a cryptocurrency mining operation. There are other locations on the map where it has appeared. Players in the game can collect Dill Bits by destroying the equipment. It’s a unique resource that is typically hard to obtain. Solana-based memecoin Dill Bits, inspired by the Fortnite in-game currency, spiked 200% to $0.0005 on April 4 as the crypto community also took notice of the latest addition. Fortnite introduced Dill Bits as an in-game currency in February as a jest toward crypto. However, these can only be used to buy in-game items. At the time, the announcement of the in-game currency prompted an anonymous crypto user to create their own version of the token on Solana. The recent spike is nowhere near previous surges, however. When the memecoin first launched in February, it surged 4,500% in price to reach a market cap of $4.8 million. Another huge spike for the memecoin occurred on March 9, after Fortnite released a video promoting its latest “Rugpull” storyline, which saw the token pump over 4,000% in just a few minutes again.

Bitcoin really becoming mainstream for a game like Fortnite to add this little easter egg,” commented one player on Reddit after becoming aware of the secret location on April 3. The gimmick is not likely new for Fortnite players, as other hidden server mines have been discovered in other parts of the map since the in-game currency was introduced. According to the official Fortnite Wiki, the new Dill Bits Mining Server is an “Unnamed Location in Fortnite: Battle Royale, that was added in Chapter 6: Season 2 to the island Oninoshima near Outlaw Oasis.” It is a “small cave containing servers mining the cryptocurrency called Dill Bits,” it states .

Major tokens like Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP rallied before the speech but quickly dropped as global markets declined, erasing earlier gains. Prices Bounce Back However, prices bounced back on Friday morning, with BTC staying above $83,100, ETH reclaiming $1,800, and XRP, SOL, and ADA each rising over 2%. Ahead of Trump’s speech, investors moved large amounts of Bitcoin, ETH, and XRP into exchanges, showing they were ready to sell. Bitcoin transactions hit 2,500 BTC in one block just hours after the speech. Coinbase saw more Bitcoin deposits, especially from big holders. ETH inflows peaked at 80,000 per hour, and XRP transfers to Binance jumped to 130 million in one hour, up from under 10 million the day before. This activity showed investors were cashing out amid economic uncertainty, with demand for Bitcoin and ETH dropping as traders closed long positions to take profits. Traders Shifting Focus To Rate Cuts However, traders are now shifting their focus from oversold markets and U.S. tariffs to new economic data and expected rate cuts. This shift has sparked hopes for a possible bounce in Bitcoin prices soon. With the pressure easing, fresh economic data coming out later today could give markets a much-needed lift. “Investors are watching closely for signs of weakness in the U.S. job market,” QCP Capital shared in a Friday update. “If the data is weaker than expected, it could lead to more Fed rate cuts this year to support the slowing economy.” Markets Expect Four Rate Cuts This Year Markets are already expecting four rate cuts in 2025—0.25 basis points each in June, July, September, and December. Rate cuts help boost the economy by making borrowing cheaper. Short-term interest-rate futures now show a 70% chance of a Fed rate cut in June, up from 60% before the tariffs were announced. However, Morgan Stanley expects the U.S. Federal Reserve won’t cut rates this year due to potential elevated inflation from Trump’s new tariffs. The Wall Street brokerage had previously predicted a 25 basis point cut in June. Fed To Keep Rates Steady? Many Fed officials recently said they want to keep interest rates steady for a while to see how Trump’s policies affect the economy. Some are still worried about inflation and unsure if price changes will last. Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson added that there’s “no need to rush” into changing rates. The Fed official noted that if the economy stays strong and inflation doesn’t drop, the Fed could keep rates at 4.25%-4.5% for a while. But if the job market weakens or inflation falls, the Fed will adjust accordingly. Bitcoin and the broader market usually respond well to rate cuts since lower rates make traditional investments like bonds less attractive and a weaker dollar strengthens BTC as an inflation hedge. QCP Capital sees high volatility but suggests a potential short-term bounce due to oversold risk assets. Recession Concerns Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, said the new tariffs raise the chance of a U.S. recession to 50%, warning that the economy could slow down in just three months if the tariffs stay. He pointed out that the real challenge is figuring out how much damage uncertainty is causing for businesses and consumers. We’ll get more insight into the Fed’s stance on Friday when Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaks after the March jobs report. Last month, Powell said he believes any inflation from Trump’s tariffs will be temporary, aligning with the White House’s view.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-04 07:15:44

Bowman, tapped by President Donald Trump earlier this week, would take over the role vacated by Michael Barr, who resigned in January. According to Fox News correspondent Eleanor Terrett, Bowman, a former Kansas state bank regulator and veteran of community banking, is expected to face questions about the Federal Reserve’s treatment of crypto, particularly on issues like debanking and regulatory overreach. “ Another important nomination hearing for the banking and crypto industries is next Thursday. Expect lots of questions from the GOP on debanking, the Fed’s stance on digital assets, and its treatment of the crypto industry ,” wrote Terrett. Trump endorses Bowman for Board of Governers seat again President Trump’s nomination of Bowman will become the second time the banker enters the US Federal Reserve System, as he appointed her for the position during Trump 1.0. On Monday, Trump announced the nomination on his social media platform Truth Social, praising Bowman’s experience and track record that could offer a “change” in the Fed’s approach to banking regulation. “Miki has the ‘know-how’ to get it done,” Trump said, “ Our economy has been mismanaged for the past four years, and it is time for a change. ” Bowman would assume the top supervisory role at a time when federal agencies are being asked to find a balanced regulatory approach to the intersection between traditional finance and digital assets. As a former Kansas state bank commissioner, she championed less onerous regulatory frameworks for smaller banks and community financial institutions. Her predecessor, Michael Barr, left office due to a political cold war with the Trump administration, as he had advocated for stricter regulatory measures under former President Joe Biden. Bowman voted against Barr’s proposal to raise capital requirements on financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs after the government faced pressure from US banking lobby groups. She also backed efforts to make the Federal Reserve stress tests more transparent. Stablecoin debate to precede banking committee hearing Bowman’s confirmation hearing will also take place against the backdrop of a political debate over how to regulate stablecoins, a crypto pegged to the value of the US dollar in a ratio of 1:1. On Wednesday, the House Financial Services Committee voted to pass the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act during a full committee markup. Per Eleanor Terrett’s report, the STABLE Act successfully passed through the US House FSC with a 32-17 vote after a 13-hour session. Six Democrats reportedly joined their Republican colleagues in supporting the bill. 🚨NEW: After a 13-hour marathon markup, the STABLE Act has passed out of the @FinancialCmte with a vote of 32-17 and six Democrats voting in favor. https://t.co/5Znwlnh1DA — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) April 3, 2025 “ Digital assets are already impacting American families every day, and their role is continuing to grow. The STABLE Act protects consumers while cementing the US Dollar as the world’s reserve currency and promoting the next generation of Web3 businesses here in the United States ,” Steil said. Both the House and Senate have now introduced legislation to establish federal oversight of stablecoins. The House version completely prohibits stablecoin issuers from offering interest, while the Senate version, called the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act of 2025 (GENIUS Act), excludes interest on some types of stablecoins, although it stops short of an outright ban. Once lawmakers reconcile the differences between the two bills, the final legislation will need to pass both chambers of Congress before landing on President Trump’s desk. Earlier this year, the American Bankers Association wrote a statement to the US lawmakers to warn them against provisions in the STABLE Act that could incentivize consumers to hold money in stablecoins rather than traditional bank deposits. “ This concept is not a mere competitive concern; it poses a significant risk to the fundamental role banks play in credit intermediation ,” the association reckoned.

All eyes in the crypto sphere are turning to Washington D.C. as the U.S. Senate Banking Committee prepares to question Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman on April 10. Nominated to step into the significant role of Fed Vice Chair for Supervision, Bowman’s stance on crypto oversight is about to be placed under the spotlight. This isn’t just another routine hearing; it’s a crucial event that could shape the future landscape of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States. Why is the Senate Banking Committee Questioning Fed Vice Chair Bowman on Crypto Oversight? Eleanor Terrett, a prominent voice in crypto news from ‘Crypto in America,’ broke the news on X, highlighting the upcoming scrutiny. But why is this questioning so important? Let’s break it down: Key Role: The Vice Chair for Supervision at the Federal Reserve holds a powerful position, particularly when it comes to overseeing and regulating banks. With the increasing intersection of traditional finance and the burgeoning crypto market, this role is now more critical than ever. Bowman’s Background: Nominated by former President Trump, Michelle Bowman is in line to succeed Michael Barr. Her appointment signals a potentially significant shift in the Fed’s approach to financial regulation, including crypto regulation . Senate’s Concern: The Senate Banking Committee, tasked with overseeing the financial sector, is naturally keen to understand Bowman’s views and plans for managing the risks and opportunities presented by cryptocurrencies. Their questioning will likely delve into how she intends to balance innovation with investor protection and financial stability in the context of digital assets. This hearing isn’t just about confirming a nominee; it’s about understanding the direction of crypto oversight under Bowman’s potential leadership at the Fed. It’s a chance for lawmakers to ensure that the regulatory framework keeps pace with the rapidly evolving crypto industry. What Can We Expect from the Senate Banking Committee’s Questioning? As the Senate Banking Committee prepares to grill Fed Vice Chair Bowman , several key areas are likely to be the focus of their inquiries: Clarity on Crypto Regulation: Senators will likely press Bowman for her specific views on the current state of crypto regulation and what changes she believes are necessary. Expect questions about her stance on stablecoins, DeFi (Decentralized Finance), and the role of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Balancing Innovation and Risk: A central theme will be how Bowman plans to strike a balance between fostering innovation in the crypto space and mitigating the inherent risks. This includes addressing concerns about consumer protection, market manipulation, and the potential use of crypto for illicit activities. Inter-Agency Coordination: Given the complex regulatory landscape with multiple agencies involved in crypto oversight (SEC, CFTC, Treasury), senators may inquire about Bowman’s approach to inter-agency coordination to ensure a cohesive and effective regulatory framework. Impact on Traditional Banks: With banks increasingly exploring crypto-related services, the committee will likely want to understand Bowman’s perspective on how the Fed will supervise and guide banks’ involvement in the crypto market. The answers provided by Fed Vice Chair Bowman could offer valuable insights into the future direction of crypto oversight and regulation in the U.S. This hearing is not just a formality; it’s a crucial moment for the crypto industry to understand the regulatory winds and prepare for potential shifts in policy. Why Should Crypto Enthusiasts Pay Attention to the Senate Hearing? For anyone involved or interested in cryptocurrencies, this Senate hearing is a must-watch event. Here’s why: Market Impact: Regulatory clarity (or uncertainty) is a major driver of crypto market sentiment. Bowman’s statements and the overall tone of the hearing can significantly influence market prices and investor confidence. Policy Direction: The hearing will provide clues about the likely direction of future crypto regulation under Bowman’s leadership. This can help businesses and investors anticipate upcoming regulatory changes and adapt their strategies accordingly. Long-Term Implications: The outcomes of this hearing could shape the long-term trajectory of the crypto industry in the U.S., influencing innovation, adoption, and the overall competitiveness of the American crypto market on a global stage. Staying informed about these developments is essential for anyone navigating the crypto space. The insights gained from the Senate’s questioning of Fed Vice Chair Bowman could be invaluable for making informed decisions in the evolving world of digital assets. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Regulation? The upcoming Senate hearing with Fed Vice Chair Bowman is more than just a procedural step; it’s a significant indicator of the growing importance of crypto regulation in the eyes of U.S. lawmakers and financial authorities. As cryptocurrencies become increasingly integrated into the broader financial system, the need for clear, effective, and balanced regulatory frameworks becomes ever more critical. Bowman’s responses to the Senate Banking Committee’s questions will be closely analyzed for signals about the Fed’s evolving approach to crypto oversight . Will we see a more proactive and stringent regulatory stance, or will the focus be on fostering innovation while managing risks? The answers to these questions will have profound implications for the crypto industry, shaping its growth, development, and integration into the mainstream financial world. In conclusion, mark your calendars for April 10th. The U.S. Senate’s questioning of Fed Vice Chair Bowman on crypto oversight is set to be a landmark event. It’s a moment that could very well define the next chapter of cryptocurrency regulation in America and beyond. Stay tuned, stay informed, and prepare for potential shifts in the crypto landscape.

To anticipate its next move, we analyze XRP’s price action across the daily, 4-hour, 1-hour, and 15-minute time frames, identifying key trends and potential breakout points. Daily Time Frame XRP is in a consolidation phase, fluctuating between support at $2.00 and resistance near $2.50. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is neutral, suggesting an equilibrium between buyers and sellers. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows signs of a potential bullish crossover, hinting at a possible uptrend. If XRP breaks above $2.50, it could target $2.80–$3.00 in the coming weeks. 4-Hour Time Frame XRP recently retested a crucial breakout from a falling logarithmic trend. The RSI is approaching oversold territory, which could attract buying interest. The MACD indicator is displaying reduced selling pressure, signaling a potential reversal. If buying momentum increases, XRP could attempt a breakout above $2.20 in the short term. 1-Hour Time Frame On an hourly chart, XRP is trading within a narrow range, reflecting consolidation. The RSI remains neutral, while the MACD is flat, indicating a temporary lack of strong momentum. This suggests that a decisive move is imminent , depending on whether the price breaks above $2.20 or drops below $2.00. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 15-Minute Time Frame In the shortest time frame, XRP shows minor fluctuations, typical of low volatility periods. The RSI and MACD indicate no strong directional bias, suggesting market indecision. However, an increase in volume could trigger a breakout. Next Move Prediction XRP’s price action suggests an imminent breakout. If buyers push the price above $2.20, XRP could rally toward $2.50, with further upside potential . However, if $2.00 support fails, a pullback to $1.90 is possible. Traders should watch for increased volume and key resistance levels to confirm the next significant move.

Low gas prices are sometimes interpreted as a sign of lower demand, but a group of analysts recently suggested that the current situation might actually reveal something quite different—that users are moving off the Ethereum mainnet and using Layer 2 solutions that are faster and cheaper. Ethereum gas fees are at their lowest since mid-2020. Less congestion, less demand? Maybe. But it could also mean users are moving to Layer 2s for faster, cheaper transactions. $ETH mainnet isn’t struggling—it’s evolving. The question is, does this make Ethereum stronger or… pic.twitter.com/M8NnAuNsw8 — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) April 2, 2025 Yet, a reduction in fees doesn’t automatically equate to a downturn for Ethereum. To the contrary, this may well indicate that the network is becoming more scalable and efficient, and therefore better able to serve its users—all positive signs for a would-be unstoppable blockchain. The real issue is what these developments mean for Ethereum’s future in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. Is Ethereum Evolving or Losing Its Edge? Ethereum’s gas fees show a decline in transaction demand on the mainnet. Ethereum seems to have fallen behind the Layer 2 systems in terms of user experience and cost. Optimism, Arbitrum, and zk-Rollups are seemingly taking much of the demand that was previously on the mainnet. These systems use Ethereum’s security but offer much better performance than the mainnet. Projects moving to Layer 2 networks may lower transaction numbers on the Ethereum mainnet, which could reduce gas fees. But this shift isn’t necessarily bad for Ethereum. It might just mean that Ethereum is surviving and thriving, and the development of Ethereum 2.0, which aims to improve scalability and lessen the number of congested times on the network, will make it more solidly the go-to platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) and other blockchain apps. Some professionals contend that Ethereum’s flexibility is what makes it strong. Presently, gas fees are lower than they were, but that’s no sign that Ethereum is positioning itself any less favorably within the blockchain space. If anything, it may represent the natural evolution of the ecosystem, where users are now moving to Layer 2 solutions and optimizing for cost. In that case, Ethereum remains as relevant as ever, and Layer 2s are a critical part of its infrastructure. If anything, the much-ballyhooed disadvantage of high gas fees may be morphing into an advantage pro forma. Whale Activity: A Sign of Confidence? Despite a recent decline in gas fees, Ethereum’s large holders (whales) remain confident. Just 11 hours ago, one of the asset’s major whales withdrew 2,774 ETH worth about $5.27 million from cryptocurrency exchange Binance. That withdrawal brings the same whale’s total withdrawals from Binance since February 11, 2024, to 16,415 ETH, or approximately $43.9 million. The whale now holds 16,415 ETH in cold storage (meaning the assets are no longer on an exchange and are presumably safe from hackers), and is evidently willing to eat a loss of more than $13 million (the whale’s average buy price was about $2,676). A whale withdrew another 2,774 $ETH ($5.27M) from #Binance 11 hours ago. Since Feb 11, 2024, this whale has withdrawn a total of 16,415 $ETH ($43.9M) from #Binance at an average price of $2,676, and is currently sitting on a loss of over $13M! https://t.co/1UrVpTOyMI pic.twitter.com/JuMarghDgO — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 3, 2025 Notwithstanding this undisclosed loss, the whale’s unbroken flow of ETH suggests a long-term strategy that reflects a confidence in Ethereum’s future. Moves like this are often interpreted as a sign of bullish intent, as these whales could be preparing to take their ETH off the market in anticipation of a price rebound. For us, as investors, this continued accumulation by potent holders can serve as a sign that potentates are positioning themselves for the next substantial bull run. Heretofore, Ethereum has been our favorite second-place asset. Similarly, another whale saw the dip as an opportunity and recently plunked down 11.5 million USDC on 6,488.5 ETH, buying the token at $1,772 per. This purchase not only indicates the whale’s belief in Ethereum’s potential but also demonstrates large-scale investor confidence in the second-biggest crypto’s future, even amid short-term price volatility. See for yourself: short-term price charts don’t tend to smile back, and if anything, midterm charts look seasonal. Buying the dip is certainly not a foregone conclusion. A whale just bought the dip — dropping 11.5M $USDC on 6,488.5 $ETH at $1,772. https://t.co/KdsiTykxYE pic.twitter.com/Ny16X4b3wO — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 3, 2025 Ethereum ETFs See Outflows Amid the Dip Even with robust whale activity, Ethereum has manifested some weakness in a few other arenas. The latest information available shows that Ethereum spot ETFs show a net outflow of $51.24 million for the day on April 2. That figure is likely to raise some eyebrows, as it was put together when there were no inflows recorded across any of the nine Ethereum ETFs tracked. One potential reason for the disappointing performance of Ethereum ETFs is that the market for them is still quite new and untested. The first Ethereum ETF was only launched in June of this year, and since then, the total assets in the ETFs have barely cracked $100 million. Compare that with the situation in 2021, when the price of Ethereum crossed $2,000 for the first time; at that point, there were already several Ethereum ETFs (or similar products) available in Europe, and the market for Ethereum futures had just opened in the U.S. On April 2, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $221 million, marking a reversal after three consecutive days of outflows. In contrast, spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net outflow of $51.24 million, with none of the nine ETFs registering a net inflow.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 3, 2025 Indeed, the Ethereum ETF was not only a first for North America; it was also a first for Ethereum in any form. And the actual form of the thing was another potential problem for our ETFs. Ethereum is a platform, and Ethereum is a thing, and not all of the Ethereum that exists is part of the platform; when it comes to insuring the platforms themselves, the thingness of the thing could be a problem. So, too, could the actual structure of the ETF. These were potential problems. What were the problems in actual performance? Looking Forward: The Long-Term Outlook for Ethereum Although Ethereum gas prices may be in remission and certain areas have seen temporary outflows, the long-term prognosis is positive. Ethereum continues to mature, and with the blossoming of Layer 2 solutions as well as the transition to Ethereum 2.0, it is likely to stay well entrenched as the leader in the space of smart contracts and decentralized finance. Confidence in Ethereum from whales and institutional investors suggests that despite its current difficulties, the underlying network may still have largely intact potential. Recent price dips and ETF outflows could simply be the market acting naturally. Ethereum could see a more favorable market climate again soon, especially if price appreciation happens in tandem with the rollout of Ethereum scalability solutions. Whales and institutions might be “hodling” on a largely unchanged Ethereum future. To summarize, even as falling gas prices and apparent changes in institutional sentiment prompt some to raise questions about Ethereum’s viability, the network’s ongoing upgrades and its support among big players and regular investors alike suggest that it keeps a secure foothold in the blockchain ecosystem. Whether it ultimately becomes a stronger network or a less relevant part of that ecosystem remains to be seen. For now, though, it looks far from losing its edge.

AMP ( AMP ) rose to an intraday high of $0.0041 on April 4, Morning Asian time, while bringing its market cap to over $320 million at the time of writing. The price rally came along with a 140% jump in daily trading volume, hovering at over $32 million. AMP’s price jump also came with a huge spike in interest from derivatives traders. According to ConGlass, open interest in AMP futures shot up by 736% in just one day, hitting over $3.3 million. The funding rate stayed at 0.0110%, which shows that most traders are feeling bullish and expecting the price to keep rising. The key catalyst behind today’s move was Bithumb , a major South Korea-based crypto exchange, which announced the addition of a KRW trading pair for the AMP token set at 4:00 PM KST on Friday, April 4, 2025. The altcoin will have an initial price of 5.091 KRW (about $0.0035). Deposits and withdrawals will open within two hours of the notice, but only on the Ethereum network. Much of the excitement around AMP is also tied to the rising adoption of the Flexa network , a digital payments platform that enables cryptocurrency payments in retail stores. AMP is used as collateral within the Flexa ecosystem to secure transactions. It can also be staked to support the network and earn rewards.

AMP price analysis Despite today’s gains, technical indicators suggest that the AMP rally may soon lose momentum. AMP price, 50-day and 200-day SMA chart — April 4 | Source: crypto.news On the 1-day/USDT price chart, AMP recently broke out of a months-long downtrend, popping out of a falling channel pattern that had been holding it back. In technical terms, that kind of breakout is usually seen as a bullish sign. However, the 50-day simple moving average has crossed below the 200-day moving average, forming what’s known as a death cross, a pattern that often signals the potential for a prolonged bearish trend. AMP Supertrend and CMF chart — April 4 | Source: crypto.news The Supertrend indicator has also flashed red, suggesting a potential downtrend or strong selling pressure in the market. On top of that, the Chaikin Money Flow Index showed a negative reading, indicating that money is flowing out of the asset, which signals weak buying interest or growing bearish sentiment. Given these signals, AMP could retrace to its immediate support level at $0.0032. A break below that might push it down further to around $0.0030, a key psychological level and its lowest price since early 2024. At press time, AMP was exchanging hands at $0.0038 per coin.

Despite Bitcoin’s recent modest gains, the broader cryptocurrency market has been struggling, with altcoins like $HYPE, $CRO, and $ONDO lagging behind in the wake of Bitcoin’s price movements. Over the past week, the total cryptocurrency market cap has seen a slight decline of about 7%, with Bitcoin showing a slight gain of 0.2%. This contrast highlights Bitcoin’s continued dominance and strength relative to other altcoins, though the market remains uncertain in the face of external factors.

Last night, a total of 18,930 BTC was sold off in a hurry by short-term holders, and we can guess with a fair degree of certainty that these folks were motivated to hit the sell button by the new economic uncertainty the tariffs are causing. This is yet another example of how fragile market sentiment is right now, particularly for short-term investors who are stirring increasingly restless. 18,930 #Bitcoin $BTC were sold by short-term holders last night, immediately after @realDonaldTrump announced new tariffs! pic.twitter.com/pONWoxV5a9 — Ali (@ali_charts) April 3, 2025 At present, Bitcoin is teetering in a pivotal price span, holding between $86,900 and $84,800. This area has morphed into something akin to a no-wire box, confined and crucial for Bitcoin’s current price action. It’s what Bitcoin seems to do instead of a not-so-happy standard deviation when there are all kinds of reports foretelling its doom or salvation. The box doesn’t really have a lid; we could use fanciful names for some of the reports that tend to come in right before or after making a move outside the confines. These reports use all kinds of research to tell us why the top is in or why the bottom is in. For Bitcoin bulls, it is crucial to keep supports above inline with the $84,800 mark, and it is most likely to occur if the sustaining forces are maintaining that $84,800 threshold as the bottom price level. That’s gives Bitcoin a lion’s share of the chances to keep the line above that level, which is the line the bulls want to keep in the going for the upside—that Bitcoin continues to not only coalesce above that $84,800 mark but also ‘attempt a new upside breakout.’ Key Support Zones and Investor Sentiment The tethering of Bitcoin’s price movement occurs at several support levels. These are particularly evident between $65K and $71K. This is a zone of price action that has lately gravitated in the direction of not-so-recent buyers who are in the weight class of “strong hands.” Accumulating in the presumption that a price breakout will occur soon, these levels seem to be serving the function of “upper supports.” It is not as though price cannot go lower; rather, it seems that these just are not the places where price is likely to go lower for very long. $BTC’s key support zone sits between $65K–$71K, where recent buyers have been loading up. Weak hands might panic, but stronger holders are stacking. This is the kind of range where big moves get set up. pic.twitter.com/wR7YVh6V1v — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) April 2, 2025 The market dynamics of Bitcoin draw their strength from a potent combination of short-term speculation and long-term faith. When the market shows even the slightest sign of trouble, it is the weak hands that sell off and for all intents and purposes, give up on Bitcoin. But when it comes to the stronger hands in the market, the ones that supposedly have better character with which to support Bitcoin, the recently established support zone between $65K and $71K is the place where these guys have put their money and their belief. Inflows to Bitcoin ETFs Signal Reversal in Market Sentiment Institutional investors are a renewed sign of confidence in the relatively challenged cryptocurrency market. They have shown considerable interest in Bitcoin. On April 2, the spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. recorded a total net inflow of $221 million after three consecutive days of outflows. This marked reversal highlights the increasingly growing appetite for Bitcoin among institutional investors. They are now viewing the cryptocurrency as a legitimate store of value, and this trajectory further narrows the route toward Bitcoin’s potential future as a widely acknowledged reserve currency. On April 2, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $221 million, marking a reversal after three consecutive days of outflows. In contrast, spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net outflow of $51.24 million, with none of the nine ETFs registering a net inflow.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 3, 2025 The capital pouring into Bitcoin ETFs indicates that institutional sentiment is headed in a positive direction. Even so, recent pressures in the external macro environment have tested the geforce capacitors of Bitcoin’s resilience. With a not unthinkable midterm election in the offing, and a high noon for U.S. debt and other payments coming up in December, the macroworld is not in an especially safe space. Yet the altcoin market is the one that’s volatile right now, and even institutional Tesla and Elon Musk seem to be matters of history and Legends of the Fall. Altcoins Struggle to Keep Pace Despite showing some resilience, altcoins such as $HYPE, $CRO, and $ONDO are unable to keep pace with Bitcoin. The tokens are running up against a couple of headwinds. One is that in a time of increasing competition among altcoins, Bitcoin is simply too robust and well-established a competitor for these tokens to contend with. To add to that, these tokens have in recent days simply not performed anywhere near as well as Bitcoin. This trend suggests that for the moment, Bitcoin is still the favored asset for not only long-term but also for short-term investors. It is stable enough now, at a price midpoint between all-time highs and recent lows, that its dominance seems to dictate the broader market’s movement. Some alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) may very well catch up down the road, but as of now, Bitcoin seems to have the wind at its back. Looking Ahead: Will Bitcoin Break Out or Consolidate? With Bitcoin lingering between vital support levels, all eyes are on it to see what might unfold next. The price of Bitcoin hovers between the vital levels of 86,900 and 84,800 at present. Investors gnash their teeth. When Bitcoin moves, it sets the tone for everything else in the crypto market. Bitcoin has managed to remain unscathed in the face of external challenges that have come at it from all angles, like new tariffs, for instance. But the biggest threat to Bitcoin seems to be the volatility of its own market. However, despite that, Bitcoin has been showing signs of increasing maturity as an asset. For one, the storied involvement of institutional investors has only ramped up over the last couple of years. And sitting underneath that are the strong hands of holders who seem less likely to capitulate in the face of potential downside than the weak hands that Bitcoin seems to have at its disposal.

Collectively, 7,800 holders have bought tokens for $0.025 each, and the project is currently in phase 4 of its 11-phase presale, having raised $6,100,000. As phase 5 approaches, momentum continues to build, promising to earn you a 20% price increase to $0.03. MUTM listing at $0.06, giving early participants a 140% return — but according to analysts, the token could reach even higher targets — some forecast a climb to beyond $2.50 before the end of 2025. Investor Route From MUTM Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) demand currently at an all-time high due to its structured tokenomics and real world DeFi applications In contrast with Dogecoin (DOGE), which boasts meme-fueled volatile price action, MUTM is grounded on use cases for decentralized lending and borrowing. Currently, these tokens are on presale in phase 4 at $0.025, a bar that can disappear as soon as the 20% jump in phase 5 awaits. Investors, however, looking at the $0.06 listing price see immediate upside, but post-launch estimates suggest transformative gains. A $1,000 investment today could turn into $100,000 if MUTM was able to hit $2.50 — which showcases just how aggressive today’s optimism on its ecosystem currently is. The Demand Behind Innovative Lending Mechanics At the heart of Mutuum Finance’s attraction is its dual-function platform that allows users to either lend assets or borrow against collateral while earning passive yields. The protocol’s mtTokens—interest-bearing representations of deposited assets such as ETH or DAI—generate value over their lifespan, swaddling liquidity without requiring asset sales. Users can receive loans by locking overcollateralized reserves. For instance, a $5,000 USDT loan would need $7,000 of ETH collateral, which reduces the chances of defaulting on a loan. It also features a peer-to-peer (P2P) to negotiate on unconventional assets like DOGE directly, connecting the dots that traditional DeFi platforms left behind. A buy-and-distribute mechanism adds to MUTM’s appeal even further. Platform revenues are directed into regular token buybacks, redistributing bought MUTM to mtToken stakers. And this cyclical demand applies permanent upward pressure on prices going up, which benefits DOGE investors now seeking stability within a meme coin market that has tended to be much more unpredictable. Security and Scalability Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is treating security as a top priority. They are finalizing a Smart contract audit with CertiK, a requisite that will help secure the trust of investors when complete. These measures separate MUTM from other projects that are focused on creating hype rather than sustainability as the platform gears up to launch an overcollateralized stablecoin. This stablecoin, supported by user-deposited assets, will function in a decentralized and transparent manner, upholding the core tenets of DeFi while offering broader functionality. The passive income approach seems effective, so investors want to avoid missing out on the next price uptrend in phase 5. Add in the project’s $100,000 giveaway—where 10 presale participants get $10,000 each—and you get a recipe that mixes opportunity and savvy marketing. A Strategic Transition from Speculations to Utilities The whimsical market fluctuations have long been a part and parcel of life for Dogecoin (DOGE) devotees, whose grip on the meme coin remains tight even as they find themselves venturing toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for real-world use cases. Through the lens of lending innovation, tokenized deposits, and revenue-driven buybacks, the takeaway is that despite Doge’s stalwart nature as a cultural icon, MUTM could be a better hedge against volatility. The early backers do not only get the tokens at presale rates, they get access to ecosystem that is designed for sustained growth. As the CertiK audit approaches completion and listings on exchanges prepare, the trajectory of MUTM hints at a shift in investor focus — moving from meme-based speculation to utility-driven possession. Investors have little time to still enter phase 4 before prices soar. For presale details and updates on the CertiK audit, visit Mutuum Finance’s official channels. Time is running out to get your MUTM at $0.025, so don’t miss out on the next evolution of DeFi.

42887785,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146338,1743751819,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Outrage in Court: Haru Invest Customer Gets 5 Years for Shocking CEO Attack During Crypto Fraud Trial,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/haru-invest-ceo-attack-sentence/,"In a stunning turn of events during a high-profile crypto fraud trial, a customer of the embattled digital asset platform Haru Invest has been sentenced to five years in prison. Mr. Kang, a South Korean national and reportedly a disgruntled user of Haru Invest , launched a violent attack on the platform’s CEO, Mr. Lee, inside the courtroom itself. This unprecedented incident has sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community, raising serious questions about investor sentiment and the escalating tensions surrounding crypto fraud cases. What Sparked the Haru Invest CEO Attack? The incident unfolded on August 28th of last year when Mr. Kang, armed with a fruit knife, approached Mr. Lee during his ongoing fraud trial and stabbed him in the neck five times. According to reports from Digital Asset, the attack was swift and brutal, causing significant disruption to the court proceedings and leaving onlookers in disbelief. Mr. Kang was immediately apprehended and charged with attempted murder and disrupting court proceedings. His recent sentencing marks the conclusion of his first trial, but the ramifications of his actions extend far beyond his personal fate. Here’s a breakdown of the key facts surrounding the incident: The Attacker: Mr. Kang, a South Korean citizen and a customer of Haru Invest . The Victim: Mr. Lee, CEO of Haru Invest , currently on trial for fraud allegations. The Weapon: A fruit knife. The Location: A courtroom in South Korea during Mr. Lee’s fraud trial. The Date: August 28th of last year. The Charges Against Kang: Attempted murder and disrupting court proceedings. The Sentence: Five years in prison. The Shadow of Crypto Fraud : Why Such Extreme Reactions? This violent outburst is a stark reminder of the intense emotions and financial devastation that can accompany crypto fraud . Platforms like Haru Invest , which promised high returns on digital asset investments, have come under increasing scrutiny as allegations of fraudulent activities surface. When investors feel betrayed and face significant financial losses, the desperation and anger can boil over, sometimes leading to extreme actions as witnessed in this case. The Haru Invest case is not isolated. The crypto industry, while offering exciting opportunities, is also plagued by risks, including: Lack of Regulation: The relatively nascent and often unregulated nature of the crypto space makes it a breeding ground for scams and fraudulent schemes. High-Yield Promises: Platforms promising unrealistically high returns should be treated with extreme caution. These are often Ponzi schemes or unsustainable business models. Investor Vulnerability: Many crypto investors are new to the financial markets and may lack the experience to discern legitimate opportunities from scams. Emotional Investment: The volatile nature of crypto markets can lead to emotional investment decisions, making investors more susceptible to scams and prone to extreme reactions when things go wrong. CEO Attack : A Reflection of Investor Despair? While violence is never justifiable, Mr. Kang’s CEO attack can be interpreted as a desperate act stemming from deep-seated frustration and financial ruin. Many Haru Invest customers are likely facing substantial losses due to the alleged fraud, and the slow pace of legal proceedings can exacerbate feelings of helplessness and anger. This incident serves as a chilling example of the real-world consequences of financial misconduct in the crypto sector. Could this incident have been prevented? While predicting individual actions is impossible, several factors contribute to such extreme scenarios in the crypto world: Factor Description Financial Loss Significant financial losses due to alleged fraud can drive individuals to desperation. Lack of Recourse The complexity and often international nature of crypto fraud can make it difficult for victims to recover their funds. Slow Justice System Legal proceedings in fraud cases can be lengthy, leading to prolonged uncertainty and frustration for victims. Public Outcry High-profile cases like Haru Invest attract significant media attention, amplifying investor anxieties and public outrage. Prison Sentence : Justice Served or a Symptom of a Larger Problem? Mr. Kang’s five-year prison sentence reflects the severity of his crime – attempted murder is a grave offense. However, some may argue that his actions are also a symptom of a larger problem within the crypto industry: the lack of accountability and the devastating impact of crypto fraud on ordinary investors. While justice is being served to Mr. Kang for his violent actions, the underlying issues that led to his despair remain largely unaddressed. The sentencing also highlights the following aspects of the legal response: Deterrence: The sentence aims to deter similar violent acts in the future, sending a clear message that such behavior will not be tolerated within the legal system. Rule of Law: It reinforces the principle that even in cases of extreme emotional distress, violence is not an acceptable form of redress. Focus on Individual Accountability: The legal system rightly focuses on holding individuals accountable for their actions, regardless of the broader context. South Korea Grapples with Crypto Crime and Investor Protection South Korea , a nation with a high adoption rate of cryptocurrencies, has been grappling with the challenges of regulating the crypto market and protecting investors from fraud. The Haru Invest saga and the subsequent attack underscore the urgency for stronger regulatory frameworks and more effective investor protection mechanisms. The South Korean authorities are under increasing pressure to address the rising tide of crypto-related crimes and ensure a safer environment for digital asset investments. Moving forward, what steps can be taken to mitigate such incidents and better protect crypto investors? Enhanced Regulation: Governments worldwide need to implement clearer and more comprehensive regulations for the crypto industry. Investor Education: Increased efforts are needed to educate investors about the risks associated with crypto investments and how to identify potential scams. Faster Legal Processes: Streamlining legal procedures for fraud cases can help reduce the frustration and sense of helplessness among victims. Industry Self-Regulation: Crypto platforms and exchanges should take proactive steps to enhance security, transparency, and consumer protection measures. A Wake-Up Call for the Crypto World The sentencing of Mr. Kang for attacking the Haru Invest CEO is a grim reminder of the human cost of crypto fraud . It serves as a wake-up call for the entire crypto industry – regulators, platforms, and investors alike. While justice has been served in this particular case, the underlying issues of investor protection, regulatory oversight, and the potential for extreme emotional reactions in the face of financial devastation must be urgently addressed to prevent future tragedies. The industry must learn from this shocking incident and work collaboratively to build a safer and more trustworthy ecosystem for digital assets.

42887759,https://nulltx.com/?p=147713,1743751850,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Smart Money Wallets Show Increased Activity Across Multiple Narratives,https://nulltx.com/smart-money-wallets-show-increased-activity-across-multiple-narratives/,"Over the past day, there has been significant accumulation of cryptocurrencies by smart money wallets, with three major narratives emerging as focal points for the most astute investors. These narratives center on meme tokens, AI and tech innovations, and real-world assets (RWA) within the decentralized finance space. But a deeper look into these trends reveals some specific tokens that are seeing strong support from smart money. And that could mean they’re in position to see some serious growth and make a serious impact on the market. Meme Tokens Capture Smart Money’s Attention In the past 24 hours, one of the most intriguing trends is that savvy investors are paying significant attention to meme tokens. Despite their volatility, meme coins remain very much in vogue in the market, thanks in no small part to the strong communities that surround them and the speculative, sometimes parabolic, price action that they are prone to. The accumulated price token seeing the most attention is DOGINME, which has gained a million in market cap to its current 40.9 million and is supported by eight wallets that have accumulated a grand total of 35,000 in the token. Investors seem to believe that this token is on the precipice of price action that could see its value increase significantly. Another meme token that has caught the eye of smart money is KEYCAT, which has also been seeing accumulation, with 8 smart money wallets adding $7,500 to their positions. With a market cap of $27.9 million, KEYCAT’s recent Coinbase listing has fueled long-term bullish sentiment, even though its listing timing was somewhat bearish. This indicates that investors believe in the token’s long-term potential despite short-term market fluctuations. Smart money wallets accumulations in the last 24 hours Main specific narratives accumulated: Meme tokens (17 wallets) AI and tech innovation (12 wallets) Real World Assets (RWA) and finance (8 wallets) Top accumulations and reasoning: $DOGINME -> Strong support… pic.twitter.com/aw9W2XFFH3 — CoinSense.app (@CoinSense_App) April 3, 2025 Finally, KTA (Keeta), a meme token associated with ex-Google leader Eric Schmidt, has been seeing an uptick in accumulation by 9 clever-money wallets. These 9 clever-money wallets added up to a total of $139,000. At a current market cap of $49.5 million, this is not investment advice, but we see the partnership with Schmidt as a pretty decent growth catalyst. AI and Tech Innovation Draw Smart Money Investments The next big area of interest for smart money is AI and tech innovation, with multiple tokens in this space being targeted for accumulation. CLANKER (TokenBot)—a token leveraging the power of AI and blockchain technology—has seen 4 smart money wallets accumulate $2.8k worth of tokens. With a market cap of $34 million and a recent listing on Coinbase, CLANKER is attracting investor interest because it seems well-positioned to capitalize on the intersection of AI and decentralized finance (DeFi). A token that benefits from the increasing attention to technical innovation is VIBE (VibeCoding). In recent weeks, 4 smart money wallets have acquired a combined $10,000 worth of VIBE. With a market cap of only $451,000, VIBE is on quite the ride lately, gaining major traction within the gaming community as it appears to be part of some sort of a Vibe Jam event. Investors considering VIBE should be aware that it presents a potential high-risk, high-reward opportunity, given its low market cap. Still, if you can get past the 420 trail to Raize (which may be very difficult for some), the purported Vibe Jam event makes this token seem like a contender within the gaming community and could signal a serious tech-driven platform emerging. Real World Assets (RWA) and Finance Continue to Garner Attention The third major narrative attracting savvy investors is the intersection of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi), with a particular focus on real-world assets (RWA). Reserve Rights (RSR), a token that supports a platform for stablecoins, has seen three smart wallets accumulate $13K worth of the tokens. With a market cap of $364 million, RSR’s focus on stablecoin solutions does lend it a bit of an edge in potentially bridging the gap between TradFi and DeFi. Furthermore, IXS (Ix’s Token), which concentrates on linking traditional finance and decentralized finance with an emphasis on the tokenization of real-world assets, has attracted the interest of two smart money wallets that have amply stocked up on $2,000 worth of the tokens. IXS now enjoys a market cap of $26.8 million, and its mission directly addresses a key segment of the decentralized ecosystem: real-world asset tokenization. Conclusion: Strategic Investments Reflect Confidence in Diverse Crypto Narratives In the last 24 hours, there has been a notable upsurge in the smart money activity that we track. Investments have been flowing into that space and are currently going into meme tokens, platforms driven by AI, and a range of other projects aimed at connecting traditional finance with decentralized finance. The tokens the smart money is targeting right now include DOGINME, KEYCAT, KTA, CLANKER, VIBE, RSR, and IXS. These reflect some of the speculative interests in the space as well as quite a bit of long-term investment narrative building. Meme tokens are still in very high demand, and for communities that are looking to capitalize on the speculative movements of their prices—and who wouldn’t want to do that?—they’re a great avenue to pursue. Why pursue just a meme when you could also take one vein of AI-driven technology and another of the supposed innovation that is bringing real-world assets into the blockchain space? For real-world use cases of blockchain technology, the growth of asset tokenization is a great hedge against the price pullbacks that we’re seeing with other blockchain projects. The market keeps evolving, and these emerging narratives plus the accumulation patterns of the smart money suggest that investors paying close attention to these trends can find both high-risk and stable opportunities. For anyone seeking to navigate the crypto landscape, understanding where the smart money is betting can give valuable insight into the future direction of market growth.

The decision was made during a core developer call on Apr. 3, following a successful test on the Hoodi testnet, Pectra upgrade’s third and final dry run. The Hoodi testnet is now ready to go live on mainnet after developers fixed bugs that caused delays earlier. Pectra combines two significant upgrades, Electra and Prague, into a single release. It features 11 Ethereum ( ETH ) Improvement Proposals, which will help to improve the network’s speed, security, and user experience. Ethereum wallets will be able to use smart accounts thanks to one major update. Smart wallets are easier to use and recover if users lose access. Another notable improvement is EIP-7251, which raises the staking limit per validator from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH. This update is expected to simplify staking for institutions and large holders by reducing the need to run multiple validator nodes. You might also like: Cardano’s new open-source digital identity platform goes live It also introduces other important features such as Peer Data Availability Sampling, which allows nodes to validate transaction data without storing everything, and Verkle Trees, which help the network to store data more effectively. Although Ethereum is making progress in its development, its market performance has been poor. As of this writing, ETH is trading at $1,804 after a 45% in the first quarter of 2025. Revenue from transaction fees fell from $142 million in January to just $21 million in March, as per DefiLlama data . In addition, Ethereum’s burn rate has dropped to its lowest point since August 2021, and since the EIP-1559 upgrade, the overall supply has grown by 3%. Despite these declines, Ethereum surpassed BNB Chain ( BNB ) and Solana ( SOL ) in March in terms of decentralized exchange volume, recording $64 billion. Developers believe that the Pectra upgrade will help the network attract new users and boost market confidence.

42887852,https://nulltx.com/?p=147714,1743751985,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Cryptocurrency Market Shifts: TON and BNB Lead Gains, DOGE and SOL Suffer Losses",https://nulltx.com/cryptocurrency-market-shifts-ton-and-bnb-lead-gains-doge-and-sol-suffer-losses/,"The previous 30 days have recorded significant ups and downs across the cryptocurrency market, with various assets demonstrating sharp changes in the percentage of their supply that is currently in profit. Among the strongest performers, $TON (Toncoin) and $BNB (Binance Coin) are showing notable gains, while $DOGE (Dogecoin), $XRP (Ripple), and $SOL (Solana) are experiencing sharp declines in the percentage of their supply that is in profit. This dynamic shift highlights the volatile nature of the crypto market—one where different assets can experience contrasting fortunes over short periods. TON and BNB Surge as Holders Enjoy Unrealized Gains In the last month, Toncoin ($TON) and Binance Coin ($BNB) have been the top performers by a considerable margin, both appearing in the list of cryptocurrencies with the largest increase in the portion of their circulating supply that is in profit. Since its launch, Toncoin has been steadily gaining strength and momentum. Its supply sitting in profit, however, recently surged—and it’s not surprising to see. Almost 94 percent of Toncoin holders are sitting on unrealized gains, and as I warned at the beginning of this series, that’s a strong signal for any asset—be it pre- or post-IPO, token or coin—that the market has confidence in it. Why did Toncoin see such a large jump in the share of its supply sitting in profit? Here’s one reason. Binance Coin has experienced a 17.4 percentage point increase, and this is now 86.3% of its supply making a profit. Binance Coin is the cryptocurrency that drives the Binance ecosystem. And if Binance continues to grow, there isn’t any reason that the profit percentage of BNB and the utility within the Binance ecosystem shouldn’t continue to grow as well. Over the past 30 days, $TON and $BNB saw the strongest gains in percent supply in profit: TON: +23.8pp → 94.1% BNB: +17.4pp → 86.3% This indicates a significant rise in holders sitting on unrealized gains. pic.twitter.com/5YfaEGo8Jk — glassnode (@glassnode) April 2, 2025 The data reveals that for holders of these coins, there are significant unrealized gains, indicating that a large segment of the market expresses an optimistic view of the future prospects for these assets. Toncoin and Binance Coin persist in their status as two of the more prominent assets in the cryptocurrency space. The data also shows that their profit percentages are increasing, suggesting that they are both still in a growth phase and that trend seems likely to continue for the time being. DOGE, XRP, and SOL See Declines in Profitability On the flip side, the past month has not been kind to some major market players. Dogecoin ($DOGE), once a darling of the meme-coin movement, found itself experiencing a sharp decline in the proportion of its circulating supply in profit—9.7 percentage points down to 53.6%. This means that a large portion of $DOGE holders are now underwater on their investments. And this, of course, brings us a step closer to a world in which Dogecoin exists as a non-viable financial product. Dogecoin’s status as a meme coin and its reliance on social media to drive pricing have contributed to its swingy nature, which has made it vulnerable to the kinds of market sentiment shifts that a national cryptocurrency ban can cause. XRP, likewise, has encountered difficulties, the percent of its supply that is in profit dropping by 5.2 percentage points to 81.5%. XRP has had a tough year because its ongoing legal fight with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has kept it very much in the public eye and, some might argue, sent it to the shaming wall, a kind of SEC-sponsored Cirque du Soleil. And that has rippled through XRP’s price and performance, taking it down a notch in what was already a fairly beleaguered patch. Because of the strong loyalty of its user base, standing by XRP through thick and thin, you might have felt sorry for XRP this year. SOL, previously a leading contender in smart contracts and decentralized applications, saw a decline in the share of its supply in profit that dropped 4.4 percentage points to 35.2% of its circulating supply in profit. The decline in Solana’s profitability mirrors the challenges the project is facing as it copes with network outages and scalability issues. Amidst a still-volatile price, it has proven difficult for investors to realize any semblance of profitability on an ongoing basis. Bitcoin and Ethereum Show Stability, But Divergence is Emerging Of the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Bitcoin ($BTC) and Ethereum ($ETH), there has been relative stability when it comes to the percentage of supply in profit. Bitcoin saw a modest increase of 1.6 percentage points, bringing the share of holders in profit to 79.5%. This illustrates that Bitcoin has retained its status as the market leader and store of value while reflecting price movements that are more often than not dictated by a wider array of macroeconomic factors, including inflation concerns and institutional adoption. Yet, Ethereum’s performance tells a slightly different story. The percentage of Ethereum’s supply in profit has decreased by 2.3 percentage points, now sitting at 51.7%. Ethereum’s price has faced headwinds due to ongoing scalability concerns and competition from other smart contract platforms. Despite the success of Ethereum 2.0 and the continued growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Ethereum’s market sentiment appears to be a bit weaker than Bitcoin’s, which could be concerns over the network’s ability to scale and handle increasing demand. Conclusion: A Market in Flux The last 30 days have brought substantial divergence in the cryptocurrency market, where some assets have posted eye-catching profit percentages, and others have seen sharp declines. Toncoin and Binance Coin have been the clearest winners, with the vast majority of their supply now in profit. They stand out in a market otherwise characterized by pronounced losses. On the opposite end of the profit spectrum are Dogecoin, XRP, and Solana, whose assets have shrunk in profitability. They are now accompanied by a number of other assets pulling back, reflecting a cooling investor sentiment. Bitcoin and Ethereum still are, for the most part, playing a very stable game at the moment, with the two leading cryptocurrencies continuing to be relatively stable. But what’s happening with Ethereum is that its supply in profit has been falling, which is showing a clear divergence between it and Bitcoin. And… you guessed it! The still-nascent world of crypto remains dynamic. If you want to steer through the cryptocurrency world, it is essential to grasp these changes in market dynamics and the underlying reasons driving each asset’s performance. What is even more interesting is to speculate about the future: whether the current state of the crypto market, in terms of its graphic representation on trading charts, will yield the same winners and losers as in the past or whether some assets will defy expectations and rise or fall in ways not currently anticipated.

Crypto analyst CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) identified this price as one of the most important of the week, stating that it “must reclaim for momentum to build.” If the digital asset successfully turns this level into support, it could trigger a strong upward move. However, failure to break through may result in a pullback toward lower levels. XRP Decision Time at $2.17 XRP is showing strength with a bounce right back to our first key test at $2.17! This is the resistance level we want to see flip into support, it might just be the most important price of the week. So what now? •We're watching $2.17 – Must… pic.twitter.com/U0zm7hLaAM — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) April 1, 2025 At the time of her analysis, the asset traded at $2.149, reflecting a 0.78% 24-hour increase. This price movement aligns with Fibonacci retracement levels, reinforcing the importance of the $2.17 mark. The level coincides with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, a historically significant point for trend reversals and breakout confirmations. Traders will watch for a decisive move that confirms or rejects this resistance. Possible Scenarios for XRP If XRP fails to hold above $2.17, it could retest $2. This level is key support and could be a base for another attempt at higher prices. On the other hand, a successful breakout above $2.17 with strong momentum could set the stage for further gains. Major resistance levels above this point include $2.70, $3.05, and $3.80. These levels have been identified as significant barriers that XRP must overcome to confirm a bullish trend continuation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 CasiTrades noted that the asset’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has confirmed a bullish divergence that precedes upward price movements. Other well-respected analysts have also pointed toward bullish technical formations on the chart, making a breakout a strong possibility. Fibonacci Time Zone Analysis and Market Outlook Additionally, Fibonacci time zone analysis indicates that April could be crucial for XRP’s next major rally. CasiTrades emphasized that XRP has entered Fibonacci Time Zone 3, a period that could signal a crucial price shift. Notably, another analyst recently predicted a 70% surge in April , and the price action outlined by CasiTrades is aligning with the expected subwave structure, suggesting that the asset may be approaching a confirmed Wave 3 move. If the asset clears $2.7 in the near term, it could validate this Elliott Wave count and reinforce the bullish scenario. In a follow-up post, CasiTrades noted that the digital asset has tested the $2.17 level but has dropped slightly, now trading at $2.15. CasiTrades jokingly predicted a move toward $1,000, and while many market participants are bullish , crossing $2.17 is the most crucial factor determining the asset’s immediate future.

42887967,https://nulltx.com/?p=147715,1743752174,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Wintermute Capitalizes on FDUSD Flash Crash, Making Over $3M Profit Amid Depeg",https://nulltx.com/wintermute-capitalizes-on-fdusd-flash-crash-making-over-3m-profit-amid-depeg/,"In a dramatic turn of events on April 2, 2025, the stablecoin $FDUSD briefly lost its usual $1 value, dropping to as low as $0.8726 after a series of bankruptcy rumors surrounding its issuer, First Digital Trust (FDT). This sharp decline in price triggered a wave of panic selling across the market, but it also provided a unique opportunity for IA traders to buy the now-devalued asset at a significant discount. Among those moving swiftly to place potentially very profitable trades was Wintermute, a large trading firm that serves as a market maker in crypto. FDUSD briefly depegged to $0.8726 after bankruptcy news. After the depeg, #Wintermute withdrew 31.36M $FDUSD from #Binance . Assuming they bought $FDUSD near the bottom at $0.90, they would make over $3M when $FDUSD returned to the peg. https://t.co/Sm1quGE1WR pic.twitter.com/5mE6MGj9hw — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 2, 2025 Wintermute’s lightning-fast actions during the price disestablishment of FDUSD have caused quite a stir in the cryptosphere, especially because the firm’s maneuvers have seemed to net it a pretty significant profit. Reports indicate that Wintermute managed to pull off something like a $3 million windfall during the depeg event. Less clear is whether this was a creative trade to profit from a price disestablishment or just an unfortunate coin for the FDUSD team to see during what was otherwise a price stabilization period. Wintermute’s Strategic Move: Profit from the Depeg The crypto markets felt the impact of the fast depeg of $FDUSD. The stablecoin, which is utilized extensively on Binance, had been a mainstay for traders in Launchpool and other platforms within the Binance ecosystem. But when the news broke that First Digital Trust might be facing insolvency, the panic in the markets was almost palpable. Traders and investors that had been using $FDUSD started to head for the exits, and soon the price of the stablecoin was spiraling downward. However, Wintermute, which is recognized for its expertise in steering through unstable markets, beheld a prospect. By pulling out 31.36 million $FDUSD from Binance while the price was low, the company bought the stablecoin at a large discount. When the price was around $0.90, it was able to redeem the asset at a value much greater than what it purchased it for. In effect, it was able to make a substantial profit on the asset once the price came back to $1. Wintermute could have realized well over $3 million in profit from this trade. Given the volatility and uncertainty of the situation, this takes Wintermute’s ability to navigate price fluctuations and capitalize on market inefficiencies to a new level. Wintermute’s Continued Activity with $FDUSD Wintermute’s operations didn’t end with the procurement of the discounted $FDUSD. Following the depeg event, the trading firm continued transferring huge sums of the stablecoin, amounting to 75 million $FDUSD, to First Digital Labs. This transfer seems to have been a coordinated move to ensure that the 75 million $FDUSD could be redeemed at a 1:1 ratio for $USD, which is the common practice of stablecoin issuers to maintain the peg. Since $FDUSD depegged, #Wintermute has transferred 75M $FDUSD to First Digital Labs. They likely bought $FDUSD at a discount during the depeg and redeemed it 1:1 through First Digital—making a solid profit. https://t.co/6WZdfs65vk https://t.co/vyLDgzbynX pic.twitter.com/91Pg6GcKAN — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 3, 2025 When the asset was restored to its pegged values, Wintermute was able to recognize its profits from the initial purchase, at the same time as it realized new gains from selling the asset to a reputable partner, First Digital Labs. With these transactions, Wintermute further cemented its place as a sophisticated operator in the crypto space—using shrugged-off market volatility to make profits that, to all appearances, it was doing in slightly more respectable, if not also slightly more risky, ways than many retail investors. This string of events has struck many investors as odd, with some questioning whether the depeg resulted purely from panic or was instead a product of some larger market force. While no one has pointed to any specific piece of evidence suggesting that foul play was afoot, Wintermute’s quick moves in the wake of the depeg and the transfers that followed have certainly raised a few eyebrows. The Aftermath: Trust in $FDUSD and the Impact on the Stablecoin Market The $FDUSD depeg event has underscored lingering worries regarding the reliability and stability of some stablecoins, especially when they are connected to matters like possible insolvency. Although $FDUSD has since returned to its peg, the situation set off a skepticism wave in the crypto community, with many questioning whether the coin could maintain its stability going forward. The depeg event was, however, an opportunity for Wintermute to demonstrate just how sophisticated it was as a trading operation. From what we can tell, it apparently took advantage of an extremely wild and volatile situation where the prices of various asset pairs were out of whack—i.e., where the market was showing clear signs of inefficiency—and made a nice profit in doing so. If nothing else, this event shows that in DeFi, as in more traditional forms of finance, some firms are much better at trading and making a profit than others. The event also reminds us of the dangers that stablecoins and the crypto market as a whole bring with them. Stablecoins like $FDUSD are often held up as safe havens and during the periods when the rest of the crypto market is tanking. But it turns out that even assets warped by the promise of maintaining a stable value can have sharp, sudden downturns when the talk is that they’re not actually backed by anything. Conclusion: The Role of Smart Trading in Crypto Market Volatility $FDUSD’s affiliation with Wintermute is a good case study for the nature of trading in crypto. Despite the broader market conditions, trading firms and liquidity providers with the expertise to understand market dynamics can turn what seem like terrible events for the crypto industry into profitable opportunities for themselves. Not only is crypto trading becoming more sophisticated, but many of the players in the space are also becoming more sophisticated. For Wintermute, this was a delightful event to be in the middle of. The firm’s halting of the cart fell right around the 7:20 mark, and the firm’s buying of $FDUSD at that moment was at a 7% discount to its 1:1 peg with the USD. Indeed, when redeeming this quite stable stablecoin for the quite stable U.S. dollar to set up the next buying opportunity, it was all very Bayesian—after all, this is a firm run by a former head of trading at the hedge fund D.E. Shaw, whose founder is very much the poster child for a Bayesian approach to the world. Following the $FDUSD depeg event, when the dust settles, one thing becomes clear: the volatility of the cryptocurrency market, even for stablecoins, continues to create opportunities for those who are quick to act.

Since the new year dawned, SonicLabs has been locked in a jaw-dropping surge in its Total Value Locked (TVL), which should be worth a gander if we go by the figures alone. What began as a modest $27 million in January blossomed almost overnight to a staggering $1.489 billion, making Sonic one of the space’s fastest-growing players. This explosive growth is a testament to the innovation taking place within the Sonic ecosystem. It has quickly become a hub for new and diverse DeFi strategies. But it isn’t just the sheer growth in TVL that has caught the attention of the crypto community; it is also the unique features and integrations that SonicLabs has introduced, particularly its ability to integrate Bitcoin into the DeFi ecosystem. SonicLabs: A New DeFi Hub with Bitcoin at Its Core A prominent feature of the SonicLabs ecosystem is its capacity to carry Bitcoin into the realm of decentralized finance, an ability that distinguishes it from other DeFi platforms. Strategic partnerships with protocols such as Rings Protocol, Lombard Finance, and SolvProtocol have allowed SonicLabs to bring the use of Bitcoin into the world of DeFi applications, making it possible to use the flagship crypto for smart contracts and other finance-related strategies. SonicLabs ecosystem, Bitcoin presence is truly a game-changer, letting users leverage their holdings in a multitude of manners. What’s significant about this is that, as the world’s leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin has generally been less involved in DeFi, compared to assets like Ethereum or stablecoins. But by incorporating Bitcoin into the fold—and doing something with it—SonicLabs is bridging the gap between traditional and decentralized finance, letting users grow their wealth in an expanded array of options. SonicLabs has drawn a broad selection of decentralized protocols well beyond Bitcoin, and these serve a marvelous array of innovative DeFi strategies that engage users. Much like our previous chapter on Saber, this reflects a big push toward diverse assets and DeFi strategies that has really drawn attention from both developers and users in the Solana ecosystem. Users are making more and more use of the awesome opportunities presented by SonicLabs. This is reflected in the rapid rise of total value locked (TVL) in SonicLabs. Top Protocols on the SonicLabs Ecosystem SonicLabs isn’t a single project; it’s a robust ecosystem packed with all kinds of decentralized finance protocols and a near-constant flow of new services and opportunities for users, each as refreshing as the next. Some of the heavy hitters in this ecosystem include ShadowOnSonic, Pendle, Silo, Beefy Finance, Beets, and Spectra Finance—along with a Bitcoin integration that takes the Bakkt effect to a whole new level. – @ShadowOnSonic: A protocol that is mainly focused on boosting privacy and security in DeFi, ensuring that users can carry out transactions with a lot more confidentiality than is standard in the space right now. – @pendle_fi: Focuses on tokenizing yield-bearing assets. This means that they allow users to separate ownership of an asset and its yield, which opens up new possibilities and provides the kind of flexibility that might make asset management and utilization more efficient. – @SiloFinance: A platform that concentrates on offering tools for managing liquidity and for achieving capital efficiency, allowing users to get the most out of their DeFi investments. – @beefyfinance: A famous yield optimization platform that assists users in achieving maximum returns by automatically compounding their yields from several different protocols. – @beets_fi: A platform that is permissionless and decentralized, giving its users tools specifically geared toward liquidity and asset management. Its mission is simple: maximize returns for users. Beets, then, is a performance engine. Its beats march to a rhythm of 1/10 or more per second. – @spectra_finance: A protocol concentrated on delivering decentralized insurance and risk management solutions in the DeFi ecosystem. – @SwapXfi: A DEX built on SonicLabs that lets users trade assets securely, and with low fees. Every one of these protocols contributes a special angle to the SonicLabs ecosystem, permitting users to personalize their DeFi experiences to suit the unique nature of their individual wants and needs. Some ways you might consider personalizing your DeFi experience: Maxing out your yield. Ensuring your privacy. Managing your liquidity (a woodshedding opportunity for Matt). Exploring decentralized insurance. @SonicLabs has become the top hub for DeFi innovation, rapidly emerging as one of the fastest-growing blockchains. Since January, Sonic has experienced a remarkable 5,400% surge in TVL, skyrocketing from $27 million to $1.489 billion. In addition to Sonic's diverse DeFi… pic.twitter.com/F1ULQkbwYn — Bitcoin Ecosystem (@BitcoinEcoTK) April 2, 2025 SonicLabs’ Ecosystem: The Future of Bitcoin in DeFi What’s truly remarkable about SonicLabs is how it has seamlessly integrated Bitcoin into the DeFi landscape. Traditionally, Bitcoin has been seen as a store of value, with few uses in decentralized finance compared to Ethereum-based assets. But SonicLabs’ innovative approach is changing that. With Bitcoin-backed derivatives and other strategies, SonicLabs is positioning itself as a bridge between traditional finance and the rapidly growing DeFi sector. As increasing numbers of holders of Bitcoin search for ways to use their assets even in the shadow of a bearish market, SonicLabs insists that it is not “serendipity” that led the company to offer a route into decentralized finance for owners of the number-one cryptocurrency. The firm has clear reasons for not leaving Bitcoin holders behind in the quest to use their holdings without either risking the price of their assets or their principle. SonicLabs has seen its TVL grow rapidly. This is a clear indicator of the very strong demand for Bitcoin-centric DeFi solutions. At the same time, it shows a clear recognition of Sonic as a leading platform in the DeFi space. This is well deserved and not unexpected. Sonic is well on its way to becoming a key player in the future of decentralized finance, especially for Bitcoin enthusiasts. Conclusion: A DeFi Ecosystem for the Future SonicLabs’ tremendous growth results from its unique integration of Bitcoin into decentralized finance. This next chapter for DeFi brings us to a point where truly diverse and innovative strategies are both available and easily accessible to a range of users. The same goes for Bitcoin. Unlike some of its direct competitors, this blockchain accommodates a whole lot of very different strategies while still letting users keep hold of their key digital assets. That apparently has managed to pull in quite a lot of attention from a mixture of institutional and individual investors. Protocols such as @ShadowOnSonic, @pendle_fi, and @beefyfinance are already serving the diverse needs of the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem that SonicLabs is building. They—and many others in the space—are creating protocols for use over and under the SonicLabs platform. As a consequence of this use and the application of their unique token economics, SonicLabs is evolving into a Bitcoin-centric DeFi ecosystem. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

A new report from DappRadar, highlighted by Cointelegraph, reveals a shocking 27% plunge in the total value locked (TVL) within DeFi protocols. This downturn brings the DeFi TVL to $156 billion, a considerable decrease from previous highs. What are the key factors driving this market correction, and what does it mean for the future of DeFi and the broader crypto landscape? Let’s dive deep into the numbers and analyze the underlying causes. Decoding the DeFi TVL Plunge: A Shocking Downturn The headline figure of a 27% decrease in DeFi TVL is undoubtedly attention-grabbing. But to truly understand the magnitude of this shift, we need to break down the contributing factors. DappRadar’s report points to two primary catalysts for this downturn: Economic Uncertainty: The global economic climate in early 2025 played a significant role. Lingering inflation concerns, coupled with anxieties about potential recessions, likely led investors to reduce risk exposure across various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies and DeFi. This risk-off sentiment naturally translates to a decrease in the amount of capital locked in DeFi protocols. Bybit Exchange Hack: The security breach at Bybit, a major cryptocurrency exchange, further exacerbated the negative sentiment. Such incidents erode trust in the crypto space and can trigger capital flight as users become wary of potential risks associated with centralized and decentralized platforms alike. The hack likely amplified existing anxieties and contributed to the overall decrease in DeFi TVL. It’s important to remember that DeFi, while promising innovation, is still a nascent and volatile market. External economic pressures and security incidents can have a disproportionately large impact compared to more mature financial sectors. Ethereum TVL Takes a Hit: Is the King Dethroned? Ethereum TVL , traditionally dominating the DeFi landscape, was not immune to this market downturn. The report highlights a substantial 37% drop in Ethereum’s TVL, bringing it down to $96 billion. Given Ethereum’s position as the leading blockchain for DeFi applications, this decline is particularly noteworthy. Let’s consider why Ethereum experienced such a significant drop: Dominance Means Bigger Impact: As the largest DeFi ecosystem, Ethereum naturally holds the most TVL. A broad market downturn is likely to affect Ethereum more in absolute terms simply because of its size. A percentage drop on a larger base value results in a bigger numerical decrease. Layer-2 Solutions and Alt-Chains: The rise of Layer-2 scaling solutions and alternative Layer-1 blockchains might also be contributing to a shift in TVL away from Ethereum. While Ethereum still hosts the majority of DeFi activity, platforms like Arbitrum, Optimism, Solana, and others are gaining traction, potentially drawing some liquidity away from the main Ethereum chain. Market Sentiment Impact: Negative news, like the Bybit hack and broader economic concerns, can disproportionately affect market leaders like Ethereum. Investors might perceive higher risk in holding assets within the largest ecosystem during times of uncertainty, leading to withdrawals and reduced TVL. Despite the 37% drop, Ethereum still commands the lion’s share of the DeFi market. However, the decline raises questions about the evolving competitive landscape and whether alternative blockchains are starting to meaningfully challenge Ethereum’s dominance in the long run. Market Downturn: How Did Other Blockchains Fare? The DappRadar report provides a snapshot of how the top 10 blockchains by TVL performed during this period of market downturn . While Ethereum experienced a significant decrease, other prominent blockchains also felt the pinch. Let’s examine some key highlights: Blockchain TVL Change (Q1 2025) Key Observations Ethereum (ETH) -37% Largest absolute drop in TVL, but still dominates the market. Sui (SUI) -44% Sharpest percentage decline among the top 10, indicating potentially higher volatility or project-specific factors. Solana (SOL) Over -30% Significant reduction, reflecting broader market trends impacting even high-growth blockchains. Tron (TRX) Over -30% Similar to Solana, indicating widespread impact across various ecosystems. Arbitrum (ARB) Over -30% Layer-2 solutions are also susceptible to market-wide corrections, despite their scaling advantages. As the table illustrates, the negative trend was widespread. Sui (SUI) experienced the most dramatic fall, plummeting 44%. This could be attributed to various factors, including its relatively newer status, potentially higher speculative interest, and sensitivity to market volatility. Solana (SOL), Tron (TRX), and Arbitrum (ARB) all recorded TVL reductions exceeding 30%, demonstrating that even blockchains known for their robust ecosystems and growing adoption were not immune to the prevailing negative market sentiment. Decentralized Finance: Navigating Uncertainty and Looking Ahead The 27% DeFi TVL plunge in Q1 2025 serves as a stark reminder of the inherent volatility and risks within the cryptocurrency market. While the numbers may seem concerning, it’s crucial to maintain perspective. Market corrections are a natural part of any economic cycle, and the DeFi sector is no exception. Here are some key takeaways and points to consider moving forward: Market Cycles are Normal: The crypto market, including DeFi, is known for its boom and bust cycles. Downturns, while painful, are often followed by periods of recovery and renewed growth. This correction could be a healthy reset, allowing the market to consolidate and build a more sustainable foundation. Focus on Fundamentals: During market downturns, it’s essential to focus on the fundamental value and long-term potential of DeFi projects. Projects with strong use cases, robust technology, and dedicated communities are more likely to weather the storm and emerge stronger. Innovation Continues: Despite the TVL decrease, innovation in DeFi continues unabated. Developers are still building new protocols, exploring novel use cases, and addressing existing challenges like scalability and security. These advancements are crucial for the long-term growth and maturation of the DeFi space. Opportunity for Strategic Investors: Market corrections can present opportunities for strategic investors to enter the market or increase their positions in promising projects at more favorable valuations. For those with a long-term outlook, downturns can be periods of accumulation and strategic positioning. The DeFi sector is still in its early stages of development. While the Q1 2025 TVL plunge is a significant event, it doesn’t negate the transformative potential of decentralized finance. Navigating periods of uncertainty requires resilience, a focus on fundamentals, and a long-term vision. The future of DeFi will likely be shaped by how the industry responds to these challenges and continues to innovate and adapt. Conclusion: DeFi’s Resilience in the Face of Market Correction The 27% drop in DeFi TVL during the first quarter of 2025 is a significant event, highlighting the impact of economic uncertainty and security breaches on the decentralized finance sector. While Ethereum, Sui, Solana, Tron, and Arbitrum all experienced substantial declines, this market correction should be viewed as a part of the broader crypto market cycle. The underlying innovation and potential of DeFi remain strong. Moving forward, a focus on robust fundamentals, continued development, and strategic investment will be crucial for navigating market volatility and unlocking the long-term promise of decentralized finance. The DeFi journey is far from over; it’s simply entering a new phase of resilience and maturation.

Sun accused First Digital Trust (FDT), the issuer of the stablecoin $FDUSD, of fraud, alleging that the company had misappropriated a staggering $456 million in funds related to its management of the reserves backing a different stablecoin, $TUSD. This accusation went over like a lead balloon. The price of $FDUSD started crashing, dropping to nearly $0.87 before slowly climbing back up. The depegging of this token, used for all sorts of applications and trading on the exchange Binance, was a major event and led to a significant loss of trust in the crypto community. The Flash Crash: How $FDUSD Depegged and Rebounded Initial fallout from Sun’s accusations was swift and severe. The claims of insolvency, as they surfaced in the next few days, sent panic sellers into the market, and the price of $FDUSD fell well below its usual $1 peg. On Binance, the digital asset dropped as low as $0.87 and, according to some reports, dipped to $0.76 when compared to USDC. The stablecoin’s sudden depeg sent shockwaves through the platform and across the wide range of users affected by the digital assets built on top of it, especially those in the Launchpool. The situation turned, however, when Binance co-founder Yi He, also known as @heyibinance, stepped in to address the concerns. He clarified that the matter causing the depeg wasn’t about reserves related to $FDUSD but rather about a legal dispute concerning $TUSD. Yi He explained that the allegations about mismanagement had to do with FDT mismanaging the reserves of $TUSD, and not with any issues pertaining to $FDUSD itself. With this clarification, the market seemed to calm down, and the price of $FDUSD made a rebound to $0.987, nearly back to its usual pegged value. Justin Sun Accuses FDT (the issuer of $FDUSD ) of a $456M Fraud, $FDUSD Briefly Depegs What Happened? Late on April 2, Tron founder @justinsuntron accused First Digital Trust (FDT), the issuer of $FDUSD , of insolvency, claiming it could not fulfill customer redemptions.… pic.twitter.com/UAsJmQlxAe — Followin (@followin_io) April 3, 2025 Even with the recovery in prices, the market’s confidence was severely shaken and it was already too late to remedy the situation. That left mom-and-pop investors — along with users of the FDUSD stablecoin — in a state of frustration and distrust when it came to their alleged safe havens in the crypto world, particularly because the communication from Binance had been so muddled and delayed. In the days following the panic crash, many associated with the crypto world speculated that the clear lack of immediate transparency had allowed insiders or whales to buy up FDUSD at a severely discounted price. The Dispute and Allegations: Justin Sun’s Accusations Against FDT The dispute started when Justin Sun took to Twitter to say that the firm behind $TUSD was not just mismanaging the stablecoin, but wasn’t being honest about its finances, either. Sun said FDT had $456 million in reserves that it had turned into a risky bond portfolio. And he said that was making $TUSD somewhat unstable. Sun is, of course, a major actor in the cryptocurrency space. And it appears that his accusation has somehow made it to federal prosecutors. The disagreement is mainly about the allegation that FDT mishandled funds related to $TUSD—another stablecoin. It’s said that FDT wasn’t able to manage $TUSD correctly and that left the company in a position where it couldn’t fulfill customer redemption requests. When customers were trying to get their $FDUSD back, the company couldn’t honor that request, and that triggered a sort of run on the bank, where people started panic selling their $FDUSD. That was the first depeg-day for $FDUSD. And it was said that FDT was in a state of insolvency. To counter the accusations, FDT took to Twitter Spaces to set the record straight. The company insisted that it had done nothing wrong and that $FDUSD was sound, underpinned 1:1 by dollars and not by some suspicious blend of crypto and cash, as had happened with $TUSD. The public remained too riled and skeptical for the reassurance to land, and many began to doubt both FDT and Binance. Retail Investors and the Fallout The treatment of retail investors is one of the main flashpoints in the $FDUSD saga. Following the $FDUSD flash crash, it became clear that many traders and users feel strongly that Binance dropped the ball on timely communication. After all, when prices are crashing, the last thing people want is to be left in the dark about what is going on in the market. There is now a good deal of suspicion that the price crash may have been used as an opportunistic buying moment for either whales or institutional investors, who were then benefited by the subsequent price recovery. The event has brought up some real worries about how transparent and accountable the big exchanges, like Binance, are, especially at times of crisis. As we get more details about the legal skirmish between FDT and Justin Sun, we’re also starting to ask some very serious questions about the integrity of the stablecoin ecosystem. And with the entire crypto market still reeling from previous stablecoin crises, this incident has once again tested our trust as investors and the industry’s trust overall. Even though the price of $FDUSD has recovered to about $0.98, the incident’s aftermath is not over. The investors are now questioning the coin’s stability and First Digital Trust’s future. The court proceedings look set to keep $FDUSD’s conversation as its main ongoing narrative. Until more clarity is achieved, the coin’s market participants will not get off the edge of their seats. Conclusion: A Trust Test for the Crypto Market The situation with $FDUSD on April 2 has shown that trust in the cryptocurrency market, especially around stablecoins, is very tenuous. Much turbulence in the $FDUSD market has been created by the accusations against FDT made by Justin Sun and by the panic-selling that has followed. Yet, the fact that the price of $FDUSD has recently started to recover once again points to the inherent strengths of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Nonetheless, the market behavior that we have recently witnessed with $FDUSD raises serious concerns about a lack of transparency and effective communication in the cryptocurrency market. The stablecoin market is likely to face lasting fallout from the ongoing lawsuit and additional probes into FDT’s management of the $TUSD reserves. As the stock of Terra Luna waits to see whether it will rebound or keep falling, one certainty has emerged: in the crypto space, where everything seems on the verge of blowing up, trust is the single most important quality a project can possess. And any project in the stablecoin space has to be especially trustworthy, because the very essence of a stablecoin is that it is a safe harbor for a trusted cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP had their moment earlier this week, rallying before tumbling as global markets reacted to U.S. tariff news . It’s been a wild ride for traders, but with interest rate cuts on the horizon next year, there’s still hope for a rebound. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s dominance sits at 62.01% and could climb even higher as the market finds its footing. #Trump 's announcement of reciprocal tariff measures, traders in the interest rate futures #market continue to bet that the Federal Reserve will cut rates as early as June. Futures pricing reflecting nearly a 50% probability of the #Fed cutting rates four times this year. pic.twitter.com/2P78zPDhje — PBFX Global (@PbfxGlobal) April 4, 2025 Why Are Rate Cuts Important for Crypto? The Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates four times in 2025, with small 0.25% cuts planned in June, July, September, and December. Lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper, which often pushes more money into riskier assets like crypto. Historically, Bitcoin has performed well when rates drop, as a weaker U.S. dollar makes it more attractive as a hedge against inflation. Big Money Moves: What Are Investors Doing? Ahead of recent economic developments, large crypto holders moved significant amounts of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP onto exchanges. When investors send assets to exchanges, it usually signals they’re preparing to sell. Data shows that Bitcoin saw a sudden spike in transactions, with 2,500 BTC moved in a single block after Donald Trump’s tariff speech. Meanwhile, Ethereum deposits jumped to 80,000 ETH in an hour, and XRP transfers to Binance skyrocketed to 130 million—way up from the usual 10 million per hour. This flood of sell orders came at a time of economic uncertainty, as traders decided to take profits and reduce their risk. However, the big question is whether the selling pressure is over or if another move is coming. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto News Today 4th April : Trump Tarrif, Ripple XRP News, Fed Rate Decision, Ethereum News , Will Crypto Prices Bounce Back? Now, attention is turning to the U.S. non-farm payroll report, which will provide fresh data on the job market. If the report shows signs of economic slowdown, the Fed could be pressured to cut rates even sooner. A weaker economy usually leads to more accommodative policies, which benefit Bitcoin and other cryptos. So far, things are looking more stable. By Friday morning, Bitcoin held above $83,100, Ethereum climbed back over $1,800, and XRP, Solana, and Cardano posted modest gains of around 2%. With selling pressure easing and markets adjusting to the idea of rate cuts, some analysts believe a short-term bounce is likely. If economic data supports the case for easier monetary policy, crypto could be in for a recovery sooner rather than later. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

A successful push above $2.20 on the daily chart could signal a continuation of the bullish trend in the weeks to come. 4-Hour and 1-Hour Analysis: Immediate Breakout Potential The 4-hour chart shows a bullish pennant formation, indicating a period of consolidation before a potential breakout. The key levels to watch are support at $2.15 and resistance at $2.38. If XRP breaks above $2.38, the price could rise significantly, potentially targeting $4.20 in the medium term. On the 1-hour chart, XRP has shown strong bullish momentum. The recent bounce off $2.05 and subsequent rise to $2.36 signals positive price action.

Bitcoin Volatility Drops Sharply to 2.68% – Market Enters a Calm Phase? According to @coinglass_com data on April 3, Bitcoin’s volatility has dropped significantly to 2.68%, down from 3.47% on March 30. What does this mean? -Lower volatility often signals a decline in… pic.twitter.com/t06Vv9LK7w — Followin (@followin_io) April 3, 2025 Understanding the Implications of Reduced Bitcoin Volatility Defining Bitcoin’s Price Movement with Volatility. For a long time, Bitcoin’s price movements have been very volatile. Over the years, the reputation that Bitcoin has earned is that it is a very volatile asset to hold. It frequently undergoes sharp swings—that’s the nice way to put it—that create both chances and dangers for investors. It creates both opportunities and risks for investors. Periods of heightened volatility are typically associated with speculation, retail FOMO, and external factors like macroeconomic data or shifts in market sentiment. The recent decrease in volatility appears to represent a shift in market dynamics. When volatility drops, it often indicates that speculative trading and retail-driven enthusiasm have slowed down. This can also mean that the market has entered a consolidation phase, where Bitcoin’s price stabilizes and fluctuates within a narrower range. In these periods, market participants may adopt a more cautious, long-term approach; and this may lead to less buying and selling activity that resembles the frenzied trading of the near past. The lessening of volatility could be taken to suggest that Bitcoin is leaving behind the wild swings of price that define periods of extreme speculation—for instance, 2017 and late 2020 to early 2021. A period of calm, in which price accumulation favors bulls, might be at hand. Not that any of this is a sure thing: Investors are as much in control of Bitcoin’s next phase as they were of its last phase. One thing may be sure, though: The period in whose midst we now find ourselves can hardly be thought to favor bears. The Role of Macroeconomic Factors in Bitcoin’s Price Stability Bitcoin’s volatility has mainly been driven by its sensitivity to major macroeconomic changes. Inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical events can all cause the price of Bitcoin to change significantly, in one direction or another. But it’s not only direct changes to the economy that can move Bitcoin’s price; we’re just as likely to be influenced by what happens in the traditional financial markets, which in turn have a big effect on investor sentiment. And when there’s a big shift in the traditional financial markets, the cryptocurrency space is affected, too. For instance, when inflation is on the increase or interest rates are expected to go up, investors might turn to Bitcoin as a safety harbor against the usual kinds of investment-pop risks, like plummeting stock prices. By contrast, when the economic picture normalizes, or when ordinary inflation expectations return to the kinds of ranges they usually hang out in, Bitcoin’s price might settle into a more stable range. In the past few weeks, some of our key external factor indicators have been showing signs of stabilization, and this might be the reason Bitcoin’s volatility has been reduced. The price of Bitcoin tends to climb when investors look for substitutes to conventional assets such as stocks or bonds, especially during periods of economic uncertainty. Yet, when those uncertain conditions ease up, Bitcoin’s volatility may well drop, too. And it could be that the overall financial landscape has stabilized recently, which would make for fewer external risk factors pushing investors in the direction of Bitcoin and thus for Bitcoin’s price to make fewer waves. Is Bitcoin Entering a Period of Accumulation or a New Breakout? Bitcoin’s volatility has dropped to 2.68%, leaving those who participate in the market wondering about its future. One question often posed is whether we are now in an accumulation phase of reduced volatility, during which HODLers are amassing yet more coins, or whether Bitcoin is gearing up for another dissolution of the same kind of order it just dissolved itself into. In the past, times of low price swings have always been followed by sharp moves in the other direction. A bit of compression of Bitcoin’s recent price range might be a sign of the calm before a new storm—either a big rally or a big bust, and busts can sometimes be just as big as big rallies. Low volatility typically leads to a rise in implied volatility and a rise in the price of options, which is exactly what we are seeing in the Bitcoin market today. Conversely, Bitcoin’s recent price stabilization could be a sign of an accretion period, in which long-term investors steadily build positions without being driven by the all-too-common relentless short-term price action. Accretion phases tend to look like this: Bitcoin’s price moves within a narrower range, and investor sentiment is peaceful and relatively impartial. Everybody’s just waiting for the next big thing. What’s the next big thing? Nobody knows. But whatever it is, the wait looks like it could be some time. The current consolidation phase of Bitcoin could draw the market’s attention for a variety of reasons. One is the upcoming economic data that are about to be released. How will the figures affect the in-progress shifts in global sentiment that seem to be happening? The broader cryptocurrency market performance also fits into this conversation. If it performs well, can we expect Bitcoin to keep on keeping on with its consolidation? Of course, there’s the inverse side to all of this, for which none of us would want to be caught on camera as half-investor, half-sportscaster when this is the framework we’re working with. A Calm Before the Storm? Although predicting the exact path of Bitcoin in the next few weeks is hard, the present low volatility might lull speculative traders into a false sense of security. History has often shown that quiet periods in Bitcoin’s price movements can be precursors to more dynamic phases. So, will Bitcoin surprise us next by breaking to the upside or downside? Only time will tell. The essential aspect for investors to deal with this phase will be to stay abreast of both the wider economic environment and the conditions that are developing within the cryptocurrency market itself. This is a pretty general piece of advice, but it is particularly relevant now. While there has been some decrease in volatility, Bitcoin may still be an asset class that is just one benign or malevolent news cycle away from making a serious move—in either direction. At the moment, Bitcoin’s price movements are calm, and this affords traders a chance to reassess their positions in the market. Long-term investors can also use this time to accumulate more Bitcoin without the immediate pressure of dealing with sharp price fluctuations. And yet, the current state of affairs raises a couple of interesting questions: Is this the calm before some kind of storm? Or is it the calm after the storm that was Bitcoin’s price chopping back and forth between $30,000 and $40,000 for most of 2023 so far? Conclusion A recent dip in Bitcoin’s volatility to 2.68% indicates a shift in market conditions and the potential for a phase of consolidation. Traders and investors tend to think of lower volatility as meaning the market is moving toward a phase of reduced speculative activity. There’s often a pretty close association between lower volatility and what some might call a “death spiral” for Bitcoin. But the recent dip in Bitcoin’s volatility might also be the calm before a major price breakout. It might just be a better market condition for traders of all types.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum and most of the market closed March in red and April opened with a tariff war which crashed prices this week. ETH fell by 8% and made a new low against Bitcoin as well. The sentiment is bearish, and the price also made a lower low, falling under $1,800. This was a key support that has now turned into resistance. With buyers on the defensive, they will likely retreat to $1,600, which will be the next support level now. Looking ahead, Ethereum’s downtrend appears to be intensifying. Worse, it closed the past four monthly candles in red since December 2024. This puts this cryptocurrency in a bear market and we do not know where the price will bottom. Chart by TradingView Ripple ( XRP ) XRP closed the week with a 10% loss, being unable to face the sell pressure from the overall market. Nevertheless, somehow, buyers were still able to keep the price above the $2 support. This resilience is impressive considering major altcoins like ETH and SOL have made lower lows in the past few months. This gives hope, but it is also a big concern. If this key support falls, then XRP could quickly go to $1.6 next. Looking ahead, XRP is back at a key level that will be decisive for its price action in the weeks to come. Failure to hold at $2 will likely turn that level into key resistance as bears take over. Keep a close eye out for any weakness here. Chart by TradingView Cardano (ADA) ADA is in a similar boat to XRP and fell by 11% this week. The key support at $0.64 continues to hold at the time of this post, but appears fragile. A breakdown at any point will see the price rush towards $0.5 next. The momentum is bearish, and the key support will likely be unable to hold another push from sellers. This can happen at any moment. Until then, watch the key level at $0.64 as it will determine where ADA goes from here. Looking ahead, Cardano’s downtrend remains intact, and new lows will likely become the longer buyers remain absent from the order book. The daily buy volume is also making lower highs, which encourages sellers to return. Chart by TradingView Solana (SOL) Solana is starting to follow on the footsteps of Ethereum with two consecutive monthly candles closed in red now (February and March). This is the first major bearish signal since 2022 when this last happened and a bear market followed. Worse yet, SOL fell by 14% this week and lost the key support at $118, which is now resistance. If nothing changes, this downtrend may take Solana to $100, the next major support level. Looking ahead, this cryptocurrency is dangerously close to losing a three-digit price. A drop below $100 would be a major blow to any bullish hopes for Solana. Until that happens, buyers still have a shot at defending the price. Chart by TradingView Shiba Inu (SHIB) With memes losing their appeal, the market pushed them into a major discount. SHIB is no different and fell by 11% this week, bringing it closer to the support at $0.000010. In the past, the current support was a key pivot level where SHIB bounced and began a recovery. If buyers return there, SHIB could enter a relief rally. However, if the overall market remains bearish, it could be short-lived. Looking ahead, SHIB’s price action is characteristic of a downtrend with clear lower lows and lower highs. Until that changes, the bias remains bearish.

This estimate comes from Volmex's one-day implied volatility index (IV) for SOL. At press time, the index showed a one-day reading annualized at 109.70%, indicating an expected 24-hour price volatility of 5.74%. (The daily figure is derived by dividing the annualized volatility by the square root of 365, the number of trading days in a year.) A movement that size represents moderate volatility, especially considering that the cryptocurrency has experienced several days of 6% or higher volatility since early March, according to data from CoinDesk. In other words, the market is likely to be volatile, but nothing out of the ordinary. Whale selling Data tracked by blockchain sleuth Lookonchain shows several whales unstaked and dumped SOL worth $46.3 million into the market. Large offloading of coins by whales often leads to bearish price action. However, the amount sold early today equates to 0.97% of the cryptocurrency's 24-hour trading volume of $4.7 billion. So, it's no surprise that SOL is trading little changed at around $116, having printed a low of $112 on Thursday. Broadly speaking, the cryptocurrency has been in a downtrend since reaching a high of $295 on Jan. 19. Focus on payrolls The U.S. jobs data, scheduled for release at 12:30 GMT, is forecast to reveal that the economy added 130,000 jobs in March, slowdown from February's 151,000 and well below the 12-month average of 162,300, according to FactSet . The median estimate for the jobless rate for March is is 4.2%, the highest since November and up from February's 4.1% reading. Average hourly earnings are forecast to have risen 0.3% month-on-month, matching February's pace. A weaker-than-expected figure will likely validate renewed pricing for four 25-basis-point interest-rate cuts this year, potentially sending risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, higher.",Markets|Solana|SOL|Markets,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-04 07:44:09

The world of meme coins is buzzing, and one name is dominating the conversation— Arctic Pablo Coin (APC). While Celestia and Terra Classic have made notable moves in the market, Arctic Pablo Coin is currently stealing the spotlight with its innovative presale and soaring momentum. Celestia recently made headlines with its expansion in modular blockchain infrastructure, while Terra Classic saw a price resurgence following key governance proposals. But right now, all eyes are on Arctic Pablo Coin, which has entered Glacial Glade—its 17th phase—with an entry price of just $0.000087. This article will cover the latest developments of all three coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, Celestia, and Terra Classic. Arctic Pablo Coin: Deflationary Model Strengthens Investor Confidence Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC), the best crypto to invest in, is setting itself apart with an aggressive token burn mechanism designed to enhance scarcity and drive long-term value. Each week during the presale, unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation, significantly reducing supply. Once the presale concludes, any remaining tokens will also be burned, ensuring a deflationary supply model that benefits investors. Built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), every burn transaction is transparent and verifiable. This scarcity-driven approach positions Arctic Pablo Coin as a high-value opportunity for investors seeking long-term gains. With the current price at $0.000087, the time to secure APC at this low entry point is running out fast. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale: A Race Against Time The Arctic Pablo meme coin presale is unlike any other. Instead of traditional stages, it follows a dynamic journey model—advancing through various locations as demand surges. Right now, the project is in Glacial Glade, the 17th phase of its adventure, with each phase bringing an inevitable price increase. At present, 1 APC is available for just $0.000087, but with a listing price of $0.008, early investors are looking at an ROI potential of over 9,084.48%. Momentum is building rapidly, with over $2 million already raised. As Arctic Pablo progresses to new locations, the price will rise—making Glacial Glade one of the last chances to enter before it skyrockets. With demand surging, missing this opportunity could mean watching from the sidelines as others capitalize on the growth. Earn Big with Staking and Referral Rewards Investors in Arctic Pablo Coin aren’t just looking at price appreciation—they’re also earning passive income. The project offers an impressive 66% APY during the presale, allowing token holders to stake their APC and generate rewards. Additionally, Arctic Pablo features an enticing referral program: share the project with others and earn lucrative incentives. Community engagement is another pillar of this ecosystem, with regular competitions that reward participants in APC tokens or USD. These incentives create a thriving investor community, further propelling Arctic Pablo Coin’s rise as the best crypto to invest in today. Celestia’s Expansion Fuels Market Excitement Celestia has made significant strides with its modular blockchain technology, attracting major developer interest. Recently, the project announced a strategic partnership aimed at improving data availability solutions, further solidifying its role as a pioneer in blockchain scalability. As modular blockchains gain traction, Celestia continues to position itself as a leader in this niche market. Terra Classic Gains Momentum with Governance Updates Terra Classic (LUNC) is experiencing renewed interest following a series of governance proposals that aim to enhance network utility. A recent community vote led to the approval of key ecosystem upgrades, sparking optimism among LUNC holders. As the project moves forward with its revival efforts, Terra Classic remains a significant player in the broader crypto landscape. The Verdict: Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Charge With Arctic Pablo Coin ’s presale surging in Glacial Glade and an ROI potential that’s turning heads, it stands out as the best crypto to invest in right now. While Celestia and Terra Classic continue to build within their respective niches, Arctic Pablo Coin presents an unmissable opportunity with its deflationary token model, high staking rewards, and location-based presale that keeps demand soaring. As the presale progresses and prices climb, the window to invest at this low price is closing fast. Don’t be left behind—secure your Arctic Pablo Coin today and ride the wave before it takes off!

This time, however, the most attention was not only on these meme-styled assets but also on some of their more traditional sector cousins. To be sure, AI, more utility-driven tokens, and Bitcoin itself held relevance this past week; however, the two that captured most of the attention during this week were Dogecoin and Shiba Inu—each having its own unique, and largely unimpeachable, reason for loving them. Trends from March 28th to April 2nd Insight: Memecoins are currently driving more attention, they are the dominant trend. They were consistent every single day AI, utility tokens, and Bitcoin still remain relevant There are still interest in fundamental crypto technologies… pic.twitter.com/rCKW6eISbB — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) April 2, 2025 Memecoins: The Dominant Trend in the Market The most prominent trend over the past week has been the supremacy of memecoins in the market. These tokens, typically propelled by community excitement and social media hype, have unfailingly drawn notice and business every single day from March 28 to April 2. The astounding amount of trading and the heightened activity in this sector underscore the growing fascination, especially with memecoins like $BONK, $WOULD, and #TITCOIN, which have exhibited ample net inflows during this time. The crypto landscape has seen the entry of memecoins, and while they don’t seem to carry the fundamental utility of more established cryptocurrencies, they offer the speculative opportunity for some short-term gains. The last week has seen these gain-train tokens gain some substantial inflows that are now being referred to as the entry of the smart money into the memecoin market. What does that tell us? Well, if we step back and assess the current situation involving both the price trends and the investors behind the price action, the smart money entry is certainly encouraging for the memecoin market. Smart Money Activity: $BONK and $WOULD Lead the Way During this time, one of the outstanding performers in the memecoin market has been $BONK. With substantial inflows, $BONK has captured the attention of smart money investors. The crisp confidence in $BONK is a clear sign that institutional investors see potential in this token, whether due to its community-led growth or its ability to get the people going again on social media. The strong inflows in $BONK aren’t just showing retail interest but also reflecting some serious institutional activity, which suggests that smart money believes this token is not done growing yet. Tokens such as $WOULD and #TITCOIN are also recording strong inflows, pointing to a rapidly increasing momentum and interest from investors. They are clearly part of a larger move into fun tokens like these and $DOGE by investors looking for new sources of return. That these inflows are happening at a time when not only are these tokens being embraced by users, but also by various meme-seeking, social media platforms, speaks in a big way to the reevaluation of meme tokens as a whole. It says to me that in the world of tokens, just being a fun one to hold could be a path to capital appreciation. Lower Interest in Some Memecoins: $ORE and $ALCH Attracting enormous interest, memecoins like $BONK, $WOULD, and #TITCOIN are not however, seeing a sustained level of activity. Their status and allure are far from stable. What is stable; however, is the fact that tokens such as $ORE and $ALCH are hovering at around a 0% net flow level of just under $20,000 and indicating a bear market for those tokens. Their communities or use cases have not reached prime time. Smart money has decided to stay away. Memecoins smart money are buying and their netflow for today Insights: Strong inflows into $BONK which means significant smart money confidence and activity #TITCOIN and $WOULD are seeing healthy inflows, indicating positive momentum. $ORE and $ALCH have relatively small net… pic.twitter.com/fPkl5Hn1kD — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) April 2, 2025 For investors, inflow volume is an important signal that highlights which tokens are drawing the attention of more strategic, long-term investors and which are not. Memecoins with lower net flows could face a tougher road ahead in gaining traction since persistent market demand usually requires at least some token utility and since these tokens do not seem to generate anywhere near the same level of community engagement or market buzz as their more successful counterparts. Growing Interest in Tokens with Moderate Market Caps Another fascinating trend is the moderate market capitalization of tokens such as $GHIBLI and $W. Even though these tokens have relatively minor market caps when stacked next to more established players, they are seeing some nice net flows. This suggests that while they may not yet have the mainstream recognition or backing of larger projects, there is certainly growing interest in these tokens—interest that seems to be driven by their developing communities and/or unique value propositions. Moderate market cap tokens such as $GHIBLI and $W frequently attract early-stage investors who are willing to take a chance on them before they reach a broader market. For these investors, who increasingly are being referred to as “smart money,” these coins represent an opportunity to get in on projects that, while not widely known, could explode in value as their networks grow. The Role of Fundamental Cryptos Although memecoins rule the short-term landscape, fundamental cryptos, like AI tokens, utility-based assets, and Bitcoin, are still holding their ground. These sectors haven’t seen anywhere near the same level of explosive activity as the memecoin market, but they remain an important piece of the crypto ecosystem. Investors are still watching these assets, particularly those types with longer-term value propositions. For example, projects driven by AI and their associated utility tokens are set to offer long-term value, unlike most of the other crypto projects out there today. They solve real-world problems and are likely to form the backbone of the next generation of decentralized applications. Bitcoin is another story. Its price might be well below its all-time high, but it seems more entrenched than ever as a store of value and a hedge against inflation, especially in the current environment of macroeconomic uncertainty. Conclusion: A Mixed Crypto Landscape To conclude, the period spanning March 28 to April 2 saw an unmistakable surge in interest in memecoins, with intelligent investors diverting their resources into tokens such as $BONK, $WOULD, and #TITCOIN. It was almost surreal to see the amount of capital pouring into these tokens, which underscored just how speculative this part of the crypto market has become. We’ve said it before, and we’ll say it again: if you’re trading these sorts of assets, you’re doing it for the memes, not for any fundamental reason. Currently, while most of the market’s attention is on memecoins, a steady undercurrent of investor interest remains in the fundamental technologies that underlie much of crypto. Bitcoin, along with AI and utility tokens, is still seen as an integral part of the crypto ecosystem; many investors still see long-term value in them as revolutionizers of industry. For people in the crypto world, the secret will be to manage the rush of short-lived profits from memecoins with the steady, long-term wealth that comes from sound, fundamental technological investments. As the whole enterprise keeps developing, it will be ever more important for players to understand these movements and make them part of any decision-making process.

The new contracts , pending regulatory approval, are expected to be available to institutional and retail traders on April 21, 2025, offering a regulated option for investors seeking exposure to one of the most liquid digital assets. We're excited to announce that Coinbase Derivatives has filed with the CFTC to self-certify $XRP futures – bringing a regulated, capital-efficient way to gain exposure to one of the most liquid digital assets. We anticipate the contract going live on April 21, 2025. Stay tuned… pic.twitter.com/nKUPjjnMKW — Coinbase Institutional 🛡️ (@CoinbaseInsto) April 3, 2025 The filing significantly develops XRP’s broader market acceptance, especially in regulated environments where futures contracts provide risk management opportunities. Coinbase and Kraken expand XRP access amid regulatory hurdles Self-certification enables Coinbase Derivatives to launch XRP futures contracts without direct approval by the CFTC as long as the contracts align with existing regulatory frameworks. Such a strategy is typically used by U.S.-regulated exchanges when introducing new futures products. The introduction of XRP futures on a regulated platform will likely improve market liquidity and provide investors with a capital-efficient way to hedge positions or take directional bets on the direction of XRP. Such an event might drive higher-level investor interest in XRP. Futures contracts are useful for hedging or speculation, and they can make XRP more accessible to new investors. Concurrently, one of the largest US-based crypto exchanges, Kraken, incorporated Ripple USD (RLUSD) among cryptocurrencies traded on the platform. Before that list, RLUSD was available only on Bitstamp exchange. The integration of Kraken into the list of XRP trading platforms increases trading volume in the asset and deepens the pool of institutional actors interacting with the asset. The Coinbase announcement comes as the community braces for the SEC’s response to the XRP settlement. The asset has remained a strong market presence, ranking as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Tether (USDT) by market capitalization. Prediction markets signal XRP volatility, with majority betting on a break above $3 by 2025 According to a prediction market on the betting platform Kalshi , XRP has a 48% chance of breaking its $3.40 all-time high in 2025 and trading at $4. Traders also give XRP a 35% chance of breaking the $3.50 barrier. While long-term sentiment around the coin has been optimistic, XRP has come under pressure in the short term. After a 500% jump in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election and Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, the token has fallen about 36% in value since then. Now, XRP is trading at about $2—nearly 9% lower in the past 24 hours and about 16% down in the last 30 days, as per the data by CoinGecko. The sentiment based on the short term is cautious. On the betting site Polymarket, traders see only a 1% chance that XRP will be priced above $2.30 by Friday. On the same platform, traders are placing only a 3% probability that the token will hit a new all-time high this month, though 40% of them think it will close the month higher than at the start. Even in the longer term, Polymarket gamblers assign XRP a 7% probability of hitting a new all-time high before July and 29% before the end of 2025. On the downside, Kalshi traders see an 80% chance that XRP will fall below $2 at some point this year, a sign of continuing market uncertainty. Coinbase sparks controversy and institutional interest with XRP futures filing Amid this volatile outlook, Coinbase Derivatives’ recent filing with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to launch XRP futures has made headlines—and stirred debate within the crypto community. The controversy started with Coinbase’s use of the term “Ripple futures” in a now-deleted tweet to describe the product. This has caused backlash from XRP holders, who have drawn attention to the confusion between the private company Ripple, which controls the XRP Ledger, and the token itself. A user named Adam on X was able to differentiate the two and wrote to Coinbase asking them to edit the terms. In his response, he stressed that one should differentiate between Ripple and XRP by stating that “Ripple is a private company while XRP is its digital asset,” he said. Coinbase immediately amended the error and confirmed that it is actually offering XRP futures. Coinbase’s filing isn’t the only sign of increasing institutional appetite for XRP derivatives. In fact, just last month, the Crypto Options and Futures Exchange Bitnomial expressed its intention to create XRP futures contracts. The product has reportedly been in development since October 2024.

Whether you’re envisioning fantastical creatures or realistic scenes, V7 shows the potential to bring your ideas to life with remarkable fidelity. Example Prompts and Initial Outcomes: Prompt Observation “A dragon with a spiky tail.” V7 successfully generated a dragon image that closely matched the description, capturing the spiky tail detail effectively. “A Ghibli-style character.” The model produced an image that clearly evoked the aesthetic of Studio Ghibli, demonstrating its stylistic versatility. These are just brief glimpses, but they hint at the power and flexibility of this new AI art model. As testing continues, we can expect to uncover even more about its strengths and nuances. Midjourney V7: What’s Still to Come? While V7 is already packed with features, Midjourney isn’t resting on its laurels. CEO David Holz has indicated that several capabilities are still in the pipeline and will be rolled out in the near future, potentially within the next two months. These include: Image Upscaling: Enhance the resolution and detail of your generated images even further. Retexturing: Apply new textures to existing images, opening up creative possibilities for image manipulation and style transfer. Midjourney emphasizes that V7 is a “totally new model with unique strengths and probably a few weaknesses.” They are actively seeking community feedback to understand its capabilities fully and refine it further. This collaborative approach ensures that V7 evolves to meet the needs and creative aspirations of its users.

The XRP futures contract is expected to go live on April 21, 2025, pending regulatory clearance. Coinbase’s Latest Offering “We’re excited to announce that Coinbase Derivatives has filed with the CFTC to self-certify XRP futures,” the company said in a statement . The move aims to provide a regulated, capital-efficient way for traders to gain exposure to XRP, which remains one of the most liquid digital assets on the market. More details on the product’s availability and rollout will be revealed soon. Coinbase has been actively growing its derivatives offerings, with the recent launch of its future contracts for Solana (SOL) and Hedera (HBAR). Additionally, the exchange has also filed with the CFTC for approval to launch Cardano (ADA) and Natural Gas (NGS) futures. If approved, the ADA futures would allow traders to speculate on its price movements without holding the asset, while the NGS product would mark Coinbase’s entry into the energy derivatives sector. The company expects to roll out both before the end of April, subject to CFTC approval. Positive Developments in the XRP Ecosystem Coinbase’s push to introduce XRP derivatives coincides with major legal developments in the Ripple ecosystem. The long-running lawsuit between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which began in 2020, has recently concluded . The financial watchdog had alleged that Ripple sold its native token as an unregistered security. The company’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, announced in March that the agency has opted to drop its appeal, although an official statement from the SEC is still pending. As part of the settlement, Ripple agreed to withdraw its cross-appeal and pay a $50 million fine, significantly lower than the original $125 million penalty. The resolution reignited optimism in the XRP community, which had waited nearly four years for legal clarity. Industry experts believe this legal outcome could pave the way for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. Several asset managers, including Bitwise, Canary Capital, 21Shares, WisdomTree, CoinShares, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton, have filed for approval to launch such financial products. ProShares and Volatility Shares are also seeking the regulator’s green light for XRP-based investment products. President of the ETF store, Nate Geraci, has shared his optimism , stating that with the legal uncertainties resolved, it is simply a matter of time. He also predicted that financial giants such as BlackRock and Fidelity may soon enter the XRP space with their investment vehicles.

Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett has shed light on this filing, sparking curiosity among the XRP community. Notably, this cryptic development has added a layer of intrigue to the ongoing Ripple lawsuit, raising questions about Keener’s motives and the potential implications of his involvement. Let’s unveil what this evidence could be and how it could influence the Ripple vs SEC case. XRP Lawsuit: Mysterious Filing Sparks Curiosity In a recent X post, Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett unveiled a mysterious filing involving Justin W. Keener, who has faced SEC allegations of operating as an unregistered penny stock dealer. The mysterious figure has reportedly filed an emergency request to present “decisive evidence” that could potentially shift the case’s outcome in favor of the defendants. “An odd filing just now in the SEC vs Ripple docket — an emergency request to present decisive evidence in favor of the defendants and in favor of liberty for the American people,” stated Terrett in her X thread. The letter submitted by Keener sparks curiosity and ambiguity as the specifics of the “decisive evidence” mentioned remain unclear. What Is Keener’s Decisive Evidence? Keener’s mysterious filing in the XRP case has invoked further anxiety as it comes amidst the case’s settlement . The cryptic nature of his decisive evidence adds more intrigue to the ongoing lawsuit. Although Keener claims to hold data and information that could resolve key issues affecting Americans, the nature of this evidence remains unclear. However, he has indicated that the data is linked to the physical investment contracts he has been collecting. It is also conceivable that this evidence could support Ripple’s case and benefit US citizens. Despite these developments, the individual’s previous legal issues with the SEC have raised concerns about his credibility. While he has been sued for operating as an unregistered penny stock dealer, his motives in intervening in the XRP lawsuit spark doubts. Ripple vs SEC Case Settlement: New Update The recent development within the XRP lawsuit has raised concerns within the Ripple community. As both the SEC and Ripple have acted in favor of an imminent case settlement, a surprising turn in the form of a cryptic filing has introduced uncertainty. Keener’s filing also coincides with speculations of a major development in the Ripple case following the SEC’s closed-door meeting on April 3 . The community anticipated that the meeting could bring more clarity to the Ripple vs SEC case.

However, analysts believe a crypto rally could be on the horizon. On April 4, President Donald Trump announced that the United States is invoking at least a 10% tariff on all imported goods that come into the country. The announcement shook up global markets leading to major stocks plunging to some of its lowest levels since 2022. Investors have grown weary that Trump’s new trade policies could spark a rise in consumer prices , signaling the beginnings of a recession. Odds on Polymarket betting that the U.S. will experience a recession in 2025 have mostly placed their money on YES, with odds surging to 53% both before and after tariffs were unveiled. Despite being hailed as safe haven assets in the face of global economic uncertainty, the crypto market did not escape unscathed from the spillover effect of Trump’s tariffs. The overall crypto market cap has fallen by 2.6% following Trump’s tariff announcement. Many cryptocurrencies actually saw brief spikes as investors reacted to Trump’s speech, but as the details of the new tariffs became clear, market sentiment quickly turned negative. Shortly after the announcement, Bitcoin ( BTC ) fell by nearly 4%. Its value that stayed barely above $80,000, recovering slightly by 0.03% to $83,210. Price chart for Bitcoin following Trump’s tariff announcement, April 4, 2025 | Source: crypto.news On the other hand, Ethereum ( ETH ) suffered a worse drop of 5.2% after Trump’s announcement. At press time, ETH has fallen by 1.24% and is currently trading hands by $1,801. Solana’s price also declined by nearly 3% after the tariffs announcement. SOL ( SOL ) has since recovered slightly, only falling by 1.9% in the past 24 hours. The token is currently valued at $116.24. Just a day prior, it was still trading within the $119 to $118 price range, plunging since. Despite the market volatility among crypto assets, analysts believe that tariffs could bring about another crypto rally.

Although things are looking bleak on the crypto market after Trump’s tariff announcement, experts believe that once the initial shock wears off, cryptocurrencies could see a long-term rally in the wake of the economic uncertainty in traditional markets due to the tariffs. If the tariffs end up pushing the economy toward a recession, the Federal Reserve could potentially lower interest rates or even quantitative easing that would inject liquidity into the financial system. A boost in global liquidity could bring about a rise in investor appetite for risk assets, such as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. So far, investors have flocked to the more traditional safe haven asset, such as gold . Following Trump’s Liberation Day tariffs, gold soared near its all-time high. Spot gold hit record high of $3,148.88 per ounce on Tuesday. However, it later retreated to $3,110 after there were reports that precious metals would be excluded from Trump’s tariffs. With traditional markets like stocks and bonds are in turbulence due to heightened trade tensions, investors may gravitate towards alternative assets as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. BitMEX co-founder and renowned crypto analyst, Arthur Hayes , explained how tariffs could prove beneficial to the crypto market in his recent post . He expected the global imbalance will be corrected and that fiat currencies would weaken. The weakening of traditional currencies like the dollar and the yuan could prove to be a boost for Bitcoin.

Global imbalances will be corrected, and the pain papered over with printed money, which is good for $BTC . pic.twitter.com/jc5eZ2VIEa — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) April 4, 2025 “The $ [dollar] is weakening alongside foreigners selling U.S. tech stocks and bringing money home. This is good for BTC and gold over medium term,” said Hayes in his post. In contrast, Bitfinex analysts warned traders that the tariffs reveal could lead to a deeper correction in the crypto market. Before Trump’s tariff announcement, Bitfinex said to crypto.news that if the tariffs stayed within the 12-20% range, markets could react positively and crypto may even see a brief rally. However, because the tariffs deployed by Trump have exceeded this range, Bitfinex analysts predict there will be renewed de-risking. “We could see a continuation of the downtrend that’s played out since February,” said analysts.

Whether these scenarios happen in a few years or are decades away, we will most likely evolve into that future in some manner, and technology, once again, will reshape our lives. Without the support of blockchain technology, however, it would be quite difficult, and potentially impossible, for agentic AI and robotics to evolve to what its proponents expect them to. If we expect these services and devices to act autonomously, security, privacy, transparency and accountability will be at the top of our minds. These areas are where blockchain shines and can support AI weaknesses to facilitate the scaling and evolution of this vision. Blockchain strengths support AI weaknesses Blockchain technology can significantly bolster the security of AI models by leveraging its key features such as decentralization, immutability, traceability, smart contracts, data privacy and identity verification. For example, but not limited to: The decentralization aspect eliminates a single point of attack, increasing the resilience of AI models against breaches. The immutability of blockchain ensures that the data used in training AI models and the models themselves cannot be illicitly altered, maintaining the integrity of the models. Every alteration or decision made by the AI model can be audibly traced through blockchain, providing unparalleled transparency and accountability. Smart contracts automate the enforcement of data access and usage rules, preventing unauthorized or unethical use of AI models. Smart contracts can ensure that data is only used for training and testing and by authorized personnel, locking the option to be used for other purposes. Combining these rules with multiparty computation could prevent or at least mitigate AI adversarial attacks. Blockchain allows secure multiparty computation, ensuring data privacy during AI model training by keeping the data decentralized. Blockchain’s secure identity verification enhances the safety of AI systems by preventing unauthorized access. Integrating AI with blockchain can establish a secure, transparent, traceable and decentralized AI environment, protecting our privacy, enhancing accountability and manifesting responsible AI. Transactions: Programmable AI meets programmable blockchain AI agents and robotics are programmable. Smart contacts, the driver of digital assets, are programmable. It makes perfect sense that digital assets would be the preferred payment rail for agent-to-human and agent-to-agent, which includes robotics. Crypto is an internet-native, programmable money with several advantages for powering the agent-based economy. As AI agents become more autonomous and engage in micro-transactions at scale, crypto’s efficiency, borderless nature and programmability will make it the preferred medium of exchange over traditional fiat rails. Recent: Sentient open-source AI search outperforms GPT-4o and Perplexity The true intersection of Web3 and agentic AI for financial transactions could emerge through new tokens and protocols tailored for this use case. These could extend stablecoin capabilities by integrating agent-specific functionalities. In this scenario, payments could be made using a specialized asset that agents can stake for quality control. Slashing policies could penalize poor performance, while validators could resolve disputes based on task quality. Additionally, agents’ reputations could be directly tied to their token stakes. Incorporating rules via smart contracts enables users to have control over their autonomous workers/assistants, enabling a shutdown or even a “kill switch,” if necessary, when AI agents start behaving dangerously. If Goldman Sachs wants to create AI agents that think and act like a seasoned employee in a highly regulated industry and with imperative risk to financial systems and at the extreme financial markets’ stability, it would be vital, not optional, to have these AI agents controlled by programmable tokens. While this approach requires advancements in both Web3 and agentic AI, it is not as distant as it may seem. Blockchain development firm Skyfire recently launched a payment platform that allows AI agents to spend money autonomously. Helmed by former Ripple vice president of products and services Amir Sarhangi, the company’s platform enables a business to give a pre-loaded wallet to an AI agent. The company’s protocol converts the cash into USDC ( USDC ). In early March, Skyfire brought its payments network that enables AI agents to make autonomous transactions out of beta. Using digital assets for robotics, VR devices and agentic AI transactions goes beyond a mode of payment for transactions. It could enhance user experience and security and enable endless business models that have never existed. It would be interesting to see how it all plays out and whether other companies will follow. There are risk issues to be addressed, however, and we should be mindful of how they are, at the very least, mitigated. This is where we should carefully consider the security measures discussed previously. Stepping out of “tunnel vision” to a multifaceted approach There is a lot of focus on the evolution of AI — generative AI, agentic AI, reasoning models, physical world models and more — all focusing on the premise that AI is the sole technology that we need to achieve AI autonomous agents at scale. This is quite a tunnel vision approach to how products are built, and it is somewhat myopic: not understanding what needs to be accomplished beyond AI models’ advancement for the ecosystem to evolve and scale. AI, advanced as it can be, cannot stand on its own and needs the support of blockchain technology — a programmable match made in heaven. Therefore, we must act in a multifaceted approach. We should think about and treat AI and Web3 together in terms of innovation, regulation and infrastructure. This is fundamental to the bedrock of a successful agentic economy. “Dreams are built with solid foundations,” and the time to build them is now. Opinion by: Merav Ozair, PhD.

Analysts Eye 20% Rally If This Level Is Reclaimed,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/aptos-apt-ready-for-a-breakout-analysts-eye-20-rally-if-this-level-is-reclaimed/,"Amid the market retrace, Aptos (APT) has seen an 8% decline in the past 24 hours, falling below a key support zone for the second time this week. Despite the correction, some analysts consider that the cryptocurrency could be poised for a breakout soon. Related Reading: Ethereum Trading In ‘No Man’s Land’, But Analyst Says Breakout Is A Matter Of Time Aptos Loses Macro Range Lows During the March retraces, Aptos fell below a crucial support level for the first time since August 2024 but recovered 24% near the end of the month. However, APT followed the rest of the market and dumped 11% to close the March below key levels. Analyst Rekt Capital noted that APT closed last month below its Macro Range Low of $5.44 for the first time. The cryptocurrency has been trading within the $5.45-$17 price range since 2023, retesting the range lows two times before. Historically, “APT tends to develop bases here in the form of downside wicks for three-month periods,” he explained, adding that the cryptocurrency seems to be developing a third three-month base, with the difference that it has closed below this range for the first time in the monthly timeframe. Following this performance, Aptos will need to reclaim the $5.44 level as support “to end this Monthly close as a downside deviation” and “avoid a bearish retest here.” Previously, the analyst suggested that holding this level could reverse ATP’s price action in the coming months, as it has done with the other clusters. Additionally, he pointed out the previous consolidations included a “downside wicking below support.” In his recent analysis, Rekt Capital considers that APT’s daily bullish divergence “is still something worth watching” as the cryptocurrency’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) continues to form Higher Lows despite the recent downside deviation, and its price “is trying to transition away from Lower Lows into a new Higher Low.” According to the analyst, “a clear market structure is developing here, and a breakout from it would validate the Bull Div and set APT up for a reclaim of the Macro Range Low of $5.44,” which is key for a bullish rally. APT To Reclaim $6.5 Resistance? Analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems highlighted Aptos’ strength amid the market volatility, which saw Bitcoin (BTC) drop from $88,000 to $81,000 in the past 24 hours. APT dropped from the $5.40 mark to the $4.95 support. The analyst considers that a retest of the local range lows could be necessary before the cryptocurrency aims for the next crucial level, as the current price zone has been tested many times.

Moreover, a reclaim of the $5.44 range could see the APT surge another 20% to the $6.5 resistance lost two months ago. Another market watcher suggested that Aptos is “showing potential for a bullish breakout as it trades within a descending channel.” Per the chart, the cryptocurrency has been trading within a descending channel since early February, testing the channel’s lower and upper boundaries throughout March. “After testing the lower trendline, it may be finding support, and a break above the upper resistance will signal a significant rally,” the analyst concluded. As of this writing, Aptos trades at $5.02, a 16.1% decline in the weekly timeframe.

The April 3 filing , made by Coinbase Derivatives LLC, is a self-certification submitted to the CFTC under Rule 40.2(a). It outlines a new cash-settled monthly contract set to launch on April 21, pending regulatory approval. Each contract, trading under the symbol XRL, will represent 10,000 XRP, roughly $20,000 at current market prices, assuming XRP holds near the $2.00 mark. The move was announced by Coinbase Institutional, the exchange’s platform tailored for professional and institutional traders. In a statement posted on April 3, the firm said the product will offer a “regulated, capital-efficient way to gain exposure” to one of the most liquid digital assets in the market. According to the filing, Coinbase will list three monthly contracts at a time. The product will be margined and USD-settled, with trading hours set from 5:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. CT, Sunday through Friday. A one-hour break will occur each weekday between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m. CT. Contracts will settle against the MarketVector Coinbase XRP benchmark index — an hourly reference rate based on volume-weighted median prices sourced from Coinbase’s own spot market.

XRP’s price, however, remained largely flat following the news. The lack of market reaction may be explained by the fact that XRP futures are not new to crypto traders. Major platforms like Binance, OKX, Bybit, and BitMEX have long offered similar contracts to global users. As previously reported by crypto.news, Coinbase Institutional recently open-sourced its multi-party computation cryptography library in a move to boost security across the crypto space. The tools, which help sign transactions without revealing private keys, are now available on GitHub, along with documentation for developers looking to integrate MPC into their systems. These efforts come at a time when the exchange is navigating broader market challenges. Coinbase stock (NASDAQ: COIN) dropped 31% in Q1 , its worst quarter since the FTX collapse, amid declining trading activity across the crypto sector. At the time of writing, COIN had slipped over 8% in the past week according to data from Google Finance.

On Thursday, in an interview with Bitcoin News, he answered the futuristic fictional question of “what if Bitcoin fails in future? How did it Fail?”. He reasoned, “Bitcoin fails and becomes irrelevant if it cannot be used by people on a daily basis. If it remains as a store of all, I don’t think it is relevant at all.” However, as soon as his comments on the importance of real-world utility of Bitcoin Payments came in limelight, Manna Bitcoin Wallet Founder Adam Simecka questioned him on why Jack Dorsey’s own platform, Block , still doesn’t accept Bitcoin payments for the Bitkey and Square. In response to it, he confirmed that the team is working on it and will soon integrate Bitcoin Payments in Block ecosystem. His response has sparked fresh conversations around the future of crypto payments — and forces us to mull whether Dorsey’s vision can meaningfully challenge incumbent players like PayPal, Coinbase, and traditional payment rails or not. Block’s Bitcoin Push The integration, though still in development, is being designed with a focus on increasing the utility of Bitcoin Payments. This will help in making Bitkey a central piece of Block’s Bitcoin push. Bitkey, which launched globally in December 2023, is a self-custody wallet that allows users to manage their Bitcoin without relying on third-party custodians. This latest development will allow its current user base of 57 million to use Block’s hardware and software products—like Square readers and the Cash App—to start accepting Bitcoin for goods and services. This vision marks a stark departure from the dominant crypto narratives of recent years, where Bitcoin is treated more as a store of value. It is often likened to digital gold, rather than as a medium of exchange. Dorsey, however, has always seen Bitcoin as a currency for the internet — a decentralized, censorship-resistant alternative to fiat and this development is evident of it. https://x.com/jack/status/1907611367546499297 Can Jack Dorsey’s Block then Compete with Payment Giants? However, with this development, Block would soon enter a payments space that has grown increasingly competitive. PayPal, for instance, has been allowing crypto purchases since March 2021. It enables payments with its “Checkout with Crypto” feature— but through custodial wallets where users don’t control their keys. Coinbase also offers similar services but remains primarily an exchange and custodial platform. BitPay, CoinGate, and Binance Pay are also other dominating players in the crypto payments space. But Block’s advantage could lie in its non-custodial, Bitcoin-native approach. By emphasizing user sovereignty and decentralization, Dorsey can tap into the core ethos of crypto — something often lost in the convenience-focused products from mainstream fintech. The question of scalability also looms large. Bitcoin, in its current form, cannot handle thousands of transactions per second. While the Lightning Network has emerged as one solution for real-time BTC payments, it still faces user experience and adoption hurdles. There are Bitcoin Layer2s like Bitlayer working on the similar objective. It’s unclear whether Block will leverage Lightning or pursue another Layer 2 integration for scaling. The Road Ahead Block has not revealed a launch date for the new Bitcoin payment feature, but insiders suggest pilot tests may begin by mid-2025. If successful, this could mark a significant turning point for Bitcoin as a usable currency, not just a speculative asset. Still, the transition won’t be without obstacles. The increasing competition is something Jack Dorsey would need to tackle. Additionally, consumer demand for paying in Bitcoin remains relatively low. Further, regulatory uncertainty around crypto payments persists in several markets. There’s also the matter of educating merchants and customers about how Bitcoin transactions work. Thus, no doubt a boost to Bitcoin’s growing role in DeFi and real-world utility, the roll out must be implemented strategically with all the challenges in mind.

Although both altcoins are slightly in the green on a daily scale, their weekly and monthly performances are quite concerning. Large market participants, known as whales, are a crucial part of the cryptocurrency industry as they can bend prices depending on their behavior – big purchases typically lead to upcoming gains, and vice versa. In the case of LINK and ADA, these investors were stacking up big time after the US elections in early November and ahead of Trump’s inauguration in mid-January. Their consecutive purchases managed to push LINK above $30 for the first time in over three years, while ADA’s peak during this cycle came at over $1.3. However, both of those multi-year records came in December. Since then, the two cryptocurrencies, as well as most of the market, have been in a state of a freefall. ADA is down by roughly 50% and sits at $0.66 now, while LINK has slumped by 57% to $13. These declines could be linked again to whales and their change in attitude. In the case of LINK, they have offloaded more than 170 million tokens in less than a month, which have a whopping USD value of $2.2 billion, according to today’s prices.

The landscape around Cardano is not that much brighter. After the March sell-off , ADA whales kept disposing of their assets by selling another 120 million tokens (valued at $80 million) in just two days at the start of April.

The pandemic simulation game that spread like wildfire announced it is ditching Base for Solana after its launch turned into a gas fee horror show. Infected’s team says that Base couldn’t handle the transaction volume, causing gas fees to spike and players to quit mid-outbreak. Base architect Jesse Pollak has claimed that Base never crashed. Meanwhile, Base’s total value locked (TVL) has recorded a decline of around 4% over the last 7 days. Base gas fees killed Infected hype? In an X post, Infected declared that after building solely on Ethereum for the past 4 years they are migrating all of their upcoming games to Solana. It mentioned that Base wasn’t able to handle their demand but it is not solely the chain’s problem. It added that it’s a fundamental scaling issue for all EVM chains . It highlighted that their team experimented with various consumer apps but then they narrowed it down to one concept i.e. speculative simulation games. Their team believes that speculation has huge potential beyond just meme coins as it will evolve into a bigger industry over the next 2 years.

There is only one reason that led us to this decision: Base couldn’t handle @Infecteddotfun ‘s… — Infected (@infecteddotfun) April 3, 2025 As per the data shared, daily gas spent on Base pre-Infected (23 Feb) was 43.515 ETH and on Infected day 1 it was 145.850 ETH. The team believed in L2 scaling for ETH, but after this, they think EVM chains have a fundamental scaling issue that won’t be solved anytime soon. They anticipate that Solana is winning this race in terms of culture and user base. Base didn’t crash, but it still lost Infected praised the ETH community for being visionary, long-term oriented, and highly technical, however, it lacks in focusing on today’s users. It pointed out that there is a huge divide between builders and users on EVM. It stated that on one hand, most builders on Ethereum have no idea who the users are and what they want. On the other hand, Solana builders focus on real-world products and actual users. It named most of the popular consumer apps on Solana like pumpfun, vectorfun, daosfun and more. The viral game added that they have doubted Solana for long but now they got it why they’ve dominated the space over the past year. It added “If our users were on XRP, we’d build on XRP. If they were on the Bitcoin mainnet, we’d go there. But today, they’re on Solana.” Jesse Pollak responded to the claims and stated that Base’s team reached out to the Infected directly immediately after the post and they haven’t responded yet. He asserted that Base did not crash and the chain hummed along, just as it should. DefiLlama data shows that Base has managed to grew its TVL by 8.3% over the last one month. It now stands at $3.05 billion. Meanwhile, Solana’s TVL has taken a hit of almost 15% at the same time to hover around $6.33 billion.

Meanwhile, Chinese firm Cango is betting big on Bitcoin by selling its traditional business to Bitmain-linked entities and shifting fully into mining. On the flip side, Singapore’s Genius Group is facing legal hurdles in the US that prevent it from expanding its Bitcoin holdings. Trump’s Tariffs Will Push Investors Toward Bitcoin BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes believes that US President Donald Trump’s newly announced tariffs could disrupt the global economy but ultimately prove bullish for Bitcoin. In an April 3 post on X , Hayes stated that while global imbalances may be shaken by the move, the resulting monetary responses—particularly money printing—will serve as a tailwind for BTC. “Global imbalances will be corrected, and the pain papered over with printed money, which is good for BTC,” he said, adding, “Some of y’all are running scurred, but I LOVE TARIFFS.” The Trump administration revealed that it will implement a 10% tariff on all countries starting April 5, with even steeper rates for specific nations. In fact, China is facing 34%, the European Union 20%, and Japan 24%. Hayes pointed to several reasons why this could trigger a Bitcoin rally. Chief among them is the weakening of the US Dollar Index (DXY), as global investors begin offloading US stocks and repatriating funds. This shift in capital, he argued, will be very favorable for Bitcoin. Supporting his case, Hayes pointed out that April 3 saw the largest single-day point drop in history for the Nasdaq 100, with a loss of 1,060 points. According to The Kobeissi Letter , the index came within just 1.5% of activating the first market circuit breaker since the March 2020 crash. Hayes interpreted this market turmoil as a medium-term positive for both Bitcoin and gold. He also mentioned the potential impact of the tariffs on the Chinese yuan (CNY), and suggested that Beijing may allow the currency to weaken beyond 8.00 in response to the punitive trade measures. According to Hayes, a weaker yuan could encourage Chinese investors to look for shelter in risk-on assets like Bitcoin to preserve their wealth. Adding another layer to his analysis, Hayes pointed to a drop in the two-year Treasury yield after the tariff news, and suggested that markets are now pricing in Federal Reserve rate cuts and possibly a return to quantitative easing . Lower interest rates and increased liquidity typically make riskier assets like cryptocurrencies more appealing to investors. Jeff Park , head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Invest, shared very similar thoughts earlier this year. On Feb. 3, Park predicted that in a scenario of a weakening dollar and declining US interest rates, risk assets will surge significantly. Overall, both Hayes and Park suggest that while tariffs may start some economic instability, they could also be the spark that drives Bitcoin into its next major rally. Cango Goes All-In on Bitcoin Mining Cango, a publicly traded Chinese conglomerate, also believes in Bitcoin’s potential. The company even reportedly decided to pivot entirely toward Bitcoin mining by offloading its traditional China-based operations. According to a report by The Miner Mag, the company agreed to sell its legacy auto financing business for $352 million to Ursalpha Digital Limited. This is an entity linked to Bitmain, which is one of the world’s leading Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturers. As part of the deal, Bitmain will transfer 32 exahashes per second (EH/s) of computing power to Cango, effectively bringing a portion of its mining infrastructure into the public market through Cango’s listing. Exahashes measure the total computing contribution a miner provides to secure the Bitcoin network. Ursalpha Digital shares the same corporate address and founding director as Antalpha, yet another Bitmain-controlled entity. This means that there are some very strong ties between the parties involved. This move is taking place as Bitmain navigates increased regulatory scrutiny in the United States, particularly after its AI subsidiary Sopghgo was blacklisted by the US government, according to Bloomberg. Bitmain also still has ties with American Bitcoin , a mining venture linked to President Donald Trump’s family. American Bitcoin was formed through a partnership with Hut 8, and was created in March. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump are among its founders. Hut 8, a Canadian infrastructure provider, recently transferred its mining equipment to American Bitcoin and is expected to focus on data centers while American Bitcoin pursues mining operations and a potential IPO. Unfortunately, market conditions for Bitcoin miners are not the best. A JPMorgan note revealed that mining stocks suffered in 2025 because of declining crypto prices and profitability pressures after Bitcoin’s most recent halving event in April of last year. This reduced mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. Hut8 stock price YTD (Source: Google ) The halving is designed to control Bitcoin’s supply but often forces miners to reevaluate their strategies and cost structures. US Court Blocks Genius Group’s Bitcoin Expansion On the other hand, some companies want to take advantage of Bitcoin’s long-term price potential, but are unable to do so. Singapore-based artificial intelligence company Genius Group is temporarily blocked from expanding its Bitcoin treasury after a US court order that bans it from selling shares, raising capital, or using investor funds to buy more Bitcoin. (Source: X ) The order was issued by a New York District Court on March 13, and it is part of a broader legal dispute linked to the company's recent merger with Fatbrain AI. Although the two firms completed their merger in March of 2024, Genius Group later moved to terminate the deal in October because of alleged fraud by Fatbrain AI executives. In February, Fatbrain AI executives Michael Moe and Peter Ritz requested a temporary restraining order and a permanent injunction, claiming that Genius Group’s financial actions could harm investors while arbitration was ongoing. As a result, the court-imposed restrictions forced Genius Group to shut down some of its business divisions, halt marketing operations, and sell 10 of its 440 Bitcoins to sustain its operations. The company warned that it may need to sell even more Bitcoin in the coming months if the restrictions stay in place. (Source: Genius Group ) The dispute escalated even more when Fatbrain AI shareholders filed two lawsuits in April of 2024 against both Fatbrain AI executives and Genius Group. The lawsuit allege violations of federal securities laws. However, Genius Group was voluntarily dismissed from the lawsuits on Feb. 14. The company now claims that adhering to the US court order is causing it to violate Singaporean law, specifically by preventing it from issuing shares to employees under preexisting agreements. Genius Group CEO Roger James Hamilton is very frustrated at the court’s ability to override corporate decision-making. He believes that decisions like raising capital or buying Bitcoin should rest with the shareholders or the company’s board, not a foreign court. Genius Group first began building a Bitcoin treasury in November of 2024 by purchasing 110 BTC for $10 million. It later announced a broader strategy to allocate more than 90% of its reserves into Bitcoin.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-04 09:27:52
42891451,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/best-crypto-to-buy-now-as-alabama-minnesota-push-bitcoin-bills,1743758893,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/42891451.jpeg,"Best Crypto to Buy Now as Alabama, Minnesota Push Bitcoin Bills",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/best-crypto-to-buy-now-as-alabama-minnesota-push-bitcoin-bills,"Owing to the growing interest and adoption of cryptocurrencies, several US states have expressed interest in creating cryptocurrency reserves—a move that has been met with both critique and acclaim. The latest additions to the list are Alabama and Minnesota, who introduced bills on the same day seeking permission to use public funds to purchase Bitcoin as investments. The two states, with this latest development, join the list of 26 other states across the country that have made active requests to establish a reserve soon. Why Is a Bitcoin Reserve Good For Investors? Alabama’s SB 283 and Minnesota’s HF 2946, with their announcements , join a growing movement—26 states have now filed bills proposing crypto reserves. While most of these bills suggest modest allocations and strict oversight, Wisconsin has already acted, holding $588 million in Bitcoin ETFs by the end of 2024. Naturally, all these developments reflect a growing willingness from governments to treat Bitcoin as a legitimate financial asset, not just a speculative vehicle. For crypto investors, this shift could be quite monumental. When state-level institutions begin integrating Bitcoin into their financial strategies, it sends a message of validation and long-term confidence in the asset. Such endorsement can ease concerns around volatility and regulation while also triggering new waves of interest from retail investors and large-scale entities. As trust in crypto grows through institutional action, the ripple effects could attract corporate treasuries, asset managers, and pension funds—each contributing to higher liquidity and stability in the market. More importantly, this surge of institutional alignment with crypto paves the way for smaller, high-upside tokens to gain attention. Investors may now look beyond Bitcoin, seeking undervalued projects with real utility or strong narratives. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Projects That May Benefit From Government Adoption BTC Bull If there’s one crypto that will always be first in line when governments consider adoption or state-level reserves, it’s Bitcoin. With Alabama, Minnesota, and 26 other U.S. states moving toward formal integration, the idea of Bitcoin-led reserve strategies is gaining real traction. That’s precisely where BTC Bull enters with perfect timing. Built around celebrating and rewarding Bitcoin believers, BTC Bull is a meme-powered project with a sharp utility: price-based airdrops. Each time BTC Bull hits a key milestone, investors are rewarded with airdrops—making loyalty a central mechanic. On top of that, deflationary burn mechanisms are baked into the token’s structure, aiming to reduce supply and increase scarcity. It’s a fitting theme for a project that mirrors Bitcoin’s ethos while catering to community-driven value. Having already raised over $4 million, BTC Bull is gaining momentum quickly. With Bitcoin’s role as the gateway to institutional crypto integration being solidified, projects riding that wave—especially those designed to reflect Bitcoin’s value and narrative—are likely to benefit massively. If these bills pass and Bitcoin reserves become reality, the indirect impact on BTC-themed projects could be immense. BTC Bull, with its fusion of a rewards system, scarcity mechanics, and thematic alignment with the broader market’s focus, might be perfectly positioned for that moment. MIND of Pepe As crypto adoption continues to embed itself into mainstream conversations, the market narrative is beginning to shift. Beyond the usual Bitcoin and high-cap altcoins, there's growing curiosity around projects that fuse tech, culture, and sentiment—especially as institutions flirt with crypto adoption. That’s where MIND of Pepe becomes especially relevant. Far from being just another meme project, MIND of Pepe introduces a unique twist: it's an AI-driven entity designed to monitor, engage, and analyze social media trends across the crypto world. The goal isn’t just virality—it’s insight. MIND of Pepe interacts like a real user, builds its own online persona, and offers investors exclusive access to its sentiment analytics, letting them track meme token momentum in near real-time. This fusion of AI and memecoin culture could hit at just the right moment. As government discussions validate Bitcoin and other top tokens, attention naturally drifts toward the social layer of crypto. MIND of Pepe positions itself as the digital mind tracking that shift. It has already attracted strong community interest, and early backers see its utility not just as a meme, but as a predictive tool. Crypto YouTuber ClayBro has even pointed out that MIND of Pepe could reshape how investors evaluate the hype cycle of meme coins. Instead of relying on intuition, users can tap into a data-driven pulse of the crypto community. With sentiment poised to become just as valuable as fundamentals, MIND of Pepe could quietly become one of the more strategic plays in the meme sector—bridging narrative and analytics in a way few projects have tried. Mantle Crypto adoption in the U.S. gained serious momentum once Donald Trump, now the sitting President, began openly backing it as part of his financial and technological agenda. That shift didn’t just spark conversations—it sparked capital flows. His company, World Liberty Financial, has been linked to multiple large-scale crypto purchases. Among those, one investment that caught attention was a $3.54 million acquisition of Mantle. While many were watching more visible altcoins, Mantle quietly became a name worth tracking. Designed as a modular Ethereum Layer 2 network, Mantle focuses on scalability and performance—two traits that governments and large institutions will likely prioritize in blockchain applications. The token’s structure revolves around enabling high-throughput smart contract execution while keeping transaction fees low—key for real-world adoption at scale. With U.S. states getting serious about integrating blockchain into fiscal strategies, infrastructure-level projects like Mantle become relevant in ways that go beyond speculation. If governmental interest evolves from holding assets to building on blockchain, projects with foundational utility will be re-evaluated—and repriced. Despite its strong fundamentals and high-profile backing, Mantle’s current market price, which is under $1, still lags behind its potential, making it one of the more underrated names in the mix. It’s worth keeping on the radar before attention catches up. Solaxy As crypto adoption—especially by governments of powerful nations like the U.S.—expands beyond buzzwords and becomes policy, one shift is inevitable: value will flow toward projects with real utility. Solaxy stands out here—not because of gimmicks, but because it’s addressing something the blockchain space actually needs. Solaxy is a Layer 2 protocol designed to bridge Ethereum and Solana, aiming to reduce network congestion, lower fees, and create smoother cross-chain interoperability. It’s a technically ambitious project wrapped in a space-themed, meme-forward aesthetic that draws initial attention but retains it through substance. Are you curious about $SOLX ? 🤔Read over the Solaxy White Paper and regular Solaxy Dev Updates in the links below 👇 https://t.co/arr34146aR https://t.co/EpiIjplyoe pic.twitter.com/oRZEt74EH6 — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) April 2, 2025 Since its debut, Solaxy has consistently stayed relevant, not just for its branding but for the very real solution it’s building in the middle of two of crypto’s busiest chains. As conversations shift from “What crypto should we hold?” to “What tech should we build on?”—a scenario made more likely by increasing state-level interest—projects like Solaxy could find themselves at the epicenter. Its presale has already raised over $28 million, a clear indicator that investors recognize its potential. Some even speculate that it could eventually match projects like Optimism or Arbitrum in influence once it goes live. With the U.S. laying the groundwork for a pro-crypto future, Solaxy’s timing automatically makes it a serious contender. Conclusion The adoption of cryptocurrencies into the US states is likely to become a move that could potentially take the market as a whole from its current valuation under $3 trillion to well above $4 or even $5 trillion easily. With US states consistently being vocal about their interest in including crypto into policy-based operations for transparency, other cities across the globe are also taking notice. their willingness to bring crypto to the centerstage. With such big moves likely to move the market, stocking Countries like El Salvador and Dubai have already shownup on projects—like the ones mentioned above—could be a sureshot play at being exposed to gems with 10x potential or more in the coming months.

Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently underway in phase 4 of its presale, attracting 7,800 holders with an overall investment of $6.1 million. Both SHIB and MUTM assets are now being highlighted by analysts as potential leaders this quarter, with upcoming ecosystem growth in SHIB combined with previously described structured financial model for MUTM predicting explosive gains. The Technical Momentum of Shiba Inu Builds Shiba Inu Tests Important Resistance, Rallies From $0.000012 Support Area Despite constant bearish pressure from descending EMAs, whale activity has consistently risen alongside a 262% spike in large transactions over the last weekly candle, hitting a figure of $45.53 million in weekly transactions. The 1 billion milestone shines a spotlight of optimism for Shibarium, cementing network utility and building community confidence. Both open interest soared 3.47% to $121.57 million, and the long to-short ratio drifts past 1.0321, indicating a bullish sentiment in the futures data. Traders expect a breakout above the resistance level 0.000013 which could set off a rally toward the $0.000020 level. But a lack of monetary support at current levels runs the risk of revisiting $0.000010, and already SHIB’s prospects this week represent a high-stakes battleground for bulls and bears alike. Accelerating Demand for Mutuum Finance Presale The fourth phase of presale sees Mutuum Finance (MUTM) benefiting from this momentum, with tokens currently priced at $0.025. Current adopters will lock in a 140% return when it lists on exchanges for $0.06, but time is running out: the fifth phase will up prices by 20% to $0.03. This unique buy-and-distribute mechanism that collects platform revenue for token buybacks and thus applies continued upward pressure has already encouraged over 7,700 holders to position. That added utility is rarely gained in DeFi via the project’s lending model—one that allows overcollateralized loans and negotiations between peers. Depositing over time creates a passive yield for depositors due to the appreciation of mtTokens as interest accrues, allowing market makers to constantly enhance liquidity. Post-launch targets range from $1.50 to $3.50, which would equate to returns bolting past 5,900% for phase 4 investors. These projections are derived from MUTM’s tokenomics, which allocates 70% of supply to presale and liquidity incentives, maintaining scarcity and demand alignment. Mutuum Finance are currently completing a Certik audit of its smart contracts, a move set to increase trust when completed. The team intends to announce its results using social channels, tackling security issues at the outset. This proactive approach sets MUTM apart from meme coins frequently labeled as speculative, supporting its structure as an organized option in a turbulent crypto environment. Timing the Entry Point The technical rebound of Shiba Inu paired with the presale of Mutuum Finance craft a double opportunity for traders. SHIB’s future depends on breaking through EMA resistances, while limited-time MUTM pricing provides a perfectly clear entry point ahead of exchange listings. And with phase 4 selling out fast, waiting to invest risks you missing out the 20% price increase in phase 5—and the huge gains expected after launch. As the crypto markets mature, the projects that are managing to combine innovation with execution will emerge from moonshot speculative noise. Cases in point are Shiba Inu’s community-driven growth and Mutuum Finance’s yield-focused architecture. For anyone looking out for underexploited macro opportunities, both tokens tell a good story in this regard — but with MUTM’s phase 5 countdown, it’s game on.

While total value locked in DeFi protocols declined due to broader financial uncertainty and the aftermath of a major exchange exploit, early-stage investment in Bitcoin-focused startups grew significantly, and key platforms like Gemini and ParaSwap made strategic moves to position themselves for future growth. DeFi Sector Shrinks Amid Economic Jitters and Bybit Hack, But AI and Social Dapps Shine in Q1 2025 The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector took a significant hit in the first quarter of 2025, with the total value locked (TVL) plunging to $156 billion, a 27% quarter-on-quarter drop, according to a new report by crypto analytics firm DappRadar. The fall, which echoes broader market turbulence, was largely attributed to persistent macroeconomic uncertainty and the high-profile Bybit exchange exploit. DappRadar’s April 3 report revealed that Ethereum, the leading blockchain for DeFi activity, saw its TVL drop 37% to $96 billion during the quarter. Other major networks including Solana, Tron, and Arbitrum also faced sharp TVL contractions, each losing over 30% of their locked assets. Sui was hit the hardest among the top ten blockchains, with a staggering 44% decline in TVL, falling to just $2 billion. The bearish sentiment was compounded by Ether’s poor performance during the same period. Ether (ETH) slid 45% to $1,820, shedding almost half of its value over the quarter as investors navigated a difficult economic landscape. DappRadar noted that chains with higher DeFi withdrawal volumes and fewer stablecoins locked in their protocols suffered disproportionately, exacerbating the market correction. However, it wasn’t all doom and gloom for the blockchain sector. The newly launched Berachain emerged as a bright spot in the DeFi ecosystem, defying the broader downtrend. From its mainnet launch on February 6 to the end of March, Berachain accumulated an impressive $5.17 billion in TVL, making it the only top-10 blockchain by TVL to post a gain during Q1. While traditional DeFi struggled, user activity in artificial intelligence (AI) and social decentralized applications surged. DappRadar reported a 29% increase in daily unique active wallets (DUAW) for AI protocols and a 10% rise for social apps over the quarter. The monthly average for DUAWs reached 2.6 million for AI-focused protocols and 2.8 million for social platforms, suggesting growing adoption and user engagement despite the sluggish market. That contrasted sharply with DeFi and GameFi sectors, which both suffered double-digit declines in user activity. According to DappRadar, the growth in AI was particularly pronounced, with the emergence of new AI agent protocols reshaping user behavior. NFT Sector Contracts, But Prestige Remains Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) also felt the pressure of the broader market downturn. NFT trading volume dropped 25% quarter-on-quarter to $1.5 billion. Yet, the sector still saw pockets of activity, with OKX leading all marketplaces with $606 million in NFT sales. OpenSea followed with $599 million, while Blur recorded $565 million. Among collections, Pudgy Penguins emerged as the most traded NFT project of the quarter, with $177 million in sales. Meanwhile, CryptoPunks continued to command prestige despite their relatively low transaction count. Just 477 CryptoPunks changed hands, generating $63.6 million in volume, highlighting their status as elite digital collectibles. “When analyzing top collections, CryptoPunks remains a staple — its prestige remains intact even as price fluctuations make it largely inaccessible for the average user,” DappRadar noted. Change in DeFi total value locked between Jan. 2024 and March 2025 (Source: DappRadar ) The first quarter of 2025 highlighted a stark divergence in blockchain adoption trends. While economic uncertainty and technical setbacks like the Bybit exploit dragged down DeFi and NFTs, emerging sectors like AI and decentralized social apps demonstrated resilience and growth. The transition reflects a broader shift in user interest from speculative financial instruments to utility-driven, innovative use cases. As AI agents and social dapps continue to evolve, they could serve as the next frontier for mass blockchain adoption — even as traditional sectors recalibrate in the face of macro headwinds. Bitcoin Startup Boom: Pre-Seed Funding Deals Surge 767% Since 2021 Despite Valuation Pressures In related news, venture capital interest in Bitcoin-based startups is surging, even as macroeconomic uncertainty, regulatory confusion, and shrinking valuations continue to weigh on funding rounds. According to a new report from Trammell Venture Partners (TVP), the number of pre-seed funding rounds for Bitcoin-focused startup companies has skyrocketed 767% since 2021—an extraordinary sign of sustained entrepreneurial interest in Bitcoin as a foundational technology. In 2024 alone, Bitcoin pre-seed transactions increased by 50% year-over-year, and the number of unique startups funded rose 27.5% from the previous year. The data, compiled by TVP, reveals a clear and growing confidence in the Bitcoin ecosystem as a platform for innovation, even in the face of broader market headwinds. Christopher Calicott, Managing Director of TVP, attributes the rise in early-stage startup activity to Bitcoin’s unmatched stability and decentralization. “Many entrepreneurs across crypto are revisiting the Bitcoin stack as the long-term place to build their companies,” said Calicott. “It makes perfect sense: The objectively most secure, reliable, and decentralized blockchain is the obvious platform of choice.” Indeed, while other chains have drawn attention for their programmability or speed, Bitcoin’s ironclad security and growing infrastructure have made it increasingly attractive to founders prioritizing durability and long-term sustainability. Layer-2 solutions like Lightning Network and emerging Bitcoin-native smart contract platforms have expanded the realm of what's possible within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Valuations and Capital Raised Still Lag Behind Bull Market Highs Despite the explosion in deal volume, the size of the funding rounds themselves has failed to reclaim the lofty heights of 2021. TVP reports that total capital raised in Bitcoin pre-seed funding rounds dropped over 22% in 2024, while both median startup valuations and median deal sizes have declined steadily from 2021 to 2023. Median valuations for pre-seed Bitcoin startups between 2021-2024 (Source: Trammell Venture Partners) Though there was a slight rebound in round values during 2024, valuations remain well below their bull cycle peaks. TVP attributes this stagnation to lingering regulatory uncertainty in the US, particularly the unclear stance of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) during the past administration. The slowdown in funding amounts is not occurring in a vacuum. Broader macroeconomic forces have made venture capitalists more hesitant to deploy large amounts of capital into speculative sectors like crypto. Fears of a prolonged global trade war intensified in early April, when US President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order that imposed a 10% baseline tariff on all imported goods. The markets responded swiftly, with risk-on assets—including equities and cryptocurrencies—suffering sharp declines. In addition, persistent high interest rates and whispers of a looming US recession have led many investors to rotate out of volatile assets and into safer havens such as government bonds, gold, and cash. As a result, crypto-focused VC firms have become more selective. Haun Ventures, for example, invested $1.5 billion into crypto startups in 2022 but has set a lower target of $1 billion for the first half of 2025, citing changed market dynamics. What’s Ahead for 2025? While 2025 may not witness the exuberant highs of the 2021–2022 venture capital cycle, some analysts believe the sector will still experience solid growth. Galaxy Digital has projected a 50% year-over-year increase in VC-backed crypto investments in 2025, even though the totals are unlikely to return to the peak levels seen in the last bull run. Deng Chao, CEO of HashKey Capital, remains cautiously optimistic. Chao noted that “pro-crypto regulations in the United States would increase VC investment in the sector in 2025,” but warned that volatility tied to geopolitical instability could derail positive momentum. TVP’s report echoed this sentiment, concluding that while capital may be flowing more slowly, interest in Bitcoin startups is undeniably strong—and growing stronger.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-04 09:30:00

Kalshi’s prediction markets now stand at 53%, an 8.1% jump from prior estimates, and Polymarket’s odds have surged to 54%. Tariff Shock And Rising Recession Odds After President Trump’s latest move to impose higher duties—“Liberation Day” tariffs targeting key US trading partners, including a 34% levy on imports from China and 20% on those from the European Union—multiple forecasters revised their recession probabilities upward. The odds have been updated across several respected institutions and platforms: Besides Kalshi and Polymarket, Larry Summers has indicated a 50% likelihood, whereas JPMorgan puts the chance at 40%. According to a CNBC Fed Survey, the odds are 36%, with both Moody’s Analytics and Pimco forecasting a 35% chance. Notably, Goldman Sachs has significantly revised its stance, now estimating the probability at 35%, up from a previous 20%. Related Reading: Corporate Bitcoin Buying Hits Record Levels, Yet Prices Are Down—Here’s Why JPMorgan warns that these tariffs could result in “a $660 billion annual tax increase on Americans,” potentially adding 2% to domestic inflation. The risk of a knock-on effect is underscored by shifting consumer confidence data and the looming prospect of retaliatory trade measures from partners such as Canada and the EU. Goldman Sachs, in its March 30 research note, offered a sobering outlook for 2025. According to the team: “We now see a 12-month recession probability of 35%. The upgrade from our previous 20% estimate reflects our lower growth baseline, the sharp recent deterioration in household and business confidence, and statements from White House officials indicating greater willingness to tolerate near-term economic weakness in pursuit of their policies.” What This Means For Bitcoin Renowned crypto trader Bob Loukas captured market sentiment on X, writing: “I’m starting to think we’re heading into a recession or bear market, maybe a milder one, but it’s looking likely. We should take it seriously. That said, I think it’s time to move away from the ‘buy the dip’ habit we’ve leaned on during the bull market. […] It might not end up being a disaster, but focusing too much on potential gains could mean overlooking real risks. […] Bonds seem like a good bet, capital has to flow somewhere.” With respect to Bitcoin, Loukas underlines the difficult situation for investor with respect to Trump’s pro-BTC policy: Bitcoin’s tricky, instinct says it struggles, but I can see it holding up as a kind of digital gold, especially since the administration seems to want it to succeed, outside of trade policy stuff. Maybe there is some bias in that last statement.” Aksel Kibar (@TechCharts), a Chartered Market Technician and ex-fund manager, briefly affirmed Loukas’s stance by commenting, “Agreed.” Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bull Run Over? Watch This Key Price Meanwhile, LondonCryptoClub (@LDNCryptoClub) spotlighted new guidance from UBS global wealth management, which now expects the Federal Reserve to cut rates by 75–100 bps through the remainder of 2025. The analyst writes via X: “This is kind of the key for Bitcoin. If the Fed treats tariff induced inflation as ‘transitory’ [… ] and focuses on supporting growth, then real rates are coming way lower […] and Bitcoin will fly. Financial conditions are currently easing with lower dollar and yields (although keep an eye on credit spreads). […] Bitcoin front runs liquidity […] Ultimately, this all ends with the Fed being forced to be the liquidity providers of last resort […] Bitcoin will end this year significantly higher. Just the path is going to be a very volatile and choppy one.” Macro analyst Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) cautioned about the interplay between monetary easing and recession risk: “Fed cuts without recession are usually bullish. Fed cuts with recession are usually bearish. This was a major talking point in 2024.” Powell’s Speech: A Pivotal Moment In light of President Trump’s unexpected tariffs, Friday’s scheduled remarks by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have taken on renewed urgency. Powell had previously indicated that monetary policy remains restrictive, given inflation’s persistence above the Fed’s 2% target. Yet tariffs introduce a potential double bind: higher costs for consumers that could drive inflation further, alongside a drag on economic growth that complicates the labor market outlook. Andy Brenner of NatAlliance Securities described the speech as possibly “One of the most important Powell speeches in three years.” The Fed Chair is due to speak at 11:25 am ET.

Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett reported on X that an emergency letter had been submitted to the court, requesting permission to present what the author calls “decisive evidence in favor of the defendants and favor of liberty for the American people.” The letter was filed by Justin W. Keener, a private individual who claims to have relevant information involving physical investment contracts he has allegedly collected. However, the filing offers little clarity on what the so-called decisive evidence entails or how it would materially support Ripple’s defense in the closely watched SEC lawsuit. Terrett noted that the vague and unconventional nature of the submission raises questions about its legitimacy, especially given Keener’s legal history with the SEC. Keener had a previous run-in with the Commission, which sued him for acting as an unregistered dealer of penny stocks. The case ended with a court order requiring Keener to pay over $10 million in penalties. It will give the clerks a good laugh and end up in the court’s kook file. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) April 4, 2025 A Filing Met With Skepticism The vague and indirect nature of the submission has sparked skepticism among legal experts, who question its relevance to the central issues of the Ripple case. Former SEC Regional Director Marc Fagel, now a respected voice on regulatory matters, dismissed the filing with humor. Reacting to Terrett’s post, Fagel commented that the letter would “give the clerks a good laugh and end up in the court’s kook file,” implying it will have no legal bearing on the proceedings and will likely be summarily dismissed by the judge. Indeed, court systems regularly receive unsolicited or irrelevant filings from non-parties claiming to possess crucial evidence. Such documents rarely influence proceedings, especially in high-profile federal cases involving major regulatory bodies and corporate defendants. The courts typically reject filings that do not follow procedural norms or present legally substantiated arguments. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Case Remains on a Tense Timeline While the Keener filing may add a moment of levity to an otherwise tense and consequential case, it does little to change the stakes or direction of the SEC vs. Ripple litigation. Ripple remains locked in a battle over whether the sale of XRP constituted an unregistered securities offering, a case that has had profound implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. The outcome of this case is expected to bring much-needed legal clarity, potentially setting a landmark precedent for digital asset regulation in the United States. Observers remain keenly attuned to developments as the case nears what many hope will be a final resolution. Ripple’s legal team has maintained that XRP is not a security and has called the SEC’s enforcement action a case of regulatory overreach. For now, though, filings like Keener’s serve only as distractions, quickly dismissed by experts and unlikely to influence the court’s deliberations. The Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit remains a high-profile case, drawing intense interest from the cryptocurrency sector and the legal community. While most filings spark legal debate or hint at procedural progress, this latest submission from Justin W. Keener appears to be an outlier, drawing skepticism from credible sources like Eleanor Terrett and Marc Fagel. As the case progresses, the focus remains on legally sound arguments and judicial rulings, not unsubstantiated letters filed from the sidelines.

The unexpected twist, along with the upcoming launch of XRP futures on Coinbase, has raised concerns about its impact on the XRP price. With XRP struggling to hold the $2 support, these developments could trigger a major breakout or a sharp drop. Unusual Filing Claims ‘Decisive Evidence’ According to a recent tweet by journalist Eleanor Terrett, a new twist has emerged in the ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC.

Keener, doesn’t make clear what the so-called… pic.twitter.com/AQSDFIW6gi — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) April 3, 2025 Eleanor pointed to an emergency request that was filed on April 3, claiming to provide strong evidence in Ripple’s favor. However, this request came from Justin W. Keener, who suggested that his evidence is linked to physical investment contracts he has collected. However, the filing does not explain what this evidence is or how it might affect the case. Despite the lack of details, it has caught the attention of the crypto community. Perhaps, the timing of this filing is also crucial. Ripple’s case with the SEC is expected to reach a major milestone on April 16. Who Is Justin W. Keener? A deeper look into Keener’s background reveals a controversial history. He has had his legal troubles with the SEC, which previously sued him for operating as an unregistered penny stock dealer. The case resulted in a court order requiring Keener to pay over $10 million in penalties. Given his legal history with the SEC, his involvement in the Ripple case is raising questions about his true intentions. Launch of XRP Futures on Coinbase Another key development that could impact XRP’s price is the upcoming launch of XRP futures on Coinbase . The crypto exchange giant has filed with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to introduce XRP futures trading on April 21. This move is expected to attract institutional investors looking to manage risk through derivatives trading. XRP Price Analysis As of now, XRP’s price is stabilized near its $2 support , reflecting a rise of 2.7% in the last 24 hours, with a market cap hitting $122 billion. Looking at the daily chart pattern, if XRP drops below $2, it could fall sharply to $1.04, a possible 48% decline. Therefore, the key level to watch is the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). XRP has stayed above this $2 support for months, but if it breaks below, recent gains could be lost.

While Trump was on the world agenda with this statement, mutual tariffs caused sharp declines in both American stock markets and the Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency markets. While these declines turned the market upside down, Trump made a statement following the sharp declines in stock markets and the crypto market. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump said the collapse in markets due to tariffs imposed by the United States on its trading partners was as expected. Trump said the US economy has many problems, that tariffs are like surgery and that he now expects economic stability. “I think everything is going very well. The markets are going to explode, the stock market is going to explode. “There were a lot of problems in the economy. The patient was in serious condition. He had an operation. It will be a booming economy. It will be magnificent.” He added that if a country has something unusual to offer the United States, it would listen to offers to renegotiate tariffs. Trump, who said that many countries have called him since he announced the tariffs, said, “That's the beauty of what we do. We put ourselves in the driver's seat. If we had asked these countries to do us a favor, they would have said 'no.' Now they will do anything for us.” Trump also added that he is in favor of interest rate cuts. *Not investment advice Continue Reading: US President Donald Trump Talks About Bitcoin and Stock Market Drops!",Altcoin|Analysis|Bitcoin|Economy|News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BitcoinSistemi', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinsistemi,2025-04-04 09:42:07

Analyst Says Network Activity Will Decide Winners,https://thecoinrise.com/one-last-altcoin-rally-analyst-says-network-activity-will-decide-winners/,"The altcoin market may be heading into its final major rally of the current cycle, but only projects with genuine network engagement and utility are expected to benefit. That’s the latest take from Real Vision’s chief crypto analyst, Jamie Coutts, who recently discussed the state of crypto markets. Coutts believes that while a rally could be imminent, it’s unlikely to lift all boats this time. “I think there will be one more breadth thrust from altcoins,” said Coutts. “The real question is whether that rally sustains for six to twelve months.” He emphasized that only altcoins showing signs of life through renewed on-chain activity and user demand are likely to post meaningful gains. Altcoin markets are currently showing fatigue. Network usage has cooled considerably. For instance, Solana’s active addresses dropped to a weekly average of 9.5 million in February — a steep decline from November’s 15.6 million, according to blockchain data. A Rally Hinges on Bitcoin and On-Chain Data Despite the decline in user participation, Coutts remains optimistic. He anticipates a rebound in altcoins by June, assuming Bitcoin reclaims its all-time highs . “If Bitcoin reaches new highs by Q2, altcoins could follow,” he said, but stressed that traders should rely on a project’s actual usage, calling network activity the “north star” of crypto trading strategies. The broader on-chain landscape remains dominated by Ethereum, which commands over 55% of total value locked (TVL). Solana, BNB Smart Chain, Tron, and Bitcoin follow, with each holding single-digit shares. Meanwhile, the altcoin arena remains overcrowded — CoinGecko reports over 36 million tokens in existence as of January — further muddying the waters for retail investors looking to pick winners. Altcoin Weakness Concerns Adding to the uncertainty, typical indicators for predicting altcoin seasons are flashing red. Capriole Investments’ Altcoin Speculation Index has dropped to 12%, down more than 50% since Christmas. Ethereum’s own struggles — down 49% from its recent high — underscore the broader altcoin weakness. And while Bitcoin dominance hovers near 63% , its reliability as a signal has been questioned. “Bitcoin dominance no longer defines altseason — trading volume does,” noted CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Yu, suggesting that investor focus should shift to liquidity and engagement metrics instead.

On April 4, Bitfeed developer Mononaut shared that in the previous 24 hours, 256 Bitcoin ( BTC ) had been unstaked from the staking protocol. Mononaut said that the unstaking transactions paid 1.35 BTC in fees and consumed 1.318 Megavirtualbytes (MvB) of blockspace. This means the transactions generated high fees and occupied roughly a third of an entire Bitcoin block. The activity followed Babylon’s 600 million airdrop of its native token, BABY, which was distributed to early users and contributors. Related: Bitcoin L2 ’honeymoon phase’ is over, most projects will fail — Muneeb Ali Babylon airdrops 600 million tokens to early adopters In a previous Cointelegraph interview, Babylon co-founder Fisher Yu said that, unlike Ethereum and Solana, Bitcoin staking does not reward stakers in the chain’s native asset. Instead, they may get rewards in the form of the native token of the blockchain secured by the staked Bitcoin capital . On April 3, the Babylon Foundation announced the details of the airdrop program for its early adopters. The protocol said the airdrop was dedicated to its Phase 1 stakers, non-fungible token (NFT) holders and developers contributing to its ecosystem. The staking protocol said it was airdropping 600 million BABY tokens, 6% of its total supply; 30 million BABY were allocated to the protocol’s Pioneer Pass NFT holders, while 5 million BABY were slated for open-source contributors. The rest of the tokens were to be distributed among eligible stakers who participated in the protocol’s Phase 1. This included a stake participation airdrop of 30 million BABY, a base staking reward airdrop of 335 million BABY and a bonus staking reward airdrop for Phase 2 transition of 200 million BABY. While the platform distributed an airdrop for its early adopters, it clarified that it did not include wallet campaigns and liquid staking incentives in this airdrop event. In response to the airdrop, crypto exchange OKX listed the BABY token and USDT pair in pre-market futures. Pre-market futures allow traders to speculate on an asset’s future price. This allows investors to trade BABY futures before the asset becomes available in spot markets. Data platform DefiLlama shows that Babylon currently has a total value locked (TVL) of $4.29 billion. This represents 80% of the Bitcoin ecosystem’s overall TVL of $5.34 billion.

On an Apr. 4 post on X, blockchain analytics platform Onchain Lens reported that 425,266 Solana ( SOL ), worth roughly $49.78 million, was unstaked. This was the largest scheduled unlock of staked SOL until 2028. Soon after, 284,147 SOL were moved to top exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance, indicating a potential upcoming selling pressure. According to a report by @arkham , the largest staked unlock until 2028 has unstaked 425,266 $SOL ($49.78M) an hour ago. Of this amount, 284,147 $SOL ($33.27M) has already been moved to #Binance , #Kraken , and #Coinbase . https://t.co/Khd2xkI5b5 https://t.co/KU6541w1cf pic.twitter.com/2JEDkEcXaI — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) April 4, 2025 According to Arkham Intelligence, the addresses behind this unlock had originally staked the funds back in April 2021, when SOL was trading much lower. Their holdings have increased by 5.5x at current prices, making them more likely to take profits.

Over the past week, SOL has fallen 7%. Prices briefly dropped to $112.24, retesting a critical 12-month support level. Despite the downturn, the network’s fundamentals are still strong. Long-term confidence is shown by the nearly twofold increase in Solana’s total value locked since November 2024, reaching over 53 million SOL. Stablecoin activity on Solana has also increased, rising from $5 billion in January to $12.6 billion, as per DefiLlama data . However, decentralized finance activity has reduced. Decentralized exchanges volume dropped from $252 billion in January to $52 billion in March. On the technical front, Solana is displaying a neutral to bullish trend reversal. After testing the $114.34 support, Solana is currently trading at about $118.55. The next major level is 143.25, although the 128.79 resistance is still a key hurdle. At 43.6, the relative strength index indicates that SOL is still in the neutral-to-oversold range, suggesting a potential upside if buying pressure picks up. Solana technical analysis | Source: crypto.news Bollinger Bands, which show the price near the lower band, indicate a potential recovery. A rejection at the 50-day moving average could signal further drops. If SOL breaks the $128.79 resistance, it will probably move toward $143.25. However, if $114.34 is lost, it could retest its lower support around $112. A clear move above the 50-day MA would confirm the bullish momentum.

The unlocking of 379,700 SOL is creating additional selling pressure. A whale received 379,700 SOL, one of the biggest daily unlocks until 2028. Just hours after the SOL came out of a staking account, most of it was sent to Kraken, Coinbase, or other addresses. The whale’s wallet retains a balance of only 644.82 SOL, after holding for over two years. The whale’s wallet first received funding from an OpenSea NFT investor wallet, acquired just as SOL was coming out of its bear market. The whale could liquidate the holdings for a value of $44.47M, as SOL traded around $116.07. The whale selling coincides with a general downturn of the entire crypto market, as the Solana ecosystem seeks to retain its activity levels. The whale’s stake is the largest among all April 4 unlocks, which contain other large-scale staking entities. The market had to absorb 11.2M SOL in March, coming from the early wallets of FTX. The vested tokens were also used for staking, accruing additional rewards. The Solana chain retains an inflation rate of 4.62%, though sudden unlocks can cause additional selling pressure. For now, the SOL market absorbs the regular daily unlocks, which will continue with linear unlocks until 2030. The larger unlock precedes a series of additional inflows coming in April and May, mostly tied to the Alameda and FTX post-bankruptcy release of SOL. April as a whole has more planned unlocks, for a total of over 2.7M SOL to be freed for trading, followed by months of extremely slow supply growth. The latest unlocks increased the circulating SOL to over 514M tokens. In total, the Solana market will have to absorb an additional $7.5B in three months before ending the highly active series of unlocks. More whales liquidate their unlocked SOL On-chain data showed three additional large-scale sellers liquidated their SOL balance. One of the whales liquidated $9.47M in SOL, retaining a stake of 78,469 SOL. The next whale sold $3.53M worth of SOL, while retaining another 68,000 SOL in staking. The last whale sold 25,501 SOL estimated at $3M, and has no remaining SOL in staking . In total, Solana will distribute $200M worth of tokens to other whales and small holders, and selling may be unpredictable. For now, whales have shown they are ready to at least take some profits, in case SOL prices remain depressed. Despite the recent price drop, the four significant whales deposited SOL for staking in 2021, and have achieved on average 5.5X growth from their initial investment, based on Arkham Intelligence data . Not all whales from the same staking cohort have moved their tokens, with more SOL still sitting idle in stake accounts. However, the whales would have the right to move and allocate SOL, or sell the tokens on the open market. Can SOL rally after the latest unlock? For SOL, the latest inflows were the last cliff unlock for the years ahead, leaving the market with less tokens to absorb through linear inflows. SOL will still be in demand as a liquidity asset on DEX and for lending. Based on Santiment analysis , the Solana ecosystem is regaining attention and SOL is expected to stage a recovery. SOL is not yet in the oversold territory, but is getting closer to other oversold assets. SOL is still outside the oversold territory, but has higher relative strength compared to other crypto assets. | Source: Cryptowaves SOL open interest grew in the past day, from $2B to over $2.2B. Short positions have fallen to 21% , opening the door to potential long liquidations. For SOL, retail and crowd sentiment is slightly more bearish, while smart money is more bullish. Bearish predictions see SOL dip as low as $90 if selling from whales continues. Large-scale holders are also sending their SOL to exchanges outside the unlock schedule, as overall crypto activity has slowed down.

42892051,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146389,1743759911,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,SHOCKING Crypto Fraud: South Korean Man Jailed in $2M Investment Scam Promising Unrealistic Returns,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/south-korean-crypto-fraud-prison/,"In a stark reminder of the lurking dangers within the seemingly lucrative world of digital currencies, a South Korean man has been handed a prison sentence for perpetrating a multi-million dollar crypto fraud . This case serves as a chilling wake-up call for investors, highlighting the critical need for vigilance and skepticism in the face of enticing, yet often deceptive, investment opportunities. South Korean Court Jails Man for $2M Cryptocurrency Investment Scam The Changwon District Court in South Korea recently delivered a three-year prison sentence to a man in his 30s, found guilty of defrauding an investor of a staggering 2.93 billion won, equivalent to approximately $2.04 million. The verdict, reported by The Kookje Daily News, was based on violations of the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes, underscoring the severity with which South Korean authorities are treating financial crimes, especially those involving the burgeoning cryptocurrency investment sector. The convicted fraudster employed a classic tactic: building trust through deception. He presented himself as a wealthy and successful individual to lure the unsuspecting investor. The bait? Promises of unbelievably high returns – annual interest rates ranging from 30% to a jaw-dropping 50%. These figures, in hindsight, should have immediately raised red flags. However, the allure of quick and substantial profits can often cloud judgment, even in seasoned investors. Over a series of 324 transactions, the victim transferred funds to the fraudster, believing his money was being channeled into lucrative cryptocurrency investment ventures. The reality, however, was far from the promised prosperity. Instead of legitimate investments, the funds were misappropriated, leaving the investor with significant financial losses and the perpetrator facing the consequences of his deceitful actions. The Deceptive Lure of High Annual Interest in Crypto One of the most critical takeaways from this case is the spotlight it shines on the dangers of unrealistic promises in the crypto scam landscape. The promise of 30% to 50% annual interest rates is not just ambitious; it’s often a glaring indication of a potential scam. Legitimate investment opportunities, especially in volatile markets like cryptocurrency, rarely, if ever, guarantee such exorbitant returns. Consider these points regarding high-yield promises: Unrealistic Returns: Consistently achieving 30-50% annual returns in any market, let alone the highly fluctuating crypto market, is exceptionally difficult and improbable for sustained periods. Ponzi Schemes: Such promises are frequently associated with Ponzi schemes, where early investors are paid with funds from later investors, rather than actual profits from legitimate investment activities. This model is unsustainable and eventually collapses. Risk Amplification: To generate such high returns, investments would need to carry extremely high risk. Legitimate investment managers are transparent about risk, not guarantees. Emotional Seduction: Scammers exploit the emotional desire for quick wealth, bypassing rational financial assessment with enticing figures. Spotting Red Flags: How to Avoid Crypto Scams Like This One This South Korean case is not an isolated incident. Crypto fraud is a global issue, and investors must equip themselves with the knowledge to identify and avoid scams. Here are some crucial red flags to watch out for, drawing lessons from this unfortunate event: Guaranteed Returns: As emphasized, be extremely suspicious of anyone guaranteeing profits, especially fixed high percentage annual returns in cryptocurrency or any investment for that matter. Unsolicited Offers: Be wary of unsolicited investment offers, particularly those that come through social media, messaging apps, or cold calls. Legitimate opportunities are rarely presented this way. Pressure Tactics: Scammers often use high-pressure tactics, urging you to invest quickly before the “opportunity” disappears. Genuine investment decisions should be made after careful consideration, not under duress. Lack of Transparency: If the investment scheme lacks transparency about where your money is going and how it’s being used, it’s a major warning sign. Ask for detailed information and verifiable documentation. Unregistered Entities: Verify if the entity offering the investment is registered with relevant financial authorities. Unregistered entities are a significant risk. Overly Complex Explanations: While cryptocurrency can be complex, be wary of schemes that use overly complicated jargon or explanations to confuse you and avoid answering direct questions about the investment strategy. The Landscape of Cryptocurrency Investment in South Korea South Korea is known for its high adoption rate of cryptocurrency and a vibrant, albeit sometimes volatile, South Korea crypto market. This enthusiasm, unfortunately, also makes it a target for fraudsters. The South Korean government has been actively working to regulate the crypto space and protect investors, but the onus ultimately lies on individuals to exercise caution and due diligence. The legal action taken in this case demonstrates South Korea’s commitment to cracking down on crypto fraud . However, prevention is always better than cure. Investors in South Korea, and globally, need to be increasingly aware of the risks associated with cryptocurrency investment and approach opportunities with a healthy dose of skepticism. Actionable Insights: Protecting Your Crypto Investments So, what can you do to safeguard your hard-earned money in the world of crypto scam and investments? Here are some actionable insights: Educate Yourself: Understand the basics of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Knowledge is your first line of defense. Due Diligence: Thoroughly research any investment opportunity before committing funds. Verify the legitimacy of the platform or individual offering the investment. Start Small: If you’re venturing into crypto investments, start with small amounts you can afford to lose. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, especially in high-risk ventures. Use Reputable Platforms: Stick to well-known and regulated cryptocurrency exchanges and platforms. Seek Professional Advice: Consult with a qualified financial advisor before making significant investment decisions, especially in emerging and volatile asset classes like cryptocurrency. Report Suspicious Activity: If you encounter a suspected scam, report it to the relevant authorities and warn others in the crypto community. A Grim Reminder and a Call for Vigilance The sentencing of the South Korean man to prison for crypto fraud serves as a sobering reminder of the risks lurking in the cryptocurrency world. While the potential for high returns exists, so does the potential for significant losses due to scams and fraudulent schemes. This case underscores the critical need for investors to be vigilant, skeptical, and informed. The promise of easy riches should always be met with caution, and thorough due diligence must be the cornerstone of any cryptocurrency investment strategy.

The tech-heavy index lost 5.5% on Thursday, just outside the top 20 worst single-day drawdowns since 2000, according to Investing.com. Most of the largest drawdowns occurred during the dot-com crash of 2000-2001 and the 2008 global financial crisis. Other equity measures also suffered, with the S&P 500 index falling almost 5%. In contrast, the bitcoin ( BTC ) price, which is typically correlated with U.S. equities over short timeframes, bucked the trend. The largest cryptocurrency, which tumbled immediately after the announcement while stock markets were closed, rose 0.7% the following day, with momentum carrying into Friday, according to Glassnode data. Bitcoin is now trading above $84,000 compared with about $87,000 before Trump started speaking. Nasdaq futures, meanwhile, are lower ahead of the U.S. jobs report due later in the day. Bitcoin made its 2025 low in mid-March at around $76,000, whereas the Nasdaq hit a low on Thursday . Year-to-date, bitcoin is outperforming the Nasdaq, losing 10% against the index's 11%. Analyst Caleb Franzen highlighted bitcoin's relative strength compared with the S&P 500 in this risk-off environment, noting its resilience around the 200-day moving average. ""It's pretty remarkable to see that bitcoin is up +3.4% today relative to the S&P 500, particularly in a risk-off environment.

The S&P 500 closed down nearly 5% lower, while the Nasdaq dropped nearly 6%. In the midst of this, Bitcoin was up 0.5%, and has climbed around 1.5% early on Friday. Worst stock market plunge since COVID Markets went into a headlong plunge on Thursday as they reacted to the ruinous tariffs that the Trump administration had imposed on the rest of the world. Initially expecting around 10%, the market was then shocked to learn that much higher tariffs would be applied to a plethora of countries that enjoyed a trade surplus with the US. Source: TradingView Thursday’s plunge in the S&P 500 was the worst since June 2020, when fears of a second wave of COVID hit the U.S. stock market. The cause of the latest big reversal was much to do with the complete shock that the severity of the tariffs had on the market. 10% across the board was one thing, but the extra swingeing tariffs added to selected countries was simply staggering. Global supply chains are in absolute disarray, and it is going to take a huge amount of negotiation and diplomacy to get things back on track - although it might be argued that the US tariffs move will have far-reaching consequences for future global trade. Fed Chair Powell speech takes on added importance Jerome Powell, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, will make a speech later today. After Thursday’s market plunge, and with U.S. CPI data to be announced next week, this speech has taken on added importance. With the economy in disarray, and certain areas of it probably already in recession, the Fed chair may have his hand forced, with cuts potentially to come sooner, and in greater measure. $BTC price holds up Source: TradingView The short-term chart for Bitcoin shows just how well the price has held up while all hell was being let loose in the U.S. stock markets. In fact, the price is once more approaching the descending trendline. The $BTC bulls have had to stop right here as they have run into resistance, and this continues up to $85,240. However, on their side, they have the Stochastic RSI indicators rising fresh from the bottom, bringing momentum. Time will tell whether the price breaks through, or whether it is rejected and the sideways chop continues. Can the $BTC bulls break through the descending trendline? Source: TradingView The weekly chart for Bitcoin is still on a knife edge. There are three days left in the week and the bulls need to hold the price where it is in order to pass through the descending trendline. If the trendline can be breached, and the next weekly candle is able to confirm above, it could be off to the races. Having said that, if the bulls are unable to push on through, there is really only one more week left in this descending triangle pattern. If the support fails then $70,000 beckons.

Although the Pi Network listing on Binance has faced multiple delays, the community is still hopeful for a Coinbase listing. On March 14—Pi Day—Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, posted a tweet featuring Pi’s logo, stating, “We take Pi Day very seriously at Coinbase.” A Coinbase listing could provide a major liquidity boost, pumping up the Pi Coin price higher to $1 and beyond. The exchange often considers community engagement when adding new assets, making Pi Network’s 60 million+ user base a strong factor in its favor. Additionally, such a listing could significantly boost PI cryptocurrency’s adoption in both U.S. and global markets. This would be a historic milestone for the ecosystem, increasing the visibility and accessibility to millions of crypto users worldwide. While Coinbase stirs speculation, Binance has yet to make any official comments regarding a potential $PI listing. Pi Coin Price Drop to $0.3 Coming? As the Pi Coin price continues to lose crucial support levels, analysts are turning pessimistic about it moving ahead. Crypto analyst Moon JEFF has projected that Pi Network price could drop to $0.30 if exchange deposits continue at their current rate. More than 375 million PI tokens have already moved to exchanges. Moon JEFF notes that with total supply reaching 500 million $PI, the token’s price could stabilize around $0.30. This is similar to our Pi Coin price prediction , which shows that altcoin to trade under $0.40 for the month of April. Source: Moon JEFF A Major Challenge for the Core Team The Pi Community backlash is growing stronger with every passing day as the altcoin selling pressure increases. Popular community member Dr Altcoin stated: “Pi’s price has been in free fall, hovering around $0.5. If this was the end goal, why did the Pi community wait six years? Pi could have easily reached this value if it had launched in 2022”. He further stated that major cryptocurrency exchanges are unlikely to list PI crypto unless the Pi Core Team (PCT) provides full transparency regarding its tokenomics. The two major challenges as highlighted by Dr Altcoin , are: At current low prices, Pi holders may struggle to engage with decentralized applications (DApps) within the Pi ecosystem. If these challenges persist, a significant portion of Pi users could sell off their holdings and migrate to other crypto projects. The analyst added that the only viable path forward for the Pi Core Team, without relying on major exchange listings, is to burn billions of Pi coins from the Pi Foundation wallets.

With the market evolving rapidly, certain lesser-known coins are poised for significant growth. This article uncovers five promising digital assets that have the potential to transform a modest investment into a substantial fortune, capturing the opportunities that lie ahead. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE , Dogwifhat , and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 – $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 – $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges AVAX: The Fast and Green Blockchain Shaping the Future of Crypto Avalanche, known by its token AVAX, is a Layer-1 blockchain that’s turning heads for its speed and eco-friendliness. It boasts low fees and can handle up to 4,500 transactions per second. This means quick transactions without the high costs found on some other networks. A standout feature is its ability to let users create custom subnets, allowing for tailored blockchain solutions. Avalanche uses a mix of consensus mechanisms to finalize transactions in under two seconds. Its platform includes three chains—X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—each designed for different tasks, from basic transactions to running smart contracts. The potential of AVAX lies in its technology and real-world uses. Its native token isn’t just for transactions; it’s also used for staking to secure the network and for operating subnets. This gives it strong roles in payments and network governance. In the current market, where speed and sustainability are valued, AVAX stands out. Compared to other coins, it offers a mix of features that could drive wider adoption. With growing interest in efficient and green blockchain solutions, AVAX looks attractive for those eyeing the next big thing in crypto. Chainlink: The Bridge Connecting Blockchains to Reality Chainlink helps smart contracts access real-world data. Smart contracts are like digital agreements on the blockchain, but they can’t reach outside their network on their own. Chainlink changes that by using oracles—special tools that fetch data from the outside world. These oracles gather information, check it for accuracy, and deliver it securely to the smart contracts. This means that smart contracts can now interact with external data sources, APIs, and systems, making them more useful and powerful. The potential of Chainlink is significant. By connecting blockchains to real-world data, it opens up new possibilities for decentralized applications in finance, supply chain, and more. The LINK token is at the heart of this system. It rewards those who provide accurate data and helps keep the network secure through staking. In the current market, LINK stands out because it has a clear purpose and growing demand. As more projects need reliable data for their smart contracts, Chainlink’s role becomes even more important. Compared to other coins without practical uses, LINK looks attractive due to its real-world applications and the essential service it provides to the blockchain ecosystem. POL Token: Unlocking the Future of the Polygon Ecosystem The POL Token is the heartbeat of the Polygon network. It powers many operations within this expanding ecosystem. Holders can stake their tokens to secure the network and earn rewards. By staking, they help keep the network safe and efficient. The token also gives holders a voice in governance. They can vote on proposals that shape the future of Polygon. Additionally, POL acts as a key to exclusive services and features, offering unique benefits to its holders. As the Polygon network grows, the potential for the POL Token increases. With more services and applications joining the ecosystem, demand for POL may rise. This could boost its value over time. Compared to other tokens, POL stands out due to its strong utility and active community. In the current market, where users seek tokens with real uses and growth potential, POL looks attractive. Market trends show a shift towards networks offering scalability and low fees—areas where Polygon excels. Therefore, POL could be a promising option for those interested in the evolving world of decentralized applications. Polkadot’s DOT: Connecting Blockchains and Boosting Speed Imagine a world where different blockchains can talk to each other seamlessly. That’s the vision behind Polkadot and its cryptocurrency, DOT. Polkadot is a decentralized protocol that lets different blockchains, like Ethereum and Bitcoin, share information and value without needing a middleman. It uses a special feature called parachains to make transactions faster and more scalable. This means Polkadot can handle many more transactions than Bitcoin or Ethereum, making it a promising solution for the future of blockchain technology. The potential of Polkadot lies in its ability to connect different blockchains, paving the way for a more unified and efficient crypto world. DOT, the token of Polkadot, isn’t just for buying and selling; it’s used for governance and staking within the network. This gives holders a say in how the protocol develops and ensures the security of transactions. In the current market, Polkadot stands out for its innovative approach to scalability and interoperability. While other cryptocurrencies face challenges with speed and high fees, Polkadot offers a promising alternative. As the crypto market evolves, DOT could become an attractive option for those looking to invest in the future of interconnected blockchains. Conclusion While AVAX, LINK, POL, and DOT offer strong prospects, XYZVerse (XYZ) uniquely blends memes and sports, aiming for 20,000% growth in the current bull run.

Major financial institution UBS is signaling a significant shift in currency strategy, and it could impact your investment decisions. UBS is advising investors to reduce their holdings in Asia FX and increase exposure to G3 currencies. Let’s dive into what this means for you and how you can navigate these potentially turbulent waters. Why is UBS Recommending Selling Asia FX? UBS, a global wealth management giant, is sending a clear message: it’s time to be cautious about Asia FX . But why this bearish outlook? Several key factors are driving this recommendation, reflecting broader shifts in the global economic landscape. Let’s break down the main reasons: Global Economic Slowdown Fears: Concerns about a worldwide economic slowdown are growing. This impacts Asian economies, which are heavily reliant on global trade and demand. A slowdown typically weakens export-oriented economies and their currencies. Stronger G3 Currencies: On the other side of the equation, G3 currencies (US Dollar, Euro, and Japanese Yen) are often seen as safe-haven assets during times of economic uncertainty. Increased demand for safety boosts these currencies. Interest Rate Differentials: Central banks in G3 nations, particularly the US Federal Reserve, have been aggressively raising interest rates to combat inflation. This makes G3 currencies more attractive for investors seeking higher yields compared to some Asian economies where interest rate hikes may be less aggressive or even paused. Geopolitical Risks: Ongoing geopolitical tensions and uncertainties further fuel demand for safe-haven currencies like the US Dollar and Japanese Yen, impacting Asia FX negatively. China’s Economic Situation: The health of the Chinese economy is a significant factor for Asia as a whole. Any slowdown or instability in China can have ripple effects across the region, impacting Asia FX valuations. Understanding Asia FX and G3 Currencies: A Quick Primer Before we delve deeper, let’s clarify what we mean by Asia FX and G3 currencies : Asia FX: This term refers to a basket of Asian currencies. Commonly included are currencies like the Korean Won (KRW), Taiwan Dollar (TWD), Singapore Dollar (SGD), Thai Baht (THB), Indonesian Rupiah (IDR), Malaysian Ringgit (MYR), and Indian Rupee (INR). These currencies are tied to the economic performance of their respective Asian nations. G3 Currencies: This acronym represents the three major global currencies: the US Dollar (USD), the Euro (EUR), and the Japanese Yen (JPY). They are considered the world’s most liquid and widely traded currencies, often acting as benchmarks and safe havens. The UBS advice essentially suggests shifting investments away from Asian currencies towards these major global currencies. This is based on their assessment of the current and anticipated economic climate. Navigating the Forex Market: What Does This Mean for Traders? For those involved in Forex market trading, the UBS recommendation provides a crucial signal. Here’s how traders can interpret and potentially act on this information: Consider Shorting Asia FX Pairs: UBS’s advice directly suggests exploring opportunities to short Asia FX against G3 currencies . This means betting that Asian currencies will weaken relative to the US Dollar, Euro, or Japanese Yen. For example, you might consider shorting USD/KRW, EUR/SGD, or JPY/THB. Focus on Safe-Haven Trades: The emphasis on G3 currencies highlights the importance of safe-haven assets in the current environment. Traders can increase their positions in USD, EUR, and JPY, especially during periods of heightened market volatility. Monitor Economic Data and Central Bank Actions: Staying informed is paramount. Closely watch economic data releases from both Asian economies and G3 nations. Pay particular attention to central bank announcements regarding interest rate policy, as these are key drivers of currency movements. Risk Management is Crucial: Currency trading is inherently risky. Implement robust risk management strategies, including setting stop-loss orders and managing leverage carefully. Market conditions can change rapidly, and protecting your capital is essential. Diversification Remains Key: While UBS suggests underweighting Asia FX , complete abandonment might not be necessary for all investors. Diversification across different asset classes and currencies remains a sound investment principle. Consider this advice as a strategic shift, not a complete exit. Investment Strategy Implications: Beyond Forex Trading The implications of UBS’s advice extend beyond just short-term Forex market trading. It has broader ramifications for overall investment strategy . Here’s how investors can consider this advice in their portfolio construction: Re-evaluate Asian Equity Exposure: A weaker Asia FX can impact the profitability of Asian companies, particularly those with significant dollar-denominated debt or import costs. Investors should re-assess their exposure to Asian equities and consider hedging currency risks. Consider Fixed Income Adjustments: In the fixed income space, the relative attractiveness of Asian bonds versus G3 bonds might shift. Higher interest rates in G3 nations could make their bonds more appealing compared to some Asian counterparts, especially when factoring in potential currency depreciation. Strategic Asset Allocation Review: UBS’s recommendation is a signal to review your overall strategic asset allocation. Are you overweight in emerging markets, particularly Asia? Is your currency exposure aligned with your risk tolerance and market outlook? This might be a good time for portfolio rebalancing. Long-Term vs. Short-Term Perspective: It’s crucial to distinguish between short-term tactical adjustments and long-term strategic allocations. While UBS’s advice is pertinent for the current market environment, long-term investors should consider the cyclical nature of markets and the potential for future Asian economic recovery. Challenges and Considerations When Selling Asia FX While UBS’s advice is noteworthy, it’s essential to acknowledge the challenges and considerations involved in selling Asia FX : Transaction Costs: Frequent trading and currency conversions can incur transaction costs that eat into potential profits. Consider these costs when implementing any trading strategy. Market Volatility: Forex market is known for its volatility. Unexpected events or economic data releases can trigger sharp currency swings, potentially impacting short positions in Asia FX . Timing is Key: Successfully executing a currency trading strategy requires precise timing. Market sentiment can shift rapidly, and being late to the trade can reduce profitability or even lead to losses. Geopolitical Surprises: Unforeseen geopolitical events can significantly impact currency valuations. Events in Asia, such as political instability or regional conflicts, could create unexpected volatility in Asia FX . Local Market Nuances: Asia FX is not a monolithic entity. Each Asian currency has its own unique drivers and dynamics. A blanket approach to selling all Asia FX might not be optimal. A nuanced understanding of individual Asian economies and currencies is crucial. Actionable Insights: Implementing a Strategic Shift So, how can you translate UBS’s advice into actionable steps? Here are some key insights to consider: Conduct Thorough Research: Don’t blindly follow any single piece of advice. Do your own due diligence. Research the economic outlook for Asian economies and G3 nations. Analyze currency trends and market sentiment. Consult Financial Professionals: Seek advice from qualified financial advisors who can provide personalized guidance based on your risk profile and investment goals. Start Small and Test the Waters: If you’re considering implementing a new currency trading strategy, start with small positions and gradually increase exposure as you gain confidence and experience. Stay Disciplined and Patient: Investment strategy and currency trading require discipline and patience. Avoid emotional decision-making and stick to your plan. Markets can be unpredictable, and patience is often rewarded. Continuously Monitor and Adapt: The global economic landscape is constantly evolving. Continuously monitor market developments, economic data, and geopolitical events. Be prepared to adapt your strategy as needed. Conclusion: A Prudent Approach to Currency Markets UBS’s recommendation to sell Asia FX against G3 currencies is a significant signal in the current global economic environment. It reflects concerns about economic slowdown, the strength of safe-haven currencies, and shifting interest rate dynamics. For traders and investors, this advice warrants careful consideration. While it’s not a guarantee of future market movements, it underscores the need for a prudent and strategic approach to currency trading and investment strategy in these uncertain times. By understanding the underlying factors and implementing sound risk management practices, you can navigate the Forex market effectively and potentially capitalize on emerging opportunities. Remember, staying informed and adaptable is your greatest asset in the ever-changing world of finance.

BTCFi is a new technological paradigm that aims to bring decentralized finance capabilities to Bitcoin’s base layer. It is one of the fastest-growing crypto sectors, reaching a total value locked (TVL) of over $8.6 billion. The growing value of BTCFi, “along with potential interest rate cuts, may reinforce positive sentiment for Bitcoin in the medium and long term,” Binance Research wrote in a report shared with Cointelegraph. Bitcoin DeFi, total value locked, 2025 chart. Source: Binance Research If the BTCFi sector’s growth trajectory continues, it could open up “new opportunities for Bitcoin holders to generate yield through lending, liquidity provision, and other DeFi mechanisms,” a Binance spokesperson told Cointelegraph, adding: “This may contribute to a shift in how BTC is perceived — from a passive store-of-value to a productive on-chain asset. While it’s too early to determine the full impact, these evolving use cases could support broader adoption and, over time, strengthen demand.” Related: Bitcoin price can hit $250K in 2025 if Fed shifts to QE: Arthur Hayes Interest in BTCFi surged after April 2024’s Bitcoin halving , which introduced the Runes protocol, the first fungible token standard on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Curious to know more! Read on! Is Bitcoin Really Independent? Bitcoin is one of the digital assets that has benefited from the change in the political climate of the US. At the start of November 5, 2024, the Bitcoin price was as low as $67,772.62. Between November 5 and 22, 2024, alone, the BTC market surged by over 45.80%. On December 17, 2024, it reached the peak of the year of $108,389.70. During early January 2025, the Bitcoin market was oscillating inside a range of $89,310 and $106,395.41. On January 20, it marked a new all-time high of $109K . After the inauguration of Donald Trump as the president of the United States – particularly after his announcement of his aggressive tariff policy, the market lost its upward momentum , mirroring the general trend in the US stock market. Since February, the market has slipped over 18.49%, triggering serious concerns about its status as a trustworthy hedge against market uncertainty. The development has triggered heated debates on whether Bitcoin is an independent asset or not. Short-Term vs Long-Term: Bitcoin’s Double Personality Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor, dismissing all the statements questioning the credibility of Bitcoin as a reliable hedge against market uncertainty, states that the correction between Bitcoin and the US stock market is a temporary phenomena. Bitcoin trades like a risk asset short term because it's the most liquid, salable, 24/7 asset on Earth. In times of panic, traders sell what they can, not what they want to. Doesn’t mean it’s correlated long-term—just means it’s always available. — Michael Saylor (@saylor) April 4, 2025 He argues that Bitcoin’s high liquidity and 24/7 availability make it a convenient asset to sell during market downturns. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin ETFs Face $100M Outflows as Markets Plunge Following Trump’s Tariff Shock , He claims that when people panic, they sell what they can, and Bitcoin is always able to be sold. He emphasises that this short-term correlation does not mean Bitcoin is inherently tied to the stock market in the long term. He reinforces the idea that long term, Bitcoin can still be a non correlated asset – an independent asset. In 2024, the Bitcoin market witnessed a growth of 121.1%. During the same year, the S&P 500 index only experienced a rise of 24.05% and the Nasdaq 100 just 27.10%. The gold market, during the period, saw a surge of just 27.54%. In conclusion, as discussions around Bitcoin’s market behaviour continue, one thing is clear: its short-term volatility does not undermine its long-term potential. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

By 2028, the EOS price value can reach a maximum of $3.26. The EOS price in 2031 could reach a maximum possible level of $5.30 and an average forecast price of $5.10. EOS , a completely decentralized network, favors the evolution and expansion stages of other bigger decentralized applications (dApps). It offers multitudes of benefits in terms of efficiency, user empowerment, and the ability to provide various services. The network has experienced a long series of developments since its initial launch in the cryptocurrency market in 2017. Since then, it has reached new highs, featuring the monumental $4 billion Initial Coin Offering (ICO) as its best. However, it still falls behind in its claim of establishing itself as an “Ethereum Killer”, as its stability has remained questionable. Can EOS reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the EOS price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency EOS Token EOS Price $0.826 Market Cap $1.29B Trading Volume $584.59M Circulating Supply 1.55B EOS All-time High $22.89 (Apr 29, 2018) All-time Low $0.4802 (Oct 23, 2017) 24-hour High $0.8702 24-hour Low $0.7835 EOS price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 6.72% 50-Day SMA $0.579171 14-Day RSI 52.86 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 26 (Fear) Green Days 18/30 (60%) 200-Day SMA $0.67959 EOS price analysis: EOS corrects at $0.826 following a sharp bullish ascent TL;DR Breakdown : EOS price analysis revealed a downtrend at $0.826. It has lost 4.52% of its value in 24 hours. EOS coin price faces resistance at $0.865. On April 4, 2025, EOS price analysis revealed a bearish trend. Its value dipped to $0.826 following the bullish run. Overall, the cryptocurrency lost 4.24% of its value. Despite today’s downswing, the market trends remained relatively bullish in the past week. EOS 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of the EOS coin confirmed a bearish market trend for the cryptocurrency. The distance between the Bollinger bands defines market volatility. This distance is widening as volatility increases. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, indicating a previous resistance, has shifted to a $0.811 high. Its lower limit, serving as the support band, has moved to $0.404. EOS/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator hovers in the overbought region. The indicator’s score dropped to 74.96 during the day. This confirms a bearish victory for the day, as the coin value decreased. The selling activities have grown as the market stabilized, but the coin remains overbought. EOS /USD 4-hour price chart The four-hour price analysis of the EOS coin also confirmed a downward trend for the cryptocurrency. Its price plummeted to $0.826 over the last four hours. A red candlestick on the price chart signifies an intensifying selling momentum. The Bollinger bands have widened as volatility is high. This condition hints at a higher market unpredictability for the next few hours. Moving on, the upper Bollinger band is at $0.909, indicating resistance.

EOS price analysis is bearish. Its value dipped to $0.826 in the past 24 hours. The currency dropped by 4.52% in value. Technical indicators give a positive verdict. The price charts present a bearish trend for the day. Is EOS a good investment? EOS has seen more green days in the last month. The coin’s price decreased by 35% over the last year. However, the circumstances can change, and a recovery cannot be ruled out. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2025), potentially pushing the EOS above $1. Why is EOS down? EOS is in descent with bearish pressure. The coin decreased to $0.826 in the past 24 hours. EOS price will decrease further if further pressure from the sellers is experienced. Will EOS reach $2? The highest price that EOS observed was $1.34 in December; EOS is sweating to break this level. Suppose the broader cryptocurrency market moves in a bullish direction. In that case, EOS may also follow the trend and is expected to reach near the $2 level by the end of 2027 if everything remains favorable. Will EOS reach $5? EOS was last seen above the $5 level in November 2021. Since then, the EOS value has plummeted significantly; however, the coin is expected to surpass $5 again by the end of 2031. Will EOS reach $10? According to the EOS price prediction, EOS may not achieve the $10 level in the next five years. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $10, possibly after 2035. How high could EOS go? EOS is expected to reach a high price of $5.30 by the end of 2031. Is EOS a dead coin? No, EOS is not a dead coin because it still has an active community. EOS has good brand recognition and is the 63rd ranked cryptocurrency. It also observed good bullish sentiment in November last year when the entire crypto market turned green. Is EOS a buy or sell? Considering its active community and ongoing development with potential future breakthroughs, EOS looks like a good buy option, despite the fact that it observed some price stagnation in the past. (Remember, this is not investment advice.) Does EOS have a good long-term Future? According to The Motley Fool, a private financial and investing advice company based in Virginia, EOS is a “very risky choice.” The publication says EOS’s future is uncertain, given the scandals and problems surrounding the EOS Foundation and Block—One blockchain company. However, the market speculates that EOS will reach above $5.30 by 2031, but the speculations can change at any time.

EOS historic price sentiment EOS price history In 2018, the EOS ICO made history by raising a staggering $4 billion, the largest initial coin offering ever. After this success, EOS’s cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 5 by market cap. However, by late 2021, the price of the EOS token had fallen from $10 in June 2018 to $4.40 due to a declining user base. In 2022, EOS experienced significant price swings. It peaked at around $3.27 and dropped to a low of about $0.81. On average, EOS traded at approximately $1.59. In 2023, EOS saw even lower prices, reaching a maximum price of $1.33. The token dipped to as low as $0.53 between August and September due to less buying of EOS tokens. On average, EOS traded at roughly $0.84 and closed the year at $0.8450. In Q1 2024, EOS’s price fluctuated between $0.65 and $1.30, with the lowest prices in January. By February and March, prices began to stabilize, averaging around $1.02​. EOS reached $1.15 on April 12, 2024, but soon declined below $1, maintaining an average price of about $0.8 throughout May. In June, EOS fell from $0.8142 to $0.5772, while July saw further loss with the token’s value decreasing to $0.4808. However, by mid-July 2024, EOS recovered back to $0.6100, and on August 23, EOS closed at $0.5566. In September 2024, EOS further dipped near the $0.4600 range, while October also observed the same pattern with prices mostly trending near the $0.450 range. Market sentiment changed in November, and a strong bullish trend was observed throughout the month, and the coin peaked at $1.36 on December 6. Following the late December correction, EOS then recovered into 2025 above the $0.766 mark in January but came down to $0.593 in February. In March, EOS dipped down to the $0.456 level, but it recovered back to the $0.67 level at the start of April.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-04 10:04:00

Recently, an address associated with World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a decentralized finance (DeFi) project reportedly connected to the Trump family, made headlines. On-chain analyst Onchain Lens flagged an intriguing USDT transfer of 213,159 USDT from a WLFI-linked address to a wallet associated with the Americana NFT deployer. Let’s dive deeper into what this transfer could signify and what it means for the involved parties and the broader crypto landscape. What’s the Buzz About this USDT Transfer? The core of this story revolves around a substantial USDT transfer . Tether (USDT) is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, making it a popular choice for crypto transactions due to its price stability. A transfer of 213,159 USDT is not a small amount, and when it involves projects with known associations, it naturally attracts attention. Here’s a breakdown of the key entities involved: World Liberty Financial (WLFI): A decentralized finance (DeFi) project. DeFi projects aim to offer financial services without traditional intermediaries like banks. WLFI’s association with the Trump family adds a layer of political and public interest to its activities. Americana NFTs: Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) representing digital ownership of unique items. Americana NFTs likely focus on themes related to American culture, history, or memorabilia. The connection to the deployer wallet suggests a potential partnership or investment. Onchain Lens: The on-chain analyst who first reported this transaction on X (formerly Twitter), highlighting the importance of blockchain analytics in uncovering crypto movements. Delving into WLFI Crypto: More Than Just DeFi? WLFI crypto , or World Liberty Financial, positions itself within the burgeoning DeFi space.

Trump Family Connection: The rumored association with the Trump family elevates its profile and invites scrutiny from both supporters and critics. This connection, whether direct or indirect, is a significant factor in the public perception of WLFI. Transparency in DeFi: While DeFi aims for decentralization and transparency, the specific nature of WLFI’s operations and its relationship with the Trump family remain areas of public interest and speculation. The transfer of a substantial amount of USDT raises questions about WLFI’s financial activities and strategic direction. Is this a routine operational move, or does it signal something more significant? Americana NFTs: Tapping into Patriotism and Digital Collectibles? Americana NFTs represent a fascinating intersection of digital collectibles and American-themed content. NFTs have exploded in popularity, offering a way to own unique digital assets, and Americana NFTs tap into a specific cultural and patriotic niche.

Potential Use Cases: Beyond collecting, Americana NFTs could have utility in virtual worlds, games, or as membership tokens within Americana-themed communities. The receipt of 213,159 USDT by the Americana NFT deployer wallet suggests a significant financial inflow for this project. What could be the purpose of this funding? Unpacking the Trump Family Crypto Link: Speculation or Substance? The mention of Trump family crypto connections adds a layer of political intrigue to this USDT transfer. It’s important to approach such associations with a balanced perspective. Here’s what we need to consider regarding the Trump family link to WLFI: Reported Association: News outlets and crypto analysts have reported on the alleged connection between WLFI and the Trump family. However, the exact nature and extent of this connection require further clarification.

This attention can be both beneficial and challenging. Impact on Perception: The Trump family name carries significant brand recognition and evokes strong opinions. This association can influence how WLFI is perceived by different segments of the crypto community and the general public. Is the USDT transfer related to the Trump family’s potential involvement in the crypto space, or is it purely a business transaction between WLFI and the Americana NFT project? The answers remain speculative at this point. Analyzing the DeFi Project Transfer: Possible Scenarios This DeFi project transfer of USDT could have several interpretations. Let’s explore some potential scenarios: Scenario Description Implications Investment/Partnership WLFI investing in or partnering with the Americana NFT project. Could signal a strategic alliance between the DeFi project and the NFT initiative, potentially for cross-promotion or integration of services. Operational Funding The USDT transfer is for operational expenses or development funding for Americana NFTs. Indicates that WLFI is providing financial support to the Americana NFT project, possibly as part of a larger agreement. Strategic Asset Allocation WLFI reallocating USDT as part of its broader asset management strategy, with Americana NFTs being a beneficiary. Suggests that Americana NFTs are considered a valuable asset within WLFI’s portfolio. Market Making/Liquidity Provision The USDT is intended to provide liquidity for the Americana NFT marketplace or trading activities. Aims to facilitate trading and increase the liquidity of Americana NFTs in the market. Without further official statements from WLFI or Americana NFTs, the exact reason for this transfer remains open to interpretation. However, on-chain data provides valuable clues for understanding crypto market dynamics. Conclusion: Unveiling the Crypto Puzzle The transfer of 213,159 USDT from a WLFI-linked address to the Americana NFT deployer wallet is undoubtedly an intriguing development in the crypto world.

Amid the current surge, a top market expert has further fueled discussions with his bold prediction, hinting towards a potential DOGE rally to $2 by this month’s end. So, here we explore the recent performance and the likely future movements of the leading dog-themed meme coin. Dogecoin Price Soars 2%: Rally To Sustain? Dogecoin price today soared more than 2% and exchanged hands at $0.1673 and its one-day volume fell 32% to $1.21 billion. Notably, the token has touched a 24-hour low of $0.15. However, despite the current gains, the leading meme coin has lost nearly 8% weekly while witnessing a slump of over 17% in the monthly timeframe. Besides, a recent DOGE price prediction indicates that the meme coin might hover near the $0.15 level in April. Despite that, Dogecoin Futures Open Interest was up 7%, indicating a strong market confidence towards the asset. On the other hand, a top market expert also predicted a potential rally ahead for the token. Dogecoin price May Rally To $2 A well-known crypto expert CryptoELITES has shared a bullish forecast for Dogecoin. In a recent post on X, the analyst highlighted a chart showing the next key targets for DOGE. According to the projection, the meme coin will likely climb to $0.75 next, followed by a breakout to $1.50 and even $2.70. Meanwhile, the expert noted that Dogecoin price has already bottomed out, and he expects the price to touch at least $2 by the end of April or early May. This bold call has added fresh excitement to the meme coin market, especially as traders look for signs of the next breakout coin amid a choppy crypto landscape. Source: CryptoELITES, X Besides, the prediction comes at a time when meme coins are witnessing another wave of popularity. Dogecoin, the original meme coin, remains at the center of the hype. This renewed attention could help the coin regain strong momentum in the short term. Here’s Key Levels To Watch Ahead For DOGE While the $2 target has caught headlines, other analysts have offered cautious optimism. Crypto expert Ali Martinez recently highlighted a key support level at $0.16. According to Martinez, if DOGE price manages to hold above $0.16, a rally toward $0.57 could follow. However, he also warned of downside risks. If Dogecoin price breaks below that level, the price might crash down to $0.06. This has made $0.16 a critical zone for traders keeping an eye on the coin’s next move. Source: Ali Martinez, X Meanwhile, this prediction also comes amid soaring tensions among the market participants. For context, a recent report indicates that Elon Musk’s leaving the D.O.G.E. (Department of Government Efficiency) might negatively impact the Dogecoin price ahead.

In this article, we explore how high SHIB can rally if these updates remove more than 100 trillion tokens from the circulating supply. Shibarium Unveils New Updates to Boost Network Activity The Shibarium network has revealed multiple updates to boost network activity and support Shiba Inu price. The first of these updates is introducing the Shibarium layer 3 network that will be privacy-focused to boost adoption. According to the X post, Shibarium layer 3 will unlock Web3 access for businesses, allowing them to run encrypted smart contracts and maintain compliance with minimal risk. The second update that is also coming to Shibarium is Karma. The Shibarium Karma ecosystem has launched a testnet to reward network users. By incentivizing network usage, Karma will also bolster activity and help drive gains for this top meme coin . With these two major upgrades, the SHIB burn rate, which had surged by 1,400% at press time, could skyrocket and possibly remove 100 trillion tokens from the supply. Shiba Inu Price If Shibarium Updates Spark 100 Trillion SHIB Burn Shiba Inu price could be poised for a massive rally if the privacy updates and the Karma network feature trigger a surge in the SHIB burn rate , and potentially remove 100 trillion tokens from the circulating supply. For context, SHIB has a supply of 589 trillion tokens. Therefore, a 100 trillion burn could drive massive growth in the price and market cap. Grok 3 notes that removing such a high number of tokens from supply could spark a 261% price surge for SHIB to $0.0000445. This will push its market cap to $21 billion, making it a top ten crypto. “Tripling the market cap might happen if the burn triggers significant hype, whale accumulation, or broader market bullishness.” Given this bullish Shiba Inu price prediction , the two updates coming to the SHIB ecosystem might be a major catalyst for growth. SHIB Technical Analysis Shiba Inu price today trades at $0.0000123 with a slight 1.6% gain in 24 hours. The 1-hour chart shows that buying activity is resuming. This is after the rise in the RSI indicator to 59, which further shows that a bullish momentum is in play. SHIB is also attempting to break out from a descending triangle pattern. If this breakout is successful, it could trigger a breakout to $0.0000134 in the near term. The MACD indicator also supports the bullish thesis after rising above the zero line. Once it confirms this crossover, it will create a strong buy signal, with the buying volumes set to push the meme coin’s price higher. SHIB/USDT: 1-hour Chart The upcoming Shibarium updates and the bullish technical outlook suggest that SHIB price could be on the verge of a massive price rally. A spike in the SHIB burn rate might also be one of the catalysts that will fuel the bullish momentum.

A federal court in Boston on April 2 sentenced CLS Global on criminal charges related to fraudulent manipulation of crypto trading volume, according to an announcement from the Massachusetts US Attorney’s Office. In addition to a $428,059 fine, the court prohibited CLS Global from offering services in the US for a probation period of three years. CLS Global, a crypto market maker registered in the United Arab Emirates, in January pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit market manipulation and one count of wire fraud. CLS agreed to manipulate the FBI’s “trap token” NexFundAI The charges against CLS Global followed an undercover law enforcement operation involving NexFundAI, a token created by the FBI as part of a sting operation in May 2024. CLS Global was among at least three firms that took the FBI’s bait and agreed to provide “market maker services” for NexFundAI, including a fraudulent scheme to attract investors to purchase the token. In October 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced fraud charges against CLS and its employee, Andrey Zhorzhes. The US securities regulator also filed complaints against two other NexFundAI manipulators, Hong Kong-linked ZM Quant Investment and Russia-linked Gotbit Consulting. CLS Global’s profile According to CLS Global CEO Filipp Veselov, the company was founded in 2017 to fill in a “huge gap in the market for high-quality market-making solutions and trading consulting.” Prior to CLS, Veselov worked at the Russian cryptocurrency exchange platform Latoken, which is advertised as a “global digital asset exchange” and has about 370,000 followers on X. The CLS team also includes chief revenue officer Pavel Singaevskii, who previously served as sales manager at Stex, a crypto platform that reportedly ceased operations without warning in 2023.

The analyst argued that this price level would also essentially indicate a bottom. The chart shared by Peterson claims to predict the lowest levels the BTC price could reach.

Peterson, in an analysis he shared last month, also evaluated where the Bitcoin price will not fall below. According to the analyst, the BTC price will not fall below $ 69,000 with a 95% probability. Peterson referred to these thoughts from last month in his latest analysis and argued that his $ 70,000 estimate was also in line with his evaluations from the previous month. *This is not investment advice.

Here’s a look at how Schwab’s outlook on crypto influenced the wider global economy. According to a recent Financial Times report , Schwab has begun the process of stepping down from his role as chairman of the WEF board of trustees, two inside sources have confirmed. Although Schwab has not given an exact date for his departure, the WEF said that the process should be completed by January 2027. Schwab has been executive chair for the WEF board for more than half a century. During his time as the chairman, he has been influential in driving forward economic innovation on the global scale. Some of the concepts he advocated for include stakeholder capitalism, the Great Reset, digital governance, and sustainable growth, inspiring numerous policy reforms worldwide. In fact, Klaus Schwab was one of the first global leaders to acknowledge how important cryptocurrency and blockchain technology was to the digital transformation of society. He often highlights how these technologies can revolutionize finance, communication, and even governance. You might also like: World Economic Forum offers guidance on global crypto regulations In his essay titled “the Fourth Industrial Revolution,” Schwab highlighted how crypto and the blockchain could become a transformative force that can transform global financial inclusion and reshape how economies operate. “Technologies such as blockchain, used in executing cryptocurrency transactions, and smart materials are redefining and blurring the boundary between the digital and physical worlds,” stated Schwab. In 2019, the WEF teamed up with the International Organization for Public-Private Cooperation and Accenture to publish a report that aimed to provide companies and governments with a blockchain value framework to help them engage with blockchain investments. The report helped organizations decide on whether they should engage with blockchain technology or not. In 2020, the WEF under Klaus Schwab’s leadership held the first global consortium which focused specifically on creating a regulatory framework for the digital currencies, including stablecoins . The Global Consortium for Digital Currency Governance was established with the goal of making financial system more accessible through inclusive and inter-operable policies. The consortium brought together leading companies, financial institutions, government representatives, experts, academics, international organizations, NGOs and members of the Forum’s communities to discuss solutions and frameworks surrounding digital currencies. In 2023, the WEF released a report that suggested a number of global guidelines that could serve to regulate the rapidly-evolving crypto industry. The report emphasized the need for harmonized regulations to ensure market stability and investor protection in the crypto space. How did Klaus Schwab view crypto? Overall, Klaus Schwab sees cryptocurrency and the blockchain as central elements to revolutionizing the financial system. However, he has also been very vocal about the importance of having clear regulatory frameworks to ensure that the transformative potential of virtual assets can be realized and the risk and harm associated with crypto can be minimized. During the 2025 World Economic Forum in Davos, Schwab stated that governments play a crucial role in ensuring that there are clear regulatory frameworks and ethical policies that can accommodate new technologies entering the financial and economic sectors. These technologies, continued Schwab, include artificial intelligence , quantum computing, and cryptocurrency among others. He believes collaboration between the public and private sectors is the key to establishing security , efficiency, transparency, and inclusivity in the crypto space. “We need more efforts. Not just summits from time to time, we need a coordinated global process to make sure that those technologies are to the benefit of humankind, of everybody,” said Klaus Schwab in his speech.

ADA’s trading volumes have crashed by 12% over the past week, suggesting fears of a stretched bearish momentum. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , on the other hand, is on the rise, taking advantage of ever-changing investor opinion. Now in Phase 4 of its 11-phase presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has sold $6,100,000 worth of the tokens to 7,800 holders, all of whom were attracted by the platform’s economic structures and its ambitious growth projections. The token’s $0.025 price presents a 140% per token return off its $0.06 listing price, and predictions range as high as $3.50 after launch. Cardano’s Remains In An Unstable Position Cardano (ADA) at $0.64, with its head hung low with nowhere to go as the workforce calls time. Analysts point to a descending wedge formation, suggesting a breakdown that puts them on pace for a sub-$0.6 price if immediate support is not held. Things like looming U.S. auto tariffs increase market jitters, making ADA susceptible to cascading sell-off. So, while developments across the ecosystem, from founder Charles Hoskinson’s imminent panel appearance at the DC Blockchain Summit 2025 or launching claims processing onchain link could stir optimism, at this stage of the price cycle momentum is down. Trading volume has dwindled as liquidity is flowing to new projects such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which presale surged above weekly gains for ADA. The Momentum of Mutuum Finance’s Presale With Phase 4 selling at a rapid pace, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) takes centre stage. Those who register early in this phase and already purchased at current phase 4 prices are guaranteed to benefit immediately, with the next phase seeing an increase of 20 per cent up to $0.03. New investors can bank on a guaranteed 140% profit from exchange listing, an amount that is baked into the project’s tokenomics. Aside from presale profits, post-launch fortunes show a jaw-dropping 13,900% upside if Mutuum Finance (MUTM) achieves its target $3.50 price. Such growth has been driven to the decentralized lending framework of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which creates a sustainable buy pressure based on revenue driven token redistribution. Developing Confidence Based on Openness In a move that’s sure to build momentum even further, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has engaged in a smart contract audit with CertiK, a step expected to cement investor confidence even more. Finalized results will be communicated through authorized channels, mitigating common security risk factors seen in decentralized finance. The audit highlights the team’s commitment to transparency, setting MUTM apart from speculative competitors. And, with an overcollateralized lending model and dynamic interest rates, together with scalability, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is utility integral at the adoption end of the spectrum while extending its appeal into the higher risk and yield markets. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) motivated not just by Cardano’s (ADA) downward spiral, but rather in redefining the entire DeFi value proposition. And with phase 4 selling out fast and CertiK verification still to come, time is running out to secure tokens at just $0.025. While ADA faces turmoil, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) steps in as a calculated hedge to offer both presale access and post-launch promise. Those looking to shelter from volatile altcoins are switching gears here, backing a project that seems primed to outpace fading giants. Time is critical. Phase 4 is the lowest available price before another 20% increase. Head over to the official Mutuum Finance (MUTM) website for a chance to get in on the next price boom.

Although many altcoins have experienced massive rallies, Ethereum price has failed to move, and four charts accurately explain why this is the case. Let’s explore why the ETH price remains stuck and unable to move higher with these four on-chain metrics from CryptoQuant . Declining Ethereum active addresses. A drop in total fees burnt. A decline in fees burnt per transaction. An uptick in the total supply of ETH post-Merge. Ethereum Active Addresses Plummet One of the reasons why Ethereum price has failed to perform is lack of interest from investors. The number of active addresses has seen a steep decline from around 600K addresses to 300K. When investors interacting with the blockchain dwindles, the capital flows are also affected, which explains the lackluster performance if ETH price. ETH Active Addresses Fees Burnt Declines Adding credence to Ethereum’s bearish fundamentals is the decline in the fees burnt. Fees burnt incentivize validators or stakers, but a decline in this metric indicates a pessimistic outlook for the price. With less investors interacting with the Ethereum blockchain it is logical to see the total fees burnt drop. This indicator has dropped from 10K to less than 100. Total Fees Burnt Additionally, the fees burnt per transaction has also dropped from nearly $80 to less than $0.1. All of these signals suggest that there is a decline in interaction with the blockchain particularly due to competition from Solana. Hence, ETH’s value remained stuck even as SOL price exploded close to $300. Fees Burnt Per Transaction Increase in Total Supply of ETH The last nail in the coffin is the increase in supply of ETH post-Merge activation. The supply has increased from 120M to 120.6M, i.e., 600K ETH was added to the supply since April 2024. Increase in ETH Supply A lack of investor interest coupled with an increase in supply already affects the price of Ethereum. To make matters worse, the price of Bitcoin is also collapsing, which does not help ETH’s case. Additionally, the worsening macroeconomic conditions have caused tension that has seeped from the US stock market into the crypto markets. Hence, the outlook for Ethereum price prediction remains bearish and will continue to do so until the aforementioned fundamentals improve.

The global economic chessboard just shifted again, and this time, the stakes are higher. Reports are swirling, originating from Watcher.Guru on X, indicating that China is set to slap a hefty 34% tariff on goods imported from the United States. In a world already grappling with economic uncertainties, this move could send shockwaves across various markets, including the volatile cryptocurrency space. Let’s dive into what this could mean for you, the crypto enthusiast, investor, and observer. Decoding the China Tariffs Impact: What’s Happening? According to the latest buzz, China’s decision to impose a significant 34% tariff on U.S. goods is not just a minor trade skirmish; it’s a substantial escalation in the ongoing economic tensions between the two global giants. This move, if confirmed and implemented, will significantly increase the cost of American products entering China, potentially impacting a wide range of industries. But why should you, as someone interested in cryptocurrencies, care? Let’s break it down: Economic Uncertainty Amplifier: Tariffs are rarely isolated events. They often trigger retaliatory measures and contribute to a broader climate of economic uncertainty. This uncertainty is like fertilizer for volatility in financial markets, and cryptocurrencies are no exception. Supply Chain Disruptions: Increased tariffs can disrupt global supply chains. While the direct impact on the crypto market might not be immediately obvious, disruptions in related sectors (like technology manufacturing) can indirectly influence investor sentiment and market dynamics. Currency Fluctuations: Trade tensions often lead to fluctuations in currency values. Changes in the value of the Chinese Yuan (CNY) and the US Dollar (USD) can impact cryptocurrency trading pairs and investment strategies. Investor Sentiment Shift: Negative economic news, such as tariff hikes, can dampen overall investor sentiment. When traditional markets become turbulent, investors may seek refuge in alternative assets like crypto, or conversely, they may reduce risk across the board, leading to sell-offs. [img src=’image-china-tariffs.jpg’ alt=’Illustration of China and US flags with tariffs’] The US-China Trade War Crypto Connection: A Deeper Dive The ongoing US-China trade war has been a simmering backdrop to global economics for years. This new tariff announcement suggests a potential intensification. For the crypto world, this is not just background noise; it’s a potentially significant factor. Here’s how the US-China trade friction can directly and indirectly affect the crypto landscape: Impact Area Potential Crypto Market Effect Increased Market Volatility Trade wars are synonymous with market uncertainty. Expect potentially higher volatility in cryptocurrency prices as investors react to the news and broader economic implications. Safe Haven Asset Narrative In times of economic turmoil, some investors view cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as a safe haven asset, similar to gold. Increased trade tensions could strengthen this narrative, potentially driving demand for certain cryptocurrencies. Geopolitical Risk Premium Escalating trade disputes add a geopolitical risk premium to all markets. Crypto, being a global and often borderless asset class, is not immune. Investor risk assessments may change, influencing investment flows. Regulatory Responses Economic pressures can sometimes lead governments to re-evaluate their regulatory stances. While unpredictable, trade tensions could indirectly influence regulatory discussions around cryptocurrencies in both the US and China. Navigating Global Economic Uncertainty Crypto Markets Face We are living in an era defined by global economic uncertainty . From geopolitical conflicts to inflation concerns and now, escalating trade tariffs, the financial landscape is complex and dynamic. For cryptocurrency investors, this means adaptability and informed decision-making are more critical than ever. How can you navigate these uncertain waters? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of economic news, especially developments related to US-China trade relations. Reputable news sources and crypto market analysis platforms are your allies. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification is a risk management staple. Don’t put all your eggs in one crypto basket. Consider a mix of assets, including potentially traditional assets, to mitigate risk. Manage Risk Tolerance: Understand your own risk tolerance. Volatile periods can be stressful. Invest only what you can afford to lose, and consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging to smooth out market fluctuations. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. Focus on the long-term potential of your investments and avoid making rash decisions based on short-term market swings. Crypto Market Volatility Tariffs Trigger: Brace for Potential Swings Tariffs and trade disputes are known catalysts for crypto market volatility . The announcement of a 34% tariff from China on US goods is likely to inject a fresh dose of uncertainty into the market. What kind of volatility could we anticipate? Short-Term Price Swings: Expect to see potentially significant price fluctuations in the immediate aftermath of the tariff news and any subsequent retaliatory actions. Both upward and downward swings are possible. Increased Trading Volumes: Volatility often attracts traders. Trading volumes in cryptocurrency exchanges may increase as market participants attempt to capitalize on price movements or hedge against potential losses. Altcoin Sensitivity: Altcoins, being generally more volatile than established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, could experience amplified price swings in response to tariff-related news. Correlation with Traditional Markets: In times of heightened economic uncertainty, correlations between cryptocurrency markets and traditional markets (like stock markets) can sometimes increase. Monitor these correlations to understand broader market sentiment. Analyzing Tariff Effects Cryptocurrency Ecosystem Faces Let’s delve deeper into the potential tariff effects cryptocurrency markets might experience. It’s not just about price volatility; the longer-term implications could reshape the crypto ecosystem in subtle yet significant ways: Shift in Global Crypto Hubs: If trade tensions significantly impact economic activity in the US and China, we might see a shift in global crypto hubs. Regions with more stable economic environments and favorable crypto regulations could become more attractive for crypto businesses and investors. Decentralization Narrative Strengthened: Economic nationalism and trade protectionism, exemplified by tariffs, could inadvertently strengthen the decentralization narrative of cryptocurrencies. As nations become more protectionist, the appeal of borderless, decentralized assets might grow. Innovation and Adaptation: Economic challenges often spur innovation. The crypto industry, known for its adaptability, might see new solutions and strategies emerge in response to the changing global economic landscape. This could range from new decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to more resilient infrastructure. Regulatory Scrutiny Intensifies: Governments worldwide may increase regulatory scrutiny on cryptocurrencies as they navigate economic uncertainties. This could lead to both challenges and opportunities for the crypto industry, depending on the nature of regulations. Conclusion: Navigating the Tariff Terrain in the Crypto World The news of China’s potential 34% tariff on US goods is a stark reminder that the cryptocurrency market operates within a larger global economic context. While the direct and immediate impacts are still unfolding, it’s clear that this development adds another layer of complexity and uncertainty to the crypto landscape. For crypto investors and enthusiasts, staying informed, managing risk, and maintaining a long-term perspective are crucial. The crypto market has weathered storms before, and its resilience will be tested again in this evolving global economic climate. Keep a watchful eye on developments, be prepared for potential volatility, and remember that in the world of crypto, change is the only constant.

Everything is about tariffs, and it may be several days, or even weeks, before the dust begins to settle. Here is how some of the top altcoins are faring in this very unsettled environment. $ETH awaits possible breakdown confirmation Source: TradingView With Bitcoin (BTC) having climbed 1.8% and now back in the red, all in the space of the last couple of hours, Ethereum (ETH) is not going to be outperforming. The number two cryptocurrency by market capitalisation is still waiting for the market to decide whether the current breakdown below the resistance and the bull market trendline will be confirmed. This will be known at the end of this week. There is strong horizontal support lower at $1,560, but with the bull market either finished now, or perhaps later this year, this is a very poor position to be in. The bulls will hope that possible rate cuts in the US, in order to stave off a tariffs-induced economic collapse, can ignite a crypto rally. $XRP rolling over - cliff edges underneath price Source: TradingView If one discounts Tether, given that it is a stablecoin, $XRP is currently the third biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. After the huge surge to over $3 over the last part of 2024 and into 2025, the price has rolled over and has been bouncing from the strong horizontal support at $1.96. If this breaks, $1.57, $1.30, and $0.95 are the next cliff edges. $BNB needs to hold current level Source: TradingView Even with one of the best charts among the top altcoins, $BNB still has its problems. The price is currently near the $584 horizontal support level. Should it break down through this, it will head down to the bottom of the triangle and the very strong horizontal support at $506. This is the last support before the price could drop off its own cliff edge. The Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart has the indicators shaping to roll over. Holding the current levels will be important to prevent this happening. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

As per a report by Dailystar, Ellie Hart, a 34-year-old primary school teacher, unknowingly threw out the device while conducting a routine spring cleaning of their home. The said USB drive had been stored in a drawer alongside miscellaneous household items such as old receipts, dead batteries, and tangled wires. Unaware of its immense value, she assumed it was one of her school-related storage devices and tossed it into the trash without a second thought. Days later, she realized her error when her husband, Tom, a 36-year-old website developer, went searching for his Bitcoin storage device. When he inquired about the flash drive, Ellie immediately froze, her heart sinking as she recalled her actions. “I felt absolutely sick. I knew instantly what I had done ,” she stated. “ We emptied the rubbish bags, tore open bin liners, but deep down, I knew it was already too late.” Notably, Tom purchased Bitcoin back in 2013, when the cryptocurrency was valued at a fraction of its current worth. Over the years, as Bitcoin’s price skyrocketed, the once-small investment turned into a multimillion-dollar asset. However, without access to the flash drive, the funds are now irretrievable. The tragic incident serves as a harsh reminder of the importance of secure cryptocurrency storage. Experts have advised Bitcoin holders to utilize offline wallets, known as “cold storage,” which are protected from cyber threats and safeguarded against accidental disposal. Properly labeling and securely storing storage devices can prevent costly mishaps like this one. This case echoes the ongoing saga of James Howells, another British citizen who lost access to 7,500 Bitcoin (worth about $627.4 million at current prices) after discarding a hard drive in 2013. Despite years of proposals to excavate the landfill where his drive is believed to be, authorities have refused permission. In February 2025, Business Waste specialist Mark Hall stated that successfully finding and extracting data from a hard drive in a landfill is “close to zero.” That same month, officials announced plans to permanently close and secure the landfill, though Howells continues seeking investor support to purchase and search the site.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-04 11:35:21
42895516,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146428,1743766529,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Concerns Mount: Justin Sun Exposes Potential Risks at FDUSD Issuer First Digital Trust,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/justin-sun-fdusd-issuer-concerns/,"The crypto world is once again buzzing with concerns surrounding stablecoin security, and this time, the spotlight is on FDUSD. TRON founder Justin Sun, a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space, has reignited worries about the financial stability of First Digital Trust (FDT), the entity behind the FDUSD stablecoin. But what exactly are these urgent concerns , and what could they mean for your crypto holdings? Why is Justin Sun Raising Alarms About FDUSD and First Digital Trust? Justin Sun’s recent X post is not the first time he’s voiced skepticism about First Digital Trust (FDT). This time, he’s specifically pointing fingers at alleged violations of fiduciary and regulatory norms by FDT. According to Sun, FDT is managing a substantial $501.8 million securities portfolio under its own name, supposedly on behalf of Techteryx. This, Sun argues, flies in the face of Hong Kong’s stringent financial regulations. Let’s break down the core of Sun’s accusations: Regulatory Breach: Hong Kong law mandates that companies offering securities management services must possess a Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) Type 9 license. The exception is if they are serving a wholly-owned subsidiary or parent company. Sun claims FDT doesn’t meet this exception and is therefore operating without the necessary license. Fiduciary Duty Violation: Sun contends that by managing securities under its own legal title in this manner, FDT is disregarding the fundamental principles of trust and fiduciary responsibility. Previous Allegations: Adding fuel to the fire, Sun reminds us that he has previously submitted evidence to Hong Kong authorities concerning alleged reserve misappropriation by FDT. This raises serious questions about the overall management and security of FDUSD reserves. Understanding the Implications for FDUSD and Stablecoin Regulation These allegations from Justin Sun raise critical questions about stablecoin regulation and the safety of FDUSD. Stablecoins, designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with fiat currencies like the US dollar, are crucial for the smooth functioning of the crypto ecosystem. Trust in their stability and the reserves backing them is paramount. If FDT is indeed operating outside of regulatory compliance in Hong Kong, it sets a worrying precedent. Here’s why this matters: Erosion of Trust: Breaches of trust and regulatory violations can severely damage investor confidence in FDUSD and potentially the broader stablecoin market. If issuers aren’t held to high standards, the perceived safety of stablecoins diminishes. Systemic Risk: A lack of robust stablecoin regulation can create systemic risks within the crypto market. If a major stablecoin issuer faces financial instability or regulatory repercussions, it could trigger wider market volatility. Investor Protection: Regulations like licensing requirements are in place to protect investors. Sun’s allegations suggest a potential failure in these protective mechanisms, leaving users of FDUSD potentially vulnerable. Justin Sun’s Persistent Scrutiny: A Deep Dive into Financial Stability Concerns This isn’t the first time Justin Sun has publicly questioned the operations of FDT. His repeated concerns underscore a persistent unease within the crypto community about the true financial stability of certain stablecoin issuers. While Sun’s motives might be debated, his actions have undoubtedly brought greater scrutiny to FDT and the broader stablecoin landscape. Consider these points regarding the ongoing saga: Pattern of Accusations: Sun’s repeated public statements suggest a sustained effort to highlight perceived issues at FDT. This consistency lends weight to the concerns being raised. Public Pressure: By making these allegations public on platforms like X, Sun is applying public pressure on both FDT and regulatory bodies in Hong Kong to investigate and respond. Market Impact: Even the suggestion of regulatory non-compliance or financial instability can impact the market perception of FDUSD and potentially influence its price and adoption. What Does This Mean for FDUSD Holders? Assessing the Financial Stability of Your Stablecoin For those holding FDUSD, financial stability is the primary concern right now. While these are currently allegations, they warrant careful attention. Here’s what FDUSD holders should consider: Factor Consideration Transparency of Reserves Are FDUSD’s reserve holdings regularly and transparently audited by independent third parties? Look for publicly available attestation reports. Regulatory Compliance How is FDT responding to these regulatory concerns? Are they addressing the allegations publicly and engaging with Hong Kong authorities? Market Sentiment Monitor market discussions and news related to FDUSD. Negative sentiment can sometimes indicate underlying issues or increased risk. Diversification As a general risk management strategy, consider diversifying your stablecoin holdings across multiple reputable issuers rather than concentrating solely on one. Navigating Stablecoin Uncertainty: What Actions Can You Take? The situation surrounding FDUSD and First Digital Trust serves as a potent reminder of the inherent risks within the cryptocurrency market, particularly concerning stablecoins. While stablecoins aim for stability, the entities backing them are still subject to regulatory scrutiny and financial pressures. Here are some actionable insights to consider as a crypto user: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of news and developments regarding stablecoin regulations and issuer compliance. Reputable crypto news sources are crucial. Due Diligence: Before using or holding any stablecoin, research the issuer, their reserve policies, and their regulatory standing. Risk Management: Don’t treat stablecoins as entirely risk-free assets. Implement diversification and risk management strategies as you would with any other crypto investment. Engage with the Community: Participate in discussions and forums to understand the broader community sentiment and concerns regarding specific stablecoins. Conclusion: The Future of FDUSD and the Imperative of Trust Justin Sun’s renewed allegations against First Digital Trust and FDUSD underscore the critical importance of transparency, regulatory compliance, and above all, trust in the stablecoin ecosystem. The coming weeks and months will be crucial in determining how FDT responds to these urgent concerns and how regulatory bodies in Hong Kong address the situation. For FDUSD holders and the wider crypto market, this episode serves as a stark reminder that vigilance and informed decision-making are paramount in navigating the ever-evolving world of digital assets.

OKX Fined $1.2 Million by Malta for Anti-Money Laundering Violations The FIAU statement said the penalty was imposed following an on-site compliance review in April 2023, which revealed serious and systematic failures. The FIAU investigation found that OKX: Failed to appropriately assess the money laundering risks associated with its products. For approximately half of the files reviewed, the client skipped risk assessments during acceptance. There were deficiencies in transaction monitoring and external reporting. OKX responded to the fine, stating that it has since implemented a comprehensive compliance program, including technology upgrades and enhanced monitoring. The exchange also noted that it acknowledged the FIAU’s remedial efforts. This latest fine adds to OKX’s growing regulatory challenges worldwide: February 2025: OKX's parent company settles with US authorities for over $500 million for failing to register as a money transmitter business.

Pseudonymous analyst Inmortal tells his 231,100 followers on the social media platform X that Solana ( SOL ) may be presenting a rare buying opportunity after hitting the 24-hour low of $112. “SOL: feels like a generational entry.” Source: Inmortal/X Looking at his chart, the trader suggests SOL is printing a similar pattern from 2021, when SOL dipped more than 60% from its local top before putting up massive gains. SOL is trading for $116 at time of writing, down 1.8% in the last 24 hours. Next up, the analyst suggests that Bitcoin ( BTC ) is on the verge of breaking out and may reclaim the $100,000 level as support by next month. “Maybe this dream [will] come true, just maybe.” Source: Inmortal/X Bitcoin is trading for $82,719 at time of writing, flat on the day.

Just like Bitcoin’s wild swings, the Forex market offers a thrilling ride, shaped by global economic winds. Today, we’re diving deep into the recent shifts in the Forex Market , where the US Dollar is showing signs of resilience, bouncing back from recent lows, while the Euro is experiencing a slip after concerning German economic data. What does this mean for traders, investors, and the broader financial landscape? Let’s unpack this exciting development. Dollar’s Dramatic Comeback: What’s Fueling the Surge? After a period of uncertainty, the US Dollar is demonstrating a notable recovery. But what’s behind this resurgence? Several factors are contributing to the Dollar’s bounce, signaling a potential shift in market dynamics. Let’s break down the key drivers: Safe-Haven Appeal: In times of global economic uncertainty, the Dollar often acts as a safe-haven asset. As concerns about global growth and geopolitical tensions linger, investors tend to flock towards the perceived safety of the US Dollar. This increased demand naturally pushes the Dollar’s value higher. Federal Reserve Policy: The stance of the Federal Reserve (Fed) plays a pivotal role in Dollar strength. Recent signals from the Fed, indicating a continued hawkish approach to combat inflation, are bolstering the Dollar. Higher interest rates typically make a currency more attractive to foreign investors seeking better returns. Positive US Economic Indicators: While global economies face headwinds, the US economy has shown pockets of resilience. Better-than-expected economic data from the US can strengthen the Dollar, as it suggests a robust economic outlook compared to other regions. Technical Rebound: From a technical analysis perspective, the Dollar might have been oversold in recent periods, leading to a natural correction and rebound. Traders often look for oversold conditions to initiate buying positions, further contributing to the upward momentum. This combination of factors is creating a tailwind for the Dollar, pushing it upwards against various currencies, including the Euro. Euro Under Pressure: Why is the Currency Exchange Rate Slipping? While the Dollar is flexing its muscles, the Euro is facing headwinds, particularly after the release of disappointing German Economy data. Germany, being the powerhouse of the Eurozone, significantly influences the Euro’s performance. Let’s explore the reasons behind the Euro’s recent weakness: Weak German Data: Recent economic data from Germany has painted a concerning picture. Key indicators such as manufacturing PMI and industrial production have fallen short of expectations, signaling a potential slowdown in the German economy. This negative data weighs heavily on the Euro, as Germany’s economic health is vital for the Eurozone’s overall stability. Energy Crisis in Europe: The ongoing energy crisis in Europe continues to cast a shadow over the Eurozone economy. High energy prices are impacting businesses and consumers, raising concerns about inflation and economic growth. This uncertainty weakens the Euro’s appeal. European Central Bank (ECB) Policy: While the ECB is also raising interest rates to combat inflation, its approach is perceived by some as less aggressive compared to the Federal Reserve. This difference in perceived monetary policy aggressiveness can favor the Dollar over the Euro. Geopolitical Risks: The proximity of the Eurozone to geopolitical hotspots, such as the conflict in Ukraine, adds to the risk premium associated with the Euro. Investors may prefer the Dollar as a safer alternative amidst heightened geopolitical uncertainty in Europe. These challenges are collectively contributing to the Euro’s slip in the Forex Market , creating a divergence between the Dollar and the Euro’s performance. Decoding the Forex Market Impact: Dollar vs. Euro The contrasting movements of the Dollar and Euro have significant implications for the Forex Market . Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone involved in trading or monitoring global financial trends. Let’s examine the key impacts: Impact Area Dollar Strength (vs. Euro Weakness) Euro Strength (vs. Dollar Weakness) Import/Export Dynamics US imports become cheaper, exports become more expensive. Eurozone exports become cheaper, imports become more expensive. US exports become cheaper, imports become more expensive. Eurozone imports become cheaper, exports become more expensive. Inflation Dollar strength can help curb US inflation by making imports cheaper. Euro weakness can exacerbate Eurozone inflation by making imports more expensive. Dollar weakness can contribute to US inflation by making imports more expensive. Euro strength can help curb Eurozone inflation by making imports cheaper. Corporate Earnings US companies with significant overseas earnings may see reduced profits when translated back to a stronger Dollar. Eurozone companies with significant overseas earnings may see increased profits when translated back to a weaker Euro. US companies with significant overseas earnings may see increased profits when translated back to a weaker Dollar. Eurozone companies with significant overseas earnings may see reduced profits when translated back to a stronger Euro. Investment Flows Stronger Dollar may attract investment into US assets. Weaker Euro may deter investment in Eurozone assets. Weaker Dollar may deter investment into US assets. Stronger Euro may attract investment in Eurozone assets. These are just some of the immediate impacts. The broader implications ripple through global trade, investment strategies, and macroeconomic policies. Navigating Currency Exchange Volatility: Tips for Crypto Enthusiasts For those deeply involved in the cryptocurrency world, understanding Currency Exchange fluctuations is increasingly important. Cryptocurrencies, while often seen as independent of traditional markets, are not entirely immune to Forex movements. Here are some actionable insights for crypto enthusiasts: Monitor Forex Trends: Keep an eye on major currency pairs, especially USD/EUR. Dollar strength or weakness can indirectly influence crypto markets, particularly Bitcoin, which is often priced against the Dollar. Hedge Against Volatility: In times of Forex market volatility, consider diversifying your portfolio. Holding a mix of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins pegged to different currencies (including USD and EUR) can help mitigate risks. Understand Global Macroeconomic Factors: Events impacting the German Economy or US Federal Reserve policy can have cascading effects across all financial markets, including crypto. Stay informed about global macroeconomic developments. Utilize Forex Insights for Trading Strategies: Forex market analysis tools and techniques can be adapted to analyze cryptocurrency price movements. Understanding currency strength and weakness can provide valuable insights for crypto trading decisions. By integrating Forex market awareness into your crypto strategy, you can make more informed decisions and navigate market volatility more effectively. Looking Ahead: Will the Dollar’s Resilience Last? The Dollar’s recent bounce and the Euro’s slip raise important questions about future trends. Will the Dollar continue its resilient climb? Will the Euro manage to regain its footing? Several factors will determine the trajectory of these major currencies: Future Economic Data: Upcoming economic data releases from the US, Germany, and the broader Eurozone will be crucial. Stronger German data could help the Euro recover, while continued robust US data could further bolster the Dollar. Central Bank Policies: The future policy decisions of the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank will be paramount. Any shifts in their monetary policy stances will significantly impact currency valuations. Geopolitical Developments: Unforeseen geopolitical events can quickly alter market sentiment and currency flows. Monitoring global geopolitical risks is essential for predicting Forex market movements. Market Sentiment: Overall market sentiment and investor risk appetite will also play a role. A shift towards risk-on sentiment could potentially weaken the Dollar, while risk-off sentiment could further strengthen it. The Forex Market is a dynamic and complex arena. The interplay of economic data, central bank policies, and global events will continue to shape the Dollar and Euro’s journey in the days and weeks ahead. Conclusion: Decoding the Dollar-Euro Dance in the Forex Arena The recent movements in the Dollar and Euro highlight the intricate dance of currencies in the Forex Market . The Dollar’s resilient bounce, fueled by safe-haven demand and hawkish Fed signals, contrasts sharply with the Euro’s slip, weighed down by weak German data and energy crisis concerns. Understanding these dynamics is not just for Forex traders; it’s vital for anyone navigating the broader financial landscape, including the cryptocurrency world. By staying informed, adapting strategies, and recognizing the interconnectedness of global markets, you can better position yourself to thrive in this ever-evolving financial environment. The Dollar-Euro saga is a powerful reminder of the constant shifts and opportunities within the global Currency Exchange ecosystem.

Here’s What Hayes Thinks,https://thecoinrise.com/trumps-tariffs-could-fuel-bitcoin-surge-heres-what-hayes-thinks/,"As global markets brace for the impact of Donald Trump’s aggressive tariff policies, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes sees a silver lining—one that could send Bitcoin soaring in the long run. In an April 3 post on X, Hayes dismissed fears surrounding the tariffs, stating, “Some of y’all are running scurred, but I LOVE TARIFFS.” He believes that these trade restrictions will destabilize traditional markets, prompting central banks to intervene with fresh liquidity—something that historically benefits Bitcoin. The Trump administration’s latest tariff plan , set to take effect on April 5, will impose a 10% blanket tariff on all imports, with steeper rates targeting specific regions. These aggressive trade policies have already sent shockwaves through financial markets, triggering the biggest single-day point loss in Nasdaq 100 history. Hayes argues that such volatility strengthens Bitcoin’s appeal as an alternative store of value. He expects central banks to print more money to offset economic pain, which would weaken the U.S. dollar and drive investors toward assets like Bitcoin and gold. A Weaker Yuan Could Push Chinese Toward Crypto One of Hayes’ key predictions is that China may allow the yuan (CNY) to depreciate in response to the 65% effective tariff on Chinese goods. If this happens, Chinese investors could seek refuge in Bitcoin to protect their wealth from currency devaluation. “China could respond by allowing CNY to weaken past 8.00,” Hayes stated, hinting at a potential flight of capital into digital assets. Historically, capital outflows from China have often found their way into BTC and other cryptocurrencies, especially during times of economic stress. Meanwhile, financial analysts have noted a sharp decline in U.S. Treasury yields following the tariff announcement. Hayes interprets this as a sign that markets expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates—a move that would inject more liquidity into the system and make riskier assets, including Bitcoin, more attractive to investors. Bitwise Strategist Predicts a Bitcoin Boom Hayes isn’t the only one who sees BTC as a winner in this financial turbulence. Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Invest, has long maintained that Trump’s tariffs would be a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin . In a February 3 post , Park stated that a “weaker dollar and lower U.S. interest rates” would lead to an explosion in risk assets, including crypto. He even went as far as to say, “Bookmark this and revisit as the financial war unravels, sending Bitcoin violently higher.” While short-term market reactions have been volatile, the broader implications of these tariffs could create a favorable environment for BTC, especially if central banks intervene with fresh rounds of economic stimulus.

The crypto market is showing significant signs of resilience as traders downplay fears surrounding the tariffs. Notably, the financial services platform Matrixport highlighted Bitcoin price’s possible surge, driven by the market’s neutral reaction to Trump’s tariff announcement. This article will analyze how the current market sentiment will shape Bitcoin’s future trends. Will Bitcoin Price Surge Despite Trump’s Tariffs? According to the analysis of Matrixport , a prominent financial services platform, Bitcoin is poised for a significant surge as the market remains resilient to Donald Trump’s tariff announcement. As traders remain less concerned about the potential impact of the tariff on the Bitcoin price, BTC remains largely unaffected by the development. Currently, the Bitcoin price is caught below the $90k range, the key resistance zone. Despite a positive sentiment, the buying interest remains relatively weak. While the crypto hit an all-time high of $108k in January 2025, it has been trading in a consolidation range of $84,000-$86,000 over the past few days. However, experts argue that the tariffs could potentially lead to Bitcoin’s surge, bolstering the crypto’s long-term appeal as a safe haven. Trump Tariffs: Varied Market Reactions Interestingly, Trump’s tariff has sparked widespread reactions, ranging from dismay to calls for further negotiations. As pointed out by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, these tariffs could be the opening move in a months-long trade negotiation process. It is noteworthy that Bitcoin is stuck below the critical $90k level, marking weak buying interest. The hedge funds are no longer experiencing an aggressive sell-off, evidenced by compressed basis and funding rates, along with a significant unwind in CME Bitcoin futures. Recently, Matrixport reported that the Bitcoin price may follow the stock market trends following Trump’s tariff announcements. Though Bitcoin remained resilient to the equity market’s recent downturn, experts highlight the correlation between BTC and traditional financial assets. Despite these predictions, Bitcoin remained stable following Trump’s tariffs. The stock market saw its largest collapse since 2020, erasing a total of $2.85 trillion. The NASDAQ also plummeted by 5.5%. Amidst the chaos, Bitcoin closed the day in the green. How Will Bitcoin Price React to the Current Market Sentiment? As of press time, Bitcoin is trading at $82,486, down by 0.74%. Over the past week and month, the Bitcoin price has seen notable declines of 2.86% and 8.32%. The 24-hour trading volume, currently at $39.19 billion, has plummeted by 26.9%. Driven by the current sentiment, Bitcoin is poised for a potential uptick, with experts predicting its journey to $150,000. Analyst CryptoELITES forecasts that Bitcoin will hit $150,000, with a minimum target of $120,000 in April and May.

Bitcoin Could Recover by May as Liquidity Eases, Analysts Say",https://zycrypto.com/fed-to-the-rescue-bitcoin-could-recover-by-may-as-liquidity-eases-analysts-say/,"Bitcoin, navigating a $2.85 trillion crypto market, faces turbulence. According to Charles Edwards of Capriole Investments, President Donald Trump announced global reciprocal trade tariffs, triggering an 8.5% single-day drop in Bitcoin’s price. Yet, amid this uncertainty, analysts see a potential lifeline. The Federal Reserve’s shift toward easing liquidity could spark Bitcoin’s recovery as early as May 2025. This feature examines the data and expert insights driving this outlook. Tariffs Trigger Bitcoin Price Decline Trump’s tariffs, announced on April 2, 2025, hit Bitcoin hard. The cryptocurrency dropped 8.5% in a single day, while U.S. stocks later recovered. Through an X post on April 3, Edwards compared the situation to the 2022 bear market bottom, noting U.S. business expectations at levels seen in 2000, 2008, and 2022—years tied to major downturns. The Philadelphia Fed’s Business Outlook Survey (BOS) reported business confidence falling below 15, a marker of economic strain, per the survey. Edwards cautioned, “If the tariff war escalates or corporate margins shrink, we could see further downside.” Source: Capriole Investments Bitcoin traders are watching critical levels. A daily close above $84,000 could signal bullish momentum, per Capriole Investments. The next target is $91,000, a key resistance, per the analysis. However, if prices fall, Bitcoin may test the $71,000 support zone, where a rebound could occur, analysts note. Capriole Investments stated that the U.S. macroeconomic environment will determine Bitcoin’s next major move. With economic pressure rising, analysts predict Bitcoin could hit $71,000 if conditions worsen. Fed’s Liquidity Shift: A Potential Catalyst The Federal Reserve’s recent policy easing offers hope. The Fed has relaxed its tight monetary stance, raising speculation about a return to quantitative easing (QE). Edwards asked, “How long until the Powell printer starts humming?” Referring to an increase in M2 money supply, which historically boosts Bitcoin’s price . Analysts believe if M2 liquidity rises, Bitcoin could begin recovering by May 2025, per the report. The Fed’s actions align with market needs. On March 19, 2025, a dispatch analyst at Nexo noted that ending the Fed’s quantitative tightening could boost liquidity and risk assets like Bitcoin. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell expressed doubts about sustained inflationary impacts from Trump’s tariffs on March 17, 2025, referencing 2019, when tariff-related inflation was temporary. Powell’s comments suggest the Fed may remain on hold, potentially supporting Bitcoin’s recovery, per the post. Bitcoin price struggles reflect broader market dynamics. The crypto market peaked at $2.85 trillion before dropping. U.S. business confidence, as measured by the Philadelphia Fed’s BOS, fell below 15, a level tied to high-risk periods. Edwards noted that while BOS data isn’t always accurate, it has historically signaled market stress. Meanwhile, gold has outperformed Bitcoin, What’s Next for Bitcoin? Analysts see a potential turning point. If the Fed increases M2 liquidity, Bitcoin could recover by May 2025. However, the $71,000 support level looms if economic pressure persists. The Fed’s next moves, expected after the April 2, 2025, tariff announcement, will be crucial,",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-04 11:47:19

Over seven days starting March 25, he collected tick-level trade data to examine the impact of Korean trading flows on XRP’s price movement. The data revealed persistent selling pressure, high-frequency trading activity, and notable differences in trade sizes and price impact. $XRP /KRW on Upbit is a market most traders have never looked at, even with it being 2nd largest by volume for $XRP I pulled the last 7 days of tick-level trade data so we can now visualize how Korean flows shaped this 7-day move Read along for an in depth data analysis pic.twitter.com/iKkGr8Ib2v — Dom (@traderview2) April 2, 2025 Heavy Selling Pressure and Volume Distribution Upbit’s XRP/KRW market recorded over 2.4 million trades within seven days, generating a trading volume exceeding $2.5 billion. Dom observed that “over 160M $XRP has been net market sold on Upbit” during this time. The volume delta chart confirmed that a significant portion of the trading activity involved selling, contributing to XRP’s struggle to maintain its three-month range. While the heightened trading activity helped XRP surpass Bitcoin and Ethereum on Upbit, Dom noted that 61.3% of the trades were selling orders. The Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) chart showed that buy-side liquidity was weak, offering limited support to counterbalance the sell orders. Dom revealed that the most active trading hour was 9 AM EST, indicating strong engagement from global traders during that period. High Bot Activity and Retail Selling An analysis of trade sizes revealed a high concentration of small trades, indicating significant bot activity. Dom noted that “53% of all trades were under 100 XRP,” while only 0.6% exceeded 10,000 XRP. Breaking down volume deltas by trade size provided shows that mall trades remained flat, suggesting algorithmic trading, while mid-sized trades showed retail selling pressure. Large trades accounted for just 6 million of the 160 million XRP net sold, indicating that major holders were not aggressively exiting.

The sell-off began with an 181K XRP order, while the largest buy order of 212K XRP occurred at the local low. A scatter plot of trades over 1,000 XRP showed minimal slippage for large trades, while smaller trades caused greater price fluctuations. Dom’s research highlights how different traders influence XRP’s price movements, providing critical insights into market structure now that Ripple is expanding ODL payments into Asia. He plans to compare order flow across Coinbase, Upbit, and Binance to assess their influence on XRP’s global pricing. His findings could provide crucial insights into market structure, liquidity, and the forces shaping XRP’s price.

The criticism comes after several tokens experience major declines in trading. In a recent post , Yi He acknowledged that the platform still had issues and the team is committed to continuously improving the crypto exchange’s performance. However, she disagreed with critics who were blaming Binance for the fall of several tokens that were recently listed on its exchange. “We certainly have many problems, but Binance cannot be responsible for the rise and fall of all coins. There are many areas that need improvement in products and operations,” stated Yi He in her recent post. Although she understood where the critics are coming from, she admitted to feeling exhausted by the frequent accusations aimed towards Binance in the crypto space. She compares the constant witch hunts of traders placing blame on the crypto exchange for things out of their control. “It is not enough to prove your guilt and apologize. As soon as you are involved, you will be charged with the next crime and paraded through the streets with drums and gongs,” said Yi He, adding that she is “tired” of the accusations. You might also like: CZ and Yi He respond to ‘Binance being sold’ rumors Yi He’s response came after several altcoins losing between 20% and 50% on Binance spot trading pairs from April 1 to April 3. So far, the tokens listed on Binance which have experienced major declines include ACT, TST, MASK and LEVER. The most recent token to experience a short-term huge drop is CATI, the native token from TON mini-game Catizen. CATI fell by more than 20% from 11:15 to 12:00 UTC+8 during trading on April 3. On April 1, several altcoins fell in succession on the Binance trading platform. The trading pair ACT/USDT fell by nearly 50% within 30 minutes, while DEXE/USDT plummeted more than 23%, and DF ( DF ) fell by 16%. This led to the ACT team declaring that it will launch an investigation regarding the token’s recent price drop. The next day, ACT and DF continued to fall by 64% and 36% respectively. Trading pairs for LEVER and MASK ( MASK ) also suffered sharp drops, with LEVER/USDT went down by 28% and MASK/USDT decreased by 29%. Traders have surmised that the sharp drops in select tokens are due to mass sell orders that were executed simultaneously on the platform. This has led to many traders online blaming Binance for the token downfalls and comparing its performance to platforms like Coinbase and Bitfinex. “The current backlash against Binance is a result of its market dominance and the lack of transparency in its operations,” said one trader. “Has Binance taken responsibility for ACT?” asked another trader in Chinese.

Although the banking committee has nominated him, complete senate voting is still pending. Despite that, the SEC’s update on the chair position brought significant bullish sentiments, influencing the XRP price surge. US Senate Banking Committee Nominates Paul Atkins For SEC Chair Paul Atkins has officially received the US Senate Banking Committee’s approval , with the 13-11 vote to advance him as the SEC Chair. Also, Jonathan Gould has been nominated to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and both are due for the full Senate vote in the upcoming weeks. If their role gets confirmed, they will play a significant role in shaping crypto regulation due to their positive crypto stance. The SEC pick’s impact on these regulatory roles has significantly affected the XRP price. However, the Democrats strictly opposed the nomination, with Senator Elizabeth Warren leading the opposition. Critics attacked the nominated SEC chair for the deregulation before the 2008 financial crisis and showed concerns over his previous ties with the FTX exchange, which collapsed. Previously, she opposed the nomination of David Sacks, the crypto and AI czar, resulting in Sacks selling his $200M crypto holding before joining the role. XRP Price Soar Nearly 3% Today, What’s Next? After the XRP price crash below the $2 mark, today marks a significant trend shift amid broader market recovery, Paul Atkins’ nomination for SEC Chair, and much more. With a nearly 3% surge in the last 24 hours, the Ripple token currently trades at $2.08 with a market capitalization of $121.36B. However, the trading volume is down 29%, indicating bearish sentiments of the investors, but the XRP futures filing is influencing the uptrend. The popular crypto exchange Coinbase filed for XRP futures , XRPL on April 3, and set to go live on April 21, 2025, marking a significant bullish factor for the altcoin. Earlier CoinGape reports revealed that the XRPL aims to enhance liquidity and institutional participation. This and upcoming U.S. crypto affairs may boost the Ripple price. Besides, the XRP ETF approval odds are high as investors anticipate a green light from the SEC this year. These factors hint at a potential Ripple price uptrend with buyer dominance. However, the new Justin W. Keener filing in the XRP lawsuit generates mixed sentiments, coinciding with the SEC’s closed April 3 meeting. Meanwhile, the uncertainty lingers, and investors await SEC meeting updates to analyze XRP’s trajectory. Will XRP Price Hit New ATH With Paul Atkin as SEC Chair? The Ripple token’s price performance has been in a complete downtrend for several years before making a recovery with the Gary Gensler resignation from the SEC Chairperson role. That’s because Gansler and his crypto regulatory stance affected XRP consistently. Experts believe a better approach and a crypto-friendly chair, like Paul Atkins, could significantly influence the price. Additionally, the XRP price predictions form the possibility of a further uptrend from here. According to the crypto analyst, CRYPTOWZRD X post , more green candles from here could shift the Ripple token back to a symmetric triangle, eventually pushing its price to $2.80 before breaking out to $3.65. Although this depends on various parameters, the XRP’s performance can rally with bullish stimulus like Atkins becoming the SEC Chair.

According to Glassnode, short-term holders—those who have held bitcoin for less than 155 days—are typically more reactive to price movements, often buying during periods of euphoria and selling during downturns. However, of late, short-term holders appear to have become value-driven buyers despite bitcoin currently sitting roughly 25% below its all-time high. Since the start of April, this group has grown by around 15,000 BTC, now holding a total of just over 3.7 million BTC. That said, since February, they have distributed approximately 280,000 BTC—likely a mix of profit-taking from the November–December rally, which followed President Donald Trump’s election win. That's in addition to panic selling during bitcoin's 30% drawdown from its January all-time high. Long-term holders—those who have held for at least 155 days – have boosted their coin stash by 400,000 BTC since February, with small amounts acquired this month, taking the overall tally to over 13.5 million. This suggests growing conviction among long-term holders, even amid recent price stagnation. While bitcoin has remained relatively flat since the start of April, Nasdaq is down 3.5% in the same time frame, with futures pointing to a further 3% decline.",Markets|Bitcoin|long-term holder|short term,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-04 11:54:48

A stronger resistance level is at $1.00, where the price consolidated in February before resuming the downtrend. A move above $0.80 would be the first sign of potential recovery, but for a chance of trend reversal, MNT would need to break above $1.00 with strong volume and hold.

42896265,https://coinpedia.org/?p=440366,1743767950,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,"China’s Retaliatory Tariffs Shake Global Markets, Bitcoin Dips To $82K",https://coinpedia.org/news/chinas-retaliatory-tariffs-shake-global-markets-bitcoin-dips-to-82k/,"The post China’s Retaliatory Tariffs Shake Global Markets, Bitcoin Dips To $82K appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Global markets are on edge as China slams the U.S. with a 34% tariff, sending shockwaves through Wall Street and crypto. Bitcoin, which had recently shown signs of recovery, climbing above $84K, took a hit as Nasdaq futures plunged further. Bitcoin slipped from $84,600 to $83,000, however the drop isn’t as sharp as expected. That’s because the market’s biggest fears are now out in the open as uncertainty often causes more stress than the actual event itself. Since Trump took office on January 20, fears of tariffs and a global trade war have rattled markets, leading a massive drop in investor confidence. This fear-driven sell-off dragged Bitcoin down from its record high of over $109,000 to under $80,000 last month. Besides, U.S. investors pulled $10.85 billion from equity funds in the week ending April 2, over concerns that Trump’s trade tariffs could raise costs, hurt profits, and trigger a recession. This was a big drop from the $22.89 billion they invested the week before. Trump’s Tariffs Could Be Good for Crypto? This week, Trump hit 180 nations with massive tariffs, with China, the EU, and Southeast Asia facing the biggest hits. U.S. tariffs now exceed the 20% threshold set by the 1930s Smoot-Hawley Act. However, this “tariffageddon” moment signals the end of market uncertainty and could actually boost investor confidence. After the tariffs, bond yields dropped globally, suggesting inflation might ease. This goes against the common belief that tariffs would cause stagflation, rising prices with slow growth and forcing the Fed to keep interest rates high. The U.S. 10-year bond yields have dropped below 4% for the first time since October, and rates in the U.K., Germany, and Japan have also fallen sharply. This raises hopes for Fed rate cuts and helps boost risky assets like crypto. Friday’s jobs report could either make people more hopeful if it’s strong or support rate cuts if it’s weak, since it won’t reflect Trump’s new tariffs. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market in “Extreme Fear” After Trump’s Liberation Day Tariff Shock , Global Correlation Hitting Hard The crypto community notes that the real issue is not Bitcoin’s fundamentals, but it’s the global market correlation dragging crypto down. As markets face broader economic challenges, crypto isn’t immune to the broader market volatility. However, once global issues ease, Bitcoin is poised to bounce back faster than ever. The Brighter Side Nevertheless, the crypto market is shifting its focus back to promising developments. Circle’s USDC is moving forward with its IPO, and Coinbase Derivatives has filed with the CFTC to self-certify XRP futures. Plus, Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade is set to launch on May 7, marking a significant step forward. Besides, the SEC has recognized Fidelity’s application for a spot ETF linked to SOL, moving it closer to approval.

Cryptocurrency exchange Bitget has received a digital asset service provider license from El Salvador ‘s National Commission of Digital Assets, following its earlier approval for a Bitcoin services provider license earlier in 2024, the company said in a Friday press release . According to the exchange, the new license allows it to offer more services in the country, including spot and derivatives trading as well as staking and other yield-focused products. Hon Ng, chief legal officer at Bitget, says the company’s move to grow in El Salvador is linked to the country’s continued push to stay “ahead of many with its progressive and transparent approach to Bitcoin ( BTC ) and digital asset regulation, making it an attractive jurisdiction for good quality web3 companies aiming to operate responsibly at scale.” “Our focus at Bitget is to enter countries with a regulated framework for crypto and provide our best services as we expand on our global regulatory strategy.” Hon Ng You might also like: Bitget becomes the first crypto firm to sponsor a driver on Porsche Cup Brazil 2025 Bitget said it plans to keep supporting jurisdictions that offer “clear frameworks and support the development of a secure, efficient crypto economy,” though it didn’t name specific countries.

For instance, in early January, stablecoin issuer Tether said it would move its corporate entity and subsidiaries to El Salvador after securing a digital asset service provider license in the Central American nation.

Polygon and VeChain, both known for their utility, scalability, and supply chain tracking features, have established themselves over years of development. However, the spotlight is now on BlockDAG, a project that has gained momentum after its Keynote 3. While MATIC and VET have shown declines in the past year, BlockDAG raised an impressive $5 million in just two days, increasing its presale total to $211.5 million! With over 19 billion coins sold and an astonishing 2,380% return since Batch 1, BlockDAG is proving that effective execution and clear delivery timelines can generate real-world traction in the crypto market. Polygon: A Solution for Ethereum’s Scaling Challenges Polygon (MATIC) is a Layer 2 solution designed to improve Ethereum’s speed and reduce transaction costs. It achieves this through sidechains and a modified proof-of-stake mechanism, enhancing decentralized app (dApp) performance. In 2019, Polygon raised $5 million in an initial exchange offering (IEO) on Binance, selling 1.9 billion MATIC tokens at $0.00263 each. As of April 1, 2025, MATIC is priced at $0.204629, reflecting a slight 1.17% increase from the previous close. However, MATIC has faced a 26% decrease in value over the past year. Despite this, analysts remain optimistic about its future, with some predicting it could reach $1.03 by 2024 and potentially $10.51 by 2030. The project continues to grow, with confidence in its ability to scale Ethereum and support decentralized applications, offering long-term potential for the future. VeChain’s Innovation in Supply Chain Management VeChain (VET) is a blockchain platform aimed at improving transparency and tracking within supply chains. It utilizes a dual-token system, with VET for value transfer and VeThor (VTHO) for transaction fees. VeChain raised over $20 million in 2017 through a successful initial coin offering (ICO) to fund its development. Currently, VET is priced at $0.02288327, showing a slight increase of 2.76% from the previous close. However, over the past year, it has dropped by around 18%. Despite this, some forecasts remain positive, predicting that VET could reach $0.08 by 2025 and potentially $0.33 by 2030. BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 Success: Presale Sees $5M Boost in 2 Days! BlockDAG’s third keynote didn’t just deliver updates—it ignited confidence. Within just 48 hours of its release, BlockDAG raised $5 million in presale funding, bringing its total to an impressive $211.5 million. This wasn’t just hype; it was a clear signal of the project’s progress and credibility, driven by a focused roadmap and functional demos shared during the keynote. The keynote also showcased real-world integrations and a working testnet, adding substance to the project’s promises. The “Primordial” beta testnet allowed developers and early adopters to see BlockDAG’s DAG architecture in action, providing tangible evidence of progress. As of now, BlockDAG is in Batch 27, with the price set at $0.0248—offering a 2,380% return for early supporters who joined at the $0.001 launch price. Over 19 billion coins have already been sold, with a total of $6.2 million in miner sales and 16,000 miners sold. This continued demand highlights how users are responding not just to the numbers, but to the solid foundation behind them. BlockDAG has demonstrated that clarity and execution lead to trust, and the market is taking notice. By pairing public updates with actual backend progress, BlockDAG has transformed announcements into signals of genuine growth. The market message is clear: BlockDAG isn’t just talking about its vision; it’s actively building it, and the support is following suit. Why Clear Delivery Stands Out! While Polygon and VeChain have maintained relevance through long-term development, BlockDAG’s recent presale surge demonstrates that today’s market also rewards speed and visible progress. Following its third keynote, the overwhelming support in funding and community engagement shows that confidence now depends on execution, not just promises. While established projects continue to evolve their ecosystems, BlockDAG has earned trust through transparency and timely execution. If this trend continues, the market focus may shift from the pioneers to the projects that deliver when it counts.

Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) & Ripple (XRP) prices have been gaining some strength regardless of the negative on-chain data. Hence, it can be assumed that the bulls are gaining some strength, and hence, the prices of these tokens may remain elevated for the rest of Q2 2025. Cardano (ADA) Price Analysis for Q2 2025 The ADA price has been trying hard to revive a strong upswing, due to which the token has been forming constant lower highs and lows ever since it marked local highs above $1.3. The token has rebounded from the support of the falling wedge, and the probability of a bullish breakout seems to be extremely low. Therefore, bearish clouds continue to hover over the Cardano price rally, which may drag the levels close to $0.5. Although the price is trading within a bullish pattern, the probability of a breakout remains pretty low. The 50/200-day MAs are about to undergo a bearish crossover along with the conversion and base lines of the Ichimoku cloud. This suggests the bears are slowly gaining strength compared to the bulls, which may not be good for a healthy ascending trend. Hence, the ADA price is expected to drop and test local support at $0.5 before initiating a fresh bullish action in Q2 2025. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis for Q2 2025 The Ripple price in the short term has entered a crucial range wherein a breakdown may result in a massive bearish action. The price has faced a rejection from the interim resistance zone, which suggests the bearish pressure over the token continues to persist. Hence, the XRP price is believed to face a notable pullback if it fails to defend the support at $1.96. The Bulls have been defending the support zone between $1.99 and $1.97 since before, but the drop in the volume suggests a breakdown is fast approaching this weekend. On the other hand, the stochastic RSI is about to trigger a bearish crossover at the average levels, validating the bearish claim. Therefore, the XRP price is expected to break the support and plunge below $1.8 to enter the demand zone. Here, one can expect a rebound back to the support-turned-resistance zone, but the strength of the bulls may determine the next price of action.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-04 12:04:32

Three factors now indicate that more bearish headwinds lie ahead and could spark a massive downturn for DOGE price to $0.06. Dogecoin Price Risks 60% Crash to $0.06 Dogecoin price today trades at $0.165 with a slight 1.5% increase in 24 hours. However, despite this surge, three indicators suggest that the meme coin might be headed for further dips. Analyst Flips Bearish on Dogecoin Price One of the top reasons why DOGE is facing a 60% crash is because of the Dogecoin price prediction shared by popular analyst Ali Charts. In his analysis, the analyst identified that DOGE was sitting at the lower trendline of an ascending parallel channel. If DOGE flips the lower channel of this trendline, it may trigger a sharp dip to the 23.6% Fibonacci level of $0.06, which will mark a 60% fall from the current DOGE price. Conversely, if DOGE can sustain levels above $0.16 and avoids breaching this trendline, it could spark an uptrend to $0.57. DOGE/USDT: 1-week Chart Liquidation Heatmap Shows Massive Liquidation Zone Below Price The liquidation heatmap shows a hot liquidation zone for Dogecoin below the current price. This magnet zone lies at $0.153, where many open long positions will be closed if DOGE drops to this level. DOGE Liquidation Heatmap Prices tend to gravitate towards a hot liquidation zone. Therefore, if Dogecoin falls to this price and triggers these long liquidations, it could lead to additional selling pressure that will push the meme coin lower. Therefore, if DOGE falls to $0.16, the next major support for this top meme coin is $0.153. This might be a trigger for the 60% crash towards $0.06. Elon Musk Abandons “DOGE Father” Role Elon Musk seems to have abandoned his role as the “DOGE Father” after his recent statement about Dogecoin not having any role in the US government. According to Fortune , Musk clarified that DOGE would not be used in any of the government activities. This statement differs from Musk’s previous support for Dogecoin, which has forged his name as the “DOGE father”. Moreover, a previous article by Coingape noted that Musk may have killed Dogecoin’s popularity after his government appointment. Summary Dogecoin price is on the verge of a 60% crash to $0.06 if it breaks support at the lower trendline of an ascending parallel channel. The liquidation heatmap with a 24-hour lookback period and Elon Musk’s failure to support DOGE suggest that the meme coin may face further headwinds.

Justin Sun Claims First Digital Trust Is Bankrupt, Questions Hong Kong Regulators Sun made the allegations in a social media post, stating that FDT has been insolvent for three consecutive years and its net asset value will be negative HK$100 million by the end of 2024. He also alleged that the firm embezzled a large amount of user funds, causing significant financial losses. Sun criticised Hong Kong's regulatory and enforcement agencies, questioning how FDT was still able to operate despite its financial situation. He warned that banking institutions must meet strict capital adequacy requirements under international banking regulations or risk license revocation. Despite its alleged financial problems, FDT is reportedly still publicly raising billions in new capital, which Sun described as “making a mockery of Hong Kong’s legal system.” Sun called on authorities to look into the matter and explain how such a situation could continue under their watch. As of now, FDT has not publicly responded to Sun's allegations, and Hong Kong regulators have yet to issue a statement either. *This is not investment advice.

Related: Bitcoin price can hit $250K in 2025 if Fed shifts to QE: Arthur Hayes Stablecoin depegs “greater systemic risk” than Bitcoin crash Stablecoins depegs pose “a greater systemic risk” to crypto than a Bitcoin ( BTC ) crash, as “stablecoins are integral to liquidity, DeFi and user trust,” according to Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget. Stablecoin depegs can cause “cascading failures like the TerraUSD collapse in 2022,” Chen told Cointelegraph, adding: “Current transparency, collateral quality and accountability among leading stablecoin issuers are insufficient — Tether’s lack of full audits, USDC’s exposure to banking risks and algorithmic stablecoins’ fragility highlight the market’s vulnerability to the next depeg event.” “To mitigate risks, the market should enforce real-time audits, prioritize high-quality collateral like US Treasurys, strengthen regulatory oversight and diversify stablecoin usage to reduce reliance on a few dominant players,” Chen added. In May 2022, the $40 billion Terra ecosystem collapsed, erasing tens of billions of dollars of value in days. Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST), had yielded an over 20% annual percentage yield (APY) on Anchor Protocol before its collapse.

Despite optimism, Ethereum faces strong headwinds, which might result in a further price collapse in the near future. Good Time to Buy? Ethereum (ETH) has been experiencing a severe downturn in recent months, with its price dropping by over 20% on a 30-day scale. However, some industry participants remain unfazed by the pullback, viewing it as a perfect buying opportunity. The X user Doctor Profit told his almost 400,000 followers on X that he increased his exposure to the asset when it was trading at $1,800. He even called the current conditions “a gift for the long term.” The trader revealed using 10% of his available cash for the purchase and putting aside the remaining 90% “to add more in the coming days.” “I buy once the streets are filled with blood, now is a good time,” he stated. It might seem scary, but some renowned investors have actually recommended such actions in times of fear. The famous billionaire Warren Buffett once said, “Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.” Shortly after disclosing his ETH purchase, Doctor Profit claimed that the price of the cryptocurrency is sitting at a historical support of around $1,800. “The same support I have mentioned several months ago, now we dumped to this area! With this massive correction and fear we are perfectly sitting at this support! Undervalued now,” he argued. How About a Deeper Correction? It is important to note that a few hours after the aforementioned post , ETH dipped below the depicted level and currently trades at around $1,770. For its part, the entire cryptocurrency market experienced another retreat following China’s reaction to Donald Trump’s latest trade tariffs. Full-scale tariff war? China hits ALL U.S. imports with 34% tariffs. Nasdaq 100 futures nosedive 600+ points. Crypto felt it too. pic.twitter.com/l9eDJffZlu — CryptoPotato Official (@Crypto_Potato) April 4, 2025 Several other factors, such as ETH’s exchange netflow, suggest that the cryptocurrency might continue to bleed in the short term. According to CryptoQuant data, inflows have surpassed outflows over the past week, signaling that investors are moving from self-custody to centralized platforms, thereby increasing immediate selling pressure. The analytics firm recently estimated that the diminished network activity is one of the major reasons why ETH has been disappointing. This decline, combined with the plummeting average fees per transaction and per block, has pushed Ethereum’s burn rate to its lowest level since the Merge (September 2022). CryptoQuant estimated that since the Dencun upgrade last year, more ETH has been minted than burned, which explains the slump. The retreat of the whales is another worrying element that indicates more pain for the bulls. The renowned analyst Ali Martinez claimed that the number of large ETH transactions tanked by almost 64% from February 25 to March 31, signaling a substantial drop in whale activity. Additionally, large investors offloaded 760,000 ETH (worth over $1.3 billion) in the past two weeks alone. Such sell-offs increase the circulating supply of the asset and could negatively impact its price (assuming demand doesn’t react accordingly). In addition, the whales’ actions may spread panic across the space, with smaller players following suit.

Meanwhile, the gaming presale gem Rollblock is standing out with record growth and astonishing projections of a 50x rally that could send its token price to $1 this cycle. Here's why these three altcoins are getting all the attention this week. Rollblock (RBLK): Explosive Web3 Growth Suggests a $1 Target Is in Sight Rollblock is proving that the world of GameFi is just getting started. With over 8000 AI-powered games including live poker, blackjack, roulette, and sports prediction leagues, Rollblock offers a decentralized gaming experience that’s hard to beat. The platform requires no frustrating download or app and supports instant fiat payments via Apple Pay, Google Pay, Visa, and Mastercard. Rollblock reported an incredible $1,941,655 in total bets wagered in March , up nearly 50% from February. Deposits jumped by 110%, registrations by 5%, and Gross Gaming Revenue climbed by 50% – every metric is hitting all-time highs right now. All gameplay is secured on Ethereum for transparent payouts in a $500 billion industry that desperately needs it. Its token launch has proven extremely popular with $11.1 million already raised, and Stage 10 of the presale is over 53% sold already at $0.062. For a deeper look, check out this project overview from Freddie Finance: RBLK Tokenomics: Big Burns and Even Bigger Rewards Rollblock has built a powerful deflationary model. Each week, 30% of platform revenue is used to buy RBLK from the open market. Of that, 60% is burned to reduce the supply, and 40% goes to staking rewards that pay up to 30% APY to its loyal holders. This dual mechanism creates constant upward buying pressure and turns every user into a stakeholder in the project. With major exchange listings on the way and fast-selling presale momentum, early buyers could see some serious upside in 2025. Ripple (XRP): Support Holding, But For How Long? XRP is trading at $2.04 today after a tough week that saw it fall nearly 13%. Amin_BTC wrote , “Staying above the $2.0125 support level is positive, initially targeting $2.1500.” However, the analyst cautions that “Losing the $2.0125 support could lead to a correction towards $1.8915.” This means XRP is at a crossroads right now, with bulls needing to defend this key level to avoid a deeper pullback. If XRP can hold here and reclaim $2.15, then a run toward $2.50 becomes much more likely, with the $6 target still alive for XRP in 2025. Cardano Price Prediction (ADA): Holding Steady With Room to Run Cardano is trading at $0.64 today, losing 5% in 24 hours as the market prices in the incoming tariff war. As CryptoLS shared , “Cardano just delivered a clean bounce off the $0.6348 support, flexing strength while the rest of the market stays uncertain.” If Cardano buyers continue to step in here with volume, ADA could easily spike to $0.70 and beyond. This Cardano price prediction lines up with many analysts who see ADA breaking out soon. Cardano remains one of the most stable plays for long-term holders looking to ride the next bullish wave of layer 1 interest. Rollblock Could Lead the 2025 Altcoin Surge XRP and Cardano both have bullish potential for the coming quarter, but Rollblock is already delivering stunning results. With unmatched growth and tokenomics built for long-term success, Rollblock stands out as the low-cap altcoin to watch right now.

The crypto trading platform faces this fine for allegedly violating the anti-money laundering rules. Notably, the Maltese authority’s increased scrutiny over OKX comes amid the Thai SEC’s lawsuit against the exchange. Let’s unveil the details of the Malta government’s allegations over the crypto exchange and the potential implications. Malta Imposes $1.2M Fine on OKX Malta’s Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) has alleged that OKX violated anti-money laundering (AML) laws. As a result, Okcoin Europe, OKX’s European subsidiary, faces a penalty of 1.1 million euros, equivalent to about $1.2 million. On April 3, 2025, the Maltese authority announced this significant move, arguing that the exchange breached AML laws multiple times in 2023. Though the exchange has advanced its AML policies recently, the FIAU could overlook its “serious and systematic” compliance failures during the past. OKX Faces AML Compliance Issues, FIAU Alleges Previously, in January 2025, the Malta Financial Services Authority imposed a fine of 304,000 euros ($336,254) for violating other rules. Significantly, Malta’s regulator conducted a detailed review of OKX in April 2023 and identified that the platform failed to meet the standards of AML regulations. Among the major issues was the exchange’s inability to identify money laundering threats associated with its services. In addition, the regulator raised concerns over potential exposure to high-risk customers as the exchange allegedly skipped risk checks on nearly half of the client files reviewed. Further, the FIAU spotted inadequate transaction monitoring, which can lead to undetected suspicious activity. The recent development follows the T hai SEC’s lawsuit against the crypto exchange over allegations of offering crypto services without proper registration. OKX Expands to Europe Despite these legal woes, OKX remains committed to its vision of European expansion. Becoming the first crypto exchange to obtain a MiCA license in 2025, OKX has begun to launch services across Europe. An official statement read, Receiving our full MiCA license is just the beginning of the OKX story in Europe. We’re committed to unlocking crypto trading and onchain discovery for millions more people in the region. It’s all part of our mission to empower people to secure their financial freedom through crypto, all with the peace of mind that they’re protected by robust regulation. Moreover, the exchange is restructuring its leadership. Recently, OKX appointed Linda Lacewell , the former head of NYDFS, as the platform’s new Chief Legal Officer.

In an exclusive interview on Decentralize with Cointelegraph’s Byte-Sized Insight series, Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot shared new details about the venture’s vision, why the timing was right and how the company plans to scale. The right team and the right time “We’ve thought about splitting out our Bitcoin mining and energy infrastructure businesses for some time,” Genoot said. “Meeting Eric and Don Jr., and seeing their deep passion for Bitcoin and infrastructure, was the perfect catalyst.” According to Genoot, the goal is clear: to build one of the world’s largest and most efficient Bitcoin mining platforms, rooted in American soil and aligned with pro-Bitcoin sentiment growing under President Donald Trump’s administration. “Eric told me, ‘I don’t want to get involved in anything that isn’t the biggest and the best,’” he said. The move comes at a pivotal moment for US-based mining. With China out of the picture post-2021 crackdown, and Washington now openly exploring the idea of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, America’s place in the global mining ecosystem is under transformation. Still, size isn’t everything. Genoot emphasized that efficiency and cost-effectiveness are core to the strategy. “We don’t want to just be the biggest. We want to be the most efficient and cost-effective miner. If our cost basis isn’t low, we might as well just buy Bitcoin.” Related: Bitcoin miner Hut 8 argues to toss ‘short and distort’ shareholder suit Mining and accumulating BTC American Bitcoin’s structure allows it to mine BTC at low cost, accumulate more when the market allows, and potentially expand into other Bitcoin ecosystem services. Hut 8 currently holds over 10,000 BTC on its balance sheet, worth up to $1 billion depending on market conditions. American Bitcoin aims to surpass that. And the company isn’t just bullish on Bitcoin; it’s bullish on power consumption. Genoot pushed back on criticism that mining wastes energy: “Power consumption has only increased with every tech revolution. Cheap, excess energy is what drives Bitcoin mining — and a lot of that energy is renewable.” Looking ahead, Hut 8’s mining spinoff has big ambitions. “Our focus is scaling. Our focus is taking this company public on a US exchange,” Genoot said. “You’ll hear more from us soon.” Listen to the full episode of Byte-Sized Insight for the complete interview on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page , Apple Podcasts or Spotify .

42899419,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=705513,1743773448,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42899419.jpeg,Weaponized trade could introduce weaponized capital to the global economy,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/weaponized-trade-weaponized-capital-economy/,"US President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” sweeping trade tariffs is clearly an admittedly weaponized plan to make countries more susceptible to his administration’s agenda. But what if other economies completely walk out of the deal? Broken supply chains, more trade deficits, and last but not least, the weaponization of capital. Trump is promoting his policy direction as a way to revive domestic industry and reduce trade imbalances. He believes the way to do this is to mount heavy tariffs on everyone (excluding Russia). Does the world really need the US at the business table? Maybe some countries, but definitely not Trump’s supposed “number one enemy,” China. International investors are now rethinking their exposure to the US economy. Owing to the current market bloodbath, they’re also preparing for a world in which capital, not just goods, is a tool of geopolitical pressure. US market capital flows could be at risk Over the past six months, according to multiple investor surveys cited by the Financial Times, exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows have been moving toward non-US markets. Foreign stakeholders hedge aren’t smiling about the growing unpredictability in US trade and economic policy, leaving Wall Street to deal with the brunt. In the surveys, economists predicted that a shrinking US trade deficit, thanks to Donald Trump’s cutthroat tariffs, would inevitably lead to diminished cross-border capital flows. By the rule of business, a nation’s current account deficit mirrors its inward capital flows, so narrowing the trade gap could inadvertently restrict the foreign capital that has supported the US financial system for decades. Non-bank financial institutions, which now control roughly 70% of America’s private sector financial assets, could get the bitter end of the deal. These establishments grow by channeling international capital into American listed and private investments. If the flow “mistakenly” slows or reverses, the US markets would have to bid goodbye to their operations, and even those that survive will have to squeeze funding for the sectors they support. Will investors run away from US markets? When President Trump won his ticket back to Washington’s most secure office in November, the stock market flashed green, market after market open. Foreign and local investors all had one idea: a Trumpian market would make them rich. And so they flocked to US markets, hoping to catch the rising train before the ultimate fall came. However, no one expected the fall to come this soon. What’s left now is a threat of capital repatriation, the withdrawal of foreign funds from US markets. Since 2015, international investors’ share of US government debt has dropped from 33% to 24%, a downtick that will shoot down even further if global partners view the US as an unreliable trading counterpart. According to FT, foreign ownership of US stocks has steadily increased over the past two decades and now constitutes around 18% of total US market capitalization. Any concerted move by international investors to withdraw, either in protest or to fund rising domestic defense budgets, will definitely lead to a mass sell-off, and American household wealth will go down with it. The US is reportedly fast-tracking the establishment of a sovereign wealth fund, combining it with large-scale privatizations and sales of federal land, now being slimmed down by Elon Musk-founded Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ). Some analysts assert that it could help Washington build a domestic capital buffer that will surpass Norway’s $1.8 trillion Government Pension Fund Global. But these are just ifs, buts, and maybes; no one knows if President Trump will wake up tomorrow and change his mind. Trump knows Europe and Britain are vulnerable The consequences of a retreat in global capital flows would not be confined to the US because Europe is also grappling with slow growth, persistent inflation risks, and rising fiscal demands. Financial experts have criticized the EU’s fragmented capital markets for lacking the scale and integration needed to support large-scale investment in critical sectors such as defense, infrastructure, and energy. Annual inflation in the Euro Area eased to 2.2% in March 2025, its lowest level since November 2024, and slightly below market expectations of 2.3%, according to a preliminary estimate released Friday. Services inflation dropped to 3.4%, a 33-month low, from 3.7% in February. Energy prices also dipped, falling 0.7% after a slight increase of 0.2% the previous month. Inflation remained unchanged for non-energy industrial goods, holding steady at 0.6%, and for processed food, alcohol, and tobacco at 2.6%. However, unprocessed food prices saw a sharp uptick, rising 4.1% compared to 3.0% in February. Core inflation, which excludes volatile components such as energy and food, slipped to 2.4%, just below analysts’ forecasts of 2.5%. Consumer prices climbed 0.6% in March, following a 0.4% increase in February. The stats show that inflation pressures are going down, but without a decisive and fully unified Capital Markets Union, the bloc will find itself in an existential crisis, which is exactly what Trump wants. We will have to wait and see if the EU will try and negotiate with the US President. Is Trump ready to negotiate or not? According to Trade Counselor to the President of the United States, Peter Navarro, the new tariffs are “not a negotiation.” But Trump, speaking aboard Air Force One on Thursday, told reporters he was open to discussions if other countries presented “phenomenal” offers. Is the President using tariffs to bring down businesses that do not comply so that they will come and talk to him? Some netizens believe so. “ So basically, Trump sits back and waits for the captains of industry to all come to grovel at his feet, and then he grants them tariff waivers if they pay him extortion money. It’s the biggest grift in world history, folks ,” said one user on social media X. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz described the president’s trade ideas as outdated and ineffective. “ You almost have to be an amateur psychologist on this. It’s like Trump is stuck in the ’80s. He’s been on this tariffs thing forever and every economist, conservative or liberal, will tell you they just don’t work … I think the biggest myth perpetuated on this country is that Donald Trump understands anything about business ,” he told CNBC in a recent interview. The room for negotiations is there – it’s always been there.

The approval will allow Bitget to legally operate and offer crypto-related services in the world’s first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender – El Salvador. The license acquisition will also help Bitget in strengthening its presence in Latin America — a region rapidly emerging as a hotbed for crypto innovation and adoption. El Salvador, in particular, has positioned itself as a pioneering force in the digital assets space since its historic move to legalize Bitcoin in 2021. What DASP License Means for Bitget The DASP license enables Bitget to provide services such as crypto custody, exchange operations, wallet infrastructure, and digital asset trading within El Salvador’s regulated digital asset ecosystem. It was formalized under the Digital Assets Issuance Law, passed in January 2023. It created a legal framework to regulate, issue, and market digital assets—including both cryptocurrencies and tokenized securities. What it Means for Country’s users According to Chainalysis, crypto adoption in Latin America surged by over 40% year-on-year in 2024, with El Salvador ranking among the region’s top markets for Bitcoin transactions and digital asset innovation. For El Salvador, the entry of another major exchange like Bitget could help further its ambition to become a regional crypto hub. According to the Chainalysis 2024 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report , Latin America accounted for 9.1% of global cryptocurrency value received between July 2023 and June 2024, with countries like Argentina and Brazil leading in transaction volumes. Bitget, which launched in 2018 and currently boasts over 25 million users globally, has steadily grown its presence through strategic investments, celebrity endorsements, and product diversification — including copy trading and AI-powered investment tools. With the new license, the platform will also roll out localized services tailored to Salvadoran users, including educational initiatives to promote crypto literacy. Next Expansion? Bitget’s regulatory approval in El Salvador follows a series of similar initiatives worldwide. In recent months, the Seychelles-based exchange has been actively pursuing licenses and partnerships in jurisdictions such as Hong Kong, Lithuania, and the United Arab Emirates. Bitget recently also partnered with Cryptorefills to boost crypto travel. And now this latest approval further bolsters Bitget’s commitment to compliance amid global regulatory landscape that is growing more complex.

The price continues to hover around key demand zones, with little sign of immediate strength from bulls, while derivatives and on-chain activity show signs of caution. Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, ETH has failed to recover above the previous support turned resistance near $2,000. The daily structure remains bearish, and the rejection from the $2,200-$2,000 supply zone has intensified selling pressure. The 200-day moving average, currently positioned above $2,800, underscores the broader bearish bias, while RSI lingers in oversold territory, suggesting that downside momentum is still present but potentially weakening. The next strong support lies near the $1,550 region, which is likely going to be touched soon. The 4-Hour Chart Zooming into the 4-hour chart, ETH has formed a horizontal consolidating pattern, with lower highs compressing against horizontal support near $1,750. The asset recently retested the $1,900 zone but was quickly rejected, failing to create any bullish breakout. The RSI has also pulled back from its previous bounce, signaling weakening momentum. A confirmed breakdown below the $1,750 support would likely trigger further downside, while a close above the pattern would be the first sign of short-term strength. Sentiment Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Exchange Reserve From a sentiment and open interest perspective, Ethereum’s open interest has remained elevated compared to historical values in recent years, even as the price continues to slide. This suggests an influx of aggressive short positioning or late leverage entering the market. If this open interest unwinds rapidly, it could trigger short squeezes on any upside volatility. However, as long as it remains high while price drops, it adds pressure and risk of continued liquidations, especially near key support zones.

On April 2, a federal court in Boston sentenced CLS Global on criminal charges for manipulating trading volumes of NexFundAI token. NexFundAI is a bait token launched by FBI in March 2024 as part of a sting operation called “Operation Token Mirrors.” In October 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed fraud charges against CLS Global and several other companies that had taken the bait, including ZM Quant Investment and Gotbit Consulting. MyTrade was also allegedly involved . The FBI reported that the operation led to the confiscation of $25 million in cryptocurrency, and several wash trading bots were shut down. In addition to the $428,000 fine, the court imposed a three-year probation on CLS Global, banning the company from offering services in the U.S. during this period. CLS Global had pleaded guilty to charges in January this year.

One recent example is Galaxy Digital’s $200 million settlement last month, resolving allegations of manipulating the LUNA token following an investigation by New York regulators. Earlier, the SEC accused Justin Sun for manipulating the markets for BitTorrent ( BTT ) and Tron ( TRX ) through wash trading, giving the false impression of active trading and liquidity.

Dogecoin price may reach a maximum of $1.07 in 2025. With a potential surge, the DOGE price may achieve its $3 mark in 2030. Dogecoin, the memecoin category leader, has been surfing the tides of the market. Amidst the turn of events, marketers are hoping for it to match its June 2021 high. The hopes could soon be fulfilled, as the House of Doge within the Dogecoin Foundation has opened the doors to the “Official Dogecoin Reserve” by acquiring 10 million DOGE to boost payment utility and transaction efficiency. Talking about DOGE’s price, it is currently holding onto its support at $0.1641, a bullish push from here could lead DOGE to its resistance at $0.18. On the flipside, if bears hunt DOGE down, its price could tumble to $0.15 in the very short term. As the underlying dynamics shift amid broader market volatility, investors have started wondering, “Will Dogecoin reach $1?” to “Will Dogecoin go up?” Are you wondering the same? Worry not, Coinpedia’s Dogecoin price prediction 2025 to 2030 will clear all such doubts. Look at this well-researched and detailed DOGE price prediction for the upcoming moves.

On the other hand, if the market is hit again by external forces like regulations or negative statements by influencers. Hence, the meme coin might trade at a potential low of $ 0.62 . We expect the DOGE price to reach a new swing high of $1.07 by the end of 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $0.62 $0.84 $1.07 Can DOGE Break the $1 Barrier? Given DOGE’s success, largely driven by hype with some technical progress, crossing $1 by 2025 remains a realistic possibility. A sustained media frenzy and growing endorsement deals could maintain bullish momentum. Expanded merchant adoption would also strengthen confidence in its long-term viability. Dogecoin’s Tokenomics and Long-Term Outlook The future of Dogecoin hinges on its utility. Meme popularity alone may not sustain it indefinitely, but advancements in transaction fees, speed, and business collaborations could help it thrive as a mainstream digital currency. Its large and passionate community will likely continue to drive positive evolution. Conclusion Given Dogecoin’s past price behavior, driven largely by online hype and media coverage, it has the potential to reach over $1 in 2025. DOGE has shown remarkable resilience, and key factors like expanded merchant adoption, community growth, and protocol upgrades could enhance its viability.

Malta regulator fines OKX crypto exchange $1.2 million for past AML breaches Cryptocurrency exchange OKX is under regulatory scrutiny in Europe after Maltese authorities issued a fine for violations of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws in the past. Malta’s Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) fined Okcoin Europe — OKX’s Europe-based arm — 1.1 million euros ($1.2 million) after detecting multiple AML failures on the platform in 2023, the authority announced on April 3. While admitting that OKX has significantly improved its AML policies in the past 18 months, the authority “could not ignore” its compliance failures from 2023, “some of which were deemed to be serious and systematic,” the FIAU said. OKX was among the first crypto exchanges to receive a license under Europe’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation via its Malta hub in January 2025. The FIAU stated that at the time of the compliance examination in 2023, OKX compiled a business risk assessment (BRA) in an attempt to identify threats and vulnerabilities. The regulators found multiple deficiencies within the BRA’s methodology, making OKX unable to properly access the money laundering risks it was exposed to and to take necessary measures to manage them, it said. Some of those risks included potential threats from the use of cryptocurrency mixers or tumblers, privacy coins , stablecoins and the usage of tokens on decentralized exchanges. An excerpt from FIAU’s penalty statement to Okcoin Europe. Source: FIAU A spokesperson for OKX did not respond to Cointelegraph’s request to comment on whether the exchange admitted to such wrongdoing in the past. “With this chapter behind us, OKX remains focused on the future — continuing to build a secure, transparent, and compliant platform for our users worldwide,” the representative said. Genius Group says it’s been banned from buying more Bitcoin Singapore-based artificial intelligence firm Genius Group says it’s temporarily barred from expanding its Bitcoin treasury after a US court order has banned it from selling shares, raising funds and using investor funds to buy more Bitcoin. Source: Roger James Hamilton A New York District court issued the preliminary injunction (PI) and temporary restraining order (TRO) on March 13 in connection with a broader dispute surrounding its merger with Fatbrain AI, the Genius Group said in an April 3 statement. “Genius is taking all necessary measures to minimize Bitcoin sales but anticipates that it will need to downsize its Bitcoin Treasury in the coming months in the event the PI remains in place,” the firm said. Paul Atkins’ SEC nomination passes committee vote Paul Atkins is one step closer to securing the top position at the US Securities and Exchange Commission after the Senate Banking Committee voted to advance his nomination. In an April 3 banking committee session, lawmakers voted 13 to 11 for Atkins to serve two consecutive terms as a commissioner at the government agency, effectively taking over former Chair Gary Gensler’s term. Atkins’ nomination is expected to go to a full Senate vote in the near future. Senator Tim Scott speaks at the committee hearing. Source: US Senate Banking Committee Before the vote, committee chair Tim Scott said Atkins would bring “much-needed clarity” to the cryptocurrency sector.

Trump’s Tariffs Spark Panic Sell-Off,https://cryptonews.com/news/the-end-for-pepe-and-meme-coins-tariffs-spark-panic-sell-off/,"PEPE has become a hard sell in the “best crypto to buy” conversation, now down over 75% from its all-time high just 4 months ago with a “Liberation Day” fueled sell-off. Recession fears bolstered by Trump’s “tariff war” escalations have sparked mass liquidations across investment markets—hitting Pepe particularly hard. To its credit, Pepe held up better than many. Despite a sharp 20% drop this week, the meme coin still posted a modest 0.47% gain for the month—signs of resilience while others face steeper losses. Trump’s Tariff War: Are Meme Coins in Danger? With the April 2nd “Liberation Day” tariffs, global equities fell across the board. US stocks mirrored losses seen in Asia and Europe. LIBERATION DAY RECIPROCAL TARIFFS pic.twitter.com/ODckbUWKvO — The White House (@WhiteHouse) April 2, 2025 The S&P 500 slipped back into correction territory today, down 9.8% for the month—wiping out $2.4 trillion in value in its worst single-day drop since September 2022. While crypto sometimes decouples from traditional markets, its 15% decline in market cap over the month shows it remains vulnerable to risk-off sentiment. And when crypto bleeds, meme coins often bleed more. Their speculative nature has driven losses deeper—down 16.5% for the month. Since the tariff war began in early February, meme coins find themself increasingly susceptible to volatility under heavy market FUD. PEPE Price Analysis: Panic Sell or ‘Buy-the-Dip’? Despite the threat to meme coins, Pepe’s setup is unique. Its resilience this month stems from a key historical support that has marked every major bottom since mid-2024. Pepe nears a potential confluence zone where this support meets the resistance that has capped upside attempts throughout its 4-month downtrend. If this level holds, PEPE could retest the resistance—part of a falling wedge pattern that guided price movements since early December. Still, momentum remains questionable as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) struggles to break above the neural line. While it displays an uptrend, it seems to lack follow-through. More so, the MACD line has slipped below the signal line in a death cross, though this may be short-lived—as has been the case with past tests of this support zone. If stronger buying pressure emerges, a breakout targets highs around $0.00002, marking a 160% gain from current levels. But given the prevailing bearish conditions, a more realistic near-term target sits at February’s high of $0.00001—a 50% move from here. This New ICO is Helping Traders Get Ahead of Sell-Offs While the market remains weighed down by FUD, few coins are catching tailwinds.

42900211,https://blockworks.co/news/altcoin-trade-volume-caution,1743774230,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,Altcoin volumes are ‘more concentrated’ than ever,https://blockworks.co/news/altcoin-trade-volume-caution,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Even before the tariffs, it was clear that risk assets — like bitcoin and crypto — were going out of style for a lot of investors. And now, with the tariffs on the table, it wouldn’t be surprising if we continued to see folks move away from these riskier assets. Which leaves us with one big question: Does this mean we’re out of luck for an altcoin season? A Kaiko Research and BRN report noted that altcoins just haven’t been able to break — or, in some cases, even come close to — their 2021-2022 peaks. On the bright side, though, we are seeing altcoin dominance levels rise relative to bitcoin, but the distribution there has been uneven. Source: Kaiko Research and BRN Report “Altcoin trade volume has returned to pre-FTX levels, but it is more concentrated than ever. The top 10 altcoins account for 64% of the total volume, indicating that investors are focusing capital on a select group. Market depth mirrors this trend, with the top 10 comprising over 60% of the 1% depth,” the analysts wrote. In a nutshell — after the US elections, there was a jump back into altcoins, but only into a select few. Altcoins across the board didn’t get the boost, which is different from what we’ve seen the last few cycles, when the rising tide lifted all the boats. “This shrinking pool of market leaders reflects a shift from retail-driven speculation to institutional capital favoring a concentrated set of high-liquidity assets,” according to the report. The smaller pool, the analysts noted, can be tied back to the institutional shift. But interest rates play into the narrative as well. Tighter monetary policy is forcing traders to take on a more cautious approach. Source: Kaiko Indices There was a lot of hope initially that regulatory certainty would be a much-needed boost for altcoins — especially since the previous SEC clearly targeted some of the top ones in their regulation via enforcement approach. But without the reengagement of retail, altcoins are left in the lurch. Perhaps altcoin ETFs could change that and offer a bit more certainty for the institutional crowd, which is clearly ready to engage with parts of crypto. But, honestly, I’m not so sure. Mostly because — outside of a potential SOL ETF — it’s not clear what other altcoins would be ready for an ETF at this stage. But don’t let my cautiousness dim your hope for altcoin szn. There are still a couple of factors to keep an eye on, per the report. We know RWAs and stablecoins are real winners, which could also translate into altcoins. Projects that are tied to a “real-world utility” like DePIN, for example, could also grab interest. Liquidity trends could change in regards to the aforementioned alt ETFs, and that also ties into the regulatory environment. Though if President Trump has his way, the focus is really going to be on US projects rather than anything overseas. Basically, this time around, folks aren’t just going to jump into an alt for the trade. It looks like there’ll be more attention paid to projects focused on revenue generation. Unfortunately, this also means that the likelihood of a face-ripping altcoin szn is getting slimmer and slimmer. A sign of maturity, if you ask me. Get the news in your inbox.

With mounting price pressure on both Dogecoin and Solana, many concerned holders are rotating into Rollblock – a viral GambleFi project that’s already seeing explosive adoption among early buyers. Analysts say Rollblock could rally up to 50x this year, and early buyers are positioning right now. Rollblock (RBLK): DOGE and SOL Whales Are Flocking to This GambleFi Giant Rollblock is picking up speed like no other token in 2025. The Web3 gaming platform just reported record-setting growth : $1,941,655 in total bets during March alone, up nearly 50% from February. Deposits grew by 110%, registrations rose by 5%, and Gross Gaming Revenue increased by a whopping 50%. Everything is logged onto the Ethereum blockchain, giving players full transparency for every bid and payout and ending decades of shady manipulation. Rollblock’s offering includes over 8000 immersive, AI-powered gaming experiences, from poker and blackjack to a high-traffic sports prediction league that covers thousands of real-time events. Fiat onboarding is now seamless with Apple Pay, Google Pay, Visa, and Mastercard now fully integrated. The project is already 53% through Stage 10 of its presale, with tokens currently priced at the discount level of $0.062. Rollblock holds a license from Gaming Anjouan and recently passed a successful audit by Solid Proof, giving it real credibility in an industry that sorely needs it. With $11.1 million raised already and more users arriving daily, this project is turning into a phenomenon. Watch this video from Crypto Octo for the full deep dive: RBLK Tokenomics: Revenue Sharing Meets Deflationary Precision Each week, Rollblock buys back RBLK using 30% of its operating revenue. 60% of those tokens are burned to reduce the supply, while 40% is distributed to stakers at attractive rates of up to 30% APY in risk-free income. This system is creating a compounding effect of scarcity and reward. With exchange listings approaching fast and demand ramping up like never before, RBLK’s current price may not last long. Dogecoin (DOGE): Decision Time at Support Dogecoin is trading at $0.16 today after falling 6.9% in the last 24 hours. According to tradingheights , “Dogecoin is at a make-or-break level. If $0.16 holds, a rally to $0.57 could follow. If it fails, a drop to $0.06 becomes likely.” That uncertainty has some DOGE holders taking an interest in other opportunities, where fundamentals are clearer and revenue is real. While Dogecoin could still bounce here if the market shakes off its tariff anxiety, the risk of a sharp drop has long-term meme coin investors on edge. Solana (SOL): Whale Movements Causing Shockwaves Solana is trading at $114 today, down by 8% after a significant on-chain move. Solana whales are spooking the market with large transactions right now. As CryptoSatRed reported, “A whale just unstaked 315,079 SOL — that’s $37.28M — and sent it to Binance within the last 9 hours!” Big moves like this often hint at incoming selling pressure or portfolio rotation out of Solana. The whale still holds over $38 million in SOL and hSOL combined, but the selloff has sparked speculation in the Solana community that some of this capital may be rotating into higher-upside plays. Rollblock Is the Best Bet for 2025 Gains Dogecoin and Solana still have loyal holders of course, but Rollblock is where the real breakout is happening right now. With top-tier tokenomics and unmatched GameFi momentum, Rollblock offers the most compelling upside of all three in 2025. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

At this point, while the risk of decline due to tariffs continues for BTC and altcoins, cryptocurrency analysis company Santiment said in its latest post that investors showed great interest in Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple USD (RLUSD), Tether (USDT), Cardano (ADA) and Binance Coin (BNB) on social media. “Here are the top trending assets as cryptocurrencies shake on tariff news and show signs of recovery amid US stock markets being closed.” Solana (SOL): Solana is seeing increasing levels of price predictions, market trends, and technical analysis indicating significant interest and activity around it. Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum is trending due to frequent mentions in analytics, price predictions, and technical reviews. Additionally, investors are discussing the transition to Ethereum 2.0 and its impact on scalability and adoption. Ripple USD (RLUSD): Ripple’s newly launched stablecoin, which has been gaining significant traction, is trending due to its relationship with Ripple. It has integrated with Ripple’s payment systems, improving cross-border transactions and attracting institutional interest. The stablecoin has seen a surge in adoption and trading volume. News of the Kraken move has increased interest in RLUSD. Tether (USDT): Trending due to frequent mentions on various platforms. Cardano (ADA): It is trending because it is frequently mentioned in discussions around cryptocurrency prices and market analysis.

CZ also recently donated $600,000 in BNB for earthquake relief in Thailand and Myanmar. Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s platform X faces a potential $1 billion fine from the EU for alleged violations of the Digital Services Act, along with ongoing investigations into its content moderation and transparency practices. CZ Joins Forces with Kyrgyzstan Former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao took on a new advisory role with the Kyrgyzstan Republic. He will be providing guidance on blockchain regulation and technological implementation after the signing of a memorandum of understanding with the country’s National Investment Agency. This agency focuses on attracting foreign investments and facilitating international business engagement, and it plans to take advantage of CZ’s expertise to enhance Kyrgyzstan’s technological infrastructure and boost innovation in blockchain, digital assets, and cybersecurity. Kyrgyzstan President Sadyr Zhaparov stated that initiatives like these are key to driving sustainable economic growth and improving virtual asset security. He believes that this collaboration could unlock new business opportunities and societal benefits. CZ agreed with this sentiment in a post on X, and also revealed that he advises several governments , both officially and unofficially, on regulatory frameworks and blockchain applications beyond trading, and finds this work deeply meaningful. Kyrgyzstan is known for its mountainous terrain and status as a landlocked country, and holds huge potential for crypto mining due to its underused renewable energy resources. More than 30% of its energy supply comes from hydroelectric power, yet only a fraction of this potential has been developed. This makes it a very attractive destination for blockchain infrastructure projects. This isn’t the first time CZ engaged with governments across Asia. In January, he met with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to discuss crypto policy, and he also held undisclosed meetings with officials in the UAE and Bhutan. These advisory roles were offered just months after CZ completed a four-month US prison sentence for violating anti-money laundering regulations. CZ (Source: Fortune India ) Since his release, CZ returned to the blockchain space with a focus on investment and philanthropy, supporting emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and biotech. CZ Sends 1,000 BNB for Disaster Relief CZ also recently donated more than half a million dollars in cryptocurrency to support earthquake disaster relief in Thailand and Myanmar. On April 3, Zhao confirmed through a post on X that he sent 1,000 BNB , which was worth close to $600,000 at the time, to help communities that were affected by the devastating 7.7 magnitude earthquake that struck the region on March 28. The quake caused extensive damage and flooding, with at least 2,719 people confirmed dead in Myanmar and 18 in Thailand. Seventy-six people remain unaccounted for. The donation was recorded on blockchain data, and was made just days after Zhao initially pledged 500 BNB, which he later doubled. As traditional banking infrastructure was heavily impacted by the disaster, blockchain stepped up as a powerful tool to facilitate fast and direct aid distribution. Crypto contributions can bypass damaged financial networks and deliver funds straight to recipients through digital wallets without the need for intermediaries. Zhao’s charitable act came as crypto donations reached new heights globally, with over $1 billion donated in 2024 alone. Of this total, 16% went to educational causes, while 14% was allocated to medicine and health initiatives. Organizations like The Giving Block are actively harnessing crypto’s potential, and even recently launched a dedicated campaign to raise $500,000 for earthquake relief in Myanmar and Thailand. The group predicts that crypto donations could grow to $2.5 billion in 2025, due to rising digital asset values and improved regulatory clarity. Anndy Lian, a well-known blockchain advisor and author, believes that crypto’s speed and accessibility make it uniquely valuable in disaster response scenarios. Unlike traditional fiat transactions that may be delayed by banking processes, blockchain transfers settle in minutes. Lian also donated 44 BNB to the relief efforts, and noticed that in places with compromised infrastructure, crypto can be a lifeline by providing aid without the need for SWIFT codes or bank accounts. Zhao also publicly praised Lian for his contribution. This recent wave of generosity happened after similar efforts by other crypto pioneers, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who donated more than $180,000 in ETH to a biotech-focused charity in October. Blockchain’s use in charitable giving is becoming not just more common but increasingly impactful in times of crisis. EU Mulls $1B Fine Against Elon Musk’s X While CZ’s legal troubles are mostly over, the same can certainly not be said for Elon Musk. European Union regulators are reportedly considering a $1 billion fine against Elon Musk’s social media platform X for alleged violations of the Digital Services Act, with the penalty potentially factoring in revenue from Musk’s other companies, including Tesla and SpaceX. According to a report by The New York Times citing four sources familiar with the matter, the EU may invoke a section of the act that allows fines of up to 6% of global revenue, which could significantly amplify the financial impact on Musk’s ventures. The Digital Services Act was implemented in October of 2022, and it is aimed at curbing illegal and harmful online activities and increasing transparency and accountability for major tech platforms operating within the EU. The European Commission, while not commenting directly on the case, held firm that it is still very committed to applying the law impartially to all companies. In response, X’s Global Government Affairs team called the reported fine an “unprecedented act of political censorship and an attack on free speech,” and pointed out that the platform has gone “above and beyond” in its compliance efforts. It also pledged to defend its operations and principles in Europe. The company signaled its intent to use all available legal options to challenge the proceedings. Beyond the monetary fine, EU regulators could also mandate product changes at X, although the scope of these potential alterations remains unclear. However, a settlement may still be possible if X agrees to specific reforms that meet EU standards. X is also reportedly the subject of a second EU investigation that is centered on its content moderation practices. Officials allege the platform has become a conduit for illegal hate speech and disinformation. These charges could bring additional penalties depending on the outcome of the ongoing inquiry. The EU’s scrutiny of X dates back to 2023 . A preliminary ruling issued in July of 2024 concluded that X breached the Digital Services Act by failing to supply researchers with necessary data, offering limited transparency about its advertisers, and not properly verifying users with verified status. In response, X challenged the ruling with hundreds of counterpoints. At the time, Musk claimed that regulators proposed an informal deal to avoid penalties if the platform quietly suppressed certain content—an allegation EU officials have firmly denied. Thierry Breton , then the EU commissioner for internal market, publicly stated that there was no backroom agreement, and clarified that X had asked the Commission to explain the settlement process and regulatory concerns, to which the Commission responded according to standard procedures. Musk said he welcomed a “very public battle in court” to ensure that the people of Europe learn the truth.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-04 13:48:57

On April 4, funding rates across leading exchanges dropped below 0.005%, reflecting high risk aversion. This comes as the world’s highest trade tensions ratcheted up after the declaration by former U.S. President Donald Trump of drastic new tariffs. Lower funding levels confirm that investors are not willing to hold leveraged positions, typically due to bearish sentiment . A 42% drop in liquidation levels also reflects weaker market activity in comparison to the strength. Trading Volumes Plummet as Investors Pull Back In the past 24 hours, crypto trading volumes have reduced by 22.71%, falling to $247.6 billion. The sharp decline confirms that traders are hedging or exiting the market in general to prepare for volatility. The decline follows Trump’s April 2 tariff threat, which involves a blanket tariff of 10% on all foreign imports and up to 34% for some countries like China. Bitcoin Nears a Death Cross Bitcoin dropped to $81,000 after the announcement and is showing additional weakness. Technical analysts are keeping a close eye on BTC’s 50-day moving average, which is moving toward a crossover below its 200-day average—a classic “death cross” indicator. This type of formation tends to produce sharp price declines and is considered a bearish market indicator. Fear Index Confirms Pessimism The crypto fear and greed index is at 25, in the “extreme fear” range. This reflects investors becoming more risk-averse and uncertain about near-term outlooks. Trade War Fallout Spills Over Into Crypto The repercussions of Trump’s tariffs are not limited to crypto.

In the evolving world of crypto today, traditional and digital finance are on a trajectory of convergence, with crypto high risk high reward dynamics playing a significant role. Recent initiatives like President Donald Trump's proposal to establish a U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve underscore the growing importance of cryptocurrencies in national economies. The initiative, including prominent assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano, aims to fortify the nation’s economic infrastructure, leveraging digital assets for stability and growth. Political endorsements like these have historically triggered bullish market movements, fostering optimism about digital currencies' role in future economies. Enhanced by the presence of crypto custody services offered by major banks, such integration into conventional financial systems spells a transformative era for digital assets. Market reactions and regulatory trends influencing crypto today The cryptocurrency markets have been inherently volatile, often swayed by global announcements and regulatory changes. Crypto today reflects this flux as political events and investor sentiment play pivotal roles in driving value fluctuations. Recent pledges to host major crypto summits have further amplified enthusiasm, boosting asset prices. Additionally, increasing calls for regulatory clarity have prompted discussions around self-regulatory organizations (SROs) to safeguard investors while fostering innovation. By employing SROs, the market hopes to avoid cumbersome reclassification and instead streamline compliance within existing financial guidelines. This form of regulation is poised to create a more navigable landscape for burgeoning digital assets while ensuring protection and adherence to robust financial standards. Innovative infrastructure and crypto custody services elevate market trust The development of infrastructure and technology has been central to the evolution of crypto today. The authorization for banks to provide crypto custody services marks a significant endorsement of digital assets, enhancing their legitimacy and investor confidence. With traditional security measures adapting to integrate cryptocurrencies, institutions like national banks are redefining trust in the crypto landscape. This shift not only mirrors the merging of traditional and digital finance but also exemplifies how technology-backed platforms can ensure enhanced reliability and security. As these infrastructure initiatives evolve, the seamless integration of cryptocurrency into conventional financial systems becomes increasingly attainable. Exploring the high- Risk, high- Reward nature of cryptocurrency investment Investors acquainting themselves with crypto high risk high reward narratives must navigate the volatile ebbs and flows intrinsic to the market. The allure of substantial gains is often tempered by the inherent risks associated with such investment vehicles. Understanding market behaviors, strategic initiatives like strategic reserves, and regulatory adaptations can appeal to seasoned investors looking for viable entry points in a tumultuous market. As crypto today continues to test new grounds, the delicate balance between risk and reward remains a constant consideration for those engaging with the digital asset ecosystem.

This move would further escalate the ongoing global trade war and could significantly impact the crypto market. China Announces 34% Tariffs On US Imports In a press release , China’s Finance Ministry announced it would impose a 34% tariff on all US imports, starting on April 10. This move follows US President Donald Trump’s announcement of reciprocal tariffs on almost all countries on April 2. Specifically, Trump announced a 34% tariff on Chinese goods, which has led to this retaliatory 34% tariff. The Chinese Ministry urged the US to cancel its unilateral tariffs and resolve trade differences through consultation in an “equal, respectful, and mutually beneficial manner.” The Bitcoin price , which had rebounded to as high as $84,000 today, sharply dropped below $82,000 following China’s announcement. This move has further fueled the bearish sentiment in the crypto market following Trump’s announcement on Wednesday. It will also inflame the global trade war, which already exists between the US and other countries. It is worth mentioning that European Commission President von der Leyen revealed that the European Union is prepared to respond with countermeasures if it is unable to reach an agreement with the US. As such, the crypto market could still witness more decline as the global trade war heightens. Crypto Market Unlikely To Witness As Much Decline As Other Markets Amid China’s latest move, crypto analyst Kevin Capital suggested that the crypto market is unlikely to witness as much decline as other markets. He noted that while crypto is only indirectly affected by tariffs unlike companies that make up the S&P 500 and other indices. The analyst explained that crypto is still holding up well right now because Fed funds futures are now pricing in five rate cuts as monetary policy expectations drive the market. He added that crypto traders believe the Fed could rescue them. However, Kevin Capital warned that things could take a drastic turn if Fed Chair Jerome Powell comes and banishes the idea of all these rate cuts. If that happens, he predicts the crypto market will likely catch up to the stock market in this ongoing decline. On the other hand, if Powell entertains the idea of significant easing of monetary policy, then the analyst believes all eyes will be on the next CPI report next week, and the crypto market could continue to hold up against the stock market. Indeed, the stock market has suffered a worse downtrend than the crypto market. The S&P 500 further declined after China announced 34% tariffs on US imports, wiping out over $1.5 trillion as soon as the market opened today. Meanwhile, Bitcoin rebounded following a strong US job data , proving Kevin’s theory that the crypto market may be concerned about the Fed’s policies rather than the ongoing global trade war.

A lawsuit, filed Thursday in federal court in Pensacola, Florida, targets Trump’s recent executive actions that introduced a steep 54% combined tariff on goods from China. According to Reuters, the suit was forwarded by the New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA), a conservative legal organization, on behalf of Simplified, a Florida-based small business that sells organizational planners and sources its products from China. The group argues that Trump unlawfully invoked emergency powers to levy tariffs that have already disrupted markets and raised costs for importers. According to data from the US Census Bureau, China and the European Union (EU) together made up roughly a quarter of all American imports in 2024, ranking among the top three sources of foreign goods, alongside Mexico. Trump used executive orders unlawfully, NCLA argues In the court filing , NCLA mentioned the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA), which the Trump administration cited as justification for the tariff orders. The IEEPA is designed to give the president authority to impose economic sanctions during international emergencies. The plaintiffs claim that using the statute to impose tariffs oversteps legal boundaries. “ Congress passed the IEEPA to counter external emergencies, not to grant presidents a blank check to write domestic economic policy, ” the lawsuit states. According to the complaint, the law allows asset freezes and financial sanctions but contains no explicit language authorizing “ultra vires and unconstitutional” tariffs. The NCLA also claimed that no president in the nearly 50-year history of the IEEPA has interpreted it as a license to impose taxes on Americans through tariffs. “ President Trump’s own statements reveal the real reason for the China tariff, which is to reduce American trade deficits while raising federal revenue. While the ’emergency’ is not challenged here, the ‘fit’ of the tariffs to the declared emergency does not meet the requirements of the IEEPA .” The complaint traced the origin of Trump’s tariff actions to two executive orders issued prior to the April 2 trade policy announcement . On February 1, the POTUS signed an order placing a 10% tariff on Chinese imports. Trump then doubled to 20% in a second order on March 3, and on Wednesday, the president applied a general 10% tariff on all imports into America, with a substantially higher 34% tariff directed specifically at Chinese goods. The plaintiffs have asked the court to issue an injunction blocking the implementation of the China tariffs and to rule the executive orders unlawful. They contend that companies, including Florida-based Simplified, which depend on Chinese manufacturers, will face immediate and irreparable harm due to the steep import duties. China fights back with reciprocal trade levies Within 24 hours of “Liberation Day,” China’s State Council Tariff Commission declared it would impose its own 34% tariff on all US imports starting April 10. Coining the US move a “typical unilateral bullying practice,” Beijing said the action violates international trade norms and disregards China’s economic rights. Today, a public holiday in China, the government announced it had added 11 American firms to its “unreliable entity list,” effectively blacklisting them. Among the affected companies are several US drone manufacturers. China also imposed new export controls on 16 American firms, barring them from purchasing Chinese goods classified as dual-use technologies. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce further announced the launch of anti-dumping investigations into American and Indian-made medical CT X-ray tubes. These probes could lead to additional duties and restrictions on much-needed medical equipment exports. Beijing also imposed export controls on seven rare earth minerals critical to electronics and military hardware. These include samarium, gadolinium, and terbium, materials that the United States relies on for manufacturing. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

As a result, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) experienced considerable declines. BTC had rallied to $87,892 on Thursday but lost momentum and plunged to a low of $81,525 before recovering to its current level. The flagship cryptocurrency has been up marginally over the past 24 hours, although market sentiment remains bearish. Meanwhile, ETH reclaimed $1,800 after falling to a low of $1,757 but has struggled to push towards $1,900 and $2,000 as price action remains muted. Price action for altcoins remained mixed, with Ripple (XRP) registering an increase of 1.50%, while Dogecoin (DOGE) registered a marginal increase and moved to $0.165. However, Solana (SOL) failed to reclaim $120, dropping over 1% and settling at $117. Cardano (ADA) , Stellar (XLM)) , Chainlink (LINK) , Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered substantial increases. However, Toncoin (TON) registered a significant decline, dropping almost 7% to $6.67. Crypto Markets Reeling After Tariff Announcement The crypto market remained bearish after Trump’s tariff announcement, as markets faced considerable volatility. Analysts have suggested short-term uncertainty but stated that BTC could become a hedge against inflation if the Dollar weakens in the face of continuous economic strain. Tariffs increase the cost of imported goods, leading to higher inflation, shifts in supply chains, and dramatic fluctuations in currency valuations. A stronger Dollar, driven by tariff-induced trade imbalances, could pressure crypto prices as investors flock to safer assets. Rick Maeda, Research Analyst at Presto Research, stated, “Trump’s tariffs, jumping to 34% on China and 25% on cars from the 10% baseline levy, unnerved the global markets, and crypto was no exception. As a result, BTC sold off into the $82,000 zone while ETH dropped to $1,800.” US crypto stocks also declined significantly on Thursday as fears of global trade tensions sparked a selloff of risk assets. Coinbase (COIN) plunged over 7%, while Strategy (MSTR) dropped 5.6%. MARA Holdings (MARA) registered a decline of 8.3%, while Riot Platforms (RIOT) fell almost 9%. The losses underscore the widespread fallout of Trump’s tariffs on multiple asset classes. The Trump administration has embraced crypto and adopted a lighter approach to regulation. However, broader economic stability could still impact crypto companies. Marcin Kazmierczak, Chief Operating Officer at blockchain firm RedStone, believes the decline in crypto indicates a growing correlation between digital assets and macroeconomic policy shifts. “But protectionist policies that potentially weaken dollar hegemony could accelerate interest in decentralized alternatives over the medium-to-long term.” However, other analysts stated the moves were less severe than in other industries. David Hernandez, Crypto investment specialist at 21Shares, stated, “The price action highlights crypto's hyper-democratic and borderless nature, allowing investors worldwide to hedge against the potential impact of macroeconomic uncertainties.” World Looking For Crypto Regulation: Circle President Former CFTC Chair and Circle President Heath Tarbert believes the world is looking to the US for crypto and stablecoin regulation before following suit. While several countries have created their regulatory frameworks, the US has lost ground thanks to the previous administration’s anti-crypto stance. However, Circle believes the US can still be a leader in crypto and stablecoin regulation. According to Heath, there was still time to achieve a regulatory framework and lead other countries. “The rest of the world is yearning for US regulation. In discussions with European policymakers and others around the world, they’re saying, ‘When are you guys going to get your regulation done? Because we’re eager to see it, and we want to be able to grant reciprocity.” Heath believes regulating stablecoins was pretty straightforward compared to regulating other, more complex digital assets. He also highlighted three key elements a stablecoin must have: a reputable issuer, safe, high-quality, liquid reserves backing everything, and transparency in the reserves. The statements come as the Senate and the House seek to tackle stablecoin regulation. North Korea Emerges As The Biggest Crypto Thief North Korea has emerged as the most prolific crypto thief, having stolen over $6 billion to fund its regime through several complex cyberattacks, including the $200 million WazirX hack and the over $1 billion Bybit hack. North Korea’s hacking exploits stretch back a decade, making it the most successful and dangerous crypto thief. The attacks are generally orchestrated through the dreaded Lazarus Group. The hermit nation was responsible for over 60% of all crypto thefts in 2024, helping the country fund its nuclear ambitions and drive its heavily sanctioned economy. North Korean hackers employ sophisticated social engineering strategies to access sensitive systems. They often pretend to be staff or IT personnel and take advantage of employee social media profiles. Some hackers have also assumed fake identities and gained employment with targeted organizations. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has steadied itself around the $83,000-$84,000 despite President Trump’s tariff onslaught, which has broken the back of the stock market. However, the selloff in the equities market did not spill over into the crypto market, as demonstrated by BTC’s price action. However, while BTC has stabilized, it has done so only after a drop to an intraday low of $81,224 on Thursday. The flagship cryptocurrency is marginally up during the ongoing session as buyers look to prevent a decline below $80,000. Markets have been rattled after Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs with a baseline of 10%. However, some countries like China face higher tariffs, leading to growing fears of a trade war. Ben Kurland, CEO of crypto research platform DYOR, stated, “Bitcoin moves at the intersection of narrative, liquidity, and leverage. Right now it’s mostly trading like a high-beta macro asset, tracking real yields, rate expectations, and Dollar strength. Yields pulled back, risk assets caught a bid, and Bitcoin responded instantly. It’s not about crypto fundamentals today, it’s about global liquidity signals and positioning. When real rates dip and the Dollar softens, bitcoin breathes.” Analysts believe that despite the market downturn, analysts have shown considerable resilience relative to equities. David Hernandez, crypto investment specialist at 21Shares, stated, “Although the tariff rates were slightly higher than expectations, the announcement provided much-needed clarity on the scope and scale of the policy. Markets thrive on certainty, and with speculation now largely removed, institutional investors may see an opportunity over the coming days to take advantage of compressed valuations.” BTC started the previous week on a bullish note, registering a substantial increase on Monday. However, it lost momentum on Tuesday after running into selling pressure and volatility. As a result, it registered a marginal decline and settled at $87,417. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price registered a marginal decline, slipping below $87,000 and settling at $86,942. BTC registered a marginal increase Thursday to reclaim $87,000 and settle at $87,236. Bearish sentiment returned on Friday as BTC plunged over 3%, slipping below the 200-day SMA and $85,000 to settle at $84,422. The price declined on Saturday, falling below the 20-day SMA and settling at $82,704. Source: TradingView Price action remained bearish on Sunday as BTC registered a marginal decline and settled at $82,404. BTC faced volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC registered a marginal increase and settled at $82,511. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as the price rose over 3% to move past the 20-day SMA and settle at $85,150. BTC surged to an intraday high of $88,624 on Wednesday in the runup to President Trump’s Liberation Day speech. However, it lost momentum and plunged over 3%, slipping below $85,000 and the 20-day SMA and settling at $82,535. BTC registered a marginal recovery on Thursday despite an overwhelming bearish settlement, registering an increase of 0.80% and settling at $83,199. The current session sees BTC up over 1% as it looks to move past the 20-day SMA and reclaim $85,000. The RSI is just under the neutral zone, while the MACD has a slight bullish bias, indicating buyers have the upper hand. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) had some good news after developers agreed to ship Pectra to the Ethereum mainnet on May 7. ETH registered a sharp decline following President Trump’s announcement on reciprocal tariffs on trading partners. However, analysts believe the selling pressure may not persist since most ETH short-term holders already sold their assets in March. Ethereum whales sold 380,000 ETH following Trump’s announcement, further stressing ETH. However, despite the decline, the Dormant Circulation Metric, which measures the total number of coins distributed daily based on the last time they changed addresses, revealed that most investors remained on the sidelines. ETH’s drop triggered over $47 million in futures liquidations over the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGlass. The total liquidated long and short positions accounted for $34 million and $13 million. ETH started the previous week with an increase of almost 4%, rising above the 20-day SMA and $2,000 to settle at $2,082. However, it lost momentum on Tuesday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $2,068. Bearish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as ETH dropped almost 3% and settled at $2,010. Price action remained bearish as ETH registered a marginal drop on Thursday but remained above $2,000, settling at $2,003. Selling pressure intensified on Friday as ETH plunged below $2,000 and the 20-day SMA and settled at $1,897. Price action remained bearish over the weekend as ETH dropped almost 4% on Saturday and 1.14% on Sunday to settle at $1,807. Source: TradingView ETH started the current week on a bullish note, registering an increase of almost 1% on Monday and settling at $1,822. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as ETH rose nearly 5% to reclaim $1,900 and settle at $1,905. However, the price fell back in the red on Wednesday, dropping almost 6%, slipping below $1,800 and settling at $1,794. ETH recovered on Thursday despite overwhelming bearish sentiment, rising 1.23% and settling at $1,816. The current session sees ETH up almost 1% and trading at $1,831. Buyers will look to retain control and push ETH towards $2,000. However, if ETH turns bearish and slips below $1,800, it could drop to $1,500 before rebounding. A break below this level could see a drop to $1,000, a level last seen during the UST crash in 2022. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) is struggling to build momentum and reclaim $120 after seeing a substantial decline over the past few sessions. SOL started the previous week on a bullish note, rising over 6% on Monday and almost 2% on Tuesday to settle at $143. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level, dropping over 4% on Wednesday and settling at $137. The price registered a marginal increase on Thursday, rising 0.73% and settling at $138. Bearish sentiment returned on Friday as SOL dropped over 6%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $130 and settling at $129. Price action remained bearish on Saturday as SOL dropped almost 4% and settled at $124. Despite the overwhelming bearish sentiment, SOL registered a marginal increase on Sunday to end the weekend positively. Source: TradingView SOL started the current week on a bearish note, registering a marginal drop on Monday. However, it recovered on Tuesday, registering an increase of 1.72% and settling at $124. SOL surged to an intraday high of $135 on Wednesday as markets rallied. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped over 7%, slipping below $120 and settling at $117. SOL remained in the red on Thursday, registering a marginal decline before recovering during the ongoing session. SOL is currently up 1.50% and trading at $118 as it looks to reclaim $120. However, a bearish MACD suggests sellers have the upper hand. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis Ripple (XRP) moved past the 50-day at the beginning of last week, settling at $2.45 on Tuesday. However, price action turned bearish after it reached this level as buyers failed to move past $2.50. As a result, XRP registered a drop of over 4% on Wednesday, falling below the 50-day SMA and settling at $2.35. Price action remained bearish on Thursday as the price declined marginally to $2.34. Bearish sentiment intensified on Friday as XRP plunged almost 6%, falling below the 20-day SMA and settling at $2.20. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price dropped over 3%, falling to a low of $2.06 before settling at $2.13. Source: TradingView XRP registered a marginal increase on Sunday despite overwhelming bearish sentiment to end the weekend positively. However, the price was back in the red on Monday, dropping over 2%, falling to a low of $2.02 before settling at $2.08. XRP recovered on Tuesday, registering an increase of 2.35%, and raced to an intraday high of $2.23 on Wednesday as bullish sentiment intensified. However, it lost momentum, dropped over 5%, and settled at $2.02. XRP plunged to an intraday low of $1.96 as sellers attempted to overwhelm a key support level. However, it rebounded from this level to register an increase of almost 2% to reclaim $2 and settle at $2.06. The current session sees XRP marginally up as buyers and sellers look to establish control. With bears having the upper hand, sellers will look to regain control and drive the price below $2.

Their view: don’t fight the market tape. Instead, investors should wait for clarity on trade negotiations , labor market data, and the Federal Reserve’s next moves before repositioning. The note, shared with crypto.news, comes after President Trump introduced aggressive new tariff rates — starting at a baseline of 10% and rising sharply for countries like China, Japan, and Vietnam. Some effective rates may approach 50% once exemptions are factored in. Implementation begins as early as April 5.

U.S. small caps led a broad equity sell-off , crypto weakened, and the U.S. dollar declined against major currencies. The yield curve bull-flattened, signaling growing recession fears. Nansen believes markets are now pricing in a stagflationary scenario — stagnant growth combined with inflationary pressures. “Now is probably the worst of the tariff uncertainty, at the same time,the negotiation is likely to linger: these are a lot of countries with often complex economic topics at stake,” Nansen Principal Research Analyst Aurelie Barthere wrote in the note. While countries like Canada and Mexico appear to be spared from new tariffs — thanks to USMCA protections — major Asian exporters and parts of the Eurozone face steep trade barriers . Yet, few governments are signaling retaliation. Japan has opted for negotiations and fiscal support for exporters, while the Eurozone has opened dialogue on topics ranging from digital taxes to LNG imports.

ISM manufacturing and services data point to a borderline expansion, while a spike in the manufacturing price index raises inflation concerns . ADP employment data showed modest strength, but layoffs in auto, retail, and tech sectors remain a red flag. Markets are currently pricing in 3–4 rate cuts by the end of 2025, but any deviation from that outlook could trigger further volatility. Crypto’s impact Crypto is not immune. Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) charts show weakening momentum, with potential “death crosses” ahead. Solana ( SOL ) has already breached key weekly support levels. “This isn’t the moment to catch falling knives,” the report cautions. In Nansen’s view, it’s time to stay on the sidelines until a more favorable macro and policy environment emerges. “Don’t fight the tape,” the note emphasizes. “Patience is a virtue.” You might also like: Nasdaq Composite on track for biggest one-day percentage drop since 2020, will Bitcoin survive the crash?",News|Crypto traders|Market Sentiment,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-04-04 13:57:05

ADA advanced by over 79.5% on the Line Break chart (TradingView) on April 2, a strong signal that a breakout pattern is forming after months of price consolidation. But a new altcoin is making some waves in the crypto industry, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) . Currently priced at $0.6424 , Cardano price has recently progressed above several key psychological and technical levels. With an overall market cap of $24 billion and positive volume flow, the setup indicates a possible attitude of bullish continuation, all contingent upon macro conditions holding in favor. At its core, Cardano’s recent developments are developing into the catalyst that can mark the next breakout. The integration of Cardano into Hydra with Bitcoin’s Lightning Network represents a significant advancement in cross-chain interoperability. Further, within the DeFi space, the announcement about Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin potentially integrating with Cardano could further spur ADA adoption. Stablecoin liquidity, being a foundation of decentralized finance, will only strengthen Cardano’s positioning as a stronger competitor to Ethereum in environments where stablecoins are utilized for DeFi activity. In addition, Coinbase Derivatives has launched ADA futures regulated by the CFTC, acting as a catalyst for institutional investors and regulated hedging strategies. This should drive Cardano’s on-chain activity, deepen liquidity, and improve overall network reliability. At the same time, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has shared a perspective on the memecoin wave, indicating that nearly every project is going to die — unless it rapidly evolves. On the Wolf of All Streets podcast , he expressed how meme-coins typically go through “the dumpening” — an emotional collapse shortly after the scam pump from the insiders. For a meme-based token to survive, he emphasized, it has to turn into utility, build a community, and start building a purpose-led ecosystem. But, this creates the ideal backdrop for a new project that is literally changing not just the meme-coin but the entire altcoin industry— Yeti Ouro (YETIO). Yeti Ouro: The Meme Coin That’s Redefining Utility and Gaming As the crypto landscape looks toward a possible bull run, Yeti Ouro is gaining traction quickly – not just as a passing meme but as a utility-first project built upon real-world application. Wrapped natively on the Ethereum blockchain, Yeti Ouro has been built with the intention of rewarding community involvement, encouraging long-term development, and providing an exciting new level of engagement on top of its imminent Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game, Yeti Go. YETIO has a capped supply of 1 billion tokens with a deflationary model, including scheduled burns (5% of total allocation). This mechanism could serve to gradually decrease sell pressure, something that has allowed other deflationary tokens to appreciate in value long-term through bullish cycles. Coupled with smart contract auditing carried out by SOLIDProof , it is evident that Yeti Ouro is taking investor security and transparency seriously. As far as growth goes, the numbers speak for themselves . Investors are confident as the token’s presale has already surpassed 211 million tokens sold, raising over $3.19 million in Stage 3. In addition, early supporters receive a 20% bonus on all purchases, while substantial contributors (above $500) are rewarded with an extra 5%, reinforcing the project’s longevity and community empowerment. Investors that purchased tokens in Stage 1 at a price of $0.012 have seen a 100% ROI with the Stage 3 token price of $0.024. With steeper price increases confirmed for the remaining two stages of the presale investors are sensing the urgency to get in sooner rather than later to secure higher returns. To invest in YETIO is easy. Investors need a good DeFi wallet on any network of their choice, including Meta mask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase, etc. Place an order on the official Yeti Ouro website for the preferred amount of YETIO tokens and complete it with a one-click transaction. What distinguishes Yeti Ouro in earnest is its flagship Unreal Engine –powered P2E racing game known as Yeti Go. The most recent updates show great strides: simple-to-learn controls, silly yet equally balanced gameplay, and immersively wild-level design. The gameplay — from dynamic object interactions to map size — has been catered to make it fast-paced, fun, and exceptionally replayable. Born from a collaboration with one of the industry’s most respected game asset studios—known for blockbusters like Call of Duty, Spider-Man, The Witcher, and Dead Space—this game is built on a foundation of top-tier talent. The visuals are striking, but it’s the immersive soundscape, developed by audio pros who’ve worked with Grammy-nominated artists like Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid, that truly brings it to life. Keep scrolling for an exclusive reveal of the game’s main character and a first look at the vivid world it’s about to take on. The core utility of YETIO is that the tokens can be used for in-game purchases, race entry fees, marketplace trading, and staking – ensuring that there is always a purpose and activity surrounding circulation (and no inflation).

33767162,[object Object],1743775204,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Bitcoin Nears 50% Breakout, But ‘Ichimoku Cloud’ Presents Key Resistance – Details",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-nears-50-breakout-but-ichimoku-cloud-presents-key-resistance-details/,"Bitcoin (BTC) could be mirroring a bullish setup from 2023, when it surged by more than 50% within weeks after an extended period of consolidation. However, the flagship cryptocurrency now faces strong resistance from the Ichimoku Cloud, which could derail its upward trajectory. Bitcoin Plunges Following US Trade Tariffs Earlier today, US President Donald Trump announced reciprocal trade tariffs targeting countries worldwide, triggering a sharp downturn in both global stock and crypto markets. Notably, the US stock market shed over $2 trillion – more than BTC’s entire market capitalization. Despite the sell-off, all may not be lost for BTC. Crypto trader Merlijn The Trader shared the following chart, suggesting that Bitcoin could be repeating a bullish setup from 2023, when it recorded a 50% surge in just a few weeks. The trader commented: Bitcoin 2023 vs 2025 — the setup is IDENTICAL. Same structure. Same breakout zone. Last time? $BTC exploded +50% in weeks. This time might be bigger. Buckle up. However, BTC faces strong resistance around the $88,000 level due to the Ichimoku Cloud. According to an analysis by Titan of Crypto, Bitcoin’s attempt to reverse its downtrend was rejected within this resistance range. For the uninitiated, the Ichimoku Cloud is a technical indicator that identifies support, resistance, trend direction, and momentum, with the “cloud” acting as a key dynamic barrier – above it signals bullish trends, while below suggests bearish momentum. Commenting on Bitcoin’s recent price action, crypto analyst The Crypto Express noted that BTC is currently consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern. The analyst added: However, the Ichimoku Cloud remains a key resistance barrier above the current price action. A decisive breakout or breakdown of the pattern is needed to confirm the next directional move. Stay alert for further developments. Short-Term Holders Sell BTC In a separate X post , well-known crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that short-term holders offloaded 18,930 BTC following Trump’s bearish tariff announcement. In contrast, recent reports indicate that long-term investors are accumulating BTC at current price levels. Further, BTC’s March monthly close suggests that its bullish momentum may still be intact. However, it must resist falling below $80,000 to avoid breaking down below the current price range. Meanwhile, on-chain indicators like Network Value to Transactions suggest that the leading digital asset’s price pullback is likely to continue. At press time, BTC trades at $82,356 on the daily chart, down 5.2% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|Cryptocurrency|Donald Trump|Ichimoku Cloud|Technical Analysis|trade tariffs,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ZK|WLD|CAKE|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-04-04 14:00:04

Both the daily and weekly charts underscore the significance of this zone, with the market hovering dangerously near a juncture that could determine whether the current price collapses by another quarter or stages a dramatic rebound. Dogecoin Could Plunge Further On the weekly chart, the trend line slants downward from the historically elevated levels near last cycle’s top and converges with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement at around $0.167. Thus, Dogecoin finds itself on shaky ground as it slipped below the 0.786 Fibonacci level at $0.167 yet still clings to the multi-year trend line, which currently hovers around $0.157. DOGE’s ability to stay above the line may decide whether the market can avoid a renewed sell-off that could erase a quarter of its current value. Notably, DOGE is already down about 66% from its December peak above $0.48 last year, revealing just how tightly the bulls need to hold the line to avoid another wave of selling pressure. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Calls Dogecoin Chart A ‘Beauty’ As Key Indicators Align Zooming in on the daily time frame, the story becomes clearer. After Dogecoin dropped out of a downtrend channel on February 24, it made an attempt to fight its way back inside on March 2 and 3, only to be swiftly pushed below the channel floor again. Subsequent rejections on March 6 and March 26 along the lower boundary confirm that the bears have little intention of giving DOGE an easy path back above. This persistent refusal is accompanied by waning volume, indicating that buyers have had difficulty mustering the momentum required to reclaim a foothold inside the channel. The weekly EMAs are spread above the price, notably with key lines sitting well above $0.16, while the daily EMAs have turned into near-term ceilings that Dogecoin has repeatedly failed to surmount in recent sessions. Related Reading: Dogecoin, XRP Among Coins Seeing The Largest Decline In Profit Supply: Data Should DOGE fall below the multi-year trend line, it could test again the support zone just around $0.14 like on March 10 and 11—delineated in red on the chart. If DOGE fails to defend the trend line and slides below the $0.14 mark, the next major pivot comes at $0.12, symbolized by the prominent blue line. A retreat that far would amount to a further 25% drop from current price levels, potentially deepening bearish sentiment well into the second quarter. All eyes are now locked on the interplay between price and the decades-long slope that has served as both a magnet and buffer across multiple market cycles. Should buyers step in firmly at the intersection of the multi-year line and the 0.786 Fibonacci level, the next challenge would be to recapture the lower boundary of the descending channel—something Dogecoin has failed to do despite repeated tests. On the other hand, a decisive break below $0.14 would raise the odds of a capitulation down to $0.12 or potentially lower. For now, it appears Dogecoin’s fate hinges on whether this long standing structural support can weather the storm. If it does, the battered meme coin may yet script a comeback. If not, the market may face a freefall that rekindles memories of the most volatile chapters in its history.

Price Crashes to New Low Below $0.60,https://cryptonews.com/news/is-pi-network-headed-to-zero-price-crashes-to-new-low-below-0-60/,"Pi Network has dived by 16% in the past 24 hours, with its fall to $0.5128 coming as the crypto market drops by 1% in the wake of ongoing tariff and recession concerns . PI has now declined by a whopping 38% in a week and by 74% in a month, raising concerns that it has entered a death spiral. The token is also down by 82% since reaching an all-time high of $2.99 on February 26, another indicator of a serious decline in interest and confidence in it. And with no new major exchanges willing to list PI (at least for now), it’s likely to continue declining for as long as the market remains spooked by the incipient trade war between the US and the rest of the world. Is Pi Network Going to Zero? Price Crashes to New Low Below $0.60 There’s no credible way of sugarcoating what PI is currently experiencing, which is a potentially terminal collapse in value. As noted above, it has lost 80% of its value since peaking in late February, and its chart reflects its all-but complete loss of momentum. Its RSI (purple) was already struggling prior to yesterday’s market-wide selloff, yet it has now plunged below 25, which is indicative of serious underselling. Source: TradingView The same goes for PI’s 30-period average (orange), which continues to sink further below the 200-period (blue). Under a normal circumstances, an asset would have rebounded after suffering such weak indicators for so long, so it’s potentially a sign of a serious problem that Pi Network hasn’t enjoyed a rebound in recent weeks. And with the global economy entering a period of uncertainty and potentially even recession , it would be foolhardy to expect a sustained recovery anytime soon. On top of this, Pi Network suffers from low confidence in the wider market, with some traders and analysts continuing to refer to it as either a data-harvesting scheme, a Ponzi, or both. I watched @SonOfATech video on Pi Network (link in second post) and I had legit never even heard of Pi Network, so I checked it out. One look at the app and it is clear this is a data aggregator app and shady af. 100% agree with him here. If you mined this coin you should get… pic.twitter.com/weMNZwfOAj — MeanHash ₿ ✪ (@MeanHash) April 3, 2025 This lack of faith may account for why the likes of Coinbase, Binance and Kraken have yet to list the token, a fact which is also conspiring to send it lower. Given these negatives, the only way for Pi Network is down, with the coin likely to sink below $0.50 in the next few weeks. It could drop as low as $0.40 by June, unless one of the above exchanges does take the step of listing it. New Altcoins with Stronger Fundamentals Because Pi Network now looks so doubtful, many traders may be much happier investigating newer tokens, with several up-and-coming coins showing the potential for gains in the near future. This is something that could be said about MIND of Pepe (MIND), an ERC-20 token that is currently holding its presale, having raised $7.8 million so far. What’s exciting about MIND of Pepe is that its platform will launch an agentic AI, one which will interact with the cryptocurrency market and social media. AI Training – 60,000 Tweets Scraped, 3,000 Hand-Picked Insights We’ve built a high-value dataset: ◉ 60,000 tweets from top AI agents scraped ◉ 3,000 high-value insights curated ◉ A fine-tuned AI model trained on actual crypto discussions Vector Database & RAG Structure… — MIND of Pepe (@MINDofPepe) March 20, 2025 In particular, it will process trading data and social media posts to provide MIND holders with market analysis, helping investors to make better decisions. It will also generate its own meme coins, using the insights it has gleaned to produce tokens with the highest potential to go viral. And what makes MIND itself bullish is that holders of the coin will gain early access to MIND of Pepe’s auto-generated tokens, something which could enable them to make big profits down the line. Investors can join its presale now by visiting the MIND of PEPE website , where MIND currently costs $0.0036671.

The tariffs began on Canada and Mexico imports, but recently, Donald Trump implemented a 10% global tax, affecting all the financial markets significantly. What are his top picks? Let’s discuss this. Jim Cramer Criticizes Trump’s Trade War Before Revealing Top Stocks to Buy Jim Cramer has been quite vocal about the Trump tariff introduction and beginning the trade war. In his recent Mad Money episode, he disclosed that he has never seen a president other than Trump crashing the entire stock market just by opening his mouth. The market was doing great — until the Trump Administration sowed a level of uncertainty I haven’t seen since Jimmy Carter…I cannot think of another president in my lifetime who could knock down the stock market simply by opening his mouth. The statement correlated with the recent tariff implementation, which he claims is mathematically wrong in a CNN interview . As the Trump trade war escalates, with China implementing a reverse 34% tariff on the US, the stock market might feel additional turmoil, including crypto stock prices. Cramer has connected Donald Trump’s tariff to the 2000 dot-com bubble burst and has recommended the sectors that rose after the collapse. Top Crypto Stocks to Buy Amid the stumbled stock market, Jim Cramer advised investors to follow the post-dot-com bubble playbook and shift their focus to defense, domestic, and healthcare picks per CNBC post. He believes that these companies with pricing power are the only ones that can withstand the ongoing economic slowdowns. You want stocks of domestic companies with pricing power and with no slackening in demand or credit risk that do well in a slowdown. The recommended pharmaceutical stocks to buy include Cardinal Health (CAH), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), and UnitedHealth (UNH). Duke Energy (DUK) and Procter & Gamble (PG) are top picks from utilities & consumer staples. Utilities, lower-priced retailers, telecommunications, and consumer packaged goods will also do well in a slower economic environment. Interestingly, Jim Cramer believes that defense stocks like Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), and others could witness a boom amid other countries’ appeasing attempts. However, he claims that it is not the right time to invest in tech stocks and that investors can focus on them once the market stabilizes. Amid these stocks to buy recommendations, investors’ sentiments remain bearish due to further developments in the Trump trade war. More importantly, investors are concerned with the inverse-Cramer index, where the opposite of his prediction happens.

Why Am I Investing In To This CRYPTO PRESALE?! | Rollblock Review (It's HUGE!) Shiba Inu Price Prediction — Will The Support Hold? Over the past week Shiba Inu (SHIB) marked a new yearly low at $0.0000115. This show of weakness sparked speculations that further declines could be in store for Shiba Inu, especially as the broader crypto market is still struggling to regain its footing. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu sells for $0.0000123, posting a substantial 14% weekly decline, which brings its total yearly losses to 55%. Source: CoinMarketCap Shiba Inu’s metrics are painting a somewhat bearish picture, as market participants are taking a step back and waiting for the dust to settle. Shiba Inu’s Open Interest (OI) has been spiraling downward, and today it marked a 1.3% decline, according to Coinalyze data. Source: Coinalyze At the same time, the weekly RSI indicates that more turbulence could be in store in the short term. As certainty still holds a firm grip on the market, selling activity is impeding the Shiba Inu price from breaking out of the trading range.

How Rollblock Becomes A Passive Income Vehicle One of Rollblock’s star features is the novel revenue-sharing mechanism, which will allow the community to earn money on autopilot. To sustain this, Rollblock will spend a portion of its weekly earnings to buy back RBLK tokens from the open market. 60% of this amount will then be burned, creating deflationary pressure, which will prime the RBLK token for scarcity-driven appreciation. The remaining 40% will be redistributed to users as recurring staking rewards with up to 30% APY. For a very limited time, investors will be able to participate in Rollblock’s $100,000 giveaway. The prize pool will be split between 10 lucky winners, with each one receiving a $10,000 cut. Those who want to learn more are invited to head over to Rollblock’s official X account .

Over the last month, Pi Network (PI) saw nearly 70% of its valuation evaporate, as selling pressure intensified and the crypto market entered a bearish phase. Today, Pi Network sells for $0.56 following a 16% intraday decrease. The 106% surge in trading volume suggests that most market participants are opting to sell their Pi Network and rotate funds elsewhere. Source: CoinMarketCap However, the bottom seems to be in for Pi Network, according to some analysts, which means that at these levels, it could still be a viable investment, although caution is advised. Crypto expert Four believes that Pi Network is tapping into a critical demand zone, and from here, the price is expected to rebound, with the next big target being the reclaim of the $1 mark. Crypto King is of the same opinion, and he asserts that if a reversal is confirmed, Pi Network could shoot up above $1.5, though this is vastly dependent on broader market conditions.

The US stock market has lost more than $3.5 trillion within two days and crypto prices also continue edging lower. This article explores the top 3 altcoins to buy during the dip, with the potential to make strong billish reversals. S&P 500 Loses $3.5 Trillion Amid Macro Fears The US stock market has been one of the worst-hit sectors following President Trump’s ongoing tariff war. In the last two days, the S&P 500 has lost more than $3.5 trillion in market cap. On Thursday, the S&P 500 index closed with 5,396 points, marking its lowest level since August 2024. At the same time, the Nasdaq index lost more than 1,000 points, with the Wall Street Journal warning that it could be headed to a bear market. The crypto market has mirrored the dip in the US stock market. Bitcoin fluctuates between $81,000 and $84,000, while Ethereum price has fallen to $1,700. Nevertheless, traders should consider to buy altcoins during the dip. Altcoins to Buy the Dip Despite Macro Fears Three altcoins are standing out with some strong fundamentals, bullish news, and narratives that suggest they can show strength despite the downtrend. The top altcoins to buy the dip include Ripple (XRP), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Tron (TRX). Ripple (XRP) XRP price today trades at $2.06 with a 3.4% gain. XRP is one of the altcoins to buy after Coinbase filed for XRP futures with the CFTC. At the same time, April 16 will be a major date for the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit where a final statement on this case will be issued. The 4-hour price chart for Ripple shows that bulls are attempting to come back into the market. The ADX histogram bars, albeit being in the negative region have flipped to green. This might culminate in high buying activity. If traders accumulate during the dip and a reversal happens, the major resistance to watch is $2.34. The volume profile bars show that this level has previously attracted buying activity, which may help in dirving the upward momentum. This makes Ripple among the top altcoins to buy. XRP/USDT: 4-Hour Chart Shiba Inu (SHIB) The Shiba Inu meme coin is also one of the top altcoins to buy. This meme coin has some strong fundamentals that may drive a price rally. As a recent Coingape article reported, SHIB’s layer 2 network, Shibarium, is on the verge of major network updates. At the same time, the SHIB burn rate has been rising. At press time, this burn rate was up by more than 1,900%, with 48M SHIB tokens being removed from the circulating supply. Shiba Inu is attempting to break out from a descending triangle pattern as seen on the hourly chart. If SHIB flips resistance at the upper trendline, it may spark a strong move to $0.0000134. The RSI also stands at a neutral zone of 49, and if buyers enter the market, it could aid the uptrend. SHIB/USDT: 1-Hour Chart Tron (TRX) The four-hour price chart for TRX shows a bullish Tron price prediction . Unlike many altcoins that have been under bearish pressure recently, TRX is moving within an ascending parallel channel with a series of higher highs. This shows upward momentum. Technical indicators also support the positive outlook. The RSI stands at 60 while the MACD line has formed a buy signal after crossing above the signal line. This technical setup makes Tron one of the top altcoins to buy. TRX/USDT: 4-Hour Chart Summary of Top Altcoins to Buy The S&P 500 has shed more than $3.5 trillion from its market cap in the last two days due to macroeconomic fears. The crypto market has also mirrored this decline as Bitcoin and most altcoins struggle under bearish pressure. Despite these headwinds, the top altcoins to buy during the dip include XRP, SHIB, and TRX.

With this revolutionary concept, the idea of a “digital asset” was born. Soon after, developers and entrepreneurs expanded on this concept, developing systems where value was exchanged not just for its own sake, but for services and digital products. Over the past decade, innovators have built permissionless, decentralized networks for computing services, file storage, asset exchange, cellular coverage, Wi-Fi connectivity, mapping tools, lending services, and more. Because digital assets can be used for services that anyone can offer and anyone can access, the use-cases – both financial and non-financial – are potentially endless. Despite this promise, these networks have courted criticism. The Biden-Harris Administration attempted to block this innovative advance through a relentless campaign of lawsuits and enforcement actions without providing the regulatory clarity the digital asset ecosystem and its innovators and users so desperately needed. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) failed to clarify how existing securities laws apply and — more importantly — don’t apply to digital asset transactions. This lack of regulatory clarity stifled the digital asset ecosystem, pushing growth out of the United States to jurisdictions that have established clear rules of the road. To address these failures, Congress began exploring ways to modernize the regulatory structure to accommodate the unique characteristics of digital assets and how they could be used in our financial system. These efforts culminated in a series of bills aimed at clarifying how digital assets could be used in the financial system, ensuring investor protection and fostering innovation. In the 118th Congress, the House Committees on Financial Services and Agriculture launched a historic joint effort to address digital asset regulation. This led to the first-ever passage of bipartisan digital asset market structure legislation in a chamber of Congress. This collaboration enabled Congress to address longstanding challenges in the ecosystem and lay the foundation for a fit for purpose framework under the leadership of President Trump. This Congress, both the House and Senate are committed to creating a clear path forward for the digital asset ecosystem. As we move ahead, it is crucial that the framework is both balanced and iron-clad for the future. To accomplish this, we have set out principles for digital asset legislation. Six principles First, legislation must promote innovation. We seek to protect opportunities for innovators to create and utilize digital assets, while ensuring users can lawfully transact with one another. Second, legislation must provide clarity for the classification of assets. Users of digital assets should clearly understand the nature of their holdings, including whether they qualify as securities or non-securities. Third, legislation must codify a framework for the issuance of new digital assets. The framework should permit issuers to raise capital through the sale of new digital assets under the jurisdiction of the SEC. It should protect retail investors and require developers to disclose relevant information to help users understand the unique characteristics of digital asset networks. Fourth, the legislation must establish the regulation of spot market exchanges and intermediaries. Centralized, custodial exchanges and intermediaries facilitating transactions with non-security digital assets should adhere to similar requirements as other financial firms. Congress should provide the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with the authority to impose requirements over these entities necessary to protect customers, limit conflicts of interest, ensure appropriate execution of customer orders, and provide disclosures. Fifth, the legislation must establish best practices for the protection of customer assets. Entities registered with the SEC or CFTC should be required to segregate customer funds and hold them with qualified custodians. Customer funds should also be protected during bankruptcy. Sixth, and finally, the legislation must protect innovative decentralized projects and activities. Congress should ensure that decentralized protocols, which pose different risks and benefits, are not subject to regulations designed for centralized, custodial firms. In safeguarding decentralized activities, Congress must also protect an individual’s right to self-custody their digital assets. We look forward to both Committees continuing our legislative work together to fulfill President Trump’s request to make America the “crypto capital of the planet.” In May, our Committees will host our second joint hearing to discuss digital asset market structure legislation. Our goal is to bring much-needed regulatory clarity to this rapidly evolving industry, ensuring that America continues to lead in shaping the future of digital finance.",Opinion,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-04 14:09:44

Still, traders have not given up on Bitcoin, according to a new report from Binance. Bitcoin (BTC) reserve, monetary policy, and fears over the trade war are stirring the markets, according to Binance. On April 4, Binance published a report on the state of the crypto market last month, delineating key trends. The overall crypto market declined by 4.4% in March. The primary drivers of this volatility were tariff tensions, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening a trade war with most of the U.S.’s major trading partners. This was enough to drag down both crypto and stock prices, despite several positive developments.

This was good news for risk assets like crypto, which saw prices drop due to reduced liquidity. At the same time, the Bitcoin strategic reserve push was a major driver of positive sentiment for the biggest crypto asset.

Can it challenge Tether’s $160B dominance? Table of Contents Circle comes full circle with its IPO bid Circle’s IPO and the new era of stablecoins The battle for dominance: USDC vs USDT Circle’s Coinbase dependence Circle’s balance sheet risk The road ahead Circle comes full circle with its IPO bid Circle , the company behind the USD Coin ( USDC ) stablecoin, has officially filed to go public. On Apr. 1, it submitted its registration documents to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, marking a notable step for the entire stablecoin industry. The company intends to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “CRCL.” However, key details such as the number of shares and the expected pricing range have not yet been disclosed. More recent estimates place the company’s valuation closer to the $4 to $5 billion range. Financially, Circle had a strong revenue year in 2024. The company reported $1.68 billion in revenue and reserve income, up from $1.45 billion in 2023 and more than twice the $772 million it posted in 2022. But its profit metrics tell a more nuanced story. Net income dropped to $155.7 million in 2024, down from $267.5 million the year before. More notably, its EBITDA, which stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, declined by 29% to $284.8 million. Circle’s IPO filing raises alarms due to hefty operational costs, with over $250 million spent on compensation and $140 million on other expenses. Omar, an investor at Dragonfly, a crypto venture fund, points to weakening gross margins, deregulation risks in the U.S., and a core income driver (rates) already peaking. With growth stalled and multiple headwinds, Omar suggests that Circle’s 32x 2024 earnings valuation is overly expensive.

As of Apr. 4, USDT controls more than 61% of the stablecoin market, while USDC holds roughly 25%. Competition is also intensifying. New entrants such as PayPal USD ( PYUSD ) and Ripple USD ( RLUSD ) are slowly expanding their presence, especially in the U.S. and enterprise sectors, which have historically been strongholds for Circle. So what does this all mean for the stablecoin market? Let’s dig deeper into how Circle’s IPO could reshape the competitive dynamics of the sector — and whether this might finally present a credible challenge to Tether’s ( USDT ) top spot. Circle’s IPO and the new era of stablecoins Circle’s decision to go public has sparked widespread discussion about transparency, regulatory alignment, and shifting expectations around stablecoin governance and structure. Crypto.news reached out to various experts to explore how this move might impact institutional adoption and stablecoin market dynamics moving forward. David Robnett, Co-Founder and Managing Director of Asset Token Ventures, views the IPO as a key turning point in the stablecoin market. “Circle’s IPO is a watershed moment for the stablecoin space. It introduces a level of transparency, regulatory accountability, and investor scrutiny that’s never before existed for a dollar-backed digital asset. While Tether remains dominant in terms of raw volume, Circle’s public status may become a decisive factor for platforms and funds prioritizing compliance and risk-adjusted returns.” Bundeep Singh Rangar, CEO of Pi Protocol, explains that the listing is especially appealing to institutions looking for reliability over opacity. “Circle’s status as a listed company should confer a strong regulatory advantage. Investors and institutions tend to favor products known for transparency and oversight, and USDC appears well placed to meet that demand. Becoming a publicly traded entity, backed by audited statements, is likely to attract more risk-averse institutions.” Yuriy Brisov, Partner at Digital & Analogue Partners, highlights how Circle’s increased disclosures set it apart from its competitors. “Circle’s legitimacy, audited reserves, and SEC reporting could attract mainstream financial players to USDC. Tether’s model remains far more opaque. That gives Circle a positioning advantage with regulated institutions, especially those under compliance pressure.” Alexis Sirkia, Chairman of Yellow Network, takes a more cautious stance, pointing to Tether’s entrenched position across existing infrastructure. “In crypto, dominance is won by use case and integration. Tether remains the backbone of offshore liquidity and is deeply embedded across both centralized and decentralized trading chains. Circle’s regulation-friendly approach will attract more institutional capital over time, but Tether’s position will not be easily displaced.” Joe, Co-Founder of DeAgentAI, notes that Circle’s timing aligns well with shifting policy in Washington. “Regulatory clarity is definitely on Circle’s side. Having U.S. institutional support, especially as the government leans more pro-crypto, is a massive tailwind. For big banks and fintechs entering Web3, USDC is a safer choice.” Eneko Knörr, CEO and Co-founder of Stabolut, views the IPO as more than just a company milestone. He sees it as a potential shift in how traditional financial institutions perceive stablecoins. “It’s like allowing investors to invest in a central bank. That kind of visibility and trust is exactly what traditional institutions need to feel comfortable holding USDC or building new financial products around it.” Kelghe D’Cruz, CEO of Pairs, believes Circle’s strategy is clear and deliberate. “Circle going public is a direct shot at Tether. Public markets force clarity. If Circle pulls this off, USDC becomes the stablecoin institutions have to trust. It won’t flip Tether immediately, but it will tighten the gap.” Tim Delhaes, CEO of Grindery, points out that legitimacy is just one part of the equation. “This is a defining moment, but the market isn’t just about compliance. It’s about network effects, accessibility, and integration. USDT still holds a strong grip on offshore and emerging markets where liquidity outweighs regulatory concerns.” The battle for dominance: USDC vs USDT As Circle moves forward with its IPO and USDC’s market cap rises, the central question remains whether it can meaningfully challenge Tether’s dominance. Robbie, CEO of Cycle Network, believes the competition between USDC and USDT boils down to regulation versus reach. “The competition between USDC and USDT is essentially a battle between regulatory compliance and market inertia. USDT remains the most liquid stablecoin, especially on exchanges like Binance and OKX. It’s the default unit of account in much of Asia and dominates because of infrastructure, not narrative.” He acknowledges that USDC is clearly the more trusted asset in DeFi, with transparent reserves and a strong presence in lending protocols like Aave ( AAVE ) and Compound ( COMP ). But, in his view, Tether’s simplicity and speed continue to make it the default choice in high-frequency, cross-border use cases where compliance is less of a concern. Blake Jeong, Co-CEO of IOST, points to evolving dynamics around utility and capital efficiency. “In this new phase, dominance won’t just be about scale but also about utility and sustainable yield. The next wave of stablecoins may be backed by real-world assets and offer organic yield. That changes the conversation from reserve safety to active performance.” He adds that yield-bearing designs could attract both institutional and DeFi users, particularly if they are paired with strong collateralization and flexible deployment across protocols. Zino, CEO of GamerBoom, stressed the role of geography and market segmentation. He notes that while USDC’s regulatory compliance strengthens its position in Europe and the U.S., Tether’s foothold in emerging markets is difficult to challenge. “Tether retains a 70 percent market share and remains deeply embedded in decentralized platforms and remittance corridors like TRON. While USDC’s IPO boosts its appeal in regulated spaces, Tether’s liquidity in high-volume, underregulated environments remains formidable.” Dmitrij Radin, CEO of Zekret, sees the competition as a reflection of two distinct value systems within crypto. “Circle has to open the books and follow U.S. compliance. Tether, by staying offshore and semi-anonymous, offers flexibility that many emerging market users value. The competition is no longer about who is right — it’s about which model works better under different constraints.” While opinions vary on who holds the upper hand in the long run, there is broad agreement that the stablecoin market is likely to remain segmented. Circle’s Coinbase dependence As Circle embarks on its public journey, several risks have emerged. One of the main concerns is Circle’s heavy dependence on Coinbase , both as a partner and as a primary distribution channel. Robbie highlighted that the $908 million payout to Coinbase for distributing USDC, which exceeds Circle’s net income of $156 million, shows the scale of this reliance. “The payments to Coinbase are huge. Circle’s stablecoin business was originally a joint venture with Coinbase, and while the acquisition of Coinbase’s stake was strategic, it has led to a situation where a large portion of Circle’s growth is tied to one platform. If Coinbase faces regulatory issues or decides to shift focus, Circle could feel the impact significantly. This dependency creates a level of risk that could hurt the company’s margins and growth potential in the long run.” Zino agrees, pointing out that Circle’s business model, driven by the payments made to Coinbase, could become a financial bottleneck. “Circle’s dependence on Coinbase isn’t just a partnership — it’s a crucial part of their revenue model. With so much of their distribution tied to one exchange, any change in Coinbase’s priorities or a shift in its market position could severely impact Circle’s operations and profitability. It introduces unnecessary risk, especially in such a volatile market.” Circle’s balance sheet risk In addition to this concentration risk, Circle also faces exposure to fluctuating interest rates. The S-1 filing revealed that a 200-basis-point drop in interest rates could lead to a $414 million loss, primarily due to Circle’s reliance on interest income from reserves. This is an area where Radin sees a key distinction between Circle and Tether. “Circle’s financial strategy is highly sensitive to interest rate changes. With the bulk of its revenue coming from interest on reserve holdings like U.S. Treasuries, any substantial rate drop could shrink their earnings significantly. This contrasts with Tether, whose revenue sources remain more opaque, but it’s likely that their model is less exposed to the immediate fluctuations of the interest rate environment.” Daria Morgen, Head of Research at Changelly, echoed Radin’s concerns, highlighting the vulnerability Circle faces due to its reliance on safe, low-yield assets. “While Circle’s transparency is a strength in terms of regulatory compliance, it leaves them exposed when market conditions change. If rates fall, their revenue model could take a significant hit. Tether, by contrast, doesn’t disclose its full portfolio, which may allow it more flexibility to weather such changes.” Circle’s interest rate risk is not just a concern for its operations but also highlights a larger strategic gap. Jeong noted that diversifying its revenue streams beyond interest on reserves should be a priority for Circle moving forward. “To compete with Tether, Circle needs to expand its business beyond the confines of interest-bearing reserves. There are growing opportunities in areas like fiat ramps, liquidity settlement, and decentralized finance. Relying too heavily on the interest rate environment for revenue puts Circle at risk, especially if rates fall or remain volatile.” Steven Pu, Co-Founder of Taraxa, brings the issue into sharp focus by pointing out that Circle must diversify to mitigate these risks. “Circle’s focus on reserve income makes sense for regulatory reasons, but it leaves them vulnerable. With so much tied up in reserves and such heavy reliance on Coinbase, Circle’s business model is highly susceptible to shifts in market conditions. To stay competitive in the long run, Circle needs to broaden its revenue sources and reduce exposure to these single points of failure.” Radin pointed out that this reliance on external financial forces is more apparent in Circle’s model than in Tether’s, where the lack of transparency leaves its financial stability open to speculation. “Circle’s transparency about its reserves is a strength, but it also makes them more vulnerable. The fact that 99% of their revenue comes from interest on U.S. Treasury reserves means they’re at the mercy of rate fluctuations. Tether’s model, while opaque, likely shields them from some of this risk, as they’re not as open about where their revenue comes from.” Sirkia views Circle’s need for diversification as not just a financial necessity, but also a strategic one. “Circle’s focus on compliance is beneficial, but it’s not enough if their revenue model is too reliant on one source. The stablecoin market is evolving, and there are growing opportunities in areas like liquidity settlement and decentralized finance. If Circle doesn’t adapt, they may find themselves behind competitors who are more nimble in responding to market changes.” The road ahead To remain competitive, Circle needs to diversify its income streams and reduce its reliance on a single partner. Though regulatory clarity and institutional backing are advantages, they won’t be enough if market conditions shift drastically. For Circle to challenge Tether’s dominance, it will have to rethink its strategy, focusing on expanding into areas like decentralized finance and liquidity settlement. Without this diversification, Circle risks being outpaced by competitors better equipped to handle uncertainty and capitalize on emerging trends.",Feature|Exclusive|IPO|Stablecoin|United States,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|USDT|USDC,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-04-04 15:03:59

Today, that business does not exist. You can now Facetime or Zoom anyone, anywhere, for free. What changed? The shift to Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) ultimately drove the price of calls down to nearly zero. Today, we are experiencing a similar transformation as a global, embedded financial layer emerges within the internet. This will ultimately drive money transfer costs closer to zero, transforming a system long burdened by high fees, delays and middlemen. Stablecoins are the application driving this evolution. The maxim “adoption is slow until it is fast” captures their explosive growth in recent years . To get an idea of scale, stablecoin transaction volume surged above $27 trillion in 2024 – surpassing Visa and Mastercard combined. Today, there are stablecoin providers, such as Tether, that hold more U.S. Treasuries than entire countries like Germany and the Netherlands. Stablecoins are no longer a niche experiment. They are becoming more deeply embedded in our global financial ecosystem. As U.S. lawmakers debate stablecoin legislation, the goal should be clear: reinforce the dollar’s dominance as the global reserve currency while extending its reach into corners of the world that traditional banking cannot touch. This should include many important players — not just those based in the United States. Two Paths, One Future Congress is at a crossroads between two general positions. One is a closed-market approach in which U.S.-based stablecoin issuers would be privileged over their non-U.S. competitors. This is shortsighted and will ultimately stifle innovation. The other approach is to build a regulatory framework that cultivates fair and free global competition. By allowing international players like Tether to compete alongside U.S.-based issuers, the U.S. can foster a dynamic ecosystem where the best ideas and technologies rise to the top. Competition is what would drive excellence. There is a myth being perpetrated that only U.S.-based issuers back their tokens with sufficient reserves, attest to those reserves, and take necessary steps to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. That simply is not true. Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, assisted American law enforcement and over 230 law enforcement agencies in 50 countries to block $2.5 billion dollars in illicit activities worldwide . The reality is that responsible stablecoin issuers exist both inside and outside the U.S. (Tether, which is based in El Salvador, accounts for more than half the stablecoin market.) Overly restrictive regulation could also backfire on the U.S. economy. If stablecoin legislation drives foreign-based companies out of the U.S., it could result in decreased demand for U.S. Treasuries, weakened dollar dominance and a less competitive stablecoin space. Congress stands at an important crossroads — “two roads diverged” as Robert Frost once wrote. It could seize this moment to craft a regulatory framework that champions competition and transparency, or it could take the narrow road by taking a protectionist approach and choking innovation. The market’s diversity is not a bug to fix. It’s a feature to harness. It's time to make a careful choice as the stakes could not be higher.

In a recent statement, Farina emphasized his commitment to holding XRP until it reaches a valuation of at least $100. Farina expressed his intent to challenge major financial institutions, stating, “I’m not here for $2, I’m here to beat the BIG BANKS and not have them further suppress the price of XRP until adoption is here.” He further declared, “I’m here for a multi-generational pump, I’m NOT selling any $XRP for less than $100. Blackrock will CRY!” Let me be VERY clear, I'm not here for $2, I'm here to beat the BIG BANKS and not have them further suppress the price of XRP until adoption is here. I'm here for a multi-generational pump, I'm NOT selling any $XRP for less than $100. Blackrock will CRY! — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) April 1, 2025 Community Reactions to Farina’s Statement Farina’s remarks have elicited varied responses from the cryptocurrency community. Michele Coulston, an XRP holder, shared her perspective: “Not selling until 1,000.00 and beyond. At 1,000.00 I’ll take a little profit, then wait for that 60,000.00 valuation.” Conversely, a user identified as CryptoPanther offered a more skeptical view, commenting, “..year 2080 and still waiting, waiting for his generation’s wealth (hoping 589$) and not selling, keep buying the dips…xrp keeping its range between 0.30 and 10 usd, but ‘who’s selling?’ “ Farina’s Previous Assertions on Institutional Accumulation According to a previous Times Tabloid report , Farina has consistently voiced concerns about institutional strategies affecting XRP’s market dynamics. He has suggested that major financial entities, such as BlackRock, are acquiring XRP at discounted rates, potentially to the detriment of retail investors. Farina highlighted that economic pressures are compelling many individual investors to liquidate their digital assets, including XRP, to meet basic financial needs. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 He posited that this scenario facilitates institutional accumulation of XRP at lower prices, potentially leading to a market dominated by large financial players. Farina warned that this trend could result in an “institutional bull run,” with fewer individual investors holding significant XRP positions as economic constraints force them to sell their holdings. Farina’s Advocacy for Strategic Holding of XRP Farina has consistently advocated for a long-term investment approach to XRP. He has previously asserted that selling XRP prematurely is akin to discarding a winning lottery ticket due to impatience. This analogy underscores his belief in the asset’s potential for substantial future appreciation. Farina has also emphasized the importance of holding a significant amount of XRP, suggesting that not owning at least a thousand is unwise. His stance reflects a conviction that XRP’s value is poised for significant growth, particularly as institutional interest and adoption increase. Edward Farina’s recent statements and ongoing commentary highlight his unwavering confidence in XRP’s future potential and his concerns about institutional influence on its market value. His perspectives contribute to the broader discourse on cryptocurrency investment strategies, particularly regarding the balance between retail and institutional participation in the market.

Surprisingly, by adding Bitcoin to the Global Market Portfolio we were able to maximize Sharpe, Information, and Sortino Ratios. Additional consideration was given to lower-risk and heuristic investors, illustrating that Bitcoin likely provides benefits to such investors as a small diversification vehicle. On a fundamental level, we think Bitcoin's long-term outlook remains positive on the basis of growing institutional uptake, political support, and more consistent volatility. Risks such as time series bias and Bitcoin's perceived fundamental weaknesses should be considered. It's been approximately three years since we last weighed in on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) , where we argued that certain correlations would lead to sustained momentum. Although it has suffered from a few bumps ever since, Bitcoin has delivered index-beating returns, consequently verifying our analysis to a degree. Pearl Gray's Previous Rating (Seeking Alpha) Today's report approaches Bitcoin from a different angle, whereby we re-assess the cryptocurrency's optics in context of its maturing nature and its portfolio optimization benefits. Without further delay, here's a summary of what we discovered. Bitcoin: Price Evaluation & A Maturing 'Asset Class' Market Commentary Bitcoin has delivered solid returns in the past year, after slumping during the initial stages of global interest rate increases and the concurrent bear market . Despite the coin's resurgence, a slight decrease has occurred since the turn of the year, likely due to a broad-based decline in risky stocks and a technical correction. Data by YCharts So, looking ahead, what's in-store for Bitcoin? First, let's run through a correlation matrix to establish Bitcoin's correlation parameters. A time series correlation matrix shows that Bitcoin's correlation to major asset classes has strengthened in recent years with its correlation to the Russell 1000 increasing to 0.62 between 2020 and 2024. However, interestingly enough, Bitcoin's correlation to the dollar has inverted even further, settling at -0.22 for the period between 2020 and 2024; moreover, Bitcoin's correlation to the VIX has stayed negative , at least until 2023. Collectively, these figures make for an interesting analysis due to a potential shift in influencing variables. BlockWorks Adding to the above, it's shown that Bitcoin's price volatility has diminished in recent years. While still a volatile asset, Bitcoin's current volatility is on-par with certain big tech stocks, which seemed unthinkable a decade ago. In our view, Bitcoin is maturing, which is both statistically evident and qualitatively explainable (elaborated upon later) . Bitcoin Realised Volatility (iShares) Herewith is a rolling volatility correlation to substantiate some of the claims made in the preceding paragraph. Bitcoin Vs. Tech Stock Realised Volatility (iShares) Maturity Institutional Acceptance Brian Moynihan spoke earlier this year, stating that “If the rules come in and make it a real thing that you can actually do business with, you’ll find that the banking system will come in hard on the transactional side of it,” - Moynihan's words provide a leading-indicator of Bitcoin's institutional level acceptance, especially given the Trump Administration's (and various other global political parties) pro-Bitcoin stance. Moreover, index funds have capitalized on the demand for Bitcoin as an investable asset vehicle; in our view, indexation could add tremendous gravitational pull. VettaFi Furthermore, financial market participants often overlook Bitcoin's transactional value (it's not merely an investable asset). Sure, Bitcoin might not be backed by tax dollars; however, it has tremendous real-world application. Until now, most of the transactional utility has occurred in developed or top-tier emerging nations . However, we think the secret sauce lies in emerging markets where people with volatile currencies might want to utilize their Bitcoin reserves as a means to protect against volatile soft currencies - I speak out of experience. Data by YCharts Potential Proxy For Gold? I pointed to Bitcoin's negative USD correlation earlier in the article. Investors have historically opted for Gold as a USD hedge, especially whenever tail risk emerged . Although speculative, Bitcoin could be used as a co-reserve alongside gold, providing similar principles with diversification benefits. Here's a recent state street study discussing how Gold and Bitcoin could arguably be used together in the future: Link Here Portfolio Optimization Portfolio optimization is primarily a statistical study emphasizing risk-adjusted return maximization through diversified portfolios. While an observation of standard deviations and correlations might possess limitations in the real world, they provide a valuable guideline to investors with an interest in objective theories as opposed to emotional decision-making. We selected a few portfolio methods to illustrate Bitcoin's potential application in portfolio optimization. More specifically, we studied heuristic portfolios, including the 60/40 and 1/N. Moreover, we looked at a Global Market Portfolio equivalent, to add width to the analysis by including a broad range of asset classes. Here's a summary of some of the terms used in the analysis. Sharpe Ratio: A measure of risk-adjusted returns by observing excess returns relative to volatility. Sortino Ratio: Similar to the Sharpe ratio. However, this metric bases its denominator on downside deviation. In addition, it sets its excess return benchmark equivalent to predefined investors' required return instead of a risk-free asset. Information Ratio : Measures excess return relative to tracking error by basing both against a benchmark. Efficient Frontier: A series of optimal portfolios based on investors' desired risk-return appetite. Tangency Portfolio: The point on the efficient frontier that maximizes the selected risk-adjusted return metric. 60/40 Heuristic: A heuristic approach to asset allocation, comprising of 60% stocks and 40% bonds. As investors age, this method often turns into other approaches, such as 120 minus age. 1/N Heuristic: A selection of major asset classes weighted equally to ensure broad-based exposure while minimizing the time and effort related to managing broad-based exposure. Global Market Portfolio: A portfolio that aims to sample all investable assets by market capitalization. ETF Proxies: Thematic vehicle proxies used to sample the underlying asset exposure of each portfolio methodology. During the testing process, we emphasized the maximum Sharpe Ratios and Information Ratios. Other methodologies can be used; however, portfolio optimization via Sharpe and IR is quite common in practice. 60/40 Heuristic The 60/40 is probably one of the most common heuristic portfolios, ideally suited to investors who seek practical yet effective solutions. Here's a view of the portfolio's weights, its ETF proxies, as well as portfolio weights for the maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio. Fund Equal Weight 60/40 Max SR Vanguard Russell 3000 (VTHR ) 50% 60% 100% Vanguard Total Bond Market ( BND ) 50% 40% 0% Source: Author's Work Here's the regression's results, a discussion follows. Monthly Regression With Dates January 2016 - March 2025 (Author In Portfolio Visualiser) A pure equity portfolio maximizes the Sharpe and Sortino Ratios. A pure equity portfolio maximizes expected return. A 50/50 portfolio minimizes maximum drawdowns. In essence, you'll likely experience superior risk-adjusted returns from a pure equity portfolio. However, market tail risk could be more severe, meaning a lack of asset class diversification might lead to an undesirable maximum drawdown. Thus, allocation would depend on an investor's risk-return preference. 1/N Here's the data for a 1/N portfolio. Kindly note that the selected major asset classes were at our discretion; investors' definition of major asset classes might differ. ETF/Fund 1/N Max SR Vanguard Russell 3000 14.29% 45.39% Vanguard Total Bond Market 14.29% - iShares Core MSCI EAFE ( IEFA ) 14.28% - Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ( VWO ) 14.28% - iShares iBoxx $ Invmt Grade Corp Bd ( LQD ) 14.29% - Vanguard Real Estate ( VNQ ) 14.28% - SPDR Gold Shares ( GLD ) 14.29% 54.61% Source: Author's Work - Might Be Subject To Small Rounding Errors Herewith are the results; a discussion follows. Monthly Regression With Dates January 2016 - March 2025 (Author in Portfolio Visualiser) The results of the 1/N provide novelty in relation to the 60/40; here are the key findings. The Sharpe Ratio and Sortino Ratio are both lower for the 1/N portfolio than for the 60/40 and pure equity portfolios. Despite the 1/N's shortcomings, an altered 1/N shows that we can achieve superior Sharpe and Sortino ratios by restricting certain asset classes from the 1/N. The expected return on the restricted 1/N is slightly lower than the pure equity portfolio, placing it second thus far. However, its maximum drawdown is the lowest of all the portfolios tested until this point-in-time. The maximum Sharpe Ratio achievable provides an unbalance portfolio, significantly overweighing Gold and Stocks while neglecting broader diversification. However, despite its shortcomings, the portfolio's maximum drawdown is lower than the preceding diversified portfolios. Global Market Portfolio As with the 1/N, the GMP's allocation can be subjective. For example, asset class representation might be mis-sampled and subject to fluctuation. Furthermore, asset accessibility might be restricted, and proxy ETFs usually have partial correlations to the targeted asset classes as opposed to near perfect correlations. Before presenting our selected liquid asset weights, I'd like to introduce you to a GMP created by State Street in late 2024 . The diagram provides an idea of the GMP's exposure. Global Market Portfolio (State Street) Next up, a table showing the portfolio's liquid vehicle weights. Aside: BIZD was used to represent private credit, which is a distant proxy, yet the closest we could find. Additionally, certain liquid vehicles provide amalgamated exposure to asset classes, meaning their testing weights differ from the GMP's. ETF/Fund GMP Max SR Max IR Vanguard Total World Stock ( VT ) 44.8% 23.34% 61.17% Vanguard Total International Bond ( BNDX ) 29.8% 11.67% - iShares MBS ( MBB ) 4.8% - Vanguard Real Estate ( VNQ ) 5.8% - SPDR Gold Shares ( GLD ) 4.2% 25% 20.85% Invesco Global Listed Private Equity ( PSP ) 3% - iShares S&P GSCI Commodity-Indexed Trust ( GSG ) 3% 3.57% - VanEck BDC Income ETF ( BIZD ) 2% 6.41% 8.02% SPDR Blmbg Convert Secs ( CWB ) 1.5% 25% 9.96% iShares Short Treasury Bond ( SHV ) 1.1% 5% - Source: Author's Work - Might Be Subject To Small Rounding Errors Above are the weights for our GMP portfolio, below are the results; a discussion follows suit. Monthly Regression With Dates January 2016 - March 2025 (Author In Portfolio Visualiser) The initial maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio notably overweighed non-core asset classes. As a result, we configured a high Sharpe Ratio but to the detriment of other metrics. To correct the bias, we added asset constraints, whereby we incorporated a maximum information ratio strategy and weighting restrictions. Here's a breakdown of the weighting restrictions. Stocks and Bonds capped at 50% of the portfolio's allocatable amount. Other core assets such as Gold and Real Estate capped at 25%. Non-core asset classes capped at 2x their weight in the GMP. Here are the results we discovered. None of the tested portfolios contest the restricted 1/N max Sharpe Ratio portfolio in terms of Sharpe Ratio. The restricted 1/N portfolio still holds superior expected return. The pure equity portfolio in the 60/40 analysis reigns supreme with regards to expected returns. The maximum drawdown is minimized through the GMP's maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio. By investing in all investable assets, we see docile numbers. The portfolio can be adjusted to maximize the Sharpe Ratio, which results in lower maximum drawdown and a best-in-class Sortino Ratio. The optimal allocation within this dataset suggests that it might suit low-risk, medium return-seeking investors but fails to deliver optimal risk-adjusted returns. Adding Bitcoin Maximizing Metrics Holistically We tested a theory, which added Bitcoin to the GMP, inclusive of the 60/40, and 1/N heuristic portfolios. Similar to the previous section, we set constraints on maximum allocations to optimize metrics throughout, instead of merely isolating the Sharpe Ratio. Herewith are the weights that were used. ETF/Fund GMP Max SR Max IR Vanguard Total World Stock ( VT ) 44.8% 33.89% 50% Vanguard Total International Bond ( BNDX ) 29.8% 5.91% - iShares MBS ( MBB ) 4.8% - - Vanguard Real Estate ( VNQ ) 5.8% - - SPDR Gold Shares ( GLD ) 4.2% 25% 25% Invesco Global Listed Private Equity ( PSP ) 3% - 4.39% iShares S&P GSCI Commodity-Indexed Trust ( GSG ) 3% 6% - VanEck BDC Income ETF ( BIZD ) 2% 4% 4% SPDR Blmbg Convert Secs ( CWB ) 1.5% 3% 3% iShares Short Treasury Bond ( SHV ) 1.1% 2.2% - Bitcoin 0% 20% 13.61% Source: Author In Portfolio Visualizer - Might Be Subject To Small Rounding Errors The results are conveyed in the next diagram, a discussion follows. Monthly Regression With Dates January 2016 - March 2025 (Author in Portfolio Visualiser) As with the GMP test, we applied the maximum Information Ratio portfolio test to supplement the Sharpe Ratio portfolio. Moreover, we applied constraints to the optimization, introducing focus on all the key ratios instead of merely the Sharpe and Information Ratios. Here are the constraints. Stocks and Bonds capped at 50% of the portfolio's allocatable amount. Other core assets such as Gold and Real Estate capped at 25%. Non-core asset classes capped at 2x their weight in the GMP. Bitcoin capped at 20%. Here are the results we discovered. We were able to maximize the Sharpe Ratios within both the GMP + Bitcoin's max Sharpe Ratio and Information Ratio portfolios to levels exceeding all preceding tests. We were able to maximize the Sortino Ratios within both the GMP + Bitcoin's max Sharpe Ratio and Information Ratio portfolios to levels exceeding all preceding tests. Aside from maximum drawdown, all metrics outshined the VBIAX ETF ( VBIAX ), which is an ETF used as a 60/40 portfolio benchmark proxy. The Maximum Drawdowns increased significantly in both the both of the GMP + Bitcoin max Sharpe Ratio and Information Ratio portfolios. However, as illustrated in the next section, lower higher-risk asset exposure, including Bitcoin, lowered maximum drawdown significantly while maintaining high Sharpe Ratios. Efficient Frontier The information ratio-based efficient frontier shows that the GMP + Bitcoin portfolio can be used to reach the tangency portfolio on the efficient frontier, which includes Bitcoin exposure of approximately 13.61%. Aside: The maximum information ratio weights used in the introduction equates to the tangency portfolio weights. Monthly Regression With Dates January 2016 - March 2025 (Author In Portfolio Visualiser) Furthermore, lower risk investors can benefit from Bitcoin exposure. The efficient frontier shows that portfolios with 0.15% active returns, yet positive information ratios load approximately 1.6% of Bitcoin in the portfolio, indicating that Bitcoin has application in lower risk portfolio optimization. Click On Image To Enlarge (Author in Portfolio Visualiser) From a volatility relative perspective, the Sharpe Ratio shows that Bitcoin plays a key role in optimization with the tangency portfolio achieved by allocating 13.61% to Bitcoin. Click On Image To Enlarge (Author In Portfolio Visualiser) Although optimized for volatility-adjusted returns, the tangency portfolio might onboard more risk than some might be willing to. However, a more docile portfolio with a standard deviation of 7.91% (versus the S&P 500's 33-y average of 15.20% ) shows that Bitcoin still plays a material role in achieving annualized returns of above 10%. Click On Image To Enlarge (Author in Portfolio Visualiser) Risks Other Metrics Should Be considered Only a handful of metrics were considered in the analysis. Although the metrics are salient to risk-return analysis. Additional metrics such as value-at-risk, non-linear correlation coefficients, skewness, and kurtosis might add value to a holistic analysis. ""It's Backed By Nothing"" Many, including Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffett , have argued that Bitcoin is unsustainable. Moreover, many retail investors and mainstream actors tend to argue against Bitcoin as an investment on the basis of it being ""backed by nothing."" Whether counter-arguments hold validity or not is debatable; however, it would be naive to ignore the opinion of opponents as financial markets comprises of buyers and sellers, not just buyers. Recent Hacking To our understanding, initially, it was argued that Bitcoin's novelty was largely due to its black box status, presenting a sense of security to holders. However, as many might be aware, numerous crypto wallets hacking have occurred in recent times, raising question marks about the notion of Bitcoin being a safety zone to privacy-seeking holders. Historical Returns Change With Time (Conditioning) The regression was calibrated over a period of less than ten years, largely due to historical data limitations. Although insights are valuable, society, the economy, and financial market behavior changes as time passes, therefore limiting the validity of historical simulation analysis. Concluding Thoughts Our portfolio optimization tests suggest that Bitcoin could be used as an instrument to enhance risk-adjusted returns. Although limited in time-frame and dependable on the past, the regression analysis communicates valuable inferences to those interested in adjusting their portfolios to modern financial market behavior. As for Bitcoin's interim price direction. We acknowledge that its short-term predictability is limited, and therefore we refrained from committing to a short-term price discovery opinion. However, we are in favor of Bitcoin's long-term prospects, given its growing societal acceptance, recent institutional uptake, and its general behavior as an 'asset class' - we retain our 'buy' rating.

Grab BTFD Coin’s 2900% ROI Potential Before It’s Gone—The Best New Meme Coin for April,https://thecoinrise.com/saw-just-a-chill-guy-surge-grab-btfd-coins-2900-roi-potential-before-its-gone-the-best-new-meme-coin-for-april/,"Meme coins have been all the rage over the past few years. What started as a fun side project with no serious potential has transformed into one of the most exciting sectors in crypto. Everyone’s heard of the big names like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, but in recent months, more and more investors are looking at newer meme coins to make their mark. Whether you missed out on the initial coin offerings (ICOs) of legendary tokens or you’re just trying to get in on the next big thing, one coin stands out above the rest—BTFD Coin. If you saw Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) skyrocket on the Solana blockchain, then you know the kind of potential meme coins can offer. Launched in November 2024, CHILLGUY caught fire by building off a viral meme character. But for those who missed the CHILLGUY ICO, the next opportunity is right in front of you—BTFD Coin. This meme coin isn’t just riding the wave of hype, it’s creating its own wave, with a Play-to-Earn game already live, 90% APY staking, and Bulls Squad growing by the day. As one of the top new meme coins to join in April 2025 , BTFD Coin is quickly capturing the attention of investors and crypto enthusiasts alike. Let’s break it down. BTFD Coin: The Bulls Squad and the Power of Community The biggest attraction right now with BTFD Coin is the community-driven momentum that’s propelling it to the top of top new meme coins to join in April 2025. Stage 15 is here, and the $0.0002 price isn’t going to stick around for long. This is your chance to get in before the price hits $0.0006 on listing day, with predictions placing the coin’s moon price at $0.006—that’s a 2900% ROI potential for those who act fast. The Bulls Squad, the core community behind BTFD, is expanding rapidly, and it’s not just about holding onto tokens. This community is about action—staking, playing, and referring. That’s where the Play-to-Earn game comes into play. It’s not just a way to have fun; it’s a way to earn while you play. Launched on January 1st, 2025, the Play-to-Earn game lets players earn real $BTFD rewards by battling it out, leveling up, and competing with others. As players engage, demand for the token naturally increases. More players = more buying pressure, which in turn creates massive price upside. If you missed the early rounds of the meme coin presale , don’t sleep on this—BTFD Coin is the next big thing. But it’s not all about playing games. BTFD Coin offers staking rewards at an astounding 90% APY. Investors can lock their tokens and watch their returns grow while the market does its thing. You’re essentially getting paid for holding, on top of any gains from the price increase. It’s a great way to earn passive income, especially when combined with the meme coin hype. With its community-driven growth and utility, BTFD Coin is quickly becoming one of the top new meme coins to join in April 2025. If you’re looking for the next meme coin presale to join, now is the time to grab BTFD before it hits the moon. The Bulls Squad isn’t just about making profits—it’s about building a movement. The referral program alone has brought in thousands of new holders, and the community is sharing the wealth. For every new user who joins via your referral, you get extra tokens. This is the BTFD Coin difference: the people who believe in it are actively helping others earn. Imagine this scenario: you jump into BTFD Coin with just $5,000 at today’s price of $0.0002. If BTFD reaches $0.0006 (its expected listing price), you’re looking at a $15,000 return. But if it hits the predicted $0.006 moon price? That same $5,000 investment could turn into $150,000. That’s the type of potential we’re talking about, and with over 72 billion tokens sold and 11,700+ bulls already on board, BTFD Coin is gaining traction fast. Don’t miss out on this meme coin presale—it’s one of the top new meme coins to join in April 2025, and this opportunity won’t last forever. Just a Chill Guy: The Meme Coin That Got Away When Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) hit the market, it grabbed everyone’s attention. Launched on the Solana blockchain in November 2024, this meme coin capitalized on the viral success of the “Chill Guy” meme, a character created by artist Phillip Banks in 2023. The meme itself gained massive popularity across social media, and when CHILLGUY Coin dropped, it quickly amassed a following. What made Just a Chill Guy stand out wasn’t just the meme—it was the community that rallied behind it. As soon as it launched, early investors who got in at the ICO made significant returns.

Eleanor Terrett from Fox Business dropped a hint on X on March 12, 2025, saying two insiders think the SEC’s ready to wrap up its fight with Ripple once they hash out the last details. This could flip the script for XRP and shake up the crypto scene big time. Ripple Vs. SEC: Legal Tangle Finally Over? The Ripple Vs. SEC showdown has been dragging since late 2020, and it’s hit a bumpy patch. Ripple’s lawyers were digging in, trying to tweak a July 2023 ruling from Judge Analisa Torres that slapped a $125 million fine on them—way less than the $2 billion the SEC wanted. Things got spicy in October 2024 when the SEC appealed, and Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse fired back on X, saying, “XRP’s status as a non-security is the law of the land today.” If they settle, it’d end years of headaches that’ve spooked investors. This isn’t just about Ripple—the general U.S. crypto vibe’s shifting. Since Gary Gensler quit as SEC chair on January 20, the agency has eased off, dropping high profile crypto cases against outfits like Kraken, Consensys, Coinbase and Robinhood. A Ripple vs. SEC deal could slot them with other firms dodging legal bullets, clearing the fog, and maybe juicing up XRP’s appeal. Could an ETF Push XRP Price to $100? If the SEC completely paves the way and an XRP ETF gets the green light , could the price hit $100? While no official confirmation on an XRP ETF has been announced, industry observers note that regulatory clarity is a key factor in investor decision-making. A resolution in the Ripple case might facilitate further institutional adoption and clearer regulatory guidelines for digital assets. Statistical data remains crucial in this discussion. XRP, which has seen fluctuating trading volumes and price swings, is closely monitored by retail and institutional investors. Although the settlement details are still under wraps, the potential for an approved ETF could add a new level of legitimacy to XRP . Such a move might influence trading volumes and market sentiment, though it is too early to predict exact price outcomes. Ripple vs. SEC settlement is a big deal—it closes a messy chapter that’s kept XRP on edge. Investors might breathe easier, seeing it as a steadying move. Ripple’s pushing hard for better terms, and with ETF talk swirling, the next steps could propel XRP’s price.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-04 15:27:45

Investors and analysts are speculating about ADA’s future amidst increasing sell-offs and competition from newer blockchain projects. But while Cardano struggles with adoption challenges, another contender, RUVI AI , is positioning itself as a highly promising alternative with advanced features and unmatched rewards for early adopters. If you’re searching for a project with clear potential to thrive in this turbulent market, RUVI is making waves with its strong fundamentals, strategic presale bonuses and community-driven ecosystem. Its features are proving to be exactly what investors need right now. Cardano’s Drop Sparks Investor Worries Cardano’s latest price drop, fueled by macroeconomic concerns such as new tariffs and jittery global markets, highlights its ongoing struggles. Trading volume for ADA has spiked over 80%, indicating heavy selling activity as traders offload their holdings. Analysts warn that without a robust recovery or breakthrough in real-world adoption, ADA risks testing the $0.50 support level in the weeks ahead . Despite the Cardano Foundation’s recent announcement of “Veridian,” a digital identity platform designed to bolster user trust and blockchain adoption, the rollout has done little to buoy market sentiment. Cardano’s reliance on speculative developments, alongside stiff competition from emerging projects, has left it in a precarious position. Enter RUVI’s VIP 5 Tier – A Reward Unlike Any Other Amidst Cardano’s struggles, RUVI stands as a beacon of opportunity thanks to its superior reward structure and forward-thinking ecosystem . For ambitious investors, the VIP 5 tier offers unparalleled benefits during the presale period. Achieving VIP 5 status requires 500,000 RUVI tokens , and the reward is unmatched with a 100% bonus . To put this into perspective, purchasing 500,000 tokens during the presale at $0.01 per token earns you an additional 500,000 tokens , doubling your total to 1,000,000 tokens for an initial $5,000 investment . When RUVI officially launches at an expected $0.07 per token, the tokens acquired for $5,000 could skyrocket to an impressive value of $70,000 . This is the kind of predictable, structured reward system that sets RUVI apart in an increasingly volatile market. RUVI doesn’t stop with its VIP tiers. Its Leaderboard Rewards system introduces an element of gamification, encouraging active participation and fostering community growth. The rewards include: 500,000 RUVI tokens for the top 10 contributors. 250,000 RUVI tokens for the top 50 contributors. 20,000 RUVI tokens for all investors in the top 1,000 rankings. This incentivized competition is designed to build a committed user base while supporting long-term project stability. Why RUVI Outshines Cardano While Cardano boasts a loyal following, its challenges with real-world adoption and dependence on speculative growth leave room for newer, more dynamic projects like RUVI to shine. Built on Ethereum’s tried-and-tested blockchain, RUVI combines scalability with secure infrastructure and introduces tiered bonuses and leaderboard rewards that are reshaping the investment experience. RUVI provides investors with immediate, tangible benefits, offering both short-term rewards and long-term growth potential. It’s a structured approach to growth and user incentivization that Cardano’s ecosystem currently lacks. A Bright Future Awaits with RUVI AI The crypto market remains volatile, but it’s during these moments of uncertainty that opportunities emerge. RUVI’s strategy of blending blockchain with artificial intelligence (AI), robust rewards, innovative features, and transparent incentives sets it up as an investment worth serious consideration. For those ready to take the leap, RUVI’s presale remains the perfect entry point into a growing ecosystem. With VIP 5 bonuses and an exciting leaderboard to boot, RUVI isn’t just another cryptocurrency project; it’s a complete investment solution for those looking to maximize their returns.

Shibarium’s growth stems from steady activity and the adoption of the layer-2 network within the broader Shiba Inu ecosystem. However, this major milestone hasn’t translated into positive momentum for SHIB’s price, which has been under bearish pressure for weeks now alongside the rest of the crypto market. Shibarium Surpasses 1 Billion Transactions With Intensifying Network Activity The launch of Shibarium in August 2023 marked a turning point for the meme cryptocurrency’s ecosystem. The goal of the layer-2 network was to improve the speed and lower the cost of Shiba Inu transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Since its launch, Shibarium has consistently increased user participation, smart contract deployments, and daily transactions. Related Reading: Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Records Heartbreaking 96% Crash In Transactions, What’s Going On? According to data from Shibariumscan, total transactions have now exceeded the one billion mark, showcasing the sheer amount of activity the network has processed. At the time of writing, Shibarium boasts 1,012,261,457 transactions processed in 10,284,922 blocks and 194,705,571 addresses created. Daily transaction volumes frequently reach the millions, sometimes tens of millions, during periods of high activity in the wider crypto market. Notably, the number of transactions processed on the Shibarium network in the past 24 hours has reached 2.75 million, with an even larger 4.11 million processed in the previous 24-hour timeframe. However, despite the milestone and notable transaction activity, SHIB has failed to make any meaningful price gains. Why Is Shiba Inu Price Still Struggling And Holding Flat Near $0.000012? SHIB’s price performance has been far less encouraging despite Shibarium’s transaction milestone. Since its launch, major milestones tied to the Layer-2 network have often led to increased buying activity. During earlier stages of Shibarium’s rollout, even modest developments were enough to spark rallies or at least short-term price jumps for SHIB. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Update: 99.44% Daily Burn Crash Could Spell Trouble For Meme Coin However, the correlation between Shibarium milestones and SHIB’s price has finally detached, and the hype has finally faded. Shibarium is now only a strong part of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, but its ability to influence the sentiment among crypto investors and price action has diminished. However, outside this detachment, the crypto markets have been generally bearish for a while. The entire crypto landscape has experienced a persistent pullback since early March, with many large-market-cap cryptocurrencies struggling to find upward momentum. Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies have been on a pullback, which was recently made worse by Donald Trump’s tariffs announcement. Over the past seven days, SHIB has been locked around the $0.000012 level and is currently down by 9.4%. The absence of strong buying interest has kept SHIB’s price trapped within this tight downfall, and there is even a risk of it falling below $0.000012 anytime soon. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00001210, down by 1.2% in the past 24 hours.

Powered by a single METIS token, this dynamic duo is rewriting the rules of decentralized technology. At a recent AMA hosted by Natalia Ameline, Metis Foundation Decentralization Coordinator, Hyperion was introduced as the foundation of “ReGenesis”-the rebirth of Metis to become the backbone for decentralized AI. With Hyperion delivering 1-2 gigagas per second, Metis is poised to fuel AI-driven innovation, ultra-low latency gaming, and scalable DeFi, all while dismantling the centralized chokehold on today’s tech landscape. As detailed in Metis’ blog on the dual-network strategy , this synergy of Andromeda and Hyperion is set to reshape Layer 2 infrastructure, with the Hyperion testnet slated for April-May 2025 and a mainnet launch in August. ReGenesis: A New Era for AI and Blockchain Natalia’s AMA revealed “ReGenesis” as Metis’ direct reflection for a state of the more pressing realities of the evolution of AI confined within centralized frameworks controlled by a few leading players. Indeed, the current race is between Blockchain and AI, as they are complimentary-synergistic technologies, she enunciated. That great potential from Blockchain brings AI next to an elevated course of addressing the trust-verifiability-equal access aspect. Hyperion, she described, uses this vision, denaturalizing AI through democratization by the open new future of a decentralized world. Hyperion: Unmatched Performance for a Web2-Like Experience Hyperion marks a quantum leap in blockchain technology, boasting 1-2 gigagas per second of processing power. Natalia highlighted its promise of “unprecedented scalability, ultra-low latency, and very high throughput,” delivering a seamless Web2-like experience free of congestion, lag, and high fees. As Metis’ blog notes, Hyperion’s launch isn’t just about tech—it’s a community-driven effort to foster a vibrant ecosystem of AI innovators and builders, amplifying Metis’ connection with its supporters. Two Networks, One Unified Ecosystem Metis’ dual-network concept incorporates Andromeda and Hyperion into a coherent ecosystem, as articulated by CEO Tom Ngo: “The two networks will work in parallel,” both powered by the METIS token with no plans for a separate Hyperion token. Andromeda remains the “general purpose all use case Web3 network,” with its proven decentralized sequencing (dSeq) and Stage 1 progression, while Hyperion shines “almost like a halo,” per Daniel Kwak, Metis’ CCO and LazAI’s CMO. Optimized for AI, Hyperion attracts cutting-edge innovation, complementing Andromeda’s reliability. The blog underscores how this synergy enhances Metis’ Layer 2 infrastructure, meeting diverse needs while strengthening the whole. MetisVM: The Engine Behind AI Integration Natalia defined the Metis Virtual Machine (MetisVM), the central component of Hyperion, as “a high-performance virtual machine developed to enhance the integration of artificial intelligence within a decentralized framework.” In contrast to conventional networks, MetisVM provides: Computing and storage should be strategically separated for maximum performance. Powerful parallel execution, enabling unprecedented throughput Efficient dynamic code optimization, cutting computational costs State-aware caching for faster data access These features, detailed in the blog, ensure AI development on Hyperion is transparent, verifiable, and free from centralized control, aligning with Metis’ mission. Parallel Execution: Unlocking AI’s Potential Parallel execution, Hyperion’s most distinctive feature, lets several operations run concurrently but still guarantees coherence. Natalia argued that this was vital for artificial intelligence activities such model training and real-time inference, a feature the blog emphasizes as a game changer for big data handling. This sets Hyperion as a front-runner in meeting the computational requirements of artificial intelligence using a distributed framework. A Community-Driven Future Metis isn’t just building technology—it’s rallying a movement. “Our vision is to make Hyperion the backbone of decentralized AI,” Natalia concluded, “but it’s up to you—our community, our supporters, and our developers—to truly build out what the new world with decentralized AI can look like.” The blog echoes this call, inviting developers and enthusiasts to join as Hyperion’s testnet nears (April-May 2025) and its mainnet looms (August 2025). The dual networking strategy is set to change the Layer 2 infrastructure and the future of AI-integrated blockchains through the reliability of Andromeda and high-performance innovation from Hyperion. ReGenesis is not that much of a technical milestone-more so, it is community-driven. Metis will have exceptional scalability and a METIS-powered ecosystem-the march toward a decentralized, AI-empowered world is on. Will you be part of it?

Here Are the Highlights and Bitcoin's Reaction!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/fed-chairman-jerome-powell-speaks-here-are-the-highlights-and-bitcoins-reaction/,"FED Chairman Jerome Powell began his highly anticipated speech in the market, which was confused by Donald Trump's tariff announcement. Powell's speech, which was delivered at a conference organized by the Association for the Advancement of Business Regulation and Writing in Arlington, Virginia, was critical to the economic outlook and interest rate cuts, but Powell began his speech by saying Trump's tariffs were larger than expected and risked higher inflation and slower growth. “As the FED, we will continue to carefully monitor the incoming data, the evolving outlook and the risk balance. We are well positioned to await further clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance. It is too early to say what the appropriate path for monetary policy will be. There is no need to rush, we still have time. We face a highly uncertain outlook for monetary policy, with rising risks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation. Tariffs are likely to increase inflation in coming quarters; more persistent effects are possible. Potential tariffs may have a permanent inflationary effect. Tariffs are likely to cause a temporary increase in prices. The economic impact of the tariffs is likely to be greater than expected. We must ensure that price increases do not lead to continued inflation. The Fed does not have a recession probability estimate, but external estimates have raised the possibility. The American people expect the Fed to tell the truth, and the Fed will do exactly that.” Bitcoin's price action during Powell's speech: *This is not investment advice.

42903317,https://coingape.com/?post_type=markets&p=247350,1743781007,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Pi Network Price Crash: Generational Opportunity After Banxa Integration,https://coingape.com/markets/pi-network-price-crash-generational-opportunity-after-banxa-integration/,"Pi Network price has plummeted by 82% from its February highs, leaving pioneers poorer and disappointed. Buyers have avoided the coin amid major challenges, including heightened dilution fears and a lack of exchange listings. However, this Pi coin price crash could be a generational buying opportunity as integrations start. Pi Network Price Could Be an Opportunity as Integrations Start One reason why the Pi Network price has plunged in the past few months is that it has not received any major integration or exchange listings. Even Binance, whose users voted unanimously for its listing , has not done so, citing inadequate disclosures. This trend may be changing as the Pi coin has just been added in Banxa, a fast-growing fintech company that offers on and off-ramp solutions. This is a notable integration since it enables users to buy and sell Pi coin directly through their cards and wallets like Google and Apple Pay. Banxa Integration of Pi Pi Network price has other additional catalysts that may make the ongoing crash a generational buying opportunity. The most important one is exchange listings by one or more mainstream exchanges. This CoinGape article explained why it would form a God candle if Upbit listed it . Crypto pundits on X wonder why Binance and other exchanges have not listed Pi Network , yet they have added many rug-pull scams, especially in the Solana ecosystem. Pi Coin Price Technicals Point to a Rebound The 4H chart shows why this Pi Network price crash could be a generational buying opportunity as the sell-off loses steam. Also, the token has formed a falling wedge pattern , comprising of two descending and converging trendlines. These two lines are now nearing their confluence point, where breakouts typically happen. The value of Pi has also formed a bullish divergence chart pattern. This happens when an oscillator is rising as an asset continues its strong downtrend. In this case, the MACD indicator has continued rising and is slowly nearing its zero line. The same is true with the Bollinger Bands Trend (BBTrend) indicator, which has continued rising, and could soon turn positive. This indicator looks at the spread between the outer lines of the Bollinger lines. PI Network Price Chart Therefore, in this case, the most likely Pi Network price forecast is bullish since all the coin needs is a simple catalyst. This catalyst may be an exchange listing, an ETF application, or the start of burning. The bullish outlook will become invalid if the coin drops below the key support at $0.45. Such a drop could see it crash to the all-time low of $0.0983.

Malta’s Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) fined OKX’s local subsidiary €1.1 million this month, worth $1.2 million. Malta Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit lays a €1.1 million fine on OKX According to the FIAU’s notice issued on Thursday, the fine came after an onsite compliance examination in April 2023 that revealed multiple failures. Based on the independent government agency’ argument on these failures, they stated that some were considered systematic and serious . Furthermore, the FIAU claimed that OKX’s business risk assessment had not sufficiently investigated possible money laundering risks associated with its products. Additionally, the agency revealed that OKX was discovered to have neglected to conduct risk assessments during onboarding for about half of the client files the watchdog examined. Moreover, it also raised concerns about external reporting and transaction monitoring. However, in defence of itself, OKX claimed to have closely followed the rules established during the previous two years. To support this, an OKX representative said, “Over the past two years, we have implemented a comprehensive compliance program, including technology upgrades, enhanced monitoring, and robust remediation efforts.” In addition, the representative highlighted that the platform had taken corrective action of its own free will, which the FIAU recognized. The agency did not immediately answer to a request for comment. OKX faces significant fines from Maltese for violating regulations set On January 23, OKX, formerly known as OKEx, announced that it had obtained a MiCA “pre-authorization” via its European hub in Malta. Later, the exchange declared that it was authorized to “passport” its services throughout the European Economic Area. In late January, the Malta Financial Services Authority fined OKX €304,000($334,260) for violating unidentified regulations. In addition, OKX agreed to designate an independent third-party service provider to examine its governance framework. Moreover, in late February, OKX’s parent company, which is based in Seychelles, agreed to pay more than $500 million in a settlement with US authorities for failing to register as a money-transmitting business. Around the same time, OKX was the subject of a criminal complaint last month from Thailand’s securities regulator for operating there without a license. OKX faces mounting scrutiny amid Bybit hack allegations The $1.2 million penalty imposed on OKX in Malta closely followed a March report by Bloomberg, which revealed that European Union regulators were investigating the exchange’s alleged involvement in laundering $100 million linked to the Bybit hack. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou had previously alleged that OKX’s Web3 proxy enabled hackers to move approximately 40,233 Ether—worth around $100 million—following the $1.5 billion breach in February 2025. OKX responded to Zhou’s accusations by denying that any EU investigation was underway, accusing Bybit of spreading misinformation. The latest news from Malta’s FIAU also followed recent reports suggesting that OKX hired former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to advise it over the federal criminal investigation leading to its plea and a $505 million penalty payment in the U.S. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

""We are well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,"" said Fed Chair Jerome Powell in prepared remarks at the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing Annual Conference. ""It is too soon to say what will be the appropriate path for monetary policy."" Noting that the tariffs are ""significantly larger"" than expected, Powell said it's the Fed's job to make sure what is sure to be a temporary rise in inflation does not become persistent. Bouncing a bit ahead of the Powell speech perhaps in the hope he would take a more dovish stance, bitcoin (BTC) has retreated back below $83,000, roughly flat from 24 hours ago. The crypto is doing far better than stocks, with the Nasdaq now lower by 4.2% following yesterday's 6% tumble. President Trump makes his feelings known Minutes ahead of the Powell speech, the president threw down the gauntlet for the Fed chair.

The tokens, which are backed by physical gold and track its price, initially rallied as investors sought shelter from the uncertainty the tariffs introduced. Gold is usually seen as a haven investment, but large-scale losses in equity markets often force investors to liquidate safer assets to cover margin calls and cash out losses. PAXG climbed to an all-time high of $3,191 with XAUT following closely behind to reach $3,190, exceeding spot gold’s peak of $3,167. The initial rise didn’t last, with PAXG dropping to $3,074 and XAUT to $3,064, mirroring gold's pullback to $3,038 per ounce. The tariffs announced on Wednesday spooked markets with their breadth and unclear targets. Investors, already jittery from a volatile global outlook, responded swiftly. The S&P 500 posted one of its steepest drops since the COVID-era panic in 2020 on Thursday, while the Nasdaq 100 saw its worst single-day point loss in history according to the Kobeissi Letter. The rout extended into a second day, with the MSCI World Index dropping 4.3% on Friday after losing 3.7% on Thursday. Still, gold-backed tokens remain 17% higher since the start of the year. The rally has been driven by Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts, sustained demand from Asia and a wave of central bank buying earlier in the year. In February, central banks reported net gold purchases of 24 metric tons, according to the World Gold Council . Poland led the pack, adding 29 tons and bringing its total reserves to 480 tons, now 20% of its foreign exchange holdings. China, Turkey, Jordan, and Qatar also increased their holdings.",Markets|Gold|Paxg|Xaut|Stablecoins,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|XAUT|PAXG,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-04 15:44:56

In a post on X, Donald Trump accused Powell of “playing politics” and emphasized that lowering rates now could help improve the U.S. economy. Donald Trump’s calls for lower interest rates come amid rising concerns about his tariff policies. Donald Trump’s Criticism of Jerome Powell’s Timing Donald Trump’s call for a rate cut highlights his belief that the U.S. economy is currently in a favorable position to benefit from lower interest rates. According to Trump, energy prices, inflation, and even the cost of eggs have decreased, which he views as a sign that the economy is improving. “This would be a PERFECT time for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to cut Interest Rates,” Trump wrote on X. He also pointed out that Powell has been “late” in his previous decisions, suggesting that a quick rate cut could help Powell improve his image. Trump’s message comes as the U.S. labor market shows strong growth, with 228,000 jobs added in March, according to the latest employment data. This job growth, along with lower inflation, has fueled Trump’s argument for a rate cut, which he believes could further stimulate the economy. However, in response to Donald Trumps statement Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has noted that Trump’s tariffs could lead to slower economic growth and higher inflation. Powell stated that the full economic effects of the tariffs might be larger than expected, with concerns about stagflation.

Experts predict that the popular meme coin could soon fall below $0.10, as market momentum slows and profit-taking sets in. As DOGE struggles to maintain its gains, traders are flocking to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rising star in the decentralized finance (DeFi) market. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens are available in Phase 4 presale for $0.025 per token during the present phase. Phase 5 price will increase to $0.03 after the phase 4 finishes. Since its launch Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has collected $6.1 million through the investments of more than 7800 holders. Dogecoin Faces Uncertain Future Amid Market Shifts Dogecoin (DOGE) has seen impressive price action in the past, but its current position at $0.17 is raising concerns among investors. Market analysts warn that DOGE could slip below $0.10 as momentum slows and traders begin securing profits. Despite its strong community and historical resilience, DOGE’s long-term growth remains uncertain due to its lack of utility compared to emerging DeFi projects. As capital flows into newer ventures like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is gaining traction in its presale phase, DOGE may struggle to regain its former highs without renewed market enthusiasm or utility-driven adoption. Mutuum Finance: Transforming DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance has succeeded in attracting many investors through its attractive opportunity structure. Mutuum Finance introduces innovative financial services through its next-generation dual-lending approach which combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) smart contracts operate lending pools through the process of receiving USDT stablecoins to issue ETH asset-backed loans. Users maintain exclusive ownership of their confidential loan arrangements through the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system because it operates without requiring any intermediaries. Users can access maximum security and adaptive operations together with profit generation through current APY rates that reach up to 10% during liquidity provision. The platform prioritizes both security and transparency by having third-party examine all procedures and implementing open-source smart contracts to build user trust. The platform will stabilize its operations through introducing a stablecoin which backs USD value together with fee-supported token buyback procedures to maintain price stability over the duration. Stakeholders who can obtain staking rewards gain financial incentives for keeping their liquidity on the platform thus building stronger confidence throughout the system. The platform registers growing popularity because it has gained over 7800 investors. Exclusive Early Investment Opportunity Throughout the Phase 4 presale event people may purchase MUTM tokens at their initial value of $0.025. Throughout its 11-staged sale period the MUTM token price growth will expand from $0.025 to $0.06 to create up to 140% investor gains before trading commencement. Market experts predict that MUTM tokens will achieve a price of $3 after the launch becoming a leading DeFi token in 2025. The current MUTM capital now exceeds $6.1 million. $100,000 Giveaway & Community Incentives Mutuum Finance can achieve wider user adoption through its $100,000 prize giveaway structured to distribute $10,000 MUTM tokens each to ten users. Users able to draw new investors receive enhanced site value because the platform promotes customer interaction which leads to rising community expansion metrics. Dogecoin (DOGE) shows indicators of dropping below $0.10 because traders are modifying their positions towards the yet-to-rise DeFi project Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Current investors view DOGE at $0.17 unfavorably due to its insufficient utility value so they seek alternative investment options. The Phase 4 presale of MUTM currently operating at $0.025 has collected $6.1 million within 7,800 separate holder accounts. Phase 5 will bring a price increase to $0.03 while analysts predict DOGE will reach $3 after its launch. Members should lock in MUTM tokens right away because the token value will soon escalate to generate the best possible returns.

The U.S. stock market has shed a staggering $9.6 trillion in value since President Donald Trump’s second-term inauguration in January. Notably, $5 trillion of that decline occurred over the past two days, marking the largest two-day loss on record. The Nasdaq Composite index is on the verge of confirming a bear market, having fallen over 20% from its December 2024 peak of 20,173.89. Also, JPMorgan Chase now estimates a 60% probability of a U.S. economic recession. This sharp decline is largely attributed to investor concerns following Trump’s implementation of a sweeping 10% tariff on all U.S. imports, particularly affecting tech-heavy exporters like China, Taiwan, and Vietnam. In retaliation, China announced a 34% tariff on U.S. goods, further exacerbating market anxieties. Big tech hit hard Major technology companies have borne the brunt of these developments. Apple’s shares have declined 12.5% due to heightened tariffs on Chinese imports, while Tesla has seen a 37% drop, amid political controversies and declining sales. Other tech giants, including Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia, have also reported significant losses.

In his latest X analysis , network economist Timothy Peterson warned that Bitcoin may return to its 2021-era all-time high. $70,000 is Bitcoin’s “practical bottom” Bitcoin price expectations continue to deteriorate as the impact of “higher than expected” US trade tariffs hits home . For Peterson, the outlook now includes an uncomfortable trip down memory lane. “Bitcoin to $70k in 10 days?” he queried. An accompanying chart compared Bitcoin bear markets and included Peterson’s Lowest Price Forward (LPF) metric — a historically accurate yardstick for gauging long-term BTC price bottoms. “While this chart is not a prediction, it does provide data-driven expectations for what Bitcoin could do,” he continued. “If it continues to track along the 75th percentile bear market range, then 70k would be the practical bottom.” Bitcoin bear market comparison with LPF data. Source: Timothy Peterson/X Peterson noted that the theory ties in with current LPF data, which last month said that BTC/USD was 95% certain to preserve the 2021 highs as support. Prior to that, the metric successfully delivered a $10,000 price floor in mid-2020, with Bitcoin never again dropping below it after September that year. Continuing, Peterson revealed probabilities for April which showed BTC price expectations in a state of flux. “Bitcoin went from 75% chance of having a positive month to a 75% chance of having a negative month in just 2 days,” he summarized alongside another proprietary chart.

As noted by onchain analytics firm Glassnode, many traders are attempting to shield themselves from further crypto market turmoil. “Puts are trading at a premium to calls, signaling a spike in demand for downside protection. This skew is most pronounced in short-term maturities - a level of fear not seen since $BTC was in the $20Ks in mid-’23,” it revealed in an X thread on April 4. Bitcoin options delta skew.

That disconnect - rising panic without a price collapse - makes the current options market setup especially notable,” it continued. “Skew like this usually appears when positioning is one-sided and fear runs high. TLDR: panic is elevated, but price is holding. That’s often what a bottom looks like.” This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

42904388,https://blockworks.co/news/neon-machine-shrapnel-in-the-red,1743782769,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,Neon Machine’s Shrapnel is in the red: Sources,https://blockworks.co/news/neon-machine-shrapnel-in-the-red,"Just a few years ago, Shrapnel was expected to become the Call of Duty of crypto. It promised a vivid, sci-fi world — one I saw firsthand at the 2023 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. I got to play a very early demo of the game, where players on a small map had to locate weapons, take each other down and extract mineral-rich asteroid bits known as Shrapnel from the map. Yes, the game was laggy, had bugs and needed technical optimization. But back then, it truly felt like the beginning of an “AAA” gaming experience. Shrapnel had elements of Escape From Tarkov and Apex Legends — and was planning an optional “GameBridge” NFT ecosystem for players. Gunzilla Games’ Off The Grid , another extraction shooter with its own token using Avalanche, was at the time also comparable to Shrapnel. In October 2023, Shrapnel raised $20 million in Series A funding in a round led by Polychain Capital. Griffin Gaming Partners, Franklin Templeton, Brevan Howard Digital, IOSG Ventures and Tess Ventures also invested. At the time, Neon Machine had about 70 to 100 employees in total, with additional labor outsourced from Sperasoft and the underlying core of the game coming from IronBelly Studios, three sources familiar with Neon Machine’s business confirmed to Blockworks. Shrapnel was previously slated to launch in 2024. Where is it now? According to a Blockworks investigation, it’s millions of dollars in the red and with very few employees left after multiple rounds of layoffs. Financial troubles Multiple sources familiar with Shrapnel’s financials told Blockworks that Neon Machine has a slew of unpaid debts, owing millions to external vendors. The studio was trying to get its monthly burn rate or costs to under a million, but some months had a burn of $2 million to $3.5 million a month, sources — who requested anonymity due to the non-public nature of the company’s financials — said. The company has had a total operating expenses burn of $86.9 million since “the founding of the company,” according to an internal document viewed by Blockworks. Two sources called Neon Machine a “toxic, failing startup” and allege that the top executives who started the studio failed to develop a clear financial plan. They claim the studio is out of cash and that an expected early 2025 round of fresh funding that had been expected to close in February has failed. When asked about Shrapnel’s work environment, Neon Machine told Blockworks via email: “The work environment at Shrapnel fosters a culture of collaboration and innovation among individuals who have a mutual respect for each other’s talents and contributions. The employees at Shrapnel continue to drive towards success for the vision laid out when the company was founded.” An attempt to obtain funds may still be in the works. In an email dated April 2, Neon Machine CEO Kenneth Rosman told Blockworks: “We are in the late stages of a fundraising process which has a lot of momentum, and as a result requires us to be heads down for the next few weeks.” The company declined an interview but responded to questions via email. Rosman became Neon Machine’s CEO in December 2024. Financial documents reviewed by Blockworks suggest that Neon Machine saw a net loss of $11.4 million in 2024. Last year, it saw about $21.7 million in services revenue, but spent roughly $33 million in “operating expense burn.” 2023 was its best year in terms of revenue, but it did not go into the black that year, either. According to the documents, the firm has lost money every year since 2021. Another Neon Machine financial document included a company prediction that it would operate at a cash-on-hand deficit beginning in March 2025, “assuming no additional cash receipts” and have a deficit of over $13.5 million by the end of Q4 this year. Those factors may be the main reasons why the studio has conducted multiple rounds of layoffs. Neon Machine declined to comment on the company’s specific financials including its net losses, expenses, profits, burn rate and whether it currently owes money to external vendors. “As a privately held company, we do not disclose financial details—but we’re now in the strongest position we’ve been to date. With a clear path forward, we’re fully focused on the launch of SHRAPNEL and energized by the progress we’re making,” the company wrote. “We’re now in the best shape we’ve been [in],” Rosman assured me via email. Shrapnel has conducted at least three rounds of layoffs, with one occurring six months ago and the latest occurring in early March 2025, several sources told Blockworks. Staff were asked to remain quiet about the layoffs to avoid attracting attention to the company, according to the sources. But the few ex-employees who did post about leaving the company were neutral to positive in their public posts about their time there. Neon Machine had closer to 100 employees at its highest headcount, a source familiar with the company told Blockworks. By the end of Q1 2024, Neon Machine had 72 employees, 39 of which were working on Shrapnel, according to an internal document reviewed by Blockworks and multiple sources. But by the end of last year, there were a total of 32 employees working at Neon Machine — just 20 of them working on Shrapnel, the internal document and sources said. Sources also claim that roughly a dozen full-time staff remain in total across the company’s divisions, with very few actually developing Shrapnel itself. In response to a question about the layoffs, Neon Machine wrote: “Our team is intentionally lean and focused as we enter the most critical phase of bringing SHRAPNEL to market this year. While our headcount is currently smaller than previously reported, this is the result of strategic adjustments to ensure every resource is aligned toward the successful development and launch of the game. In earlier phases, we explored additional growth opportunities in areas like multimedia and infrastructure. Now, as we move full speed toward launch, we will operate with a core team of full-time employees, supported by world-class co-development partners who share our vision.” When asked specifically how many in-house engineers are working on Shrapnel right now, Neon Machine said: “Our team structure reflects what’s proven to work best for high-growth gaming startups: lean, focused, and built for agility. We prioritize hiring key department leads in-house to maintain strong alignment and ownership, while strategically outsourcing to stay nimble and efficient. We’re planning to expand in the coming months with a few key hires to support our next stage of growth.” Before the latest round of layoffs in March 2025, employees making more than $100,000 annually were told their salaries would be cut by roughly 20%, two sources said. Staff were asked to sign documents agreeing to those terms in February 2025, according to a copy of one of the agreements viewed by Blockworks. “Like many startups, we’ve occasionally made short-term adjustments to preserve momentum and stability. As part of our effort to extend runway and stay focused on delivering SHRAPNEL, we implemented a temporary, voluntary salary adjustment for higher-earning team members. This proactive decision was made to support the long-term health of the studio while we explored funding opportunities,” Neon Machine said. Neon Machine is no longer using its office space at Thinkspace in Seattle as of the end of last month. A Thinkspace spokesperson confirmed to Blockworks that the game studio had moved out. “Shrapnel will launch as a free-to-play, always-on game in 2025,” the Shrapnel team posted on its Medium blog in January 2025. The game had previously been slated for a 2024 release. But three sources familiar with the studio’s financials said they do not believe Shrapnel will launch worldwide this year — if ever — because the studio behind it has allegedly run out of cash and the game is not yet complete. “SHRAPNEL is planned for a simultaneous worldwide launch. Our goal is to launch before the end of 2025,” Neon Machine told Blockworks. The China pitch Neon Machine is planning to launch Shrapnel in China on the country’s real-world assets (RWA) Trusted Copyright Chain, entering a partnership with the Chinese government. Neon Machine announced the news on April 1 in a press release , confirming it was not an April Fool’s joke. The RWA chain is “where digital assets and IP rights are officially certified by government administrative bodies to enable true digital ownership for all citizens,” the release states. According to a source, internal company documentation explained that the move is a “For China, By China” pitch. Neon Machine is working with a handful of Chinese entities on the Chinese version of the game, including one called ZenHive, which was not mentioned in the press release. Neon Machine told Blockworks the deal with China does not mean the studio is selling the game to the Chinese government. “Neon Machine remains independent, and the launch of SHRAPNEL remains global. The partnership with China presents the opportunity for SHRAPNEL to attract a large user base from the region with the support and promotion of the government and local partners. SHRAPNEL is creating custom content (in-game assets such as Characters and Skins) for China which [sic] with a planned release in June, and the partnership will have a revenue share,” the company said. A confidential corporate document details the “responsibilities” for “Neon Machine (USA)” and the following entities: “Zenhive (China)” and “Argon (Panama).” In the deal, ZenHive is supposedly responsible for overseeing Shrapnel’s “marketing and sales funnel” in China. The entity will collect “bank gross sales revenue,” according to the internal document. Another entity, dubbed Argon, is based in Panama and is to pay Neon Machine’s “service invoices,” among other duties, including transferring taxes owed to China collected from the international marketplace to China. According to Neon Machine, Argon, or the Argon Protocol Foundation, is “the Foundation that is developing the Shrap Protocol and SHRAP Token, and has engaged Neon to help develop, market, and maintain the protocol and token.” ZenHive is also to “hold Argon’s rev share, pay Argon’s China co-dev partners, pay China taxes on gross sales,” and “transfer Argon’s rev share upon Argon invoice,” according to the document. Neon Machine is planning to hire co-development partners in China for its game launcher and for its “content” to help it develop Shrapnel, the document claims. Neon Machine’s job in the deal would be to “source and manage” these external vendors. Neon Machine itself is expected to deliver “Access Pack Concept Art and Codes” to ZenHive and deliver game assets for China to China pack buyers/wallets.” The public press release announcing the news states that the “Shrapnel team participated in a forum on ‘Web3 Gaming and International Digital Copyright Collaboration’ in Beijing with attendees including Wang Yefei, the Chairman of the Capital Copyright Association” recently. “The Beijing Copyright Bureau is a working department of Beijing Municipal People’s Government,” Neon Machine said when asked about the Capital Copyright Association. Shrapnel is also in discussions with the Lingjing People’s Game Lab regarding the game’s digital assets, according to a Medium post published on Tuesday. Lingjing Game Labs is a digital subsidiary of the Chinese state-run newspaper People’s Daily, which is operated by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The deal with China is a last-ditch effort to save the company, three sources familiar with the matter claimed. Two also noted the game’s team had begun designing those game assets for the Chinese market last year to help pitch the idea of a sale before the latest round of layoffs. Shrapnel’s X account responded to my post regarding the focus on China and away from the US market with: “We are focused on global markets, including the US market.” We are focused on global markets including the US market. Please reach out to us in a DM for any questions. — SHRAPNEL 🔺 (@playSHRAPNEL) April 1, 2025 Because China has restrictions on crypto , however — as well as on what types of violence can be depicted and the types of characters that can be played — the game will be “localized” for the Chinese market, per the press release. China also has strict rules on the amount of time minors can spend playing video games. In 2021, it established a rule limiting video game play time to one hour a day on Fridays, weekends and public holidays. “We cannot comment or speculate on the Chinese government’s involvement in crypto or gaming. Any game, regardless of technology, undergoes review by the Chinese regulatory authorities to ensure compliance. The use of a specific technology does not impact content regulations; we have no plans to alter the gameplay for any specific geography. As in the case of China, we will offer exciting and exclusive content (in-game assets, collaborations) for players in the region,” Neon Machine told Blockworks. Token troubles While Shrapnel’s finances have deteriorated, its token has fared far worse. SHRAP, the game’s Avalanche C-chain based ERC-20 asset, is down roughly 98% since CoinGecko began tracking it in November 2023. It peaked at around $0.43 and now trades at just $0.0066. Three billion SHRAP were generated on April 29, 2023 , according to the Shrapnel website. At this point, it’s unclear whether the token will ever be usable in the game, given the deal to build Shrapnel on China’s RWA blockchain. However, an Ava Labs spokesperson confirmed to Blockworks that Neon Machine still plans to continue development on its Avalanche L1. SHRAP selloff A wallet with an ENS name donnorbury.eth, which sources told Blockworks belongs to Shrapnel co-founder and ex-studio head Don Norbury, has sold approximately $672,000 worth of SHRAP since September. The sales occurred via token swaps into USDC ($266,954) and AVAX ($404,841) via MetaMask, according to public blockchain data compiled by Blockworks Research. Norbury’s LinkedIn identifies him as the chief technology officer of Shrapnel since December 2024. Roughly $200,000 of that was sold in October 2024, and another $200,000 worth of SHRAP was sold a month later in November. That wallet has ultimately sold thousands of dollars worth of SHRAP every month since September 2024, most recently selling about $25,000 worth in March and nearly $4,000 worth in the past week. In 2024, the team revised its token unlock schedule, according to a March 2024 Medium post , which spread out SHRAP unlock more over time. Tokens began to be unlocked for the team, advisors, seed token holders and strategic token holders on April 29, 2024 — 12 months after the token was launched. “While the community reward pool emissions and ecosystem fund unlocks are not changing, the number of remaining tokens unlocking in April 2024 is reduced by nearly 75%,” the Shrapnel team wrote in the Medium post. “The non-linear unlock divides the total unlock period of each pool into four epochs, beginning with a lower unlock rate, and accelerating with an increasing user base and increasing SHRAP utility. Existing unlocked SHRAP tokens remain unlocked.” Image from the Shrapnel white paper cited in the Medium post Based on Blockworks’ analysis, it is most likely that the SHRAP tokens sold by the Norbury address had been received from vesting and had not been paid for on the open market. Norbury did not respond to Blockworks’ multiple requests for comment by press time. Lengthy legal battles Shrapnel has also been the center of a multi-year lawsuit that began in 2023 over company funds involving its co-founders. 4D Factory, a controlling shareholder in Shrapnel, believed it was inadequately compensated by Neon Machine. But Neon Machine believed at the time that 4D was “raiding or attempting to raid” its coffers . Neon Machine has since told media outlets that the lawsuit has been settled. Details of the settlement have not previously been reported. On Feb. 14, a legal filing with the Southern District of New York proposed a settlement: “As a result of the settlement and the dismissal of all claims with prejudice, 4D also retains ownership of its 6 million shares of Neon Machine common stock.” The settlement, the details of which 4D’s attorneys confirmed to Blockworks, further noted that Neon Machine is expected to pay 4D $4.25 million in cash over the next 48 months. 4D is also expected to receive 150 million SHRAP in accordance with a vesting schedule. 150 million SHRAP is equal to about $767,500 at current prices, according to data from CoinGecko. ByBit is the largest market for SHRAP trading as of press time, with around $43,000 in daily trading volume. CoinGecko also puts the SHRAP circulating supply at about 40% of the total, with about 60% of tokens still unvested. This market data suggests that SHRAP is illiquid on public markets, making it difficult to exit in size due to potential slippage. Regarding the lawsuit’s settlement, Neon Machine told Blockworks: “We can confirm that it has since been approved by the court.” Blockworks reached out to both parties’ attorneys for comment. Attorneys for 4D factory also confirmed to Blockworks that the lawsuit has been settled and provided a statement from 4D’s founder, Cort Javarone. “4D Factory supported Shrapnel before it was even born, and we believe in it more than ever today,” Javarone told Blockworks in the statement. “We look forward to the game launching and exceeding everyone’s highest expectations.” Get the news in your inbox.

According to a recent Bloomberg report , Maltese authorities published a notice that informed the trading platform that it had failed to examine potential money laundering stemming from the products it offered to customers. As a result, the authorities ordered the exchange to pay €1.1 million, or more than $1.2 million. The notice followed onsite compliance examinations conducted by the FIAU in April 2023, during which several breaches of AML egulations were discovered. The watchdog described these violations as “serious” and “systematic,” particularly regarding the exchange’s Customer Risk Assessment procedures. “Moreover, the Company was found to have failed to carry out a CRA upon establishing a business relationship for around 50% of the customer files reviewed as part of the compliance examination,” stated the FIAU in a statement . Authorities also alleged that the crypto firm failed to properly monitor or follow up on cryptocurrency transactions conducted on its platform, transactions that amounted to more than $20 million in value. You might also like: Thai SEC files complaint against OKX for alleged regulatory violations A spokesperson for OKX told Bloomberg that the FIAU had acknowledged the platform’s “remedial action out of its own volition” in response to the penalty. However, the FIAU has not responded to a request for further comment. “Over the past two years, we have implemented a comprehensive compliance program, including technology upgrades, enhanced monitoring, and robust remediation efforts,” said the spokesperson. On Jan. 23, the crypto exchange secured a pre-authorization license under the Markets in Crypto-Assets or MiCA framework. With the license, OKX received full authorization to offer products and services to over 400 million users from its European hub in Malta. OKX’s recent legal troubles The penalty from Maltese authorities is just one of a string of legal and regulatory issues the exchange has faced in recent months. On March 31, the Thailand Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint against OKX for operating in the region without a license. Not only that, the financial watchdog also alleged that the exchange failed to adequately implement Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering protocols. If the accusations are proven true, the exchange could face legal penalties and Thai users will not be able to access the platform. Earlier in March, European regulators declared that it has begun investigating OKX after hackers allegedly used it to launder stolen funds from a hack on Bybit , which resulted in a loss of nearly $1.5 billion. In response, an OKX spokesperson denied all wrongdoing, stating that the accusations of the exchange’s involvement in money laundering “are inaccurate and preposterous.” A few days after the inquiry, OKX announced that it would be temporarily suspending its decentralized exchange aggregator service. The exchange stated that it had detected an attempted attack by North Korea’s Lazarus Group to “misuse our DeFi services.” Read more: Report: European watchdogs investigating OKX’s Web3 service over Bybit heist",News|AML|legal|Malta|OKX,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-04-04 16:09:47

The timing couldn’t be better. As AI adoption surges, this initiative might do more than help students through their finals; it could accelerate AI-driven innovation across Web3, especially in sectors like DeFi. One of the biggest standouts in this growing space? MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – a new AI agent coin that’s rapidly gaining traction. Access to AI Tools Fosters Innovation To unlock free access, students have to verify their status through SheerID, which works with university registrars to confirm enrollment. This may involve signing in through your college’s SSO or uploading additional official documents. OpenAI is positioning this as an attempt to ‘help you through the finals.’ However, the implications stretch far beyond your Economics 101 final, especially as AI becomes a powerful tool in new crypto investing and DeFi innovation. While some studies show that AI tools weaken students’ critical thinking skills , others argue that access to ChatGPT and similar tools inspires creativity, improves productivity, and enables new breakthroughs – particularly in decentralized technologies. In fact, in Q1 2025 alone, unique daily active wallets (DUAWs) interacting with AI protocols surged by 29% – even as DeFi’s Total Value Locked (TVL) dropped by 27%. Yup, that’s right: while the overall DeFi space struggled – with $ETH falling 37% and Sui down 44% – AI social apps and protocols defied the trend and showed positive DUAW addition. This shift in behavior shows that investors are looking beyond the usual suspects and turning toward smart, AI-integrated projects. And that’s where MIND of Pepe comes in.

42904577,https://coingape.com/?p=247380,1743783264,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"Machine Learning Reveals How High Shiba Inu Price Will Rally In April, Here’s The Target",https://coingape.com/machine-learning-reveals-how-high-shiba-inu-price-will-rally-in-april-heres-the-target/,"Leading on-chain metrics and price prediction firm CoinCodex has published a bullish forecast for Shiba Inu (SHIB) in April 2025. According to their machine learning algorithm, the popular meme coin could experience a notable price surge in the coming days. The prediction has surfaced despite its recent downward trend. The prediction comes at a time when SHIB is struggling with consistent price declines. Shiba Inu price has fallen 4.6% in the past 24 hours and 14.7% over the past week. Current on-chain data from IntoTheBlock shows predominantly bearish signals, with four bearish indicators, zero neutral, and zero bullish indicators. CoinCodex Shows Bullish Shiba Inu Price Targets CoinCodex’s machine learning algorithm has generated specific price targets for Shiba Inu in early April 2025. According to their forecast table, SHIB could reach $0.00002069 by April 4, a potential return on investment of 69.71% from its current price. The prediction gradually decreases over the following days, with targets of $0.00002045 (67.73% ROI) for April 5, $0.00001898 (55.62% ROI) for April 6, and $0.00001771 (45.24% ROI) for April 7. By April 8, the algorithm suggests a slight uptick to $0.00001772. This prediction would still mean a 45.32% increase from current prices. Source: CoinCodex These price predictions contrast sharply with SHIB’s current market performance. SHIB has been steadily negative across all timeframes. If these targets materialize, they would mean the first sustained positive movement for SHIB in months. Similar to CoinCodex, CoinGape’s SHIB price prediction highlights a 51% bullish outlook for the next three months. SHIB On-Chain Metrics Present Bearish Signals Current on-chain data from IntoTheBlock shows a bearish picture for Shiba Inu. The platform’s signal summary indicates “Mostly Bearish” conditions with four bearish indicators, zero neutral, and zero bullish signals. Looking at specific metrics, Net Network Growth is bearish at 0.19%, while the “In the Money” indicator shows a concerning -5.81%. This suggests that most recent transactions are occurring at a loss. Concentration indicators and large transaction metrics also register as bearish at -0.14% and 0.34% respectively. The token summary shows 62% of holders are currently out of profit, with only 35% in profit and 3% at breakeven. SHIB continues to be heavily concentrated, with 74% held by large holders. The token also maintains a relatively high correlation with Bitcoin at 0.76. This means that it follows broader market trends. Notably, 77% of SHIB holders have held their tokens for more than a year. As per the data, only 2% of the investors have been holding for less than a month. Analysis Points To Potential 14X Growth Some technical analysts are taking an extremely bullish stance on the SHIB price despite current market conditions. Crypto analyst ELITES shared a chart suggesting Shiba Inu could potentially achieve a “14X” return from current levels, stating: “Why Not a 14X for SHIB? We’re sitting in a strong buy zone, and a big move is coming soon!” Why Not a 14 X for SHIB? We're sitting in a strong buy zone, and a big move is coming soon! Are you ready? Tg : https://t.co/ngqIcEBSPx #SHIB $SHIB #Shiba $Shiba pic.twitter.com/vS752n9bpR — @CryptoELlTES (@CryptooELITES) April 3, 2025 The technical chart identifies several key SHIB price targets, including $0.00008171 (labeled as “1.0”) and $0.00018312 (labeled as “1.272”). These targets would represent massive gains from SHIB’s current trading price. The chart shows SHIB/USDT forming what appears to be a long-term bottoming pattern. The analyst has also identified the current level as a potential “Bottom” formation. This technical setup suggests the possibility of a major trend reversal if the pattern plays out as expected. Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that SHIB could rise in April 2025. This is because the price prediction is subject to changes, and SHIB is crashing daily. The markets are highly volatile, and macroeconomic factors could pull its price down.
