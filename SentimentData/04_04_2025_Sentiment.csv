This move follows similar withdrawals from Kentucky, Vermont, and South Carolina, signaling a potential shift in the regulatory landscape surrounding crypto staking in the United States. Is this the relief the crypto world has been waiting for? Let’s dive into what this means for Coinbase, the broader crypto market, and the future of crypto staking. Understanding the Coinbase Staking Lawsuit Saga For those unfamiliar, Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, offers a staking service that allows users to earn rewards on their crypto holdings. Staking, in simple terms, is like earning interest on your crypto. You commit your crypto assets to support the operations of a blockchain network, and in return, you receive rewards, often in the form of more of the same cryptocurrency. However, the legality of these services has been under scrutiny from various state regulators, leading to lawsuits like the one recently dropped by Illinois. These lawsuits generally revolve around whether crypto staking services should be classified as securities, which would bring them under stricter regulatory frameworks. Why is the Illinois Lawsuit Drop Significant for Crypto Staking? The decision by Illinois to drop the lawsuit is more than just a minor legal victory; it’s a potentially pivotal moment for the future of crypto staking in the US. Here’s why it matters: Precedent Setting: When multiple states like Kentucky, Vermont, South Carolina, and now Illinois drop similar lawsuits, it creates a pattern. This pattern can act as a precedent, making it harder for other states to pursue similar legal actions against Coinbase or other crypto platforms offering staking services. Positive Regulatory Signals: These withdrawals can be interpreted as a softening stance from state regulators on crypto staking. It might indicate a growing understanding, or at least a reassessment, of crypto services and a move towards more nuanced regulatory approaches rather than outright prohibition. Boost for Coinbase: For Coinbase, these dropped lawsuits are a clear win. The legal battles consume resources, create uncertainty, and can negatively impact public perception. Clearing these hurdles allows Coinbase to focus on its core business and continue offering its staking services with less regulatory pressure from these specific states. Market Confidence: Positive legal developments like these can boost overall market confidence in the crypto space. It reduces the fear of overly aggressive regulatory crackdowns and suggests a more constructive dialogue might be emerging between regulators and the crypto industry. Coinbase’s Stance: Staking is Not a Security Throughout these legal challenges, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Paul Grewal has consistently maintained that their staking services are not securities. This is a crucial point in the ongoing debate. The classification of crypto assets and related services as securities has significant regulatory implications. If staking is deemed a security, it would subject Coinbase and other providers to securities laws, requiring registration, disclosures, and potentially more stringent operational requirements. Coinbase’s argument, and the apparent shift in stance from some states, suggests a potential recognition that staking might not neatly fit the traditional definition of a security. The Broader Implications for Regulatory Clarity The withdrawal of these lawsuits contributes to a growing narrative around the need for regulatory clarity in the cryptocurrency space. For years, the lack of clear rules and guidelines has been a major impediment to the growth and mainstream adoption of crypto. Businesses struggle to operate in a legal gray area, and investors are hesitant due to uncertainty. Actions like these lawsuit drops, while not definitive policy statements, can be seen as steps towards a more defined and potentially more favorable regulatory environment. However, it’s important to note that this is a state-level development. Federal regulatory bodies like the SEC still hold significant influence, and the overall regulatory landscape remains complex and evolving. Illinois Lawsuit and its Context within State Regulations The Illinois lawsuit was part of a broader wave of state-level regulatory scrutiny targeting crypto staking services. Each state has its own securities laws and regulatory bodies, leading to a patchwork of regulations across the US. While the withdrawal in Illinois is positive, it doesn’t mean the issue is resolved nationwide. Here’s a look at the context: State Action on Coinbase Staking Status Illinois Lawsuit related to staking services Dropped Kentucky Similar lawsuit Dropped Vermont Similar lawsuit Dropped South Carolina Similar lawsuit Dropped Other States Ongoing regulatory discussions and potential actions Varying This table illustrates a trend, but it’s not a universal clearance. Other states may still have concerns or ongoing investigations. The crypto industry needs to continue engaging with regulators at both state and federal levels to advocate for clear and sensible rules. Navigating the Coinbase Legal Battle: What’s Next? While these dropped lawsuits are encouraging, Coinbase’s legal battle is likely far from over. The broader debate about crypto regulation in the US is ongoing, and various agencies are still formulating their approaches. Here are some key aspects to watch out for: SEC Scrutiny: The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) remains a major player in crypto regulation. Their stance on staking and other crypto services will be crucial in shaping the future landscape. Federal Legislation: There are ongoing efforts in the US Congress to create comprehensive crypto legislation. The outcome of these legislative efforts will have a profound impact on the industry. Global Regulatory Trends: The US is not alone in grappling with crypto regulation. Developments in other major economies will also influence the global regulatory environment and could indirectly affect US policy. Industry Advocacy: Continued advocacy from crypto companies and industry associations is essential to ensure that regulations are balanced, promote innovation, and protect consumers without stifling growth. Conclusion: A Sigh of Relief, But Continued Vigilance Needed The news of Illinois dropping the Coinbase staking lawsuit, following similar actions by other states, is undoubtedly a positive development for Coinbase and the crypto industry as a whole. It signals a potential easing of regulatory pressures at the state level and contributes to the ongoing quest for regulatory clarity . However, the journey towards a fully defined and stable regulatory environment for crypto is still underway. Stakeholders must remain vigilant, engage in constructive dialogue with regulators, and continue to advocate for policies that foster innovation while addressing legitimate concerns. This victory offers a moment of relief, but the broader Coinbase legal battle and the fight for sensible crypto regulation continues.

Despite today's market decline, some experts predict that BTC will rise to new highs before the end of the year. Bitwise’s Head of Research Ryan Rasmussen has confirmed the firm’s $200,000 year-end price target for Bitcoin, saying the recent market turbulence is merely a temporary setback. “Once the market recovers from this ‘Independence Day’ chaos, we will finally start to see the market pull back to the upside,” Rasmussen said. “We like to use the analogy that good news is dry powder stored for when this volatility and uncertainty eventually subsides.” Related News: Trump Imposed Heavy Tariffs: So What Will Happen to Bitcoin and Altcoins Now? Bitcoin’s correlation with the tech sector has strengthened in recent years, particularly as gold has reached record highs. But Rasmussen encouraged investors to take a broader view, noting that Bitcoin has outperformed gold, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq since Nov. 5. “We’ve had a great snowball of news over the last few months,” Rasmussen said, referring to the White House’s decision to create a Bitcoin reserve, regulatory changes and the increased involvement of sovereign wealth funds. “This market would have been at $150,000 by now if it weren’t for the fear of impending tariffs.” Rasmussen also noted that some of these tariffs could be rolled back and that he expects the Fed to cut rates later this year despite the current economic uncertainties surrounding trade and immigration policy. *This is not investment advice.

If you’ve been closely following the journey of Bitcoin ETFs and eagerly awaiting the next big leap, you’re in for a treat. Recent news suggests a potentially game-changing shift in how these investment vehicles operate, and it all centers around a concept called ‘in-kind redemptions’. Let’s dive into the heart of this story and explore what it could mean for the future of crypto investing. Why are BlackRock and SEC Discussing Crypto ETFs? As the cryptocurrency market matures, so does the demand for more accessible and regulated investment products. Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have emerged as a popular vehicle for investors to gain exposure to various assets, and crypto is no exception. BlackRock, a global investment management giant, has been at the forefront of this movement, actively engaging with regulatory bodies like the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) to refine and expand the offerings of crypto ETFs . This week, a delegation from BlackRock met with the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, according to a tweet by Eleanor Terrett, a well-regarded name in financial journalism. The core topic of discussion? Exploring the possibility of enabling ‘in-kind’ creation and redemption processes for their existing and future crypto ETFs. But what exactly does ‘in-kind’ mean, and why is it such a significant point of discussion? Decoding ‘In-Kind Redemption’ for Bitcoin ETFs To understand the significance of in-kind redemptions, let’s first clarify the standard creation and redemption process for ETFs, particularly Bitcoin ETFs . Creation Units: ETFs operate using a mechanism involving ‘creation units’. These are large blocks of ETF shares, typically created or redeemed by authorized participants (APs), which are usually large financial institutions. Cash Creation/Redemption (Current Model): Currently, many ETFs, including some crypto ETFs, use a ‘cash’ creation and redemption model. When an AP wants to create new ETF shares, they deliver cash equivalent to the value of the underlying assets (in this case, Bitcoin) to the ETF issuer. Conversely, when redeeming shares, APs receive cash. In-Kind Creation/Redemption (The Potential Shift): ‘In-kind’ redemption, on the other hand, means that instead of cash, APs would directly exchange the underlying assets – in this scenario, actual Bitcoin – when creating or redeeming ETF shares. Table: Cash vs. In-Kind Redemption Feature Cash Redemption In-Kind Redemption Asset Exchange Cash Underlying Asset (e.g., Bitcoin) Tax Implications Potential Capital Gains/Losses when selling assets to obtain cash Potentially more tax-efficient, deferring capital gains until the underlying asset is sold later Efficiency Simpler for some operations Potentially more efficient for managing underlying asset holdings and reducing transaction costs What are the Benefits of In-Kind Redemptions for Crypto ETFs? The shift towards in-kind redemptions for crypto ETFs , particularly BlackRock Bitcoin ETF , could unlock several advantages: Enhanced Efficiency: In-kind processes can streamline the creation and redemption mechanism. By directly exchanging Bitcoin, it reduces the need for APs to constantly convert between crypto and cash, potentially lowering transaction costs and operational complexities. Tax Advantages: For investors and APs, in-kind redemptions can be more tax-efficient. When using cash redemption, there might be taxable events triggered when APs sell the underlying Bitcoin to obtain cash for redemption. In-kind transfers could defer these capital gains until the actual Bitcoin is sold in the future. This is a significant draw for tax-conscious investors. Deeper Liquidity: By making the ETF mechanism more efficient and potentially cost-effective, in-kind redemptions could attract more authorized participants and institutional interest. This increased participation can lead to deeper liquidity in the ETF market, benefiting all investors through tighter bid-ask spreads and smoother trading. Closer Tracking of NAV: In-kind redemption can help ETFs track their Net Asset Value (NAV) more closely. Directly using the underlying asset in creation and redemption processes can minimize discrepancies that might arise from cash conversions and market fluctuations between the crypto and fiat markets. Challenges and Considerations for SEC Regulation While the benefits are compelling, enabling in-kind redemptions for crypto ETFs isn’t without its hurdles, particularly from a regulatory perspective. The SEC plays a crucial role in ensuring investor protection and market integrity. Here are some key considerations for SEC crypto regulation : Custody and Security: Handling in-kind redemptions means securely managing and transferring actual Bitcoin. The SEC will need to be confident that robust custody solutions and security protocols are in place to safeguard these digital assets throughout the creation and redemption process. Market Manipulation Concerns: Regulators need to be vigilant about potential market manipulation risks. They will assess how in-kind mechanisms could impact market surveillance and ensure fair pricing and trading practices are maintained. Valuation and Transparency: Accurate and transparent valuation of Bitcoin and the ETF units is paramount. The SEC will likely scrutinize the valuation methodologies used in in-kind transactions to ensure fairness and prevent any ambiguity. Regulatory Framework Clarity: Clear and consistent regulatory guidelines are essential for the widespread adoption of in-kind redemptions. The SEC’s engagement with BlackRock signals a potential step towards providing this much-needed clarity and adapting regulations to the evolving crypto landscape. Examples of In-Kind Redemptions in Traditional ETFs In-kind redemptions are not a novel concept in the broader ETF universe. They are commonly used in ETFs that track physical commodities (like gold ETFs) and even in some equity ETFs. For instance, many commodity ETFs allow authorized participants to create or redeem shares using the underlying commodity itself. This practice has been well-established and provides a framework that could be adapted for Bitcoin ETFs . The SEC can draw upon its experience regulating these existing in-kind ETF models to develop a suitable framework for crypto ETFs. Understanding the nuances of how in-kind works in other asset classes can provide valuable insights and best practices for navigating the regulatory landscape for digital assets. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? The discussions between BlackRock and the SEC regarding in-kind redemptions are a positive signal for the future of Bitcoin ETF approval and the broader crypto investment space. Here’s what you should consider: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on further developments regarding SEC regulations and ETF approvals. News about in-kind redemptions indicates progress and a potential shift towards more efficient and investor-friendly crypto products. Understand ETF Mechanics: Familiarize yourself with how ETFs work, including creation and redemption processes. Understanding in-kind vs. cash redemption will give you a deeper appreciation of the operational aspects and potential benefits of these investment vehicles. Consider Tax Implications: If in-kind redemptions become more prevalent, be mindful of the potential tax advantages. Consult with a financial advisor to understand how these changes might impact your investment strategy. Long-Term Growth Potential: The move towards in-kind redemptions suggests a maturing crypto ETF market. This could pave the way for greater institutional adoption, increased liquidity, and potentially contribute to the long-term growth and stability of the crypto asset class. Conclusion: A Promising Step Forward for Crypto ETFs The dialogue between BlackRock and the SEC about in-kind redemptions marks a significant and promising step forward for the evolution of crypto ETFs . While regulatory hurdles remain, these discussions signal a willingness to explore innovative mechanisms that could enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve the overall investor experience. As the crypto market continues to mature, such developments are crucial for fostering wider adoption and integrating digital assets into mainstream finance. The potential for in-kind redemptions is not just a technical detail; it’s a testament to the ongoing efforts to build a more robust, accessible, and investor-friendly crypto investment ecosystem.

The buzz is real, and the excitement is palpable as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially acknowledged the filing for a Solana ETF by none other than financial giant Fidelity. This is not just another headline; it’s a monumental step that could redefine how investors engage with Solana and the broader cryptocurrency market. Are you ready to dive into what this thrilling development means for you and the future of crypto investments? What is a Solana ETF and Why is it Potentially Revolutionary? First things first, let’s break down what a Solana ETF actually is. ETF stands for Exchange Traded Fund. In simple terms, it’s like a basket of securities that trades on an exchange, much like individual stocks. A Solana ETF, therefore, would be a fund that holds Solana tokens or derivatives, allowing investors to gain exposure to Solana without directly holding the cryptocurrency itself. Think of it as investing in gold through a gold ETF instead of storing gold bars at home. Why is this potentially revolutionary? Here’s why: Accessibility: ETFs are easily accessible to the average investor through traditional brokerage accounts. No need to navigate crypto exchanges, manage wallets, or worry about private keys. A Solana ETF would open the doors to Solana investment for a massive pool of investors who are comfortable with conventional investment vehicles. Regulation and Security: ETFs operate within a regulated framework, offering a layer of security and investor protection that some find reassuring, especially in the often-volatile crypto space. Having a Fidelity Solana ETF regulated by the SEC adds a significant layer of legitimacy and trust. Diversification (Indirectly): While a Solana ETF focuses on a single cryptocurrency, it diversifies the way investors can access this asset class. It can be part of a broader, diversified portfolio, blending traditional and digital assets. Mainstream Adoption: The approval of a Solana ETF could signal a major step towards mainstream adoption of Solana and cryptocurrencies in general. It sends a message that institutional players like Fidelity are taking crypto seriously, potentially encouraging wider acceptance and investment. Fidelity’s Bold Move: Championing a Fidelity Solana ETF Fidelity, a name synonymous with financial prowess and innovation, has thrown its hat in the ring, filing for a Fidelity Solana ETF . This isn’t Fidelity’s first foray into the crypto world; they’ve been gradually embracing digital assets, recognizing the growing investor interest and the transformative potential of blockchain technology. Their decision to pursue a Solana ETF is a strong endorsement of Solana as a significant player in the crypto ecosystem. Why is Fidelity’s involvement so crucial? Reputation and Trust: Fidelity is a well-established and respected financial institution with decades of experience. Their backing lends credibility to the Solana ETF and the underlying asset, Solana itself. Market Influence: Fidelity’s entry into the Solana ETF space could encourage other major financial institutions to follow suit, potentially leading to a wave of new crypto investment products. Investor Base: Fidelity has a massive existing client base. Offering a Fidelity Solana ETF provides these clients with a familiar and trusted avenue to invest in Solana. SEC Acknowledgment: Is the SEC ETF Filing a Green Light? The SEC acknowledging the filing is a crucial procedural step. It means the application is officially under review. However, it’s important to temper expectations. Acknowledgment is not an approval. The SEC will now rigorously examine the SEC ETF Filing , considering various factors including market surveillance, investor protection, and the nature of the underlying asset, Solana. What does the SEC’s review process typically involve? In-depth Analysis: The SEC will conduct a thorough analysis of the ETF’s structure, the underlying Solana market, and potential risks. Public Comments: The SEC often seeks public comments on proposed rule changes and filings, allowing stakeholders and the public to voice their opinions. Deliberation and Decision: After the review period, the SEC Commissioners will deliberate and vote on whether to approve or disapprove the ETF. The timeline for this process is uncertain. Previous crypto ETF applications have faced lengthy reviews and, in some cases, rejections. However, the fact that the SEC has acknowledged the filing for a Solana ETF is undoubtedly a positive signal. Why is This a Huge Deal for Crypto ETF Investment? The potential approval of a Crypto ETF Investment product focused on Solana is significant for several reasons. It signifies the maturing of the crypto market and the increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate investment assets. For years, Bitcoin ETFs were the holy grail, and now, the focus is expanding to include other major cryptocurrencies like Solana. Here’s why this is a big deal for the broader crypto ETF landscape: Diversification Beyond Bitcoin: For a long time, crypto ETFs were almost exclusively focused on Bitcoin. A Solana ETF opens the door for ETFs based on other cryptocurrencies, offering investors more diversified Crypto ETF Investment options. Broader Market Appeal: Solana is known for its speed and lower transaction costs compared to some other blockchains. A Solana ETF could attract investors who are interested in the technological advancements within the crypto space, not just Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative. Precedent Setting: If the SEC approves a Solana ETF, it could set a precedent for approving ETFs for other cryptocurrencies in the future, potentially leading to a diverse range of crypto investment products becoming available to mainstream investors. Potential Challenges and Roadblocks for Solana Investment via ETF Despite the excitement, it’s crucial to acknowledge that challenges and potential roadblocks remain for Solana Investment through an ETF. The crypto regulatory landscape is still evolving, and the SEC has historically been cautious about approving crypto-related investment products. What are some potential hurdles? Regulatory Scrutiny: The SEC will likely subject the Solana ETF application to intense scrutiny, focusing on market manipulation risks, custody solutions, and investor protection. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, including Solana, are known for their volatility. The SEC may be concerned about the risks associated with exposing mainstream investors to such volatile assets through an ETF. Custody and Security: Ensuring the secure custody of Solana tokens underlying the ETF is crucial. The SEC will want to be satisfied with the custody arrangements proposed by Fidelity. Market Maturity: While Solana is a major cryptocurrency, the market for Solana and its derivatives may be considered less mature than the Bitcoin market, which could raise concerns for regulators. What’s Next? The Approval Process and Keeping an Eye on Developments The SEC’s acknowledgment of the filing is just the beginning of a potentially lengthy process. Investors interested in a Solana Investment via ETF should closely monitor developments. Keep an eye out for: SEC announcements and updates: The SEC will likely issue updates on the review process and any decisions made. Industry news and analysis: Stay informed through reputable crypto news sources and financial analysts who are tracking the Solana ETF application. Fidelity’s communications: Fidelity may provide updates on the status of their ETF filing. The journey of a Solana ETF from filing to potential approval is a marathon, not a sprint. Patience and informed observation will be key for anyone following this exciting development. Conclusion: A Thrilling Step Forward for Solana and Crypto ETFs The SEC acknowledging Fidelity’s Solana ETF filing is undeniably a landmark moment for Solana and the broader cryptocurrency market. It represents a significant step towards mainstream adoption and offers a glimmer of hope for a more diversified and accessible crypto investment landscape. While challenges remain and approval is not guaranteed, this development is a powerful signal of the growing maturity and institutional interest in cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin. The prospect of a Solana ETF ignites excitement and anticipation within the crypto community and beyond, promising to reshape how investors interact with digital assets in the years to come. The future of crypto ETFs is looking brighter than ever, and Solana is poised to be at the forefront of this exciting evolution.

Today, @BankingGOP voted to advance the following nominations: Paul Atkins to lead @SECGov Jonathan Gould to lead @USOCC Luke Pettit to be Assistant Secretary @USTreasury Marc Molinaro to lead @FTA_DOT It's time for the Senate to confirm these well-qualified nominees. pic.twitter.com/tkVUpNTs2L — U.S. Senate Banking Committee GOP (@BankingGOP) April 3, 2025 “Paul Atkins, the former SEC Commissioner, will promote capital formation and provide much-needed clarity for digital assets,” Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC) said. “Under his leadership, the SEC will return to its core mission and will ensure our markets remain the envy of the world.” Paul Atkins and the SEC: A Shift in Direction However, some lawmakers voiced strong opposition to Atkins replacing former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized the nomination in an April 3 statement. “Mr. Atkins was dead wrong in the lead-up to the worst financial crisis in a generation and he has 20/0 hindsight about those mistakes,” she said. “He has spent his post-government career helping billionaire scammers like CEO Sam Bankman-Fried get even richer.” Paul Atkins began his career as a corporate lawyer and later co-chaired the Chamber of Digital Commerce’s Token Alliance. He has been viewed by some as a crypto-friendly candidate for the SEC role. Crypto Holdings and Past Affiliations Under Scrutiny Just last week, reports revealed that Paul Atkins currently holds nearly $6 million worth of digital assets . During a March 27 nomination hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, Senator John Kennedy questioned Atkins about Sam Bankman-Fried and his family’s potential financial ties to the failed FTX exchange. Atkins stated he was “concerned” about reports that Bankman-Fried’s parents and Stanford University may have profited from the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. With the Senate Banking Committee’s approval, Paul Atkins now awaits a full Senate vote to confirm his appointment as SEC Chair. If confirmed, his leadership would mark a departure from the SEC’s recent regulation-by-enforcement approach to digital assets under the Biden administration.

Similar decisions across states point to a reassessment of enforcement tactics in digital asset management. The change invites discussion on streamlining regulatory rules to foster a more unified national crypto framework. Illinois is preparing to drop its lawsuit against Coinbase over the exchange’s staking program, following the lead of three other U.S. states that have recently abandoned similar legal actions. A spokesperson for Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias confirmed the decision on April 3, but did not specify when the case would be officially dismissed. Illinois was one of ten states that sued Coinbase in 2023, alleging that the exchange had violated securities laws by offering staking services without proper registration. The case was part of a broader crackdown led by a multistate task force, which included regulators from Alabama, California, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin. Illinois Follows Other States in Dropping Coinbase Staking Case The legal battle over staking stems from concerns that Coinbase’s program, which allows users to earn rewards by locking up their crypto, operates without regulatory oversight. Regulators argued that Coinbase’s staking rewards program functioned as an unregistered securities offering, allowing the company to collect a share of staking profits before distributing the remainder to investors. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also sued Coinbase over its staking product, arguing it constituted an unregistered securities offering. However, the SEC dropped its case in February . SCOOP: The Illinois Secretary of State intends to drop its staking lawsuit against @coinbase , joining Kentucky, South Carolina and Vermont in backing down from litigation against the crypto exchange. @cheyenneligon reports https://t.co/f71kAbYrMm — CoinDesk (@CoinDesk) April 3, 2025 Since then, Kentucky , Vermont , and South Carolina have all moved to dismiss their lawsuits against the exchange. Despite these developments, not all states have backed down. A representative for the New Jersey Bureau of Securities confirmed that its case against Coinbase remains open, while Washington State’s securities administrator, Bill Beatty, said its case is still ongoing. The original lawsuit against Coinbase raised concerns that staking rewards accounts were not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), leaving investors unprotected from potential losses. Regulators in Alabama had initially ordered Coinbase to justify why it should not be forced to stop offering its staking services. Despite the legal challenges, Coinbase has maintained that its staking services do not constitute securities and has continued to oppose regulatory claims. With Illinois now set to drop its case, the pressure on Coinbase’s staking program appears to be easing, though ongoing cases in states like Washington and New Jersey suggest the legal battle is not yet over. Kentucky Drops Coinbase Staking Lawsuit, Signaling Shift in State-Level Crypto Policies Kentuck’y Department of Financial Institutions filed the joint dismissal with Coinbase on April 1 to drop its lawsuit , ending the legal battle nearly a year after joining 10 other state regulators in accusing the exchange of violating securities laws. Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, acknowledged the decision and urged Congress to replace the current “state-by-state” legal battles with clear federal regulations. Seven states, including Alabama, California,Maryland, New Jersey, Washington, and Wisconsin, are still pursuing cases against Coinbase. Meanwhile, Illinois has shifted its focus to Bitcoin adoption. The state is advancing a Bitcoin strategic reserve bill ( HB1844 ), which proposes creating a dedicated fund to hold Bitcoin as a financial asset for at least five years. Representative John Cabello introduced the bill, which follows Arizona’s push to allow public funds and pensions to invest in Bitcoin. As regulatory battles continue, Illinois’ pivot signals growing state-level interest in Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What broader trends does this shift suggest? Regulators moving away from state-specific crypto lawsuits indicates a trend toward unified oversight. The shift promotes aligned rules that better manage digital asset risks while enhancing market clarity overall. How might the legal easing impact investor trust? Easing legal pressures could increase investor trust in crypto services. With fewer state disputes, users may enjoy steadier offerings and a clearer compliance framework that reassures market participants. What future changes could result from dropping state lawsuits? This change could lead to more consistent legal frameworks that support market innovation and consumer safeguards statewide.

PEPE continues to thrive off its meme popularity, but Dragoin is stepping into the spotlight with a deeper offering—a working ecosystem, actual use cases, and a presale structure designed to reward early backers. As Dragoin enters public sale at $0.0000292, those aiming for longer-term growth are starting to shift from hype-heavy coins to meme coins that offer stronger functionality like Dragoin. While PEPE gained massive traction in 2023 based on its meme status and technical patterns, it has since entered a sharp downturn, currently over 74% below its peak. Dragoin, on the other hand, is still early in its journey and is building momentum fast. Here’s why Dragoin is quickly gaining attention as one of the more practical meme-themed cryptos of 2025. Public Sale Begins at $0.0000292: A Strong Early Entry Point Many meme coins tend to gain value after launch, but Dragoin takes a different route by offering real value from the beginning. Stage 1 of the public sale is now live at $0.0000292. The launch price will be $0.002, meaning early entries could see an approximate 6,700% return. Dragoin’s supply and pricing are designed to reward early action. The sale will unfold in 25 different stages, each bringing a higher price. To reduce excess supply, any unsold tokens will be permanently burned, reducing circulation and encouraging scarcity. This system pushes quicker participation and adds a deflationary mechanism not found in PEPE. Even though PEPE has a large base of holders, Dragoin brings a new dimension—a live Telegram game where users control dragons, earn rewards, and compete in a fantasy setup. This combination of meme energy, engaging gameplay, and limited supply is making Dragoin a strong project to watch this year. Utility and Engagement Give Dragoin the Advantage Dragoin goes beyond viral content by offering a reason for users to stay involved. The Telegram game is already functional, giving users the ability to dodge obstacles and collect $DDGN tokens in real-time. It’s one of the rare meme-themed coins to offer a playable game before exchange listings. PEPE, in contrast, continues to rely on social status and meme-driven appeal. While it does have a supportive community, it doesn’t offer interactive experiences that many backers now look for. Dragoin plans to roll out listings on both DEX and CEX platforms and expand its game later in 2025. This planned growth adds staying power to its appeal. Long-Term Token Structure Sets Dragoin Apart Dragoin’s supply is set at 200 billion tokens, with half (100 billion) going into presale. Liquidity will be locked, and the team tokens will follow a two-year vesting plan—helping build user confidence. With each stage of the presale, the price rises, giving those who buy early a stronger edge. This method contrasts with PEPE’s current model, which remains more vulnerable to price swings and concentrated control. PEPE’s top 20 addresses own around 50% of its tokens, which shows a somewhat even spread. However, Dragoin’s phase-based rollout and focus on fair distribution improve accessibility and reduce imbalance from the beginning. Meme Coin Interest Follows Social Activity Trends Social presence plays a huge role in meme coin success. During PEPE’s run in 2023, a spike in mentions on platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Telegram drove prices up fast. But when the talk dies down, so does the price—and PEPE has recently seen reduced online interest. Dragoin, on the other hand, is seeing a rise in social mentions. With the sale live and the game actively running, excitement is increasing across platforms. Historically, rising social activity often hints at coming price growth, especially when linked with real use, as is the case with Dragoin. Also, fantasy themes like dragons and online storytelling already have strong fan bases. Combining that with meme trends gives Dragoin a strong position to build on. As prices rise with each sale stage, this growing buzz is likely to continue. What Makes Dragoin a Better Choice Than PEPE in 2025 PEPE continues to hold attention in the meme coin scene, but its strength lies in its past viral success. Those looking for the next step in meme crypto are turning their eyes to Dragoin for its utility, structure, and future plans. Here’s how the comparison breaks down: PEPE depends mainly on meme strength and community attention. Dragoin offers storytelling, limited supply, real-time gameplay, and early purchase benefits for better long-term value. Now that the public sale is open, the $0.0000292 entry point, along with a functioning ecosystem, gives Dragoin a head start before broader awareness kicks in. Final Remarks! Meme-themed coins often come with high ups and downs, but those that mix entertainment with purpose tend to last. Dragoin fits that model. With rising social discussion, an active game, and built-in token burning, the shift in momentum is clearly moving its way. Instead of watching it grow from afar, this might be the time to get into $DDGN during Stage 1—before it begins gaining broader attention.

Amidst the market downturn, technical indicators suggest that Dogecoin could be setting the stage for an explosive rally, with analysts predicting a 270% surge to a new price high. Dogecoin Price Prepares For 270% Surge A Dogecoin price chart shared by crypto analyst Javon Marks reveals a critical shift in momentum. Following a prolonged downtrend that saw the meme coin’s price crash to significant lows, Dogecoin has now broken out of a descending trendline, signaling the potential end of its bear cycle. Related Reading: Cardano Price Could Be Set For 100% Rally As This Bullish Triangle Has Formed On The Daily Timeframe Since reaching a cycle low, Dogecoin has consistently posted higher lows — a common sign of growing buying pressure and a steady uptrend. Following the formation of its latest higher low, Marks believes that DOGE is now positioned in a bullish set-up. Historically, similar patterns have preceded parabolic moves in the Dogecoin price, suggesting that the meme coin could be gearing up for an uptrend continuation. According to Marks‘ analysis, if Dogecoin follows the established trend, the next impulsive wave could push its price to $0.653, marking an explosive 270% surge. While past higher low formations support the likelihood of the analyst’s projected rally, Dogecoin’s recent breakout from the descending trendline reinforces its bullish structure. Marks also suggests that a climb to the $0.63 level could serve as a launchpad for Dogecoin, potentially driving its price even higher to $1.25 if its momentum persists. Despite the ongoing market volatility, DOGE continues to hold key support levels as it eyes a fresh breakout. Notably, a surge to the $1.25 target would mark an impressive 681.25% increase from the meme coin’s current market value of $0.16. DOGE Faces Make Or Break Level According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the Dogecoin price is currently at a make-or-break point, meaning that its next move could determine whether it sees a significant breakout or a sharp decline. Sharing a price chart highlighting Fibonacci retracements and trend channels, the analyst revealed that Dogecoin is sitting on a key ascending trendline that has acted as support since 2018. Related Reading: Pundit Gives Dogecoin Price 30-40% Chance Of Crash To $0.165 As RSI Enters Oversold Levels This trend line aligns with the 0.796 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.16, marking it a crucial support zone. If Dogecoin holds above this level, it could trigger a bullish continuation, with the next major Fibonacci extension level at $0.57. Surpassing this price mark could also propel Dogecoin to the 1.272 Fib at $2.77. On the flip side, if Dogecoin breaks below $0.16, the next major support lies around the 0.618 Fib at $0.06. The analyst’s chart also highlights a possible breakdown to $0.0066 or even as low as $0.0016 if bearish momentum persists.

Hidden Road, a prominent player known for its crypto-friendly approach, is reportedly engaged in acquisition talks with a crypto-native firm. This intriguing development, first brought to light by CoinDesk, has sent ripples through the industry, raising questions about the future of Hidden Road and the broader implications for institutional investment in digital assets. Why is the Potential Crypto Acquisition of Hidden Road a Big Deal? The news of a potential crypto acquisition of Hidden Road is significant for several reasons. Firstly, Hidden Road has quickly established itself as a key prime broker in the cryptocurrency space. Prime brokers play a crucial role in traditional finance, offering services like securities lending, margin financing, and trade execution to institutional clients. In the burgeoning crypto market, these services are equally vital for institutional investors looking to navigate the complexities of digital assets. Hidden Road’s focus on serving institutional clients makes this acquisition particularly noteworthy. Secondly, the fact that a “crypto-native firm” is making the acquisition offer signals a growing maturity and consolidation within the crypto industry. As the market evolves, we are witnessing established crypto companies seeking to expand their reach and service offerings through strategic acquisitions. This trend underscores the increasing institutionalization of crypto and the desire of established players to capture a larger share of the market. The identity of the crypto firm remains undisclosed, adding an element of suspense to this unfolding story. Let’s break down why Hidden Road’s position makes this news so compelling: Institutional Focus: Hidden Road specifically targets institutional investors, a segment that is increasingly important for the sustained growth of the crypto market. Prime Brokerage Services: As a prime broker , Hidden Road provides essential infrastructure for institutions to trade and manage crypto assets efficiently. Recent Funding: Having reportedly raised $50 million in the past year, including from Dragonfly Capital, Hidden Road is not a struggling entity, making the acquisition offer even more noteworthy. Unpacking the Hidden Road Story: Dragonfly Capital and Institutional Investment The report mentions that Hidden Road secured approximately $50 million in funding over the last year from investors, including the well-known crypto venture capital firm, Dragonfly Capital . This detail adds another layer of intrigue to the acquisition talks. It is speculated that one of these investors might be the entity behind the acquisition offer. Dragonfly Capital’s involvement suggests strong backing and belief in Hidden Road’s potential. If an investor is indeed making the acquisition move, it could indicate a strategic decision to further capitalize on their initial investment and integrate Hidden Road’s services more deeply within their ecosystem. Consider these key aspects related to institutional investment and Dragonfly Capital’s role: Aspect Details Dragonfly Capital’s Reputation A prominent crypto VC firm known for backing successful crypto projects. Their investment in Hidden Road lends credibility to the platform. Investor Acquisition The possibility of an investor-led acquisition suggests a strong strategic alignment and potentially a desire to accelerate growth or integration. $50 Million Funding Highlights the significant capital already invested in Hidden Road, making an acquisition a substantial move. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Prime Brokerage? The potential acquisition of Hidden Road comes at a pivotal time for the prime broker sector in the cryptocurrency industry. As institutional interest in crypto continues to grow, the demand for robust and reliable prime brokerage services is also on the rise. An acquisition of this nature could lead to several potential outcomes: Market Consolidation: It could signal the beginning of a consolidation phase within the crypto prime brokerage space, with larger firms absorbing smaller, specialized players. Service Expansion: The acquiring firm might seek to integrate Hidden Road’s prime brokerage capabilities to broaden its service offerings and cater to institutional clients more comprehensively. Increased Competition: Alternatively, the acquisition could intensify competition if the combined entity becomes a more formidable player, challenging existing prime brokers. However, it is crucial to remember that these are still just acquisition talks. There is no guarantee that the deal will materialize. Negotiations can be complex, and various factors can influence the final outcome. The crypto market itself is known for its volatility and rapid changes, which can further complicate such deals. Navigating the Uncertainties of Crypto Acquisitions: Key Takeaways The situation with Hidden Road serves as a reminder of the dynamic and evolving nature of the cryptocurrency industry. Crypto acquisitions , like this potential deal, are becoming increasingly common as the market matures. For industry participants and observers, here are some key takeaways: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on developments in this acquisition story and similar deals within the crypto space. Market Trends: Pay attention to the broader trends of institutional investment and consolidation in the crypto market. Prime Brokerage Evolution: Understand the growing importance of prime brokerage services and how acquisitions might shape this sector. Due Diligence: For companies considering acquisitions, thorough due diligence and strategic alignment are crucial for success. While the future of Hidden Road remains uncertain pending the outcome of these acquisition talks, one thing is clear: this development underscores the increasing maturity and sophistication of the cryptocurrency market. The potential acquisition is a testament to the growing value and strategic importance of crypto prime brokers in facilitating institutional participation in digital assets. As the story unfolds, the crypto world will be watching closely to see if this hidden road leads to a new chapter for both Hidden Road and the acquiring crypto firm.

Forced Bitcoin liquidation shows vulnerabilities in corporate crypto reserves, challenging the viability of Bitcoin-first treasury strategies amid regulatory uncertainties. This case highlights the risks of cross-jurisdictional legal conflicts, where U.S. court actions threaten foreign companies’ ability to comply with local laws and governance structures. A New York court barred Genius Group from selling shares, raising funds, or using investor money to buy Bitcoin on April 3, forcing the company to liquidate parts of its Bitcoin Treasury to sustain operations. The ruling, issued by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), follows an ongoing legal dispute involving the education and AI-focused company. Court Blocks Genius Group from Raising Funds, Forces Bitcoin Treasury Sale Genius Group, which trades on the NYSE American under the ticker GNS, has been entangled in legal battles stemming from its attempt to terminate an asset purchase agreement with Fatbrain AI (LZGI). The dispute escalated when LZGI shareholders filed lawsuits alleging fraud against the company’s executives, Michael Moe and Peter Ritz. The SEC also launched a case related to shareholder fraud. On February 14, 2025, Moe and Ritz sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to prevent Genius from selling shares or using funds from its $150 million at-the-market (ATM) offering to buy Bitcoin. Genius Group has been blocked by the US District Court Southern District of New York from selling shares or raising funds, and specifically banned from buying Bitcoin, in direct opposition to the wishes and approvals of the Company's board and shareholders. We will keep fighting… pic.twitter.com/Lk6uXzfCx6 — Roger James Hamilton (@rogerhamilton) April 3, 2025 The court granted the injunction on March 13, effectively freezing the company’s ability to issue shares and raise capital. In response, Genius Group has filed multiple motions contesting the ruling, arguing that the injunction disrupts the status quo and was secured through false claims. The company also submitted a transcript of a meeting with Ritz, recorded in New York on February 27, in which he allegedly described a strategy to exploit the legal process to extract money from Genius. The transcript hasbeen included in a separate lawsuit against LZGI and its executives in a Florida court as well. As a result of the court order, Genius Group has been forced to sell portions of its Bitcoin holdings, reducing its treasury from 440 BTC to 430 BTC. The company has warned that further sales may be necessary if the injunction remains in place. The restrictions have also prevented Genius from issuing share-based compensation to employees, putting it at odds with Singaporean employment laws. The company has filed an emergency appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, seeking to overturn the injunction. At the same time, it is restructuring operations, cutting marketing expenses, closing divisions, and canceling event sponsorships to conserve resources. CEO Roger James Hamilton criticized the court’s intervention, stating, “We never dreamed that a U.S. court could block the company from issuing shares, raising funds, or buying Bitcoin—decisions that should be made by shareholders or the board, not the courts.” Genius Group’s Market Cap Falls Below Bitcoin Holdings Amid Court Battle Since the temporary restraining order was issued in February, Genius Group’s stock price has dropped 53%, from $0.47 to $0.22. The company’s market capitalization now stands at just 40% of the value of its Bitcoin holdings, raising concerns about its ability to continue operations. Source: YahooFinance Meanwhile, Hamilton reaffirmed the company’s commitment to Bitcoin, stating, “We will continue to fly the flag for Bitcoin, even when legally banned from building our Bitcoin Treasury.” Despite the court banning Genius Group from trading stocks and holding Bitcoin, the Singapore-based AI and education firm has been aggressively accumulating BTC. The company now holds 430BTC, worth $46 million, while its market cap is $33.1 million. Genius has spent $42 million acquiring Bitcoin, mirroring MicroStrategy’s treasury strategy . In just four months, it has allocated $40 million to BTC and plans to push that to $120 million using reserves, loans, and an ATM facility. As it stands now, with regulatory pressure mounting, the company’s Bitcoin-first approach faces an uncertain future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How does the court ruling highlight risks for foreign companies listed in the U.S.? It shows the vulnerability of international firms to U.S. legal actions, where court rulings can severely disrupt company operations regardless of home-country governance. Could this case transform corporate treasury strategies? Yes, it may push companies to diversify reserves beyond Bitcoin, balancing liquidity and regulatory risks to safeguard operational stability. What does this mean for Bitcoin’s role in corporate finance? The forced liquidation demonstrates how external legal pressures can compromise Bitcoin-first strategies, raising questions about its reliability as a primary reserve asset. What lessons can other crypto-focused firms learn from this situation? They should prioritize robust legal frameworks and contingency plans to mitigate risks from regulatory and judicial interventions.

42872315,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146234,1743721823,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Data Center Shift: Microsoft Rethinks Global Cloud Expansion,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/microsoft-data-center-cloud-rethink/,"In a surprising turn of events that has the tech world buzzing, particularly those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space who rely heavily on robust cloud infrastructure, reports indicate that Microsoft is pumping the brakes on its ambitious global data center expansion plans. This news, arriving fresh from Bloomberg, suggests a potential recalibration of strategy at the tech giant, leaving many to wonder about the future trajectory of cloud computing and the infrastructure that powers the digital age. Why is Microsoft Reconsidering its Data Center Strategy? According to the Bloomberg report, Microsoft has either halted discussions or delayed development for numerous data center sites across key global locations, including the U.K., Australia, North Dakota, Wisconsin, and Illinois. This pullback comes as a bit of a surprise, especially considering Microsoft’s previously stated commitment to invest heavily in capital expenditures, with a significant portion earmarked for AI infrastructure and related data center expansions in 2025. A Microsoft spokesperson offered a statement to Bloomberg, suggesting that these adjustments reflect the inherent flexibility built into their long-term planning. They emphasized that plans are made years in advance and that these changes are simply a demonstration of strategic agility. However, this explanation raises more questions than answers. Is this a temporary adjustment due to unforeseen challenges, or a more profound shift in Microsoft’s long-term vision for its cloud computing empire? Potential Factors Behind the Data Center Slowdown Several factors could be contributing to Microsoft’s reported pullback. Bloomberg highlights two primary possibilities: Diminished Demand Expectations? Could Microsoft be anticipating a slowdown in demand for cloud computing services? While the cloud market continues to grow, economic uncertainties and shifting business priorities could be influencing future projections. However, with the explosion of AI applications, demand for powerful computing resources would seem to be on an upward trajectory, making this explanation somewhat perplexing. Construction and Resource Challenges: The other potential factor is related to more immediate, practical hurdles. Shortages of power and building materials are real-world constraints impacting construction projects globally. Building and equipping data centers is a massive undertaking, and supply chain disruptions could certainly cause delays and necessitate strategic adjustments. This explanation aligns with Microsoft’s previous statement about shifting focus from new construction to optimizing existing facilities. Microsoft’s AI Ambitions and Data Center Implications Adding another layer of complexity is Microsoft’s aggressive push into Artificial Intelligence. The company has been vocal about its commitment to AI, investing billions in OpenAI and integrating AI across its product suite. AI, especially generative AI and large language models, demands immense computational power, requiring specialized data centers optimized for these workloads. It’s worth remembering that just recently, in February, Microsoft reaffirmed its intention to allocate over $80 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, primarily targeting AI data centers . This commitment underscores the strategic importance of infrastructure in Microsoft’s AI-driven future. Therefore, the current reports of a data center pullback seem contradictory to their stated AI ambitions. What Does This Mean for the Future of Cloud Computing and AI? Microsoft’s actions, as one of the giants in cloud computing , inevitably send ripples across the entire technology landscape. Here’s what this potential shift could signify: Strategic Realignment, Not Retreat: It’s crucial to avoid jumping to conclusions. This might not be a complete abandonment of expansion plans but rather a strategic realignment. Microsoft could be prioritizing efficiency, optimizing existing infrastructure, and focusing investments on the most critical areas, particularly those supporting AI.

Whether it’s PayPal rolling out Chainlink access or tokenized stocks shaking up traditional finance thanks to Ondo, there’s no shortage of big moves happening across the blockchain space. With mainstream platforms jumping into the game and legacy financial models getting disrupted, the hunt for the next big crypto just got a whole lot more real. While all eyes are glued to these headlines, Qubetics ($TICS) is busy building something next-level—something that actually solves real digital privacy problems instead of just repackaging old ideas. It’s offering tools people actually need, like a decentralized VPN powered by blockchain, and its token presale is creating waves that are too loud to ignore. The next big crypto might not just be the one with the most hype—but the one actually offering innovation and utility with serious growth potential. Qubetics’ dVPN: Privacy Without Compromise—The Real-World Fix You’ve Been Waiting For Privacy in today’s digital world feels more like an illusion, especially when traditional VPNs can log and leak user data. Qubetics is flipping that script. Its decentralized VPN (dVPN) runs on a peer-to-peer model where no central authority exists to monitor or restrict traffic. That means you’re not just masking your IP—you’re stepping into a fully secure, censorship-resistant network. This is where blockchain isn’t just a buzzword; it’s the backbone. Picture this: a remote journalist in a restricted region can now safely communicate with sources without risking exposure. Or a fintech startup dealing with confidential transactions gets full end-to-end encryption across all internal comms. That’s what the Qubetics dVPN unlocks. This isn’t just tech talk—it’s real protection for real people. No wonder it’s being watched as the next big crypto that could genuinely reset how we think about secure digital access. Qubetics Presale: The Next Big Crypto Opportunity That’s Heating Up Fast Right now, Qubetics is in its 28th presale stage, and the token is priced at $0.1430. Over $15.8 million has already been raised, with 506 million $TICS tokens sold and a thriving community of 24,300+ token holders. Each stage only lasts 7 days, and when that week wraps on Sunday at midnight, the price jumps by 10%. These limited windows have added urgency—and yeah, people are noticing. Now let’s talk ROI. If $TICS hits just $1, you’re looking at a 599.21% return. At $5, that spikes to 3,396.06%, and if it climbs to $15, early adopters could be sitting on an insane 10,388.18% ROI. A simple $100 investment today? That could become $699 at $1 or as much as $10,485 at $15. These numbers aren’t pulled from the sky—they’re based on solid projections from the current stage. It’s no wonder people are calling this Qubetics presale the best crypto presale of the year and watching it as the next big crypto breakout of 2025. Ondo Is Unleashing the Tokenized Stocks Era—and Wall Street Should Be Nervous According to 99Bitcoins, Ondo is shaking things up by introducing tokenized stocks, and it’s not just a passing trend. Experts are calling tokenized equities a “sleeping mammoth,” and Ondo is leading the charge by bringing traditional stock ownership into the Web3 era. These tokenized shares can be bought in fractional units, traded 24/7, and accessed globally—things Wall Street’s been way too slow to offer. The impact? Massive. Ondo is positioning itself as a bridge between outdated financial systems and the modern, always-on digital economy. The move has sparked renewed attention in how equity ownership is handled and could easily make Ondo the go-to platform for those wanting the convenience of crypto without letting go of real-world asset exposure. As the financial world keeps moving toward decentralization, Ondo might just be the pressure point that forces traditional finance to evolve—or risk getting left behind. Chainlink Gets a Major Boost as PayPal Adds It to the Crypto Lineup Chainlink just got a serious visibility upgrade thanks to PayPal. As reported by TronWeekly, the payments giant has now integrated Chainlink (LINK) into its digital asset offerings for U.S. users. That’s a huge move, signaling that major payment platforms are now embracing decentralized oracle networks as core components of their crypto strategy. Following the announcement, Chainlink’s value climbed 2.5%, a strong indicator of renewed market interest. The integration means Chainlink’s role in providing secure, real-world data to smart contracts is gaining traction with mainstream users—something that’s been years in the making. PayPal is already exploring Web3-compatible solutions and stablecoin integration, and now with Chainlink in the mix, they’re doubling down on making decentralized finance accessible to their massive user base. It’s a win not just for LINK but for the broader adoption of decentralized infrastructure in the U.S. financial landscape. The Final Verdict: A Trio of Titans in the Race for Crypto’s Future There’s no denying the momentum behind these three power players. Qubetics is making internet privacy real again with a decentralized VPN that actually works for everyday users and enterprises. Ondo is transforming how people think about stock ownership with its tokenized equities, and Chainlink is securing a front-row seat in mainstream finance through its game-changing integration with PayPal.

42872564,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146238,1743722419,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unlock AI Coding Power: Devin AI Unveils Affordable Pay-As-You-Go Plan,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/devin-ai-pay-as-you-go/,"The buzz around AI-powered coding assistants is deafening, and at the forefront of this revolution is Devin AI. Remember the viral sensation that promised to automate software development? Well, Devin, from the startup Cognition, is back with a twist that could make it more accessible to developers everywhere – a new pay-as-you-go plan. For those in the crypto and blockchain space, constantly seeking cutting-edge tech to streamline development, this could be a game-changer. Let’s dive into what this means for you. Demystifying Devin AI: Your Autonomous AI Coding Agent When Cognition first launched Devin AI , it wasn’t just another tool; it was a viral moment. Social media exploded with demos showcasing its autonomous software development capabilities. Imagine an AI coding agent that could tackle coding tasks independently – the possibilities seemed endless. While initial hype met reality checks regarding complex projects, the sheer potential was undeniable, even earning endorsements from AI visionaries like Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, significantly boosting Cognition’s profile. Initially, Devin AI was positioned as a premium tool for teams, priced at a hefty $500 per month. However, just weeks after a reported massive funding round, Cognition has introduced a more budget-friendly entry point: a $20 plan that transitions into a pay-as-you-go plan . But is this new plan truly affordable, and what does it mean for developers looking to leverage AI software development ? Breaking Down the Pay-As-You-Go Plan: Is it Worth the Cost? The allure of a pay-as-you-go plan is clear – flexibility and potentially lower upfront costs. But with Devin AI, the devil is in the details, or rather, in the ACUs (Autonomous Compute Units). Here’s a breakdown: Initial Entry: $20 gets you started with approximately 9 ACUs. ACU Cost: On the $20 plan, ACUs are priced at $2.25 each, a slight increase from the $2 cost on the $500 monthly subscription. Work Equivalence: Cognition states that 15 minutes of “active Devin work” consumes about 1 ACU. Limited Hours: 9 ACUs translate to roughly 2.25 hours of active Devin work. For developers wrestling with extensive codebases or complex projects, 2.25 hours might seem like a drop in the ocean. The pay-as-you-go plan ’s cost-effectiveness hinges heavily on usage patterns. If you anticipate sporadic use for smaller tasks, it could be economical. However, for intensive, daily coding assistance, the costs could quickly escalate. Consider this table for a clearer picture: Plan Initial Cost ACUs Included ACU Cost Approx. Active Work Time Pay-as-you-go ($20 plan) $20 9 $2.25 2.25 hours Monthly Subscription $500 ~250 (estimated, based on ACU cost) $2.00 ~62.5 hours (estimated) It’s crucial to evaluate your anticipated usage to determine if the pay-as-you-go plan truly offers savings or if the monthly subscription remains a more predictable and potentially cost-effective option for heavy users. Devin 2.0: Significant Improvements or Just Hype? Cognition emphasizes that today’s Devin – Devin AI 2.0 – is a substantial upgrade from its initial December release. Drawing parallels with GitHub Copilot, Devin now boasts enhanced capabilities: Project Planning: Devin can assist in generating comprehensive plans for coding projects. Code Q&A with Citations: Get answers to code-related questions with source citations for verification. Code Wikis: Devin can create documentation “wikis” for codebases, improving project understanding and collaboration. Silas Alberti from Devin’s development team even claims a “twofold increase in work output.” While these improvements sound promising for AI software development , it’s wise to approach such claims with healthy skepticism. Independent evaluations are crucial to validate these assertions. The Lingering Challenges of AI Coding Agents Despite advancements, the current landscape of AI coding agent technology, including Devin AI , isn’t without its hurdles. Studies consistently highlight potential pitfalls: Security Vulnerabilities: AI-generated code can introduce security weaknesses. Bugs and Errors: Flaws in understanding complex programming logic can lead to errors. Task Completion Rate: One recent evaluation noted Devin successfully completing only 3 out of 20 tasks. These challenges underscore that while Devin AI and similar tools are evolving rapidly, they are not yet a complete replacement for human developers. They are best viewed as powerful assistants, capable of augmenting and accelerating the development process, but requiring careful oversight and validation by experienced programmers. Actionable Insights: Should You Try Devin AI’s Pay-As-You-Go Plan? The introduction of a pay-as-you-go plan for Devin AI definitely lowers the barrier to entry. Here’s a practical approach to consider: Assess Your Needs: Evaluate your coding tasks. Are they small, frequent, or large and complex? Test the Waters: The $20 plan offers a low-risk way to experiment with Devin 2.0 and gauge its effectiveness for your workflow. Monitor ACU Usage: Carefully track your ACU consumption to understand potential costs beyond the initial $20. Compare with Alternatives: Explore other AI coding agent tools and compare pricing models and features. For crypto and blockchain developers, who often work on fast-paced projects and need to stay ahead of the curve, exploring Devin AI ’s capabilities could offer a competitive edge. However, a cautious and data-driven approach is recommended. Start with the pay-as-you-go plan , experiment with specific tasks, and measure the actual time and cost savings before committing to heavier usage. Conclusion: AI-Powered Coding is Evolving – Proceed with Prudence Cognition AI ’s new pay-as-you-go plan for Devin AI marks a significant step towards broader accessibility of advanced AI software development tools. While the promise of an autonomous AI coding agent is compelling, it’s essential to remain grounded in the current realities. Devin 2.0 shows improvements, but like all AI assistants, it’s a tool that requires careful evaluation and strategic implementation. The pay-as-you-go plan offers a tempting entry point, allowing developers to explore its potential without a hefty upfront commitment.

If you thought the crypto markets were volatile, take a look at Wall Street. Yesterday saw a significant shakeup in the traditional financial world as all three major U.S. stock indexes took a nosedive. Was it just a blip, or is this the start of something bigger? Let’s dive into what happened and what it could mean for your investments. Decoding the Stock Market Crash: A Sea of Red The numbers don’t lie. The trading day concluded with a stark reminder of market volatility. Here’s a snapshot of the damage: S&P 500: Dropped by a staggering 4.84% Nasdaq: Tech-heavy Nasdaq took an even bigger hit, plummeting 5.97% Dow Jones Industrial Average: The stalwart Dow wasn’t spared, falling by 3.98% To put this into perspective, these aren’t just minor dips. These are substantial declines that signal a significant shift in market sentiment. A near 5% drop in the S&P 500? That’s the kind of day that makes headlines and sends shivers down investors’ spines. This wasn’t just a bad day; it was a full-blown stock market crash for many. What Triggered This Market Correction? Unpacking the Reasons Behind the Fall So, what caused this sudden downturn? While pinpointing one single cause is often impossible, a confluence of factors likely contributed to this sharp market correction . Let’s break down some potential culprits: Inflation Fears Persist: Despite efforts to curb inflation, concerns remain about its persistence. Recent economic data might be suggesting that inflation is proving stickier than anticipated, leading to worries about more aggressive interest rate hikes. Interest Rate Hikes Loom Larger: The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates to combat inflation. However, the market is now bracing for potentially larger and more frequent rate increases, which can dampen economic growth and corporate earnings. Geopolitical Uncertainty: Global events always cast a shadow over the markets. Ongoing conflicts and international tensions can create instability and uncertainty, prompting investors to pull back. Weakening Economic Data: Concerns about a potential economic downturn are growing. If economic indicators start to weaken, suggesting slower growth or even recession, investors tend to become risk-averse and sell off stocks. It’s a complex web of interconnected factors, but the overarching theme is fear and uncertainty. The market hates uncertainty, and right now, there’s plenty of it to go around. Investor Sentiment Takes a Hit: Are Panic Buttons Being Pressed? Unsurprisingly, this market plunge has had a significant impact on investor sentiment . When markets experience such dramatic drops, fear and anxiety tend to creep in. Here’s how investor psychology might be playing out: Fear of Further Losses: No one wants to see their portfolio shrink. Large market declines can trigger panic selling as investors try to cut their losses and move to safer assets. Risk Aversion Rises: In times of market turmoil, investors generally become more risk-averse. They may shift away from stocks and other risky assets towards bonds, cash, or even precious metals. Long-Term vs. Short-Term Views: The market reaction often depends on whether investors are taking a long-term or short-term view. Long-term investors might see this as a buying opportunity, while short-term traders might be more inclined to sell and run. Understanding investor sentiment is crucial because it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. If enough investors panic and sell, it can exacerbate the market decline, creating a downward spiral. Is This Just a Dip, or a Deeper Stock Market Decline? Navigating the Uncertainty The million-dollar question everyone’s asking is: Is this just a temporary setback, a healthy stock market decline that will eventually recover, or is it the beginning of a more prolonged bear market? Unfortunately, no one has a crystal ball, but we can consider a few scenarios: Scenario Description Potential Impact Short-Term Volatility The market experiences a sharp drop but stabilizes and recovers relatively quickly. Could be a buying opportunity for long-term investors. Short-term traders face higher risk. Extended Correction The market remains volatile for a longer period, with ups and downs but no clear upward trend. Requires patience and careful portfolio management. Focus on quality assets and diversification. Bear Market A prolonged and significant market downturn, potentially lasting months or even years. More challenging for investors. Requires defensive strategies, risk management, and potentially adjusting portfolio allocations. Predicting the future is impossible, but being prepared for different scenarios is essential. It’s crucial to stay informed, monitor market developments, and adjust your investment strategy as needed. Actionable Insights: What Should Investors Do Now? Seeing your portfolio value decrease can be unsettling, but it’s important to avoid knee-jerk reactions. Here are some actionable steps to consider in the face of market volatility: Stay Calm and Avoid Panic Selling: Emotional decisions are rarely good in investing. Resist the urge to sell everything in a panic. Review Your Portfolio: Assess your current asset allocation. Is it still aligned with your risk tolerance and long-term goals? Consider Diversification: A well-diversified portfolio can help cushion the blow during market downturns. Ensure you’re not overly concentrated in any single asset class. Think Long-Term: Market corrections are a normal part of the investment cycle. Focus on your long-term investment goals and remember that markets have historically recovered from downturns. Seek Professional Advice: If you’re feeling uncertain or overwhelmed, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance. Remember, market downturns, even significant ones like this stock market decline , can present opportunities for savvy investors. It’s a time to be cautious, but also to be strategic. Conclusion: Navigating the Stormy Seas of the Stock Market Yesterday’s market plunge serves as a stark reminder of the inherent volatility of the stock market. The significant drops in the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones reflect deep-seated concerns about inflation, interest rates, and the potential for an economic downturn . While the immediate future remains uncertain, history teaches us that markets are cyclical. By staying informed, remaining calm, and focusing on a long-term investment strategy, investors can weather these stormy seas and position themselves for future growth. The key is to not panic, but to prepare and adapt.

BONK just flashed a double-bottom reversal, and DOGS dropped a hyped-up roadmap promising games, gift card utility, and global payment use cases. The meme coin scene is shaking, and traders are watching every wiggle. But while BONK fights resistance and DOGS builds community buzz, BTFD Coin (BTFD) is giving investors something far more predictable: an ROI roadmap that’s written in numbers. With a 90% APY staking setup, a 2900% ROI potential baked into its current presale price of $0.0002, and only one stage left before the final launch, BTFD isn’t just another meme coin—it’s your moon mission ticket. Presales like BTFD are where smart investors dodge volatility, skip the drama, and lock in coins at launchpad prices before the crowd catches on. From an active referral program to a fully live Play-to-Earn game, BTFD has won the hearts of over 11,700 Bulls. Want to turn a simple $4500 into life-changing returns? This article dives into why BTFD Coin might be the best meme coin to buy today while checking in on BONK’s recent surge and DOGS’ expanding roadmap. Time to stack, stake, and secure your shot at generational gains. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Is This the $0.0002 Dip You’ll Regret Missing? Here’s the million-dollar question: What if a $4500 investment today could grow into $135,000 in just months? That’s exactly what’s on the table with BTFD Coin . At its current Stage 15 price of $0.0002, every $4500 scores you 22.5 million BTFD coins. By the time the presale wraps and BTFD lists at $0.0006, your stash triples to $13,500. But that’s just scratching the surface. Analysts are eyeing BTFD’s potential “moon price” at $0.006. At that level? Your $4500 haul explodes into $135,000, a jaw-dropping 2900% ROI. And the window to get in at these prices is slamming shut—Stage 16 is next, then it’s full launch mode. Why the hype? First, BTFD gives you serious staking power. With a massive 90% APY, holders aren’t just betting on price hikes—they’re compounding their stack like clockwork. That kind of passive income is almost unheard of in meme coin land, and it adds long-term utility that most memes can’t match. Need more juice? The BTFD Play-to-Earn game is live, letting users earn tokens while playing. Over 72 billion BTFD coins have been sold so far, raising more than $6.45 million. And the community? It’s wild, with over 11,700 holders rallying behind the Bulls Squad and their dip-chasing mission. Add a killer referral program on top—offering 10% bonuses for both you and your referrals—and it’s clear: BTFD isn’t just a meme coin, it’s a movement. Want in? Here’s how to buy BTFD Coin before Stage 16 launches: Go to the BTFD Presale , connect your wallet, enter your purchase amount, and hit “Buy Now.” No rocket science, just smart timing. Secure your tokens before it’s too late. BTFD or get left behind. BONK (BONK): Reversal Pattern Spotted Amid Bearish Pressure After a brutal 50% drop over the past two months, BONK may be staging a comeback. Technical traders are eyeing a double bottom pattern around $0.00001112, signaling potential for reversal if BONK breaks above $0.00001240. While momentum is still shaky, BONK recently pumped over 10% in 24 hours, and trading volume surged 128% to $159.13M. It’s a short-term trader’s playground, but far less predictable than a presale play like BTFD. Dogs (DOGS): Roadmap Unleashed With Games, Gift Cards & Payments DOGS just dropped alpha on its roadmap, teasing DOGS-themed games and IRL payment utility with gift cards and travel bookings. Currently priced at $0.00012687, DOGS plans to expand community use cases by mid-2025. Some analysts predict DOGS could rally 227.43% by April 27. While promising, it lacks the staking income and ROI clarity that BTFD brings to the table. Claim This Huge ROI Before the Window Closes This might be your last shot to buy the best meme coin to buy today at launchpad-level pricing. BTFD Coin’s 90% staking APY and a potential 2900% ROI make it the most compelling meme coin presale we’ve seen in years. Presale started at just $0.000004. Today? Still only $0.0002. You do the math. The final stage is next, and listing is locked at $0.0006. Want more? Jump into BTFD’s referral program and earn 10% BTFD bonuses when others buy using your code. Share it. Stack it. Dominate the leaderboard. Just visit the presale site, connect your wallet, and your referral code is ready to roll. Don’t sleep on this one. Presales like this don’t stay quiet for long. Load your bull sack. Conclusion: Your Dip. Your Decision. Your Shot at 2900% Gains Based on current market moves, expert predictions, and raw presale numbers, BTFD Coin is easily the best meme coin to buy today. While BONK battles resistance and DOGS plays the long game, BTFD lets you stack coins at $0.0002, stake at 90% APY, and aim for a moonshot $0.006. Don’t be the person who reads about this coin after it’s already pumped. Join before the BTFD Coin presale ends—because the Bulls are charging, and this stampede doesn’t wait.

42873549,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146270,1743724210,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary AI Kindle Recaps: Never Forget a Book Series Plot Again!,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-kindle-recaps-book-series/,"Ever found yourself lost returning to a beloved book series after a break? It’s a common reader’s woe – trying to recall intricate plot details and character relationships. Amazon Kindle is stepping in to banish this frustration with a brand-new, incredibly helpful feature: AI Recaps . Imagine effortlessly refreshing your memory before diving into the next installment of your favorite saga. Sounds amazing, right? Let’s explore how this AI -powered feature is changing the reading game, especially for those of us juggling multiple book worlds. What are Amazon Kindle’s New AI Recaps? Amazon is rolling out a “Recaps” feature for Kindle users designed to solve a very specific problem: series amnesia! Before you jump into the latest novel in a series, this feature offers a quick way to catch up on key plot points and character developments from previous books. While Amazon ‘s official announcement played it coy about the tech behind it, Bitcoin World confirmed the secret sauce – it’s AI ! According to Amazon spokesperson Ale Iraheta, these recaps are AI -generated, utilizing “GenAI and Amazon moderators” to ensure accuracy. Think of it as having a super-efficient, AI -powered study guide for your favorite book series , right within your Kindle device and soon on the Kindle app for iOS. Why is Amazon Using AI for Book Recaps? Why turn to AI for something like book series recaps? It boils down to efficiency and scale. Manually creating summaries for thousands of eBooks in series would be a monumental task. GenAI offers a scalable solution, capable of quickly processing vast amounts of text and extracting key information. Here’s a breakdown of the likely benefits for Amazon and readers: Scalability : AI can generate recaps for a massive library of book series much faster than human editors. Efficiency : Automated AI recaps reduce the time and resources needed compared to manual methods. Consistency : AI algorithms can provide a consistent format and level of detail across all recaps. Reader Convenience : Ultimately, AI recaps offer readers a convenient and instant way to refresh their memory, enhancing the reading experience. Concerns and Accuracy: Are AI Kindle Recaps Reliable? The introduction of AI recaps hasn’t been without a ripple of concern. Readers on platforms like Reddit are questioning the accuracy of AI -generated summaries. Will AI truly capture the nuances of complex plots and character arcs? This is a valid question, especially considering the early stages of GenAI in content creation. Amazon assures users that they are taking accuracy seriously, stating they use “technology, including GenAI and Amazon moderators” to create recaps that “accurately reflect book content.” The involvement of human moderators is a reassuring sign, suggesting a hybrid approach to quality control. However, Bitcoin World has rightly requested more details about this moderation process to understand the checks and balances in place. It’s crucial to remember that AI is a tool, and its effectiveness depends on its training and oversight. While GenAI has made incredible strides, it’s not infallible. Reader feedback and ongoing refinement will be essential to ensure Kindle AI recaps become a truly reliable and helpful feature. How to Access and Use Kindle AI Recaps Eager to try out these AI recaps ? Here’s how you can access them on your Kindle device: Software Update : Ensure your Kindle is running the latest software version. Locate Series Page : Go to your Kindle Library and find the page for a book series you’ve purchased or borrowed. Look for “View Recaps” Button : On the series page, look for the “View Recaps” button. Alternatively, Use Three-Dot Menu : You can also find the “View Recaps” option within the three-dot menu when viewing a series grouping. Spoiler Warning : Before accessing the recap, you’ll receive a spoiler warning – a helpful heads-up that major plot points will be revealed. Enjoy the Recap : Acknowledge the warning, and you’ll be taken to the AI -generated recap for the book series . Currently, AI recaps are available for thousands of best-selling English-language eBooks in series for Kindle device users in the United States. Amazon plans to expand this feature to the Kindle app for iOS soon, bringing AI -powered convenience to even more readers. What Kind of Book Series Benefit from AI Recaps? Amazon highlights that AI recaps are designed to be useful across all genres, from epic fantasy sagas to intricate mystery thrillers. Think about series with: Complex Worlds : Fantasy, science fiction, and historical fiction series often have vast and detailed worlds that can be hard to keep track of. Large Casts of Characters : Series with many characters, especially those with interconnected storylines, benefit greatly from character recaps. Intricate Plots : Mystery, thriller, and suspense series with twisty plots can be easier to follow with a quick recap of previous events. Long-Running Series : For series with many books released over years, recaps are invaluable for refreshing your memory before each new installment. Whether you’re diving into a sprawling fantasy epic or catching up on a cozy mystery series, AI recaps promise to enhance your reading experience. The Future of Reading with AI Assistance Amazon Kindle ‘s AI Recaps feature signals an exciting direction for the future of reading. AI is increasingly being integrated into various aspects of our lives, and now it’s lending a hand to enhance our literary journeys. While concerns about accuracy and AI ‘s role in creative fields are valid, the potential benefits for readers are undeniable. Imagine a future where AI assists with personalized reading recommendations, provides deeper insights into literary themes, or even helps authors with research and writing tools. Kindle AI Recaps might just be the first step in a broader integration of AI into the world of books, making reading more accessible, engaging, and enjoyable for everyone.

But despite recent bullish sentiment, both coins appear to be losing momentum in early Q2 2025. Ethereum is hovering around the $1,700–$1,900 range, while XRP remains volatile, currently trading near $2.01 following a brief post-settlement rebound from the SEC case. While ETH’s technical indicators show signs of potential strength, analysts say the lack of volume and on-chain activity could stall a major breakout. Similarly, XRP’s settlement with the SEC brought some clarity, but long-term bullish momentum remains uncertain. That’s why many early-stage investors are now turning their attention to a new project showing real traction and upside: MAGACOIN FINANCE . MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Traction with Early Buyers Unlike legacy tokens that may have already priced in much of their growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE is a brand-new presale project with clear upside and growing investor demand. With a starting price of just $0.0002704 and a confirmed listing price of $0.007 , the early presale offers over +2,500% ROI for first movers — a return that’s hard to ignore in today’s sideways market. As of now, MAGACOIN FINANCE has raised over $5 million in early contributions and already surpassed 10,000 holders , signaling strong confidence from retail and early-stage crypto communities alike. Key Differences That Have Investors Paying Attention GET 50% EXTRA TOKENS INSTANTLY — USE PROMO CODE: MAGA50X BEFORE IT EXPIRES Here’s why MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly separating itself from the altcoin crowd: • New Presale Just Launched — not yet listed, so upside is still ahead • Over $5M Already Raised — momentum is building fast • Staged Price Model — rewards early participation with lower prices • Listing Price Locked at $0.007 — giving transparency for future valuation • Over 2,500% ROI Built In — based on current presale vs. listing price Investors are beginning to view MAGACOIN FINANCE as a potential breakout coin in the next cycle — especially while ETH and XRP continue to consolidate . The Bottom Line Ethereum and XRP still have long-term relevance, but their near-term upside looks limited. With both struggling to break key resistance levels, many investors are looking further down the market cap list for the next major mover. MAGACOIN FINANCE might be exactly that — a well-structured new project with real momentum, massive upside, and a dedicated early community. As the presale continues to gain attention, those who move early could be the ones positioned to benefit the most in 2025.

Cardano is on the verge of a surge with positive market indicators and heightened long-term holder interest. Ripple is finalizing legal issues with a smaller SEC fine, providing regulatory clarity but minimal expansion in immediate applications. BlockDAG (BDAG) is leveraging its Beta Testnet as a comprehensive ecosystem trial—facilitating user and developer activity, rolling out smart contracts, and integrating miners and users. With 19 billion coins already sold and $210.5 million collected in its presale, BlockDAG’s practical application of its testnet goes beyond theory, serving as a real-world model for blockchain’s immediate future. Cardano Eyes for Breakout Cardano (ADA) is currently trading between $0.699 and $0.75. A strong push beyond $0.76 could lead to a 13% price jump, aiming for $0.85. The 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at about $0.75 acts as a resistance point. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) near 60 signals a possible uptick. Meanwhile, traders have significant positions at $0.712 and $0.76, totaling $18.25 million in longs and $8.50 million in shorts. A rise above $0.76 might clear these shorts, propelling further advances. Ongoing withdrawals of ADA from exchanges since March 13 suggest accumulation by steadfast supporters, bolstering a bullish stance. Ripple Lawsuit Settled Ripple Labs has settled its lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), agreeing to a reduced fine of $50 million from the initial $125 million. This settlement, awaiting confirmation from both the SEC and the judge, closes a crucial chapter in ongoing discussions between regulatory entities and the crypto industry. Ripple has not conceded any legal errors in this settlement. Additionally, the SEC has withdrawn its appeal on a previous decision that XRP tokens traded on public exchanges are not securities. This resolution is a key development for Ripple and could impact the regulatory framework for digital currencies. BlockDAG Beta Testnet: Pioneering Real-World Use BlockDAG’s “Primordial” Beta Testnet is more than a testing ground—it’s a hub of active development. Developers are now deploying smart contracts, testing features, and using tools like a bespoke IDE, blockchain explorer, and wallet setup guide. Concurrently, miners and users engage in competitions with rewards of $2,000 in BDAG for top performers in transactions, mining, and wallet holdings. Additionally, the testnet is accelerating user engagement. Each participant in the presale is granted 10,000 test tokens, which mature over three weeks and can be tracked via a specialized dApp. This strategy encourages real interaction ahead of the mainnet launch. On the funding front, the momentum of the crypto presale is impressive. More than 19 billion coins have sold, amassing $210.5 million. Currently, in its 27th batch priced at $0.0248, the project boasts a 2,380% ROI from the first batch. With its EVM compatibility and comprehensive support infrastructure, the testnet serves not merely as a rehearsal but as a launchpad for BlockDAG’s ambitious future. Pioneers of Progress: BlockDAG Versus the Rest While Cardano focuses on potential price escalations and Ripple concludes its regulatory negotiations, BlockDAG rigorously tests its network in real-world scenarios. This isn’t just about validating technology—it’s about readying the community of users, developers, and miners for a fully operational mainnet. With incentives directly linked to active participation and tools already available for deploying contracts, BlockDAG’s testnet is far from just a temporary setup—it’s a critical component of their offering. As other blockchain initiatives balance visibility with practical utility, BlockDAG’s proactive approach during its Beta phase demonstrates it’s not merely preparing for mainnet functionality—it’s already proving its capabilities.

The latest updates on PI coin price and Hedera (HBAR) price outlook have stirred mixed emotions—one falling over 76% from its peak, the other rallying on institutional buzz. But while the noise builds around these names, a shift is happening elsewhere. All eyes are turning to BlockDAG , the top trending crypto that’s not just promising more—it’s already delivering. Keynote 3 changed everything. With a real beta testnet, 800K+ X1 miners, and 15,000 TPS potential, BlockDAG has leapfrogged Ethereum, Solana, and even Bitcoin in both performance and accessibility. It’s the first real hybrid of PoW + DAG, using Phantom and GhostDAG to confirm blocks in parallel. The future’s not coming—it’s already live. BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 Just Changed the Game BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 is the moment many in crypto didn’t see coming. While Ethereum still struggles with congestion and Solana faces repeated outages, BlockDAG introduced a network that delivers both power and simplicity. Its hybrid Proof-of-Work + DAG architecture is built to handle 15,000 transactions per second—far more than most major Layer 1s—without the energy cost you’d expect from a PoW system. That scalability makes BlockDAG not just another altcoin story, but a real Layer 1 alternative with substance. At the core of this performance is the Phantom + GhostDAG protocol. Instead of waiting for one block to be confirmed at a time, BlockDAG processes multiple blocks simultaneously. This parallel structure reduces confirmation times, boosts network throughput, and removes the bottlenecks that hold back most chains. It’s a major shift from how people have been told blockchains “should” work. And now that it’s live on beta testnet, it’s no longer theoretical. Keynote 3 delivered more than hype—it showed results. Over 800,000 users are now mining with the X1 app. BlockDAG’s TG Tap Miner has crossed 400,000 users with 100,000 active daily. Meanwhile, the presale has raised over $210.5 million, with 19.1 billion BDAG coins sold. Current pricing in Batch 27 is $0.0248, offering a 2,380% return since Batch 1. It’s one of the reasons BlockDAG is now a top trending crypto across multiple platforms. But it’s not just about numbers. The launch of BlockDAG Academy, ambassador programs, and global workshops points to something long-term. This isn’t about speculation—it’s about building. Keynote 3 proved it: your crypto bag is outdated. BlockDAG is already on the next page. No wonder it’s quickly becoming the top trending crypto everyone’s switching to. What’s Next for the PI Coin Price After Its Drop? The PI coin price hit $2.99 just days after its February 20 launch but has since dropped over 76%, now sitting around $0.70. The sell-off followed mainnet issues, listing rejections from major exchanges like Binance and Bybit, and a shift in user verification from phone numbers to email-based 2FA. These changes caused uncertainty and added pressure to an already volatile chart. Technically, Pi is still holding above key support at $0.6450. A bullish reversal could push the PI coin price back to $1, with $1.22 as the next short-term target. However, if sentiment turns bearish again, it could fall to $0.50. The MACD remains neutral, but EMA signals are hinting at a Golden Cross. Right now, traders are watching closely, but the hype has definitely cooled since launch week. Why the Hedera (HBAR) price outlook Just Got Interesting The Hedera (HBAR) price outlook saw a boost after the team announced HashSphere—a new private-to-public blockchain tailored for institutional users. It supports HBAR, stablecoins, and tokenized real-world assets, and will be compatible with Ethereum’s EVM. This triggered a 10% price jump, helping HBAR bounce off its recent low of $0.1568. Still trading around $0.1685, HBAR remains nearly 70% below its all-time high of $0.5692. Technical indicators show RSI levels at 45 and 33, pointing to a potential upward move if $0.20 is reclaimed. The Hedera (HBAR) price outlook now depends on whether HashSphere’s Q3 launch delivers more traction and usage. With backing from firms like Google and IBM, HBAR’s long-term potential is solid, even if concerns about validator centralization still linger. Summing Up The recent drop in the PI coin price and the cautious Hedera (HBAR) price outlook show how quickly momentum can shift. Both networks are facing major turning points—Pi with its tech updates and Hedera with its push into institutional use. But while they’re figuring things out, BlockDAG is already several steps ahead. Keynote 3 made it clear why BlockDAG is the top trending crypto. With real testnet progress, scalable performance at 15,000 TPS, and its hybrid PoW + DAG setup, it’s setting a new standard. Add in global workshops, the BlockDAG Academy, and 800K+ users on its X1 app, and it’s no surprise why users are switching. Your crypto bag is outdated. The next chapter is here—and BlockDAG is writing it.

42873892,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146277,1743724867,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Rejection: Teen AI App Prodigy with 4.0 GPA Denied by 15 Top Universities,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-app-teen-college-rejection/,"In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency and disruptive tech, we often celebrate young innovators breaking barriers and achieving remarkable feats outside traditional systems. But what happens when a prodigious teen, already making waves with a viral AI app , encounters a seemingly conventional hurdle: college rejection ? Meet Zach Yadegari, the 17-year-old co-founder of Cal AI, a calorie-counting application that’s taken the app stores by storm. Despite a perfect 4.0 GPA, a stellar 34 ACT score, and real-world success as a teen entrepreneur , Yadegari faced a wave of rejections from 15 out of 18 top-tier universities, sparking a massive online debate about the true value of traditional education versus entrepreneurial drive. The Viral Sensation: Cal AI and a Teen’s Triumph Before diving into the college rejection saga, let’s understand what makes Zach Yadegari’s story so compelling. He isn’t just another bright student; he’s a proven innovator in the tech space. Cal AI, the AI app he co-founded, isn’t some small project – it’s a viral hit. Reports suggest it has surpassed 1 million downloads and boasts overwhelmingly positive reviews, putting it on track for millions in annual revenue. While specific revenue figures are unverified, the app’s popularity is undeniable. But Cal AI wasn’t Yadegari’s first foray into entrepreneurial success. He previously sold a web gaming company for a substantial $100,000. This track record underscores his innate talent and business acumen, making his college rejection letters even more perplexing to many. Why College? A Hacker House Epiphany Interestingly, university admissions weren’t always Yadegari’s priority. After spending a summer in a San Francisco hacker house, immersed in building the Cal AI prototype, he initially leaned towards the path of a college dropout tech entrepreneur. However, this experience led to a crucial realization. He recognized that bypassing college meant missing out on a significant phase of personal growth and development. He eloquently described this shift in his viral essay, stating: “In my rejection of the collegiate path, I had unwittingly bound myself to another framework of expectations: the archetypal dropout founder. Instead of schoolteachers, it was VCs and mentors steering me toward a direction that was still not my own.” This epiphany motivated him to apply to universities, seeking a more holistic learning experience beyond coding and revenue streams. He articulated his desire to learn from diverse perspectives, not just digital resources, aiming to “elevate the work I have always done” through human interaction and academic rigor. His essay highlighted this evolved perspective, emphasizing his newfound appreciation for the value of a college education in broadening his horizons and amplifying his impact. The Essay That Sparked a Firestorm: Authenticity or Arrogance? Yadegari’s application essay, which he openly shared on X, became a central point of contention in the online debate surrounding his university admissions fate. In it, he candidly discussed his initial aversion to college, detailing his journey as a self-taught coder and the financial success he achieved. He recounted how venture capitalists and mentors reinforced the notion that college was unnecessary for him. This narrative, while honest, seemed to some as lacking the conventional eagerness for higher education that university admissions committees typically seek. Despite his impressive academic record and real-world achievements, rejections poured in from institutions like Stanford, MIT, Harvard, Columbia, Princeton, Duke, and Cornell. He did receive acceptances from Georgia Tech, University of Texas, and University of Miami, solid options, but not the Ivy League cohort that many expected for someone with his profile. X Marks the Spot: 22 Million Views and a Torrent of Opinions Yadegari’s tweet about his widespread college rejection went viral, amassing over 22 million views and thousands of comments. The reactions were diverse and often sharply divided: Essay Criticism: Many commenters labeled his essay as “arrogant,” suggesting it conveyed a lack of genuine interest in learning within a traditional academic environment. They argued that university admissions officers likely perceived him as someone who was applying to college almost as an afterthought, rather than with true enthusiasm. System Critique: Others directed their criticism at the university admissions system itself, echoing familiar complaints about its often opaque and seemingly arbitrary nature. They argued that a system that overlooks a proven teen entrepreneur with stellar grades and test scores is fundamentally flawed. Insightful Observations: Perhaps the most constructive feedback centered on the idea that colleges prioritize candidates who demonstrate a genuine thirst for knowledge and a high likelihood of graduating. Yadegari’s essay, in its candid portrayal of his initial reluctance towards college, may have inadvertently signaled a lack of commitment to the traditional academic path, despite his eventual change of heart. Garry Tan Weighs In: Ayn Rand and College Rejection Even Y Combinator’s Garry Tan chimed in on X, sharing his own experience with widespread college rejection and waitlists. Tan humorously confessed that his own application essays, heavily influenced by Ayn Rand’s philosophy after reading ‘The Fountainhead,’ might have contributed to his initial setbacks. While Tan eventually gained admission to Stanford, his anecdote highlights the subjective and sometimes unpredictable nature of university admissions , where even philosophical influences can play a role. Beyond Business Success: A Teen’s Evolving Perspective Speaking to Bitcoin World, Yadegari expressed his fascination with the diverse responses to his viral post. He acknowledged the varied perspectives and the inherent uncertainty in understanding the exact reasons for his college rejection . However, he emphasized his commitment to authenticity, stating, “At the end of the day, when I wrote my essay, I hoped admissions offices would perceive me as authentic because that’s all I ever want to be.” Importantly, Yadegari also revealed a significant shift in his priorities. Having achieved considerable business success at a young age, he now recognizes that “life was not just about financial success. It is about relationships, and about being a part of a larger community.” This evolving perspective underscores a maturity beyond his years, suggesting that his pursuit of higher education is driven by a deeper desire for personal growth and community engagement, rather than solely career advancement. While the college rejection saga of this teen entrepreneur has sparked debate and offered insights into the complexities of university admissions , it also highlights a crucial point: success can be defined in many ways. For Zach Yadegari, despite the initial disappointment, this experience seems to be shaping a more nuanced understanding of achievement and personal fulfillment, proving that even in the face of rejection, growth and learning continue.

Solana, Tron and the Arbitrum blockchains also had their TVLs slashed over 30%. Meanwhile, blockchains that experienced a larger volume of DeFi withdrawals and had a smaller share of stablecoins locked in their protocols faced extra pressure on top of the falling token prices.

The monthly average of DUAWs interacting on the AI and social protocols rose to 2.6 million and 2.8 million, while DeFi and GameFi protocols fell double-digits. DappRadar said there was “explosive growth” in AI agent protocols, stating that they’re “no longer a concept.” “They’re here, and they’re shaping new user behaviors,” said the firm.

33767162,[object Object],1743726600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Pantera CEO Drops Bombshell: Bitcoin Should Be Worth $120,000 Today",https://bitcoinist.com/pantera-ceo-bitcoin-should-be-120000-today/,"Dan Morehead, CEO of Pantera Capital—a firm renowned for its pioneering role in digital asset investments since 2013—has delivered a bold valuation call for Bitcoin. According to Morehead, the world’s leading cryptocurrency should be trading above $120,000, potentially even surpassing $126,000, if recent political and regulatory developments were fully reflected in market prices. Is Bitcoin Mispriced? Morehead’s argument comes at a time when Bitcoin’s price is only up by only 24% following the last US presidential election—a modest increase by his standards. In a post on X, Morehead points to significant political and regulatory developments that he argues should have driven Bitcoin’s price far higher than current levels. He wrote: “If a few days before the US Presidential election – with bitcoin at $69,000 – a sorcerer showed you a crystal ball and in it you knew for a fact that the pro-crypto candidate wins the presidency, Red House and Senate, 54 anti-crypto Members of Congress losing their seats, several Presidential Executive Orders on crypto including: Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, US Digital Asset Stockpile (with other cryptocurrencies), most major SEC actions against blockchain industry participants dropped and the President hosting a summit to get input from the industry …all this in ten weeks.” Morehead then assesses the impact these developments should have had on Bitcoin’s valuation: “I’d bet you’d say bitcoin would be up way more than 24%. The way I think of it, the markets have barely moved relative to trend. The twelve-year compound annual growth rate of Pantera Bitcoin Fund is 83%. It’d be up almost as much just naturally. Seems to me that the crypto markets have yet to price in the very positive developments.” By outlining these milestones—ranging from a pro-crypto presidential victory and a reshaped Congress to a series of supportive executive actions—Morehead suggests that the market’s current price fails to capture what he sees as a natural upward trend. A 83% uptrend would position BTC above $126,000. This bullish forecast is especially striking given the backdrop of recent market volatility. Bitcoin had just suffered a drop exceeding 7% after US President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs —a reminder that even the most promising outlooks can be overshadowed by sudden geopolitical and economic shocks. BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes, also speaking on X, reacted to the sudden downturn and cautioned traders about potentially choppy conditions in the weeks to come. His comments suggest that $76,500 serves as a crucial price floor. Should Bitcoin maintain that threshold through mid-April, Hayes believes the market’s ability to regain traction will look far more promising. “Mrkt no likey ‘Liberation Day’, if BTC can hold $76.5k btw now and US tax day Apr 15, then we are out of the woods. Don’t get chopped up!” he stated Meanwhile, Charles Edwards—Founder and CEO of Capriole Investments— hints at the possibility of Federal Reserve intervention, drawing parallels to previous periods where expansionary monetary policy helped reignite risk-on appetite, often boosting Bitcoin in the process. “Consider this as tariffs come in higher than expected. The Phily Fed Business Outlook survey is showing expectations today comparable to 2000, 2008 and 2022. How long until the Powell printer starts humming?” he remarked on X. At press time, BTC traded at $81,811.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|Dan Morehead|Pantera Capital,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ZK|WLD|CAKE|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-04-04 00:30:00

The findings, which come from Glassnode’s newly published report titled “Rippling Away,” reveal that while Bitcoin market indicators edge closer to a bearish zone, XRP has seen remarkable inflows of capital and user activity—albeit with signs of waning momentum. According to Glassnode’s report, Bitcoin has been consolidating between the $76,000 and $87,000 price range. Indicators such as the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio are showing “signs of near-term seller exhaustion but not yet a renewal of sustained bullish momentum.” Furthermore, a longer-term on-chain “Death-Cross” suggests the market’s current weakness could persist for some time. “Supply in loss remains elevated at 4.7M BTC,” the report states, underlining the depth of investor stress. These conditions, as Glassnode notes, paint a picture of “deepening bearish conditions” for the leading cryptocurrency. Retail Flocks To XRP In contrast to Bitcoin’s cautionary signals, Glassnode points to XRP as a proxy for heightened retail speculation this cycle. The report highlights: “For this cycle in particular, Ripple (XRP) has been a preferred asset for trade amongst retail investors, and studying its behavior can, therefore, serve as a proxy for measuring retail speculative demand.” Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction For April: Analyst Explains What To Expect From the 2022 cycle low, XRP’s daily active addresses have “jumped by +490%” on a quarterly average basis, while Bitcoin’s rose by only 10%. This sharp divergence underscores the retail community’s enthusiasm for XRP, which Glassnode views as indicative of broader speculative appetite in the market. The enthusiasm for XRP translated into a near-doubling of its Realized Cap—leaping from $30.1 billion to $64.2 billion during its rally from December 2024 to early 2025. Glassnode estimates that approximately $30 billion of this new capital came in over the last six months, pointing to a fresh wave of market participants. Alongside the short surge in capital flows, there’s been a rapid concentration of wealth in the hands of new investors,” the report explains. However, Glassnode also warns: “When viewed together with the heavy retail participation, this sharp uplift in new holders raises caution signs.” Related Reading: XRP Bull Cycle Could End If This Happens: Analyst Glassnode warns that these new investors are vulnerable to downside volatility, especially as XRP’s cost basis becomes more top-heavy. Thus, despite initial excitement, the report notes a cooling of speculative interest since late February 2025. Glassnode’s Realized Loss/Profit Ratio for XRP has declined steadily since January 2025, suggesting a slip in profitability and “waning confidence.” This might reflect a more fragile market structure, where large swaths of relatively new holders face mounting paper losses. “The XRP market is showing signs of a top-heavy structure, with many investors caught on a relatively high-cost basis,” the report adds. This fragility in XRP’s positioning could also imply broader caution for retail-driven altcoin markets. Overall, Glassnode’s latest research underscores the dichotomy in today’s digital asset landscape. While Bitcoin’s drift below $80,000 spurred increased losses for long-term holders, XRP’s meteoric rise and subsequent slowdown depict a market driven by short-term retail enthusiasm that may be approaching saturation. “For more speculative assets like XRP, demand may have already peaked,” the report concludes, “suggesting caution may be warranted until signs of a robust recovery start to emerge.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.00.

During this time, the quarterly average of daily active addresses jumped by 490% and XRP price hit a 7-year high. XRP’s 1-day chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Fast forward to the present, and data shows that the speculative interest surrounding XRP is declining. Holders are increasingly facing losses rather than gains, which is dampening their risk appetite. “Retail confidence in XRP may be slipping” Since bottoming in 2022, Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP have gained 500% to 600%, but the bulk of XRP’s gains came from a parabolic price increase. Data from Glassnode shows that XRP daily active addresses jumped by 490%, whereas the same metric for Bitcoin increased by 10% over the past four months. XRP's new investor realized the cap.

The share of XRP’s realized cap held by new investors (less than six months) jumped from 23% to 62.8%, signaling a rapid wealth shift. However, since late February 2025, capital inflows have dipped significantly. XRP realized profit/loss ratio. Source: Glassnode The primary reason is that investors are currently locking in fewer profits and staring at higher losses. This can be identified by the realized loss/profit ratio, which has constantly declined since 2025. Glassnode analysts said, “Given the retail-dominated inflows and largely concentrated wealth in relatively new hands, this alludes to a condition where retail investor confidence in XRP may be slipping, and this may also be extended across the broader market.” Besides weakening confidence among newer investors, the distribution of XRP among whale addresses reflects a similar trend. Data shows a steady increase in whale outflows since the start of 2025, suggesting that large holders have been consistently trimming their positions. Over the past 14 days, over $1 billion in positions were offloaded at an average price of $2.10. Whale flow 30-day moving average.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView However, on the lower time frame (LTF) of the 1-hour and 4-hour charts, a bullish divergence can be observed for XRP. A bullish divergence occurs when the price forms a lower low and the relative strength index (RSI) forms a lower high. With a fair value gap between $2.08 and $2.13, XRP might see a relief rally into this range, especially if the wider crypto market undergoes an oversold bounce. On the higher time frame chart, XRP appears bearish due to the formation of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, with a measured target near $1.07. There is a chance that the altcoin finds support from the 200-day moving average (orange line) around the $1.70 to $1.80 mark, but XRP price has not tested this level since Nov. 5, 2024.

The tariffs combine a 10% baseline duty with additional double-digit tariffs on key trading partners. Analysts note that the overall US tariff rate on imports would rise to 22%, a significant jump from the 2.5% seen last year. Donald Trump giving a ‘Liberation Day’ speech at the Rose Garden in Washington DC. Source: Sky News Olu Sonola, head of US economic research at Fitch Ratings, stressed that the tariff rate is now at its highest level since 1910, calling it a “game changer” for the US economy and the world. Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Liberum, warned, “The chances of a US recession over the next 12 months are materially higher as a result of the decisions last night.” Financial markets reacted swiftly. The US dollar fell 1.7% against a basket of currencies from key trading partners by early Thursday afternoon European time, reflecting growing concern about US growth prospects. The tariffs are expected to affect the economy through multiple channels. While companies may not pass on the full cost increase to consumers, the wide scope of the tariffs means that American households are unlikely to be spared. During Trump’s 2018 trade war, about 60% of a temporary 20% tariff on imported washing machines was passed on to consumers. Consumer sentiment has shown signs of weakness In March, the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index fell by 7.2 points to 92.9, the lowest level since January 2021, when some pandemic restrictions were still in place. At the same time, the consumer expectations index, which reflects views on income, business, and labor market conditions, plunged to 65.2 – the lowest reading in 12 years and well below the recession-warning threshold of 80. US economist James Knightley from ING estimated that the new tariff package could add roughly $1,350 in extra costs for every American, depending on how much of the cost is passed on by businesses. Marc Giannoni, an economist at Barclays, predicted that core consumer price inflation would likely exceed 4% this year and that real GDP would decline. Giannoni also warned that the unemployment rate might rise, forecasting a 0.1% contraction on a year-on-year basis in the final quarter of 2025 –a change he described as “consistent with a recession.” He further projected that unemployment could reach 4.6% by the fourth quarter. Paul Donovan, an economist at UBS, said that market expectations will adjust to price in recession. He stated, “If there is no retreat, markets will price a US recession. If there is a retreat, markets will assume US growth will weaken.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

With gas fees remaining high and alternatives gaining traction, many buyers are seeking new opportunities with higher upside potential. The fourth phase of Mutuum Finance presale continues while this high-growth altcoin sells for $0.025 and has collected $6.1 million. The next stage of the presale will boost MUTM’s price to $0.03 while attracting more than 7800 investors. The initial investors during this phase will receive a 140% payback when the launch price reaches $0.06. Experts predict MUTM could surge to $3.50 by late 2025, making it a better alternative for investors moving away from Ethereum’s stagnation. A DeFi Giant on the Rise Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 7800 investors have joined the presale funding to support the project which has received $6.1 million in total. Mutuum Finance’s price currently reaches $0.025 in Phase 4 even though investors anticipate a 20% price increase in Phase 5 which will generate considerable profit potential. The analysts forecast MUTM to surge beyond $10 in upcoming months when it launches at $0.06 because its distinctive lending approach meets rising market requirements thus making it an underappreciated yet promising DeFi resource. Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts. The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi. A Reliable and Secure Financial Network Mutuum Finance creates a launch plan for its new collateralized USD-backed stablecoin developed for Ethereum blockchain usage. Insolvency risks that threaten algorithmic stablecoins will not affect this over-collateralized asset because it will maintain long-term reliability. A complete audit system of smart contracts together with transparent financial mechanisms establishes trust with investors as it fixes numerous security problems observed with past decentralized finance projects. To attract more community members Mutuum Finance implements profitable incentive programs at an aggressive pace. The program will use $100,000 to give ten investors $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and the referral system gives rewards to users who bring in new investors to the platform. The platform gives early supporters exclusive benefits including staking pools and governance rights and VIP-exclusive updates to enhance their connection with the platform. Friendly Tokenomics for Lasting Expansion Tokenomics in the project follows a strategy designed for both limited token circulation management and continuous appreciation of value. The presale limitation combined with anti-inflationary procedures enables Mutuum Finance to establish scarcity which creates possible upward token value potential. Staking rewards users for token involvement by delivering valuable incentives that strengthen the ecosystem sustainability of its native token. Ethereum’s (ETH) uncertain outlook and increasing competition are driving investors toward high-growth alternatives like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With a unique dual-lending model, strong tokenomics, and a rapidly expanding community, MUTM has already attracted over 7,800 investors and raised $6.1 million. As its price climbs from $0.025 in Phase 4 to a projected $3.50 by late 2025, early participants stand to gain significantly. Don’t miss this opportunity—join the Mutuum Finance presale today and secure your position in the future of decentralized finance.

Brutal, isn’t it? That sting of missing out doesn’t just haunt your wallet, it messes with your head. You start thinking, “If I’d just thrown in a cheeky $200 back then…” But here’s the kicker—those chances aren’t gone. They’re just hiding in plain sight. Right now, while the big names are busy battling it out on the charts, a new wave of meme coins is quietly brewing in the shadows—and one in particular, BTFD Coin (BTFD) , is kicking up a proper storm. With only one presale stage left before launch and a wild 2900% ROI on the table, it’s the kind of moment you either grab or regret forever. If you’re hunting for the top new meme coins to invest in this month, you’re in the right place. Stick around—we’re about to unpack the meme coins catching fire this month, starting with the one everyone’s whispering about before it blows up. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Bulls Are Charging, Are You In? If your mates are buzzing about BTFD, they’re not just hopping on hype—they’re sniffing out something big. The BTFD Coin presale is now thundering through its 15th stage at just $0.0002 per coin, with a listing price locked in at $0.0006. That’s a 200% gain baked in already if you buy now. But here’s where it gets tasty—analysts reckon BTFD could moon to $0.006. If that happens, Stage 15 investors could bag a jaw-dropping 2900% ROI. Let’s break it down. Say you chuck in $4000 during this current stage. At $0.0002 per BTFD, that nets you 20 million coins. If the coin hits its projected presale price of $0.0006, that’s already $12,000. But if it moons to $0.006, you’d be looking at $120,000. That’s right—one smart move today could flip a used car budget into luxury-level gains. But it’s not just about the numbers. BTFD isn’t some faceless memecoin. This project is powered by the legendary Bulls Squad, a group of four bold characters—Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull—each symbolizing a key strength of the community. From community outreach to rock-solid tech, the Bulls Squad brings personality and purpose to this meme movement. And let’s not lie—who doesn’t love a coin with a mascot that vibes with the times? Then there’s the BTFD play-to-earn game, which is already live and fully functioning. You earn tokens while laughing, blasting through levels with the Bulls, and unlocking power-ups. It’s got all the bells and whistles Gen Z and crypto-native gamers love, plus an in-game economy that ties directly into the BTFD ecosystem . And if you like passive income, check this—staking rewards up to 90% APY are available, turning your bag into a yield-generating beast. With staking kicking in during the early stages, long-term holders are already seeing their bags bulk up before launch. Oh, and don’t miss the referral program. Share your link, get mates to invest $50 or more, and they get 10% extra in BTFD tokens. If you make it into the top 20 on the leaderboard, you’ll pocket 10% of what your referrals spend—paid in tokens. It’s proper community growth with a reward twist. With over $6.45 million, over 72 billion coins sold, 11,700+ holders, and only one stage left before it hits exchanges, this presale window is vanishing fast. Miss this best meme coin presale now, and you might be chasing green candles later like a punter at Ladbrokes. This coin’s made it to the list of the top new meme coins to invest in this month because the Bulls Squad is building a real movement, not just another meme flash in the pan. 2. Floki Inu (FLOKI) – From Viking Ship to VVIP Status Floki Inu’s been sailing strong this year with major ecosystem expansions. The team has doubled down on utility with FlokiFi Locker and Floki University, making it one of the few meme coins giving holders educational tools and DeFi security. With a die-hard Viking army and top-tier meme branding, Floki keeps storming into trending charts. It’s earned its spot among the top new meme coins to invest in this month for continuously proving that meme coins can pack brains and brawn. 3. Brett (BRETT) – The Smiley Face of Base BRETT is the native meme prince of the Base Chain, and it’s not shy about it. Inspired by Matt Furie’s cartoons, BRETT has surged in social media circles as the “friendly face” of on-chain vibes. It’s already cemented itself as a staple of the Base ecosystem. As the Base Chain rises, so does BRETT’s street cred. Think of it like catching Pepe before it went nuclear. BRETT lands on this list for mastering the art of relatability with meme-native flair. 4. Baby Doge Coin (BABYDOGE) – The OG Pup Still Barking Loud Don’t count out the baby of the Doge family. BABYDOGE continues making headlines with its burn strategy—burning over 200 quadrillion tokens recently—and ongoing efforts to push mass adoption via partnerships and donation drives. Its community-first approach and charity integration make it a crowd favorite even today. It deserves this spot among the top new meme coins to invest in this month for proving staying power and evolving in a competitive meme jungle. 5. Turbo (TURBO) – From Chat to Chart-Topper Turbo was born as a joke—literally created with AI help—but it’s become one of the most-watched meme coins in the space. Thanks to its clever branding and engagement-focused team, Turbo’s transformed from a meme into a movement. It’s quirky, cheeky, and consistently riding high on social trends, especially among younger investors. It’s made this list for flipping the script—starting as a joke and turning it into a gem. 6. Popcat (POPCAT) – The Click Heard Around the World POPCAT turned a meme of a cat opening its mouth into a full-blown crypto project. No, seriously. But this isn’t just a gimmick—the Popcat game saw crazy traction in Asia and beyond. The coin piggybacks off that viral fame, bringing in new users with gamified click-to-earn mechanics. If you believe in the power of meme virality, Popcat’s your bet for meme magic turning into market cap.

The space is buzzing with fresh presales, and investors are always on the lookout for the next hidden gem. While Dogwifhat and TST are making waves, one new meme coin is creating a storm of excitement in the crypto world— Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) . This project stands out because of its innovative approach to token burns, presale structure, and staking rewards. As Arctic Pablo enters new phases and climbs in value, the window to secure tokens at rock-bottom prices is narrowing. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, Dogwifhat, and TST. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Token Burn Revolution and Location-Based Presale When it comes to new meme coins, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is setting itself apart with an innovative presale structure and a deflationary approach that fuels excitement among investors. The presale is uniquely structured around geographical locations—the presale price increases each time Arctic Pablo “travels” to a new place. Currently, the coin is in its 17th stage at Glacial Glade, where the price stands at just $0.000087. But here’s the kicker—investors who enter now can expect a jaw-dropping ROI of 9,084.48% as the price reaches its listing point of $0.008. The excitement doesn’t end there. Arctic Pablo’s token burn mechanism plays a pivotal role in creating scarcity, ultimately enhancing the remaining tokens’ value. Every week, unsold tokens are permanently burned, and once the presale ends, any leftover tokens will also be burned. This continuous token burn strategy creates a deflationary cycle that can significantly increase scarcity and boost the value for early investors. On top of that, Arctic Pablo offers a robust staking program with a high 66% APY during the presale, enabling investors to earn rewards as they stake their tokens. Referral incentives are also available, creating a ripple effect as more investors spread the word about this exciting project. Community-driven competitions add to the excitement, with rewards in APC tokens or even USD up for grabs. The price continues to climb as the Arctic Pablo Coin presale advances through different phases. Getting in now while the price is still low can be a game-changer. With over $2 million already raised, Arctic Pablo is proving to be one of the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in April 2025 —but hurry, opportunities like this don’t last forever. Don’t Miss Out: Arctic Pablo’s Glacial Glade Presale Phase At present, Arctic Pablo Coin has reached its Glacial Glade stage, and the pressure is building. With only a limited amount of time left to enter at $0.000087, the opportunity to grab tokens at such a low price is slipping away. As the meme coin presale progresses, the price will continue to rise, especially as the project ventures into new locations. Don’t let this chance pass by—early investors who jump in now could experience significant returns once the coin hits exchanges at $0.008. The current ROI from Glacial Glade is over 9,084.48%, which makes this an unparalleled opportunity for those looking to invest in meme coins with massive potential. Remember, prices rise as Arctic Pablo “travels,” so getting in now could make all the difference. Dogwifhat: A Strong Community and Latest Updates Dogwifhat continues to make headlines with its strong community backing and its unique tokenomics. Recently, it announced the launch of its new staking platform, which promises high rewards for long-term holders. The platform has been well-received by its growing user base, making it an attractive option for those seeking steady growth. TST: What’s New in the Meme Coin Space? TST has also been making waves in the meme coin market, with the latest update highlighting its partnership with a leading blockchain project. This new partnership is expected to bring more exposure and investment to the TST ecosystem. Additionally, the team behind TST has announced that it will be launching a new NFT marketplace that will allow users to buy, sell, and trade exclusive TST-related NFTs. This move aims to expand the utility of the token beyond traditional use cases, making it an interesting player in the space. Final Words: Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Way In the fast-moving world of meme coins, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as a project that’s not only innovative but also offers significant ROI potential. While Dogwifhat and TST are making their mark with community-driven features and updates, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale structure, token burn mechanism, and staking rewards make it a unique and exciting investment for April 2025. With over $2 million already raised and a presale price that’s still at a bargain, now is the time to get involved. Don’t miss the chance to be part of Arctic Pablo’s journey—invest now and watch as this coin soars in value.

Cardano’s price is headed below 50 cents in search of a new support zone that can serve as a springboard to reach new highs. Cardano Price Can Still Clinch $1 Despite Price Slump Market technician Jonathan Carter in an analysis on X predicts that Cardano’s price can reclaim the $1 price point in the coming months. According to Carter, the recent ADA correction will not be a hindrance for Cardano’s price to reach $1. ADA has lost a jarring 13% over the last week and trades at $0.64 in an unremarkable week for the cryptocurrency. On the daily charts, prices have generally moved sideways, underscoring a lack of investor enthusiasm. For Carter, Cardano’s recent decline has seen it fail to stay above the $0.65 support level. The analyst opined that a downtrend is the offing for the Cardano price that could see a new support zone of $0.59. Carter says the new $0.59 support zone will hurl Cardano price to reach $1. “Despite the long correction, the price still has a chance to bounce off this support and rise towards $1,” said Carter. “Otherwise, we will fall to the lower border of the broadening wedge.” While some investors are eyeing an ADA bounce to $0.70 , a plausible play will be a slump below $0.60 before the start of a rally. A Slew Of Positives For ADA Despite the pervading negative sentiment around ADA price, the cryptocurrency has a wave of positive fundamentals going for it. Cardano price spiked following Charles Hoskinson’s confirmation of Ripple’s RLUSD on ADA. Furthermore, Charles Hoskinson reveals that Cardano will play a major role in Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi) application. In more positive technicals, Cardano price is forming a cyclical pattern from 2024 that can send prices to astronomical proportions in May. While the prediction pegged prices at $2.5, optimists say ADA price to $10 is not a crazy hypothesis. The report cites present solid fundamentals and ADA’s over 1,000% spike to set its all-time high back in 2021 as pointers for the seismic rally to $10.

BlockDAG, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coin are gaining significant recognition for their robust growth amidst a fluctuating market. Each project has carved a unique path to success, but their exceptional performance is a common trait. This overview highlights the key drivers behind the strong performance of these best crypto project contenders this year. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): The Remarkable 2,380% Rise BlockDAG (BDAG) has rapidly ascended in the market rankings, thanks to its modern Directed Acyclic Graph structure. This framework facilitates parallel processing, which enhances throughput and scalability significantly. Transactions are processed swiftly without delays, enabling scalable growth. From its initial offering price of $0.001 to the current $0.0248, BDAG has surged by 2,380%, accumulating over $210.5 million in raised funds. This growth is not just speculative—it”s supported by solid development. Looking ahead, the potential for BDAG is substantial. With its mainnet debut approaching this year and plans to list on 10 leading centralized exchanges, increased utility and user engagement are expected. This expansion is likely to further elevate the coin’s value, with experts predicting a potential rise to $1 in 2025 and reaching up to $30 by 2030. This trajectory is why BlockDAG is recognized as one of the best crypto project success stories of the year. 2. Litecoin (LTC): Combining Speed with Stability Litecoin (LTC) maintains its status as a best crypto project due to its established reputation and practical application. Originating as a Bitcoin fork, it delivers quicker transactions and reduced costs, which are perfect for regular payments. The creation of Charlie Lee, Litecoin is supported by effective leadership, robust liquidity, and a dependable network. Its limited total supply of 84 million and diminishing block rewards enhance its rarity. Currently valued around $95 and anticipated to approach $100, Litecoin’s stable valuation underscores its consistent efficacy and practical use, confirming its position as a leading alternative cryptocurrency. 3. Ethereum (ETH): Revolutionizing with Smart Contracts Ethereum (ETH) has revolutionized the blockchain landscape by introducing smart contracts, enabling the development of decentralized applications across numerous sectors. Co-created by Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum underpins a significant portion of the Web3 infrastructure, from DeFi systems to NFT marketplaces, sustaining high demand for ETH and securing its position as a best crypto project. With its current price at approximately $2,070 and predictions of future price increases, Ethereum continues to draw developers and long-term holders alike. Its vibrant ecosystem, extensive liquidity, and widespread usage underscore its enduring strength and versatility as one of the globe’s most utilized cryptocurrencies. 4. Binance Coin (BNB): Driving a Major Crypto Ecosystem Binance Coin (BNB) remains a best crypto project through its integral role within the Binance exchange ecosystem. Holders enjoy benefits such as trading fee discounts, access to launchpad events, and the expanding utility within Binance’s broadening services. Trading at about $630 currently, BNB consistently demonstrates robust trading volume and liquidity. Beyond many utility tokens, BNB presents continuous application and genuine demand. Those looking for a cryptocurrency with tangible utility and the backing of a leading platform find BNB to be a dependable and strategic choice. Closing Thoughts: What Sets These Coins Apart in 2025 Each cryptocurrency listed here has secured its spot for specific reasons. Litecoin offers simplicity and speed. Ethereum continues to lead with its foundational smart contracts. Binance Coin showcases the strength of a crypto ecosystem’s demand. However, BlockDAG sets itself apart by not merely enhancing existing frameworks but by innovating the foundational structure itself. Its remarkable ascent from $0.001 to $0.0248, marking a 2,380% increase, highlights its rapid scalability and burgeoning popularity. With such impressive advancements, it’s clear why BlockDAG is recognized as the best crypto project this year, with potential to maintain its lead.

Dive into the 25-Stage Dragoin Presale for 6,700% ROI Potential!",https://thecoinrise.com/on-the-hunt-for-massive-crypto-gains-dive-into-the-25-stage-dragoin-presale-for-6700-roi-potential/,"Dragoin is breaking the mold of traditional presales with an exciting 25-stage presale featuring fantasy storytelling and big rewards. The first stage is now live, with tokens priced at just $0.0000292. By the time the final stage closes at $0.002 per token, early buyers could see a potential gain of up to 6,700%. However, the appeal of Dragoin’s presale goes beyond discounted tokens and high percentages. Each of the 25 presale stages is themed around legendary fantasy stories, adding excitement with every passing phase. Buyers aren’t just securing tokens; they’re entering an adventure! As each stage progresses, the price of Dragoin tokens increases, rewarding early buyers and punishing those who wait too long. Hesitant buyers will face diminishing returns, paying more for fewer tokens. The longer you wait, the more you pay, and the fewer tokens you’ll get. An Adventure-Fueled Presale Unlike typical crypto presales, Dragoin’s model offers a unique journey that ties into well-known fantasy tales. Stage 1, “The Fall of Valyria,” offers the lowest price and the best value. Early participants at this stage can secure tokens at the ground level, positioning themselves for higher returns as the presale progresses. The excitement only builds as Dragoin reaches later stages. By Stage 10, “The Battle of the Bastards,” token prices will already have risen significantly. As the presale advances, for example, Stage 15, “The Trident Clash,” will clearly highlight the advantage of buying early, with tokens purchased at earlier stages becoming more valuable. Each new stage offers fresh excitement, more intricate storylines, and a higher token price, encouraging early action to maximize returns. The Cost of Waiting – Paying More and Getting Less It’s crucial to understand that delaying your purchase doesn’t just mean paying a bit more—it means paying much more. At Stage 1, tokens are priced at a low $0.0000292, but that price will rise significantly with each stage. Once a stage ends, the chance to buy at that price disappears forever. Late buyers will pay considerably more per token and receive fewer tokens for the same investment. For instance, those waiting until Stage 20, “Defending the Eyrie,” will pay several times the price per token compared to those who acted at Stage 1. This cuts into their potential profits and limits the number of tokens they can acquire. Each passing stage is a missed opportunity. The longer you wait, the fewer tokens you get and the lower your future profit potential. Strategic Scarcity – Tokens Burned at Every Stage Dragoin’s presale also introduces a scarcity factor that boosts the value of the tokens. Under this model, unsold tokens are burned at the end of each stage, permanently reducing the overall supply. This creates scarcity, which can drive up the value of the remaining tokens. As tokens are burned, early buyers benefit by holding a larger share of the available supply. Entering the presale early means securing more tokens, while later buyers will face the impact of limited availability and higher prices. This mechanism incentivizes immediate participation, as waiting through multiple stages will result in higher prices and fewer tokens to purchase. Early Buyers Reap the Rewards of Dragoin’s Tokenomics Dragoin’s tokenomics are especially designed to benefit those who act quickly. Out of the total 200 billion tokens, half (50%) are allocated to the presale. This ensures that early participants have exclusive advantages. The remaining 50% is allocated to other important functions such as ecosystem development, long-term liquidity, and token security. Of this, 5% is reserved for the team and locked for two years to prevent any immediate token sales by the developers. The remaining 30% supports community rewards, such as staking and gaming incentives, which will foster the growth of Dragoin’s ecosystem. This strategic allocation ensures a well-balanced and sustainable approach, giving early buyers the confidence that their involvement is supported by careful planning. Why Early Action is Key – Benefits for Fast Movers At Dragoin’s Stage 1 presale, tokens are priced at just $0.0000292, offering the best possible returns. By Stage 25, the price will reach $0.002, offering a substantial potential return of up to 6,700%. Each delay means a higher price per token and fewer tokens available. The presale’s 25 fantasy-themed stages, with their escalating prices, create a compelling reason to act fast. Delaying will only reduce potential profits and limit how much can be purchased. In summary, early buyers have a significant advantage in Dragoin’s presale. The opportunity to purchase tokens at a low price, paired with the potential for high returns, makes early action crucial. Don’t miss out on your chance to be part of the exciting journey—join now at Stage 1 for the best possible deal and biggest potential rewards.

Internet Computer continues to focus on reshaping the web through decentralization, while Bitget Token earns investor trust by delivering practical exchange benefits and maintaining clear financials. Both tokens have made progress. But neither has sparked the kind of investor reaction BlockDAG saw right after Keynote 3. Within just 48 hours, BlockDAG added $5 million to its presale. That spike wasn’t fueled by hype—it was about what buyers could actually see. With its Beta Testnet now live and mining gear already shipped, BlockDAG’s rise is grounded in delivery. For many buyers, that’s when interest turns into serious funding. Internet Computer (ICP): Pushing for a Web Built on Decentralization Internet Computer (ICP), a project from the DFINITY Foundation, is working to change how the internet functions. It aims to let developers build and run decentralized apps on the web without using traditional cloud services. Its smart contracts, called “canisters,” are designed to run at the speed of the web and scale efficiently. Launched in May 2021, ICP gave early investors access through presales and community distributions. As of now, ICP trades at about $5.29. Over the past year, the price has been unstable, ranging from a low of $6.66 to a high of $32.40. While the price has dropped from its peaks, loyal supporters continue to believe in its long-term goal of building a decentralized internet. New services such as decentralized social platforms and open web tools keep the project alive. Despite the price shifts, ICP’s bold vision and technical depth still attract developer and investor interest. Bitget Token (BGB): Powering Exchange Features with Steady Growth Bitget Token (BGB) supports the Bitget exchange by offering users multiple perks. These include reduced trading fees, staking, early access to Launchpad events, and exclusive features. Initially rolled out via private and exchange listings, BGB has built momentum. Currently, it trades at around $4.57 and holds a market cap of $5.49 billion. Over the past year, it’s steadily gained value, with some projections expecting a price of $5.41 before the year ends. BGB’s upward trend is linked to Bitget’s broader expansion, including improved copy trading tools and global sponsorships. A big factor in user trust is Bitget’s financial openness—confirmed by a 213% proof-of-reserve ratio in March 2025. For early holders, this mix of utility, exchange growth, and clear reserves makes BGB a strong long-term play within centralized platforms. $5M in Two Days: How Keynote 3 Caught the Attention of Crypto Whales Big traders rarely react to noise—they wait for clear signs of progress. That’s what made the two days after BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 so striking. In that short period, $5 million poured into the project’s presale, sending a clear message that large players were jumping in. BlockDAG isn’t selling promises—it’s delivering products. Its “Primordial” Beta Testnet is up and running. Wallet activity is growing. Mining equipment has already reached users. These aren’t concepts—they’re working parts of the ecosystem. For bigger buyers, seeing systems in action makes it easier to trust the project. The numbers reflect that trust. BlockDAG has raised $210.5 million through 27 presale rounds, selling over 19.1 billion coins. The current price is $0.0248, a 2,380% gain for those who bought during batch 1. That kind of return, supported by real updates and steady progress, is tough for buyers to overlook. Whales aren’t drawn to hype—they follow results. And Keynote 3 gave them exactly that. In crypto, visible progress often leads to serious investment. The recent increase in whale buying may point to more than just short-term interest—it could be a deeper belief in BlockDAG’s future. Key Highlights! Internet Computer and Bitget Token have both earned their places—one through its push for a decentralized web, the other by growing a trusted exchange utility. Each offers something real. But the jump in BlockDAG’s whale activity signals something different: response to action. With a testnet that’s already live, mining units shipped, and wallets active, the numbers speak for themselves. BlockDAG’s $5 million jump after Keynote 3 wasn’t about wishful thinking—it was a response to systems already working. When money starts flowing this fast, it usually means there’s nothing left to doubt. BlockDAG made that clear for everyone watching.

Despite a strong start to the year, where the crypto market experienced bullish momentum, ETH has failed to sustain its upward trajectory. Since slipping below the $3,000 level, the asset has largely ranged downward and has now breached the $2,000 support zone, signaling weakening demand and sentiment. While Bitcoin and other major digital assets still managed to see some recovery efforts in recent weeks, Ethereum’s price decline has been accompanied by decreasing network activity and weakening on-chain fundamentals. This divergence has raised concerns over ETH’s short-term outlook and prompted a fresh analysis of the underlying causes driving the asset’s performance. Related Reading: Whales Dump 760,000 Ethereum in Two Weeks — Is More Selling Ahead? Fee Decline and Network Inactivity Fuel Inflationary Pressures CryptoQuant analyst EgyHash recently published a report highlighting key on-chain metrics that suggest Ethereum’s current market weakness is closely tied to its declining fee economy and user activity. According to the report titled: “Why Ethereum Is Bleeding Value: Fee Crash Meets Hyperinflation Hellscape.” Ethereum’s network is experiencing its lowest levels of activity since 2020. Daily active addresses have declined steadily since early 2025, and average transaction fees have dropped to record lows. This reduction in activity has led to a sharp fall in Ethereum’s burn rate, a metric crucial in offsetting inflationary pressures following the network’s transition to proof-of-stake. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Approaches Resistance—Will It Smash Through? The Dencun upgrade, which was expected to enhance network efficiency, has coincided with an extended period of low transaction volumes, further reducing fee income and contributing to higher net ETH issuance. EgyHash concludes that the confluence of weak network engagement, reduced burn rate, and high token inflation is central to Ethereum’s declining valuation. Why Ethereum Is Bleeding Value “Ethereum’s recent underperformance can be largely attributed to diminished network activity, as evidenced by declining active addresses and reduced transaction fees.” – By @EgyHashX pic.twitter.com/fgQJYCrOIn — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) April 3, 2025 Ethereum Technical Outlook Signals Potential Support Despite on-chain headwinds, some technical analysts maintain a cautiously optimistic view. Trader Courage, a technical analyst on X, noted that Ethereum is currently testing a major support zone and could rebound toward the upper resistance of its current trading range. $ETH / #ETH 1H chart 📊 Back at the green support line.

As blockchain continues to transform industries, some projects are standing out more than others. Litecoin and Injective have long been considered strong assets in the crypto market, but a new player, Qubetics, has arrived with solutions to problems that even these established projects have yet to address. So, what’s next? Is Qubetics poised to become the best cheap crypto to buy now, offering solutions that blockchain developers and businesses need to thrive? Now, how does Qubetics fit into the world of blockchain, and what sets it apart from Litecoin and Injective? While Litecoin has gained traction with its use in digital transactions and Injective has pushed the envelope with decentralized finance (DeFi), Qubetics looks to bring a more comprehensive solution that not only integrates with existing systems but enhances them with true interoperability. The future of blockchain is all about efficiency, and Qubetics is leading the charge toward making digital finance smoother, faster, and more adaptable. Qubetics: Interoperability Revolutionizing the Blockchain World Qubetics stands as a solution to the fragmentation present in today’s blockchain networks. While other blockchain systems, such as Litecoin and Injective, focus on specific niches, Qubetics introduces a level of interoperability that directly addresses gaps in cross-chain communication. In simple terms, interoperability ensures that different blockchain networks can work together seamlessly—this is a game-changer. Imagine a business trying to integrate multiple digital payment systems but facing roadblocks due to the inability to connect different blockchain technologies. With Qubetics, this problem is a thing of the past. It enables businesses to execute cross-chain transactions effortlessly, allowing seamless operations between various blockchain ecosystems. This makes Qubetics the best cheap crypto to buy now for anyone looking to support innovation that solves real-world problems. Numbers That Speak Louder: Qubetics’ Presale Momentum and $200 Scenarios Qubetics is powering through Stage 28 of its top crypto presale . The numbers reflect a community that’s not just watching but acting. With over $15.8 million raised, 24,300+ token holders, and 506 million $TICS sold, the interest isn’t speculative—it’s strategic. Each $TICS token is currently priced at $0.1430, making it one of the most accessible and potentially rewarding presale tokens this year. Consider this: a $200 allocation at today’s rate secures approximately 1,398 $TICS tokens. If the price reaches $1 per token, that $200 turns into $1,398—a 599% return. At $5, the same tokens would be worth $6,990, showing the power of early entry. If $TICS climbs to $10, that initial $200 skyrockets to $13,980. And if it touches $15, the return would be an impressive $20,970. These numbers highlight the potential upside for those who position themselves early in a project with strong utility and growing adoption. These aren’t promises—they’re possibilities grounded in utility and community traction. When real-world solutions meet mass adoption, exponential outcomes aren’t fantasy—they’re the natural result. Litecoin: A Stable Player in Digital Finance Litecoin has always been one of the most reliable digital assets in the market. Created as a “lighter” version of Bitcoin, Litecoin has distinguished itself with faster transaction times and a more accessible entry point. Its recent integration into retirement accounts through Fidelity’s “Crypto IRA” service is a clear indication of its staying power in the digital finance ecosystem. This integration marks an important milestone, showing how Litecoin is becoming an integral part of long-term savings strategies. In the context of market volatility, Litecoin has managed to maintain its position as one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Analysts have noted that Litecoin’s performance is poised for growth, especially if it maintains support above $100. Recent developments, such as the addition of Litecoin to retirement plans, make it even more appealing to community members looking for a stable crypto asset to complement their portfolios. With its transaction speed and reliability, Litecoin remains a solid choice for those looking to hold long-term in the crypto market. Yet, while Litecoin offers stability, it lacks the level of interoperability that newer projects like Qubetics bring to the table. As such, it remains a strong option for those seeking a trustworthy and low-risk entry, but it’s clear that for blockchain developers and businesses craving more expansive solutions, Qubetics might soon take the spotlight. Injective: DeFi’s Leading Light Injective Protocol has firmly positioned itself as a leader in decentralized finance (DeFi), with its cutting-edge cross-chain trading solutions. Injective’s unique value proposition lies in its ability to allow traders to access decentralized exchanges (DEXs) with minimal barriers to entry. Its recent “Learn & Earn” campaign proves the project’s commitment to educating and expanding its user base, while the upcoming “Injective Builder Day” in Seoul showcases its continuous focus on community engagement. The strength of Injective lies in its technological advancements, particularly in its cross-chain trading mechanisms. By offering users the ability to trade assets across multiple blockchains seamlessly, Injective is catering to a growing demand for decentralized exchanges that work without the need for intermediaries. As a result, it’s quickly becoming one of the go-to solutions for DeFi enthusiasts. However, while its solutions are robust, they still rely on the ecosystem of DEXs to function. This is where Qubetics shines with its more holistic approach to interoperability across all blockchain sectors, making it a potential competitor to Injective’s position in the future of digital finance. Qubetics, Litecoin, and Injective: A Comprehensive Comparison When considering the best cheap crypto to buy now, all three of these projects stand out in their own ways. Litecoin remains a stable choice with its adoption in retirement accounts and quick transaction speeds. Injective is leading the charge in DeFi, offering decentralized trading and smart contracts that break down the walls of traditional finance. However, Qubetics brings a fresh, innovative approach to solving the key issues of blockchain interoperability and real-world applications. For developers and businesses looking for seamless connections across multiple blockchain systems, Qubetics offers the potential for transformative change. Its ability to integrate disparate systems into a unified, efficient process is exactly what the blockchain industry needs to scale. As more people begin to realize the long-term potential of this interoperability solution, Qubetics could very well surpass other assets in its category, offering significant returns for early community members. The current presale stage of Qubetics demonstrates immense potential for growth, especially as the technology evolves. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on the Future of Blockchain Solutions As the blockchain industry matures, interoperability will become more critical than ever. Qubetics is here to fill that gap, offering a practical solution to real-world challenges while showing early signs of a major impact on the digital finance sector. As the presale continues to gain momentum, now is the time to consider getting involved with one of the most promising projects on the market. In conclusion, while Litecoin and Injective continue to serve specific niches within the digital finance world, Qubetics is poised to become the go-to solution for bridging the gap between disparate blockchain ecosystems. The question isn’t whether Qubetics is the best cheap crypto to buy now —it’s whether you’ll be part of this transformative journey.

The NIA is responsible for promoting foreign investments and assisting international companies in identifying business opportunities within the country. Source: Changpeng Zhao “This cooperation marks an important step towards strengthening technological infrastructure, implementing innovative solutions, and preparing highly qualified specialists in blockchain technologies, virtual asset management, and cybersecurity,” Zhaparov said. The Kyrgyzstan president added: “such initiatives are crucial for the sustainable growth of the economy and the security of virtual assets, ultimately generating new opportunities for businesses and society as a whole.” Kyrgyzstan, which officially changed its name from the Republic of Kyrgyzstan to the Kyrgyz Republic in 1993, is a mountainous, land-locked country. It is considered well-suited for crypto mining operations due to its abundant renewable energy resources, much of which is underutilized. Over 30% of Kyrgyzstan’s total energy supply comes from hydroelectric power plants, but only 10% of the country’s potential hydropower has been developed, according to a report by the International Energy Agency. CZ has met with several other state officials in Asia Malaysia also recently tapped CZ for guidance on crypto-related matters, with Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim meeting him personally in January. CZ has also met with officials in the UAE and Bitcoin-stacking country Bhutan — however, it isn’t clear what those meetings entailed. Related: Is Bitcoin’s future in circular economies or national reserves? CZ’s latest pursuits come a little over six months after he was released from a four-month prison sentence in the US for violating several anti-money laundering laws. Since being released, CZ has made investments in blockchain tech, artificial intelligence and biotechnology companies. CZ also recently donated 1,000 BNB ( BNB ) — worth almost $600,000 — to support earthquake relief efforts in Thailand and Myanmar after the natural disaster in late April.

Based on estimates using tariff costs paid in 2024, American big tech companies could face daily expenses ranging from $1 billion to $2 billion. The new tariff policy is set to cost U.S. businesses an estimated $654 billion a year. That figure is projected to grow even further when considering up to an additional $300 billion in tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act on products like steel, aluminum, and autos. “If this holds up in court, then we are waking up to a new global economy with a different set of costs than we have known for the last several decades,” said Josh Teitelbaum, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce during the Obama administration. Big tech companies may suffer The U.S. stock market suffered its worst daily loss since 2020 on Thursday. The effects reach beyond Apple in the tech sector. The company has already seen its worst stock drop since the COVID-19 outbreak. While Apple is particularly vulnerable due to its heavy reliance on Asian manufacturing, the new tariff framework puts the entire tech sector’s trade surplus under the microscope. According to Cesar Hidalgo, a professor at the Toulouse School of Economics, tech giants have long benefited from a large trade surplus with the rest of the world. Alphabet exported $141 billion in services, followed by Meta with $71.2 billion, Oracle at $45.2 billion, Amazon at $40.2 billion, IBM at $31.9 billion, and Microsoft at $31.6 billion. Apple stock price. Source: Google Finance. The US exported $2 trillion in physical goods in 2024, while importing around $3.27 trillion. On the surface, this suggests a trade deficit of roughly $1 trillion. However, the digital economy is different. Every time a foreigner streams a movie on Netflix or purchases an ad on Facebook, the United States is effectively exporting its digital services. “We estimate that the U.S. enjoys a trade surplus of at least $600 billion in digital products,” Hidalgo explained. U.S. exports in digital advertising and cloud computing reached about $260 billion and $184 billion, respectively. Hidalgo noted that these figures are even larger than the country’s exports of crude or refined petroleum, which have long been considered one of its major export products. Trade retaliation, however, may not be limited to digital services. Jason Miller, an assistant professor at Michigan State University, warned that massive foreign countermeasures are likely. This means that U.S. exports in tech industries like aerospace, machinery, electrical equipment, computers and electronic products, and energy could all face significant tariff-based retaliation. Could big tech actually benefit from the trade war? The trade war has also raised questions about whether big tech companies could ultimately benefit from the administration’s aggressive tactics. With Wall Street in a state of panic and allies around the globe voicing their displeasure, the fallout from Trump’s trade policies continues to grow. Some of the world’s richest companies might see gains if Trump can successfully negotiate better terms. Issues ranging from the sale of TikTok to digital services taxes, and even Europe’s antitrust actions against Silicon Valley giants, have now become part of the broader trade dispute. Yet the question remains – What exactly does Trump want in exchange for easing these tariffs? Michael Froman, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, addressed the issue on the POLITICO Tech podcast. “Leverage is only good if you take it out for a drive,” Froman said, stressing that the administration must clearly outline what it expects in return from other nations. “You’ve got to be able to lay out for the other countries, for the other markets what it is you want them to change, or do, in order to reduce the tariffs, get rid of the tariffs,” he explained. He noted that, so far, the Trump administration has not provided a detailed plan outlining these demands. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Most of the survey respondents said they were turning to crypto in hope of making “big” returns on their investments. Brazilian Crypto Interest on the Rise The survey, conducted by Locomotiva, was commissioned by the crypto exchange Binance, the Portuguese-language media outlet Livecoins reported. Trading volumes on Bitso, one of Latin America’s most popular crypto exchanges, over the past year. (Source: CoinGecko) The researchers found that interest in cryptoassets has now risen higher than demand for stocks, private pensions, government bonds, and even foreign currencies. The survey compilers said that they spoke to 1,000 people aged between 25 and 45 with “investments in addition to cash savings.” The results showed that crypto investments are equal in popularity with investment funds. But crypto’s popularity outpaces high interest-bearing payment accounts and private bonds. The data also shows that 55% of respondents said they have made at least three forms of investment.” The remaining 45% said they have made “four or more types of investment.” Brazil's central bank chief sees need for reforms to unblock monetary policy transmission channels https://t.co/ft3xPZAIx5 pic.twitter.com/BCLkoKiwWS — Reuters (@Reuters) April 2, 2025 Liquidity a Draw While most investors said that the hopes of “high returns” had motivated them to buy crypto, others said they were attracted to the crypto market’s “high liquidity.” Others still said they felt crypto offered them “independence from the traditional financial system” and “secure transactions.” The study’s authors noted that crypto investment levels were noticeably higher among men, as well as people with higher levels of education. People with higher levels of income and knowledge about investments also tend to prefer crypto as an investment tool, the authors added.

This filing aims to launch XRP futures on April 21, 2025, offering both institutional and retail investors a regulated way to gain exposure to XRP in a more capital-efficient manner. The filing marks a significant development for XRP’s broader market acceptance, especially in regulated environments where futures contracts provide both liquidity and opportunities for risk management. XRP Futures: Regulatory Developments and Market Entry Through self-certification with the CFTC, Coinbase is allowed to bring in XRP futures without waiting for an explicit green light from the agency, so long as it complies with the necessary rules. This approach is normally used by exchanges especially when they are introducing new corporate securities in the market place. In launching XRP futures into its product line, Coinbase Derivatives is placing into the market a new structured trading product, which may enhance the liquidity and invite more institutional investors into the asset. We're excited to announce that Coinbase Derivatives has filed with the CFTC to self-certify $XRP futures – bringing a regulated, capital-efficient way to gain exposure to one of the most liquid digital assets. We anticipate the contract going live on April 21, 2025. Stay tuned… pic.twitter.com/nKUPjjnMKW — Coinbase Institutional (@CoinbaseInsto) April 3, 2025 The futures contracts are useful for the purposes of hedging or speculation, they can make XRP more accessible to new investors. At the same time, one of the largest US-based crypto exchange, Kraken, incorporated Ripple USD (RLUSD) among cryptocurrencies traded on the platform. Before that list, RLUSD was available only in Bitstamp exchange. The integration of Kraken into the list of XRP trading platforms increases trading volume in the asset and deepens the pool of institutional actors interacting with the asset. XRP Price Trend Amid New Futures Announcement At the time of this writing, various technical levels was observed for XRP. Earlier last night, in a live stream, experts pointed out that XRP price tested .382 retracement level which was a major resistance level. This level was tested on the higher end before being rejected and the current focus now lies at the possibility of a downside towards the $1.95 price level. Lately, $1.90 has been considered as another important support level, and in case of the XRP drop below this level, further correction should be expected. However, if XRP manages to establish or maintain a price above these levels, it can be expected that the market is positioning for a bounce, especially if there is the bullish RSI divergence. Source: X Consequently, the next XRP price move is critical. A successful retest of these lower levels, coupled with signs of strength from the relative strength index (RSI), could suggest that XRP is nearing a bottom before a potential breakout. If the price holds steady at $1.90, a strong rally into a new wave higher may be on the horizon. Community Reaction To Coinbase Filing Although the filing has attracted attention, it has also caused controversies in the cryptocurrency community. Coinbase first publicly mentioned the futures product as “Ripple futures” in a now-removed tweet which angered XRP holders. This confusion occurred because Ripple is the name of the company that developed the XRP blockchain, XRP on the other hand refers to the token itself. A user by the name of Adam on X (previously twitter) was able to differentiate the two and wrote to Coinbase asking them to edit the terms. In his response, he stressed that one should differentiate between Ripple and XRP by stating that “Ripple is a private company while XRP is its digital asset,” he said. Coinbase immediately amended the error and confirmed that it is actually offering XRP futures. Meanwhile, late last month, Crypto Options and Futures Exchange Bitnomial announced the launch of its XRP futures contract. This new product has been on the exchange’s radar since at least October 2024.

A New York District court issued the preliminary injunction (PI) and temporary restraining order (TRO) on March 13 in connection with a broader dispute surrounding its merger with Fatbrain AI, the Genius Group said in an April 3 statement. Fatbrain AI and Genius Group completed a merger and purchase agreement in March 2024, but by Oct. 30, Genius initiated arbitration procedures to terminate, alleging fraud by Fatbrain AI executives connected to the deal. Source: Roger James Hamilton In February, Fatbrain AI executives Michael Moe and Peter Ritz filed for the TRO and permanent injunction, blocking Genius Group from selling its shares, raising funds and buying more Bitcoin pending the arbitration outcome. The injunction has forced Genius Group to close divisions, halt marketing activities and sell 10 Bitcoin ( BTC ) from its stash of 440 , worth over $23 million at current prices, to continue funding its operations. The firm hasn’t ruled out more sales in the future. “Genius is taking all necessary measures to minimize Bitcoin sales but anticipates that it will need to downsize its Bitcoin Treasury in the coming months in the event the PI remains in place,” the firm said. Fatbrain AI shareholders also filed two lawsuits against Fatbrain AI executives, including Moe and Ritz, and Genius Group, in April 2024, alleging violation of federal securities laws in connection with the merger, ASX law said in an October statement. Two shareholder lawsuits against Fatbrain AI alleged conduct during the merger was fraudulent, which defrauded shareholders of $30 million. Source: ASX Law Genius Group was subsequently voluntarily dismissed from the suits on Feb. 14. Genius Group claims it’s breaking Singapore law by following order Genius Group says the US court injunction has also forced it to break Singapore law by halting share compensation to employees as part of its employment agreements. “We never dreamed that it was possible that a US court could block the company from being able to issue shares, raise funds or buy Bitcoin — all actions that would normally be decided by a public company's shareholders or Board rather than a court,” said Genius Group CEO Roger James Hamilton.

Back in March 2024, Slerf (SLERF) proved that even chaotic launches can make millionaires overnight. Early adopters saw a once-in-a-lifetime price run. But if you missed that moonshot, don’t beat yourself up. You’ve got another chance—this time, it’s called BTFD Coin (BTFD) . BTFD is the top new meme coin to invest in for short term . It’s deep in its 15th presale stage with a price of just $0.0002. Over $6.45 million has already been raised, more than 72 billion coins sold, and over 11,700 bullish holders are locked in. With only one stage left before launch, this is your window to catch the next big meme coin wave. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – 90% APY, 2900% ROI, and Just One Stage Left Let’s talk facts. BTFD presale isn’t riding the hype wave blindly. This coin is built for both degens and disciplined crypto investors. You’re not just throwing cash at a meme—you’re joining a utility-packed movement with staking, gaming, and insane growth potential. Here’s what’s got the BTFD community hyped: Staking earns you 90% APY—seriously. Just park your tokens and watch them stack. Analysts are eyeing a potential moon price of $0.006. That’s a 2900% ROI if you get in now at $0.0002. Invest $5,000 today? You’d score 25 million BTFD coins . When the price hits $0.006, that could be worth $150,000. Let that sink in. It’s not just staking—BTFD’s Play-to-Earn game launched on January 1, 2025. You can earn while playing. And the Bulls Squad? That’s the community engine. From meme makers to staking strategists, they’re pushing this thing to orbit. It’s also worth shouting out the BTFD referral program: Share your code and get 10% of all $BTFD purchased through your link (if you’re top 20). Your referrals get 10% more coins too (on purchases over $50). Leaderboard resets monthly, so you’ve got a fresh shot every time. And let’s not forget—this is a meme coin presale built on Ethereum. No rug pulls, no vaporware. Just a smart contract, locked liquidity, and a roadmap that’s already in motion. You’re not just buying tokens. You’re buying time in the market before it moons. SLERF (SLERF) – Chaos, A $10M Mistake, and a Legendary Launch Let’s take it back. On March 18, 2024, SLERF, a Solana-based meme coin, dropped into the scene with almost no plan. No roadmap. No promises. Just vibes—and a sloth mascot. It launched without a presale, and within 24 hours, trading volume exploded past $2.7 billion, hitting over 130,000 traders and 800,000 transactions. Then came the twist: the developer accidentally burned $10 million worth of presale and liquidity tokens. Absolute disaster? Not quite. The crypto community flipped the script. SLERF became a symbol of meme resilience. Despite the $10M burn, it surged to a peak of $1.30 by March 19. The story went viral. SLERF turned a disaster into gold. As of today (April 3, 2025), SLERF trades around $0.056 with a market cap near $27 million. It’s cooled off, but it’s still standing—and that’s saying something in meme land. Did people make 100x on SLERF? Yes. Did many miss it? Also yes. Now the question is—are you gonna miss BTFD too? Conclusion: The Dip That Could Change Your Portfolio Here’s something wild—SLERF taught us that even major screw-ups can spark meme coin moonshots. But BTFD Coin ? It’s got none of the chaos and all of the upside. This Ethereum-based meme beast is offering a chance to earn 90% APY just by staking, a jaw-dropping 2900% ROI if the price hits $0.006, and a referral program that literally pays you for spreading the word. The presale has already raised over $6.45 million, sold more than 72 billion tokens, and is now in Stage 15, with just one more level to go before launch. If you’re looking for the top new meme coin to invest in for short term, this is your golden window. Timing is everything in crypto—and right now, the timing couldn’t be better. Join before the BTFD Coin presale moves into Stage 16 and leaves you chasing candles instead of catching waves.

BTFD’s $0.006 Moon Target Draws FOMO—Top New Meme Coins to Join Today Alongside SLERF and GOAT’s Comeback",https://timestabloid.com/1500-into-45000-btfds-0-006-moon-target-draws-fomo/,"What do you do when meme coins start breaking the rules and rewriting the playbook? SLERF just shocked the market by going fully into circulation after its team accidentally burned its presale allocation, and GOAT’s price action dropped 5.83% while still pulling over $22 million in trading volume. But while these wild cards turn heads, one coin is grabbing wallets among the top new meme coins to join today: BTFD Coin (BTFD) . Investors are now realizing that presales aren’t just for early access—they’re a shield from market turbulence. While others sink or spike with headlines, BTFD keeps climbing through its 16-stage presale ladder. Its P2E game (live since January 1), staking rewards at 90% APY, and raging Bulls Squad community have made it one of the top new meme coins to join today . With Stage 15 almost at the finish line, there’s just one more left before listing—and the current price of $0.0002 is a ticket to up to 2900% ROI if it hits its predicted $0.006 moon shot. If you’re looking to hedge against the chaos while aiming for explosive gains, this might be your once-in-a-cycle chance. Let’s break it down: BTFD Coin: Can the Bulls Squad Really Take You to the Moon? Let’s cut to the chase: BTFD Coin ain’t just a vibe—it’s a movement. Right now, the Bulls Squad is rallying with horns up, charging through Stage 15 of the presale with one final step left. Current price? $0.0002. Moon price prediction? $0.006. That’s a jaw-dropping 2900% ROI potential if you ape in before Stage 16 hits. Over 72 billion $BTFD coins are already sold, $6.45 million raised, and 11,700+ Bulls have joined the stampede. This is the final stretch—miss this top new meme coin to join today, and you’re watching from the sidelines. The Bulls Squad isn’t some boring Discord title; it’s a hype-powered collective of degens, gamers, and crypto heads united under Baby Bull’s fearless guidance. From Nerdy Bull keeping the backend watertight to Raging Bull pumping the visuals, this squad ain’t here to play—they’re here to win. And when you join them, you don’t just buy a meme coin. You back a meme army. The meme coin presale launched on November 26 and has already proven it knows how to build serious traction. With a P2E game already live (since January 1, 2025), you can actually earn while you play. Plus, those staking rewards? 90% APY. That’s the kind of utility meme coins usually dream about. Let’s talk numbers. Invest $1500 right now at $0.0002 per token, and you’re bagging 7.5 million $BTFD coins. When BTFD lists at $0.0006, you’re already sitting on $4,500—a 200% ROI. But if it hits $0.006 like analysts predict? That’s $45,000. Off $1500. That’s what we call a moon mission. Want in? Here’s how to snag your $BTFD: Head over to the BTFD presale platform . Hit “Connect Wallet” (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, whatever you got), enter how much you wanna buy, and click “Buy Now.” No red tape. No whales. No delays. Just you, the Bulls, and the moon. And if you want to turn your referrals into rewards, don’t sleep on the BTFD Coin Rewards Program: Once you connect your wallet, you get a referral code. Share it. If someone uses it to buy $50+ worth of BTFD? They get 10% extra tokens, and you earn 10% of their purchase (if you’re in the top 20 that month). Simple, slick, and live till the last day of every month. Secure your tokens before it’s too late. BTFD or get left behind! SLERF (SLERF) – Full Send With No Presale? Here’s a plot twist: SLERF made headlines by accidentally burning its presale allocation, meaning every token is now fully in circulation. No whales, no early dumps—just pure market-driven madness. As of April 3, it’s sitting at $0.0554 with a 5.41% 24-hour drop. Still, the 24-hour trading volume is north of $16 million, showing people are watching. As a Solana-based meme coin, SLERF lives on volatility. Whether that turns into short-term gains or chaos depends on the market’s next move. But it’s earned a place on the watchlist of top new meme coins to join today. Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) – Volatility with Volume GOAT just took a 5.83% dip, but with a 24-hour volume of $22.46 million, it’s still got eyes on it. Built on Solana and tied to the AI bot Truth Terminal, GOAT hit its all-time high of $1.35 back in November 2024. It’s now at $0.0459, scraping close to its all-time low. The origin story is unique, and the hype is still simmering. But in a market this brutal, investors want more than memes. That’s why top new meme coins to join today need actual utility—like staking, gaming, and community. Final Word: Don’t Just Follow the Herd—Charge With the Bulls So here’s the deal: based on our research and real market activity, SLERF and GOAT are both wild rides—each with their own headlines and high-volume moves. But if you’re looking for real potential, a strong presale foundation, actual game rewards, and a 90% APY staking system, BTFD Coin is in a different league among the top new meme coins to join today. The Bulls Squad is calling. With only one presale stage left before listing, this is your moment to grab BTFD at $0.0002. Aim for that 2900% moonshot. Be part of a community that knows how to charge. Join the BTFD Coin presale before the door slams shut. You’ll thank yourself later. This isn’t just another roundup. This is your guide to the top new meme coins to join today. Don’t miss out.

The firm intends to move into the new office in May. The size of the new office that Gemini agreed to lease is 8,840 square feet (821 square meters) at 545wyn, located in the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami. Wynwood has developed into a new business growth centre, attracting numerous firms Wynwood, a neighborhood in Miami well-known for its warehouses and graffiti murals, has developed into a new centre for residential and business growth. In support of this, several firms have established offices in the neighborhood in recent years. This includes Spotify Technology SA, Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, and Marcelo Claure’s investment firm. In addition, Amazon.com Inc. also signed an office lease in Wynwood. Its office was the largest in the district’s history this year. Furthermore, in 2020, Sterling Bay developed the 545wyn office building, a 10-story building, in Miami’s Wynwood neighborhood and accommodated Gensler, Sony Group Corp., and PwC. Following the firms’ addresses in the Wynwood neighborhood, Gemini’s address is 545 NW 26th St., while Gensler, Sony Group Corp., and PwC’s address are 545 NW 26th St. Based on Gemini’s decision to open a new office in Wynwood, a vice chairman of Blanca Commercial Real Estate, Florida’s top independently owned commercial real estate services company, Juan Ruiz, said: “Gemini’s decision to plant their flag at 545wyn speaks volumes about Wynwood’s evolution from an arts district to a magnet for top-tier technology and creative companies seeking a vibrant, walkable neighborhood.” Blanca also acted as the landlord’s agent in the deal. Gemini files for a confidential IPO application Gemini recently filed confidentially for an initial public offering (IPO). The crypto exchange and custodian is working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. on the offering, according to individuals whose identity was not revealed because the information was confidential. Notably, Gemini was thinking about going public as soon as this year. In February, Cameron Winklevoss posted on X that a listing would come after a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the exchange was concluded. According to a January filing, a lawsuit that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission earlier brought, the business paid $5 million to settle. If Gemini moves forward with the public listing process, it will be part of a small but growing number of crypto-native companies considering an IPO in the U.S. stock exchanges, including Kraken, Circle, Bullish (parent company of CoinDesk) and Blockchain.com. Gemini recently appointed a new chief financial officer as it positions itself for a potential initial public offering. The company’s latest hire, Dan Chen, who previously served as vice president of capital markets at Affirm, announced the move in a social media post. Sources said that discussions are still ongoing, and no final decision has been made regarding the IPO. Representatives from Goldman Sachs and Citigroup declined to comment, while a Gemini spokesperson did not respond immediately to requests for comment. Interestingly, since President Donald Trump’s administration has embraced cryptocurrency, the industry has seen a boom in IPOs.

ETH is now consolidating losses and might face resistance near the $1,840 zone. Ethereum failed to stay above the $1,850 and $1,840 levels. The price is trading below $1,840 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,810 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $1,820 and $1,840 resistance levels to start a decent increase. Ethereum Price Dips Further Ethereum price failed to stay above the $1,800 support zone and extended losses, like Bitcoin . ETH traded as low as $1,751 and recently corrected some gains. There was a move above the $1,780 and $1,800 resistance levels. The bulls even pushed the price above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,955 swing high to the $1,751 low. However, the bears are active near the $1,820 zone. The price is now consolidating and facing many hurdles . Ethereum price is now trading below $1,820 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $1,810 level. There is also a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,810 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The next key resistance is near the $1,840 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,955 swing high to the $1,751 low at $1,850. The first major resistance is near the $1,880 level. A clear move above the $1,880 resistance might send the price toward the $1,920 resistance. An upside break above the $1,920 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,000 resistance zone or even $2,050 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,850 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,765 level. The first major support sits near the $1,750 zone. A clear move below the $1,750 support might push the price toward the $1,720 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,680 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,620.

Analyst Predicts ETH To ‘Explode’ In Q2 2025,https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/is-ethereum-repeating-its-2020-trend-reversal-analyst-predicts-eth-to-explode-in-q2-2025/,"Although sentiment toward Ethereum (ETH) remains largely pessimistic, crypto analyst Mister Crypto predicts that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap could be on the verge of a parabolic rally, mirroring its historical price action from 2020. Ethereum About To Witness A Change Of Fortune? Following US President Donald Trump’s highly anticipated reciprocal tariff announcement, the crypto market took a sharp plunge, wiping out over $140 billion in the past 24 hours. During this period, ETH tumbled by 5% and is at risk of setting fresh cycle lows in the $1,700 range. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Breaking Free from the Bear Trap? Analysts Weigh In Despite the negative sentiment, crypto analyst Mister Crypto suggests that ETH may soon experience a sharp momentum shift. In an X post shared earlier today, the analyst noted that while retail investors may have abandoned ETH, large investors – commonly referred to as whales – have not. Mister Crypto shared the following chart, highlighting striking similarities between ETH’s current price action and its 2020 trajectory. He added that if history repeats itself, ETH could see strong bullish momentum in Q2 2025. Fellow crypto analyst CryptoGoos echoed Mister Crypto’s perspective, arguing that ETH is “extremely undervalued” at its current price levels. The analyst also shared a chart illustrating how ETH whales are accumulating the asset at a record pace. The data reveals that wallets holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH have been accumulating at an accelerated rate since early 2025. This trend persists despite ETH’s decline from approximately $3,350 on January 1 to around $1,700 at the time of writing. Another cryptocurrency analyst, Crypto Caesar, noted that ETH is likely approaching a bottom, as it is currently trading near the same price level it held four years ago. However, he cautioned that if ETH breaks below its current support, it could decline further to the $1,200 range. ETH May Have More Pain Ahead While whale accumulation suggests long-term optimism for ETH, some analysts warn that further downside may be imminent before a potential recovery. In a recent analysis, crypto market expert Cryptododo7 predicts that ETH may eye bearish targets around $1,130 to $1,200. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashing Bullish Signals, But Rising Exchange Reserves Raise Concerns – Details Similarly, analyst CryptoBullet highlighted that ETH has now touched the 300-week moving average for only the second time in its history – an event that has historically signalled a bearish trend. Despite these cautionary outlooks, market commentator Titan of Crypto recently stated that ETH is still on track to reach new all-time highs later this year. At press time, ETH trades at $1,777, down 5% in the past 24 hours.

While this breakthrough technology promises unprecedented computational power, it also poses a significant threat to current encryption systems. Cryptographic methods that secure our financial transactions, communications and sensitive data may become obsolete. This has led to the emergence of quantum-resistant cryptography, a crucial field focused on safeguarding digital assets against quantum-based attacks. Understanding the quantum threat Classical encryption methods, such as RSA and ECC (elliptic curve cryptography), rely on complex mathematical problems that would take traditional computers thousands of years to solve. However, quantum computers leverage Shor’s algorithm, which can break these encryptions within hours or even minutes. This means that once quantum computing reaches a practical level, many of today’s security protocols will no longer be viable. The urgency to develop post-quantum cryptographic solutions has never been higher. What is quantum-resistant cryptography Quantum-resistant, or PQC (post-quantum cryptography), refers to cryptographic algorithms designed to withstand attacks from quantum computers. Unlike traditional encryption, PQC methods do not rely on integer factorization or discrete logarithm problems, which are vulnerable to quantum attacks. Instead, they utilize advanced mathematical principles such as the following. Lattice-based cryptography – Uses complex lattice structures that even quantum computers struggle to solve. Hash-based cryptography – Relies on the security of cryptographic hash functions, which remain resistant to quantum attacks. Multivariate polynomial cryptography – Uses multivariable equations that are difficult to reverse engineer. Code-based cryptography – Implements error-correcting codes to create secure encryption schemes. The urgency for adoption Governments and organizations worldwide are already preparing for the post-quantum era. The NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) is in the process of standardizing quantum-resistant algorithms to replace current cryptographic systems. Financial institutions, healthcare providers and technology companies are also investing in post-quantum security measures to future-proof their infrastructure. A major concern is the concept of ‘harvest now, decrypt later’ attacks. Malicious entities can collect encrypted data today and decrypt it in the future once quantum computing becomes powerful enough. This makes it essential to implement PQC sooner rather than later to protect sensitive information from future threats. Current market trends and statistics According to a recent Allied Market Research report , the global quantum cryptography market was valued at $89 million in 2020 and is projected to reach $214 million by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 19.1% during the forecast period. The rising demand for cybersecurity solutions in industries such as finance, healthcare and government is driving this growth. Another study by Deloitte estimates that more than 25% of all encrypted data on the internet could be at risk once quantum computers become powerful enough. This alarming statistic underscores the urgency of transitioning to post-quantum cryptographic methods. Challenges in implementing PQC Despite its potential, quantum-resistant cryptography comes with its own set of challenges. Computational overhead – Some PQC algorithms require significantly more processing power, making them less efficient for low-power devices. Compatibility issues – Existing digital systems must be upgraded or redesigned to accommodate new cryptographic methods. Standardization delays – The process of establishing universally accepted quantum-resistant algorithms is still ongoing, slowing down widespread adoption. Cost of migration – Transitioning to post-quantum security involves significant investment in infrastructure and training. Industries at high risk Some industries are more vulnerable than others to quantum threats due to their reliance on secure communications and data protection. Financial services – Banks and payment processors rely on encryption for transactions. A breach due to quantum attacks could lead to financial chaos. Healthcare – Patient records and medical data must remain confidential. Quantum computing could make it easier to breach these databases. Government and defense – National security agencies depend on cryptographic security to protect classified information. Cloud computing – Cloud storage providers need quantum-resistant encryption to ensure data remains safe from future threats. Steps to prepare for a post-quantum world Organizations must take proactive steps to integrate PQC into their cybersecurity strategies. Steps include the following. Identifying vulnerable encryption methods in current systems. Testing and integrating post-quantum cryptographic algorithms into applications. Collaborating with cybersecurity experts and regulatory bodies to stay ahead of emerging threats. Educating stakeholders about the risks of quantum computing and the need for cryptographic transition. Adopting hybrid cryptographic solutions that combine classical and quantum-resistant encryption during the transition phase. The road ahead As quantum computing continues to advance, the race for quantum-resistant security solutions is intensifying. Companies like IBM, Google and Microsoft are heavily investing in quantum research, which means the reality of breaking current encryption standards is approaching faster than anticipated. The need for action is clear – organizations must prioritize quantum-resistant cryptography to protect their digital infrastructure. Conclusion Quantum computing is no longer a distant future – it’s an imminent reality that requires immediate attention. The shift toward quantum-resistant cryptography is not just an option but a necessity for ensuring the security of digital assets. Businesses, governments and individuals must act now to protect their data before quantum computers render current encryption obsolete. The future of cybersecurity hinges on this transition, and those who prepare today will have a significant advantage in the post-quantum world.

ETH is significantly underperforming compared to bitcoin (BTC) and some major cap altcoins. Worse still, the bleeding does not appear to be stopping soon. According to a report by the market analytics platform CryptoQuant, diminished network activity is one of the major reasons why Ethereum has been losing value. This continued subdued activity is contributing to a high inflation rate for ETH, making the cryptocurrency lose its value over time. Diminishing Network Activity The number of active addresses on Ethereum has been reducing steadily since the beginning of the year. In addition, average fees per transaction and per block have plummeted to record lows. As a result of the low fees and fewer active addresses, the ETH burn rate has fallen to its lowest level since the Merge. Recall that Ethereum introduced a burn mechanism to remove a portion of ETH from circulation to ensure the asset remained deflationary over time. These coins are taken from Ethereum gas fees and permanently removed from the supply. The Merge, which marked the transition of Ethereum from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, aimed to bolster this concept by ensuring more ETH was burned than produced. However, after the Dencun upgrade last year, which introduced blobs and reduced transaction fees, less ETH was burned and more minted. This caused ether to become inflationary again. With the ETH burn rate hovering around its lowest level since the Merge, inflationary pressures on the cryptocurrency have intensified . “Ethereum’s recent underperformance can be largely attributed to diminished network activity, as evidenced by declining active addresses and reduced transaction fees. These factors, coupled with a low burn rate post-Dencun upgrade and a continuous high inflation rate, continue to exert downward pressure on the asset’s value,” said pseudonymous CryptoQuant analyst EgyHash. ETH Down 4% Daily Furthermore, EgyHash stated that Ethereum faces a chance at potential recovery if there is a positive change in the network’s activity—an increase in active addresses, which would lead to higher transaction fees and more ETH being burned. At the time of writing, ETH was worth $1,790, down 4% daily per data from CoinMarketCap. Notably, the asset was negatively affected by the announcement confirming the implementation of trade tariffs in the United States. Moreover, ether has lost 16% of its value in the past month and is down by more than 60% since this cycle’s peak at just over $4,000.

Their XO Swap platform generates about 85% of their revenue. This is mostly thanks to its security and partnerships with Ledger, without self-custody hassles. You see, EXOD's Passkeys and MPC technology significantly simplify self-custody, eliminating cumbersome seed phrases and making crypto much more user-friendly. Their balance sheet and runway also seem safe for now, though ideally, they should already be cash flow positive in my view. So, after the recent 60% price pullback, the Company now looks like a compelling play in crypto. Exodus Movement, Inc. ( EXOD ) is basically a financial technology company that offers self-custodial digital crypto wallets. These wallets allow users to swap between several blockchains and move between fiat and crypto using a user-friendly and secure platform. Interestingly, their wallets are also integrated with third-party providers that support their transactions with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, among others. Also, it has partnerships with other complementary platforms like Ledger and Magic Eden. One important feature of EXOD's wallets is the use of Passkey and multi-party computation [MPC] that are relatively user-friendly while maintaining secure self-custody standards. And after the recent 60% pullback, I feel it's fair to once again lean bullish on EXOD at these levels. A Crypto Wallet Play Exodus Movement is a fintech that was founded back in 2015 for self-custodial cryptocurrency wallets. Over time, they also added a multi-asset platform that's accessible and user-friendly. The company also aggregates third-party services for easy crypto swapping, productive stacking, and fiat-to-crypto onboarding. They're headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, but as you might imagine, their crypto exposure makes their services available virtually worldwide. Moreover, I believe EXOD's wallets have interesting features that distinguish them from others. Firstly, many wallets are custodial, meaning that a company or exchange saves the private keys. However, this does expose the crypto assets themselves to third-party security risks. In contrast, EXOD's wallets are self-custodial , which means that they are controlled directly by the users. Corporate Presentation - March 2025 In fact, EXOD's platform doesn't have access to users' private keys because they are stored locally on their devices. Other important features are that these wallets offer simpler interfaces, good customer support, and have so far a very strong security track record. Additionally, EXOD's wallets support all the major blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano in a single wallet. These crypto assets can be swapped within EXOD's wallet at relatively good prices and without major slippage costs. The company also offers tools to move funds between traditional money, like USD or EUR (i.e., fiat), and crypto. For this, EXOD's solutions use third-party API providers that check multiple offerings and choose the best prices available. This way, its users fulfill their buy/sell orders seamlessly at the best available prices. Also, EXOD's fiat on-ramps integrate providers such as MoonPay, PayPal, Blockchain.com, Ramp, Robinhood, and Sardine. These are all well-known payment processors with large ecosystems that make EXOD's crypto services highly accessible with traditional credit and debit cards, transfers, or even PayPal transactions. Corporate Presentation - March 2025 Furthermore, EXOD is also partnered with Ledger, which is a well-known provider of hardware wallets. For most crypto native users, hardware wallets are a must because these ensure funds are always safe and don't depend on any third parties. This allows users to store cryptocurrency offline much more securely. This is why EXOD's partnership with Ledger means their integrated XO Swap also has the same benefits as traditional hardware wallets without the hassles of self-custody. Note that XO Swap is EXOD's exchange aggregator, but it has the same security as a hardware wallet. This is because the connection from the users' ledger to XO Swap is via Bluetooth. Still, all signing operations are done inside the Ledger hardware wallet device. Since these signatures aren't performed inside EXOD's app, this basically ensures users always have end-to-end encryption in their transactions. Corporate Presentation - March 2025 At this point, the main risk comes from the human side. For instance, security breaches could involve users themselves accepting unknown pairing requests or approving malicious transactions without proper verifications on the hardware wallet's screen. Another interesting EXOD's partnership is with Magic Eden , which is a popular NFT marketplace on the Solana blockchain. Magic Eden users get access to EXOD's services to buy crypto with fiat money and then swap crypto across blockchains. EXOD's users can seamlessly interact with NFTs directly from their wallet, which is much more convenient than using the blockchain itself directly. Corporate Presentation - March 2025 More recently, in 2024, EXOD generated 85% of its revenue from XO Swap. And approximately 7% came from its partnerships with as Ledger or Magic Eden, which produce fees from swaps through those partners. Finally, around 8% of its full-year revenues came from non-exchange aggregation services like fiat onboarding and staking. So, overall, EXOD doesn't hold user funds but still produces fees through third-party services. And interestingly, roughly two-thirds of EXOD's users are international. Passkeys and MPC Simplify Self-Custody Having said that, I believe that one of EXOD's main innovations is that its platform uses Passkeys . These are a relatively new approach that simplifies access to digital wallets using biometric authentication, a PIN, or a password, without requiring a seed phrase. This way, other decentralized apps [dApps] can integrate EXOD's wallets into their systems to create or access wallets. Also, users can seamlessly use fiat onboarding tools, or even swap between crypto coins with self-custody and user control through multi-party computation [MPC]. In my view, Passkey wallet with MPC is probably going to be the future of crypto and decentralized assets in general. When users log in with biometrics or a password, EXOD's system coordinates a secure MPC protocol without needing a seed phrase. Corporate Presentation - March 2025 You see, MPC is a cryptographic method that enables multiple parties to manage a private key without accessing the full key itself. MPC allows for better security because to compromise a wallet, the attacker would need to compromise several different locations at once. And since the full private key is never in one place, there is no need to memorize a 12 or 24-word recovery phrase. Plus, if the user losses access, they can easily regain control by using cloud backups or device re-authentication instead of resorting to a long seed phrase again. The most important theme of all this is EXOD's focus on making the system safe, without sacrificing the decentralization and self-custody benefits that crypto brings. And all without expecting its users to have any technical skills. Valuation and Risk Analysis Now, from a valuation perspective, EXOD trades at a $1.3 billion market cap already, making it a mid-sized company in its sector. Its balance sheet holds $68.4 million in cash and short-term investments, against essentially no financial debt. And its book value stands at $257.5 million, indicating a somewhat high P/B of 5.1. For comparison, its sector's median P/B is just 3.1, so the stock does seem to carry a bit of a premium at these levels. After all, the stock has already retraced roughly 60% from its recent January 2025 highs. Seeking Alpha Charts Similarly, according to Seeking Alpha's dashboard on them, EXOD is projected to generate about $192.0 million in revenues by 2026. That would still price them at an expensive forward P/S of 6.8, which is also much higher than its sector's median forward P/S multiple of just 2.6 . Still, in a way, I do believe EXOD deserves a premium for its above-average topline growth of 106.9%, which vastly outpaces its peers' growth of 5.1%. Seeking Alpha And in fact, this is probably the main reason why I ultimately lean bullish on EXOD. However, looking at their latest quarterly cash burn of $5.3 million, it does imply a modest runway of 12.9 quarters. And that was back at year-end 2024, so by now their runway is probably closer to 11.9 quarters, or 3.0 years. Note that I got those figures by adding their Q4 2024 cash flows from operations and CAPEX. But ideally, I'd like to see EXOD generating positive cash flows already, given their sizeable top line, so I'm a bit concerned about their long-term margins. Similarly, if we see any margin deterioration or maybe a substantial revenue decline during this crypto downturn, EXOD's premium valuation could quickly vanish. Corporate Presentation - March 2025 And lastly, EXOD is quickly becoming a Bitcoin play in a sense, as it's actively accumulating as much Bitcoin as it can. As of 2024, they already held 1941 Bitcoins, which alone was worth as much as $194.1 million back when Bitcoin broke through the $100.0 thousand price milestone in Q4 2024. In other words, they're now directly exposed to Bitcoin's price fluctuations as well. Conclusion: Speculative Buy Overall, EXOD looks like a growth play in crypto, but that's not without its risks. Moreover, the current US administration has been vocal pro-crypto , but we don't know how this stance might change over time and with the following presidencies. Although, I would consider those more macro and long-term risks. As it stands today, I feel EXOD is a nice way to gain exposure to fees generated from crypto transactions. Plus, their focus on self-custody seems like a good strategic focus, since crypto natives tend to be very sensitive about this item as well. Thus, I rate EXOD a reasonably sound ""speculative Buy"" in this sector.",EXOD,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING|WALLET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-04-04 03:59:36
42881337,https://square.htx.com/?p=43614,1743739200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/100/default.png,Justin Sun: The Watchman of Web3,https://square.htx.com/justin-sun-the-watchman-of-web3/,"On April 2, 2025, Justin Sun once again set the crypto world abuzz. As reported by CoinDesk, Sun stepped in with a critical injection of liquidity to support TrueUSD (TUSD) amid a staggering $456 million reserve gap—averting a potential depegging crisis that could have rocked the stablecoin ecosystem. “Godzilla was destroying the city. I’m Ultraman—I came in and punched Godzilla to save everyone,” Sun told Hong Kong media outlet Sing Tao Daily, in his trademark flair. But behind the theatrics lies a much graver mission. Sun is taking on the alleged fraud by First Digital Trust (FDT) and its affiliated partners, urging Hong Kong regulators & and law enforcement agencies to take decisive measures to address these loopholes. “These assets are essentially public users’ money,” he said. “To protect users and uphold Hong Kong’s credibility as a global financial hub, I had to step in. The scale of the fraud shocked me. All fraudsters must be held accountable.” A Relentless Defender of Crypto Crypto has always been a volatile adventure. Bull runs feel like reaching for the stars, while crashes leave only wreckage. But in these uncertain times, Justin Sun has made it his role to keep the lights on. He’s not just a survivor—he’s a watchman. Someone who shows up when others hesitate. The Ethereum Showdown: Twice Tested, Never Broken Sun’s relationship with Ethereum has been nothing short of a saga. During the infamous May 19, 2021 crash, ETH dipped below $2,000 and Sun was inches away from liquidation. He repaid $300 million just in time to protect his 606,000 ETH position and threw in another $280 million to buy more ETH and BTC at fire-sale prices. “My assets were safe, but it felt like a bullet grazed my scalp. The wick was brutal,” he wrote on Weibo. It wasn’t just a trade. It was a battle of conviction. He shielded his own position while keeping the crypto dream alive. In 2024, ETH lagged in performance and Sun faced fresh rumors of massive losses and sell-offs. Instead of retreating, he proposed bold plans: Halt ETH Sales, heavily tax Layer 2 solutions, streamline foundation & optimize revenue. Wild? Maybe. But Sun has always married ambition with execution. Reviving HTX: From Burnout to Breakout Critics once joked that Sun “got burned” buying into HTX (formerly Huobi). When he stepped in as Global Advisor in October 2022, the market was reeling from FTX’s collapse, and centralized exchanges were under siege. HTX had lost ground—and users. Today, HTX is thriving. Trading volume and user activity are up, euro-stablecoin trading is on top three globally, and its CIS market share is dominant. It even made Forbes’ list of “Top 25 Most Trustworthy Crypto Exchanges of 2025.” The same exchange that once looked like a liability? Now a pillar of Sun’s empire. FTX Fallout: Standing in the Storm When FTX collapsed in November 2022, chaos swept the markets. Sun publicly pledged to support TRON-related tokens and HT assets with 1:1 redemption. He even told Bloomberg he was prepared to inject “billions” to help FTX, subject to due diligence. FTX ultimately folded, but Sun’s swift move bought time for users and preserved value within the TRON and HTX ecosystems. The Curve Crisis: DeFi Gets a Lifeline DeFi’s fragility was exposed again in 2023 when Curve Finance was hacked. Founder Michael Egorov faced possible liquidation on $100M in loans. As CRV tanked, Sun and allies stepped in, purchasing 72 million CRV for $28.8 million to shore up the protocol. He didn’t stop there—Sun launched a stUSDT pool on TRON, giving the ecosystem a boost. Some say it was strategic self-interest. But in a storm, does it matter who holds the umbrella, as long as someone does? Controversial but Unshaken Sun’s name always invites debate. Opportunist or idealist? Visionary or self-promoter? The truth probably lies somewhere in between. Yes, he’s bold. Yes, he’s ambitious. But when others flee, he steps forward. From converting $HT to $HTX, to partnering with WLFI on reserve-backed assets, Sun continues to bet on crypto’s long-term future. “I’m not here to make a quick buck,” he once said. “I want to build something that lasts.” Love him or not, in the darkest hours of Web3, Justin Sun has made a habit of showing up with a flashlight.

While Cronos and Ethereum Classic have earned solid reputations through steady progress and loyal communities, they often leave users to navigate systems on their own. Cronos has widened its use cases but is still recovering from a notable price slide. Ethereum Classic sticks to a stable system but doesn’t provide much support for active user engagement. What sets BlockDAG (BDAG) apart is its strong focus on usability. Participants in its testnet get access to a full set of tools and real-time guidance, placing user needs at the center of the experience rather than making them secondary. Cronos (CRO): Expansion Steps and User Returns Cronos (CRO) powers the Cronos blockchain, developed by Crypto.com. It began as a tool for handling transactions within the Crypto.com platform and has grown to become the gas fee token for Cronos EVM and zkEVM chains. CRO now supports DeFi services, NFT functions, and gaming apps, positioning it as a key asset within the expanding ecosystem. A key move occurred in March 2025, when the Cronos community voted to release 70 billion CRO over the next decade to fuel ecosystem growth. This includes work on a CRO-backed ETF designed to draw interest from major financial institutions. Alongside that, a proposal to burn 50 million CRO from reserves was made to reduce supply and potentially raise demand. These actions reflect a long-term goal of maintaining growth and increasing value. On March 30, 2025, CRO was priced at around $0.099. Compared to 2024 highs, this reflects a drop of nearly 50%, largely in line with wider corrections in the market. Still, outlooks from analysts remain mildly positive. Depending on how adoption progresses, projections suggest CRO could climb to between $0.124958 and $0.337643 by the end of 2025. Ethereum Classic (ETC): Steady Model with Market Resilience Ethereum Classic (ETC) came into being in 2016 after a split from Ethereum, following the principle of “code is law” to preserve blockchain integrity. It continues to rely on Proof-of-Work (PoW), allowing developers to create dApps on a secure platform. In terms of price action, ETC has held its ground. As of March 30, 2025, it trades at about $16.47. That marks a drop of roughly 50% from its 2024 peak, which mirrors the downturn seen across many cryptocurrencies. Forecasts for ETC in 2025 are mixed, with some suggesting a rise to between $50.28 and $60.03 if broader conditions improve. Its focus on consistency, along with generally lower transaction fees compared to Ethereum, appeals to those looking for a more stable option in the market. The fixed maximum supply of 210 million ETC also makes it an asset that could better resist inflation. Looking at both Cronos and Ethereum Classic, each has faced market shifts yet continued building with community support and clear plans. Though performance has been affected by larger trends, the long-term potential of both projects depends heavily on future adoption and market stability. BlockDAG Gives Testnet Users Full Access to Tools and Support BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet, named “Primordial,” is carefully designed for ease of use. It provides users and developers with a full set of tools to explore features, manage wallets, run smart contracts, and interact confidently with the system. Key resources include a Block Explorer to track live transactions, a user-friendly Wallet interface to check balances and vesting, and a no-code dApp Wizard for launching applications quickly. There’s also a built-in IDE for creating and deploying contracts, backed by detailed technical documentation. Whether someone is mining, building, or simply engaging with the platform, each process is clearly laid out and easy to follow. In addition to these tools, BlockDAG offers around-the-clock technical help through Freshdesk. This includes live agent support and the option to escalate technical concerns directly to developers. These services aim to lower entry barriers, encourage testing, and ensure users are not just part of the process—they’re in full control. The momentum from this tool-focused rollout is reflected in BlockDAG’s crypto presale . As of Batch 27, the project has raised $210.5 million, distributing over 19.1 billion coins at the current rate of $0.0248 per coin. Those who joined in Batch 1 have already seen gains of 2,380%, showing strong backing from the wider market. Yet this growth is not just based on numbers—it shows how people respond to systems that are easy to use, reliable, and scalable. With rewards for top testnet users, automated vesting features, and real BDAG earnings, BlockDAG continues to build a group of users focused on long-term goals. Final Remarks! Practical use isn’t only about transaction volume or total market value—it’s about how well a blockchain supports its users across every stage. While Cronos adds value through DeFi connections and Ethereum Classic stays true to immutability, both fall short in providing tools that bring users closer to the system. In contrast, BlockDAG hands over the tools and support people need to fully participate, create, and explore with confidence. It’s more than just building software—it’s about making sure people have what they need to take full part in the network. That core idea may be what shapes which projects truly last.

This is not a typical sales event. Half of Dragoin’s total supply is open only for presale participants. Here’s the key detail—any coins not bought during this period will be permanently eliminated through a burn process. This approach ensures a reduced future supply. The first stage is currently active, offering $DDGN at $0.0000292. By the final presale stage, the token is expected to reach $0.002. This progression reflects a built-in 6,700% growth potential. Early participants benefit from securing a larger amount at a significantly lower price. With each stage pushing the cost higher, those acting soonest gain the most. Dragoin Presale: Supply Burns Add Urgency Dragoin’s presale method includes a planned reduction in supply through permanent burns. A total of 50% of all Dragoin coins are made available only during the presale, spread across 25 structured stages. Any tokens left unsold during these stages are permanently removed, not hidden or stored for future use. This approach is rare among meme projects and gives a real edge to early movers. Rather than stretching supply to influence value later, Dragoin’s method does the reverse—every unsold coin lowers the overall supply. The strategy is clearly explained upfront, giving early users a chance to take action before availability drops. Stage 1 is now active, priced at $0.0000292. As each phase completes, prices move up, and available coins decrease. The final target is $0.002, offering early buyers a potential 67x increase before public trading begins. Those who join early aren’t just getting in—they’re stepping into a limited supply at the best rate available. Structured Presale Design Gives Early Entry an Edge The Dragoin presale is broken into 25 stages, each carrying a themed title like “The Battle of Harrenhal” or “The Final Battle for the Iron Throne.” These titles represent more than branding—they signify progression, where each stage carries a higher price. This design supports fast participation and rewards earlier involvement. Each stage releases a fixed amount of coins, and once those are gone, the next stage begins at a higher price. That means joining sooner results in receiving more $DDGN for the same payment. Those purchasing in Stage 1, for example, are paying over 60 times less than what is expected post-launch. This isn’t speculative; it follows Dragoin’s preset pricing model. The system ensures fairness while supporting community engagement. Early participants who understand the setup stand to benefit the most. This process isn’t driven by hype but by a calculated rollout that increases in cost the longer one waits. Why Permanent Token Burns Support Value The choice to remove all unsold tokens permanently after the presale carries real implications. Once taken out of circulation, the total number of $DDGN becomes smaller. That limited supply may lead to stronger pricing as more users discover Dragoin. Typical projects face the risk of future supply increases due to undisclosed team holdings or delayed distributions. Dragoin eliminates that issue. Its model allows everyone to see exactly how many coins exist and where they’re allocated. There’s no fear of surprise dumps or hidden supply. This clarity helps early buyers retain more stable value over time. Supply won’t unexpectedly rise. Additionally, the burn strategy sends a message that long-term scarcity is a priority over short-term gains. Those who join the presale at early stages are getting the lowest possible price. If Dragoin reaches $0.002 after its market listing, Stage 1 buyers could see gains of up to 6,700%. The structure is clear, ensuring those who act fast are positioned to benefit without relying on speculation. Scarcity Mechanism Drives Future Demand Dragoin’s permanent burn model doesn’t just reduce supply—it builds long-term value. When assets are harder to obtain, demand usually increases. Once the presale ends and leftover coins are burned, new participants must buy from existing holders at market rate. This creates a strong balance between availability and demand. As the Dragoin ecosystem expands—especially with the upcoming play-to-earn Telegram game—more users will compete for fewer available tokens. Those who joined early will hold a rare asset with added uses. They gain the benefit of being first. Scarcity strengthens Dragoin’s overall structure. The project avoids flooding the market and instead follows a planned rollout, increasing value over time. The path from $0.0000292 to $0.002 isn’t speculative—it’s outlined from the beginning. This clear pricing structure helps build anticipation and confidence, especially for those who understand supply economics. Wrapping Up! The Dragoin presale setup gives early participants a strong starting advantage. With 50% of supply available only during presale and all unsold coins permanently burned, the available supply shrinks quickly. Early stages offer the lowest pricing and highest volume for purchase. Stage 1 is already open at $0.0000292, with the final listing price set at $0.002, marking a built-in 6,700% growth. With every presale stage, prices go up and coin supply tightens. The structure is transparent and designed to reward early participation. Those exploring Dragoin now stand to gain the most. Once unsold coins are burned, there’s no bringing them back. Acting at the start locks in the best deal and the strongest potential gain.

Over the years, crypto narratives have contributed to shaping how people perceive and value cryptocurrencies, influencing investor sentiment, market trends, and the adoption of new technologies. Currently, some of the trending narratives influencing the crypto market and projects are artificial intelligence (AI), stablecoins, layer 1 blockchains (L1s), memecoins, real world assets (RWAs) tokens, DeFAI, AI agents and DeSci among others. A declining trend in key performance metrics According to trends data shared by Web3 analytics platform , Dexu.ai, DeSci, AI agents and DeFAI narratives price performance have seen a decline and are currently at -80.50%, -86.67% and -67.38% over the last 90 days. Other narratives, such as RWA and CEX performed marginally better, even though they also have negative figures of -52.08% and -18.01%, respectively. DeSci, AI agents and DeFAI narratives price performance have seen a decline in Q1 of 2025. Source: Dexu.ai. Under the sub-category for price performances, the data is also grim, showcasing a downward trend in the negative 90% region for the respective narratives that were touted to be the future of decentralized technology applications in late 2024. The three narratives continue to perform poorly, holding 4.51%, 3.35% and 0.29% for DeFAI, AI agents and DeSci, respectively, in terms of the mindshare performance category, a metric that tracks how these narratives are being actively discussed, including trends across social media, in this case X (formerly Twitter). The three narratives continue to perform poorly in terms of the mindshare performance category. Source: Dexu.ai. L1s lead the pack with a mindshare percentage of 18.89%. A high mindshare typically means a larger market share because users are more likely to invest in projects or narratives they recognize and trust. On the other hand, the decline in social media buzz suggests that enthusiasm around DeFAI, AI Agents, and DeSci might be fading. In terms of project volumes that fall under the three narratives, DeSci and DeFAI seem to be lagging with projects linked to them amassing $32.55 million and $36.68 million in volume. AI agents are doing better with a volume of $903 million, although it’s still a far cry from what stablecoin and L1 narrative projects pulled, with reported volumes of $86.59 billion and $67.92 billion. Project volumes for the DeSci and DeFAI narratives have fallen behind, although AI agents are doing better. Source: Dexu.ai. DeFi and memecoins, which have been around longer, continue to maintain significantly higher trading volumes, recording $2.15 billion and $4.13 billion in volume, indicating a major gulf between the volume of the highly touted narrative trio of late 2024 relative to their older counterparts. Among the three narratives, AI agents lead in market cap, with a valuation of $1.68 billion, while DeSci and DeFAI come last with market cap valuations of $171.57 million and $124.21 million. All three narratives don’t come close to the leader, L1, which has a $2.22 trillion market cap. DeSci and DeFAI only hold a small fraction of the market cap valuations of top narratives like L1. Source: Dexu.ai. In terms of market cap to volume ratio, AI agents are leading the pack at 53.72%, while DeFAI and DeSci are also performing well with 28.89% and 18.54%. According to Dexu.ai, this data was computed by taking the median value for all the projects across each narrative. The Web3 analytics platform highlighted that a higher value signifies increased interest in trading in that narrative. However, this metric doesn’t translate to a higher volume because narratives like DeSci with low market caps could easily amass high ratios. This works the other way for narratives with high market caps, a case in point being L1s, which had a volume to market cap ratio of 12.47%. The market caps of the narratives were also compared to the fully diluted valuation (FDV), a metric used to gauge a cryptocurrency project’s future value by considering its total token supply. This was to indicate the percentage of tokens from projects linked to each narrative that are currently in circulation. AI agents and DeFAI seem to be doing well in that department, with percentages of 81.51% and 78.75%, however, DeSci at 32.83% has a low market cap to FDV ratio. Understanding DeFAI, AI Agents and DeSci With the boom of artificial intelligence and the search for more use cases for the technology in the blockchain space, DeFAI emerged, enabling the integration of AI into DeFi platforms. The goal of this fusion was to bring ease to complex financial operations, lowering the entry barrier, providing better insights for trading and yield optimization to both experienced traders and newbies alike. AI agents are another application of AI in the crypto space. These agents are known for their widespread applications across various industries, and they are used to execute tasks ranging from trading strategies to managing decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Tokens related to AI agents have risen in terms of market capitalization, especially late last year and early this year, reflecting consumer willingness to invest in AI-powered solutions in the crypto space. DeSci also garnered attention by proposing decentralized models for funding, conducting, and sharing scientific research. This movement aims to address challenges in traditional research systems, such as high access costs and centralized control, by leveraging blockchain technology to promote transparency and collaboration. While these narratives gained sizable traction towards the end of 2024, with projects in these sectors experiencing significant market activity, the early months of 2025 have been telling a different story, as recent data indicates a downward trend across key performance metrics. The decline of DeFAI, AI Agents, and DeSci raises important questions about the sustainability of crypto narratives driven by hype. While their initial success showed strong use cases and technological potential, the current downturn may give credence to the assumption that investors are shifting their focus to more stable and established blockchain applications.

Ripple has agreed to pay a reduced fine of $50 million, slashing the original $125 million penalty. In return, the SEC will request Judge Analisa Torres to lift the “obey the law” injunction, which had forced Ripple to register future securities sales. Yet, despite this monumental win, XRP’s price has remained oddly stagnant, defying expectations of a post-settlement surge. This has left the XRP community in a state of suspense, eagerly awaiting an official statement from the SEC—similar to the responses seen in cases involving Kraken and Cumberland. In the latest development, an unexpected filing has surfaced in the SEC vs. Ripple docket. A man named Justin W. Keener has submitted an emergency request, claiming to possess “decisive evidence in favor of the defendants and in favor of liberty for the American people.” The filing is cryptic, offering little detail about the nature of the evidence, except that it involves physical investment contracts Keener has been collecting.

The alleged embezzlement centers on FDT’s handling of client assets, which Sun claims have been misappropriated.

FDT dismissed Sun’s claims as “false information” and a “smear campaign.” The company warned it would take legal action to defend its name and accused Sun of spreading false information.

The question is, is it a sustained rally that we will see for six to twelve months,” Real Vision chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts told Real Vision co-founder Raoul Pal on an April 3 X livestream . Network activity will be the ‘north star’ for how to trade crypto “At this stage, I am not too sure, but I do believe that quality altcoins where activity returns, activity drives prices …we will definitely see a recovery in some of these more high-quality names,” Coutts said. Cointelegraph reported in January that there were over 36 million altcoins in existence . However, Ethereum still holds the majority share of total value locked (TVL) with 55.56%, followed by Solana (6.89%), Bitcoin (5.77%), BNB Smart Chain (5.68%), and Tron (5.54%), according to CoinGecko data. Coutts said traders should watch where the network activity “is gravitating” and use that as their “north star” for how to trade in crypto, adding he sees an altcoin market upswing within the next two months. “I’m expecting by June to see altcoins really start to pick up again. Predicated on the fact that Bitcoin is back at all-time highs by that point.” On March 28, Coutts told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin could reach all-time highs before the end of Q2 regardless of whether there is more clarity on US President Donald Trump's tariffs and potential recession concerns. The total crypto market cap is down around 8% over the past 30 days. Source: CoinMarketCap Blockchain network activity across the board has recently experienced sharp declines amid a broader crypto market downturn. On Feb. 21, Cointelegraph reported that the number of active addresses on the Solana ( SOL ) network fell to a weekly average of 9.5 million in February, down nearly 40% from the 15.6 million active addresses in November 2024. Altcoin indicators are flashing red Meanwhile, several key indicators the crypto industry uses to determine an incoming altcoin season suggest it's still nowhere in sight. Capriole Investments’ Altcoin Speculation Index has dropped to 12%, down 53% since Dec. 25, the same period during which Ether fell 49% from $3,490, according to CoinMarketCap data. Related: When will altseason arrive? Experts reveal what's holding back altcoins CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index , which measures the top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin’s performance over the past 90 days, is reading a score of 14 out of 100, leaning toward a more Bitcoin-dominated market, referring to it as “Bitcoin Season.” The Altcoin Season Index Chart is sitting at 14 at the time of publication. Source: CoinMarketCap However, while Bitcoin dominance — a level often watched for retracements that signal an altcoin season — sits at 62.84%, some analysts argue it’s no longer as relevant as a signal for altcoin season.

Bitcoin dropped as much as 6%, briefly touching $82,000, while the broader crypto market shed around 3% amid rising fears of a global economic slowdown. The downturn came after Trump declared April 2 “Liberation Day ” and announced a sweeping 10% baseline tariff on all US imports. Higher duties were also imposed on several major trading partners. Following Trump's tariff announcements yesterday, the S&P 500 is currently down -4.02% in Thursday trading. In the 2020's, there have only been 5 worse performing days: March 16, 2020: -11.98%​ March 12, 2020: -9.51%​ March 9, 2020: -7.60%​ June 11, 2020: -5.89%… pic.twitter.com/TpTbYMDFZF — Santiment (@santimentfeed) April 3, 2025 S&P 500 Sees Worst Drop Since 2022 as Trump’s Tariffs Rattle Global Markets Trump framed the move as an effort to end “unfair trade practices.” His announcement triggered immediate volatility in both traditional and digital asset markets. Global equities fell across the board. US stocks mirrored losses seen in Asia and Europe. The S&P 500 slipped back into correction territory, shedding nearly $2t in value. It was the index’s worst single-day drop since Sept. 2022. Deutsche Bank has warned that the tariffs could shave 1% to 1.5% off US GDP this year. Crypto markets weren’t spared. Ethereum (ETH), XRP and Solana (SOL) also posted losses, and the ETH/BTC ratio slipped to its lowest point since June 2020 before slightly recovering. “We will likely continue to see the fallout of this strategy throughout Q2 and possibly throughout the summer, before Trump begins to ease off the pressure,” Ultra’s CEO Gus van Rijckevorsel said. While he expects Trump to eventually return to the negotiating table, Rijckevorsel noted that “he’ll end up being the firefighter, putting out the fires of his own making.” Trump Tariffs, Inflation and Budget Woes Stir Market Jitters Across Assets Traders are now trying to understand how the tariffs will affect trade, interest rates and investor willingness to take risks. Maksym Sakharov, co-founder at WeFi, said the business impact may be limited for now. However, he warned that inflation could make it harder for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Meanwhile, Washington’s upcoming budget debate is adding to market unease. The Treasury is currently using “extraordinary measures” to meet its obligations. Analysts warn that the US could face a funding crunch if a debt ceiling deal isn’t reached soon. While Bitcoin has occasionally moved independently of traditional markets, recent performance suggests it is still sensitive to broader risk-off sentiment. “Given the negative outlook in stock markets, we anticipate that selling pressure may also extend to cryptocurrencies,” said Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler. “Though we do not expect a dramatic selloff in the short term.” The post Crypto Market Slides 3% As Trump’s Sweeping Tariffs Rattle Assets, Recession Fears Mount appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|Crypto Market|tariffs,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-04-04 04:40:37

This continues a sharp PI price decline from the March peak, sparking concerns among investors. However, technical indicators suggest a potential rebound in the short term, although broader challenges may limit any significant recovery. Will Pi Coin Price Bounce Back? The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Pi Network’s coin has dropped below 20, signaling oversold conditions on the hourly chart. Typically, when the RSI falls into this region, a short-term price rebound may follow. Historical trends in the market show that such oversold conditions often lead to temporary recoveries. Source: TradingView Any rebound in PI price is expected to face strong resistance near the $0.6817 to $0.6915 range. This level was once support but has now turned into resistance due to the price’s recent downturn. A break above this resistance would likely trigger a stronger rally, although the broader market environment might still limit the scope of any recovery. In addition to the RSI, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is currently at -0.23, indicating negative money flow. This suggests that selling pressure remains dominant, and there is more capital flowing out of the token than entering. A recent Pi Netwrok price prediction by CoinGape also revealed that bears currently remain dominant, as per the 3-month bias indicator. The chances of a recovery remain diminished due to the abovementioned concerning market dynamics. Broader Market Factors Could Limit Rebound Potential Although the technical analysis shows that Pi Network is highly likely to bounce from the current levels, factors in the broader market may halt a recovery for Pi Network. Currently, investors’ risk appetite is relatively low to moderate and most of them prefer to invest in less-risky assets than investing in other cryptocurrencies including the Pi currency. Moreover, the protracted trade dispute between the United States and the rest of the world as well as the general macroeconomic instability also contributed to the pressure on the crypto market. From within, Pi Network still suffers with a number of problems such as slow feature releases and doubts about its preparedness for the mainnet release. Some of the critics of the Pi Core Team include that the leadership cannot handle the increasing challenge of the project that has been expanding over the years since 2019. PiDaoSwap has voiced frustration over the delayed and dragged-out KYB process, even though their platform is already fully developed. This painful slowdown isn’t just affecting pioneers (with KYC approvals and mainnet migration)—it’s hitting the very ecosystems trying to build on… pic.twitter.com/tqPeLQ8oX6 — Pi Network – Open Mainnet (@Pi81Mall) April 4, 2025 The internal factors coupled with other market conditions might hinder Pi Network full recovery in the short run. Despite the positive outlook given by Craig Steven Wright and others, the community constantly complains about the lack of transparency, slow pace of the KYC integration, and the restricted access for third-party developers. Until these issues are fixed, even if the prices have recovered, it may only be a temporary phenomenon. Will Exchange Listings Boost Pi Coin Price? The overall market activity of Pi Network has been steadily rising and has now taken a promising turn. Trading volume has risen to $478 million, an increase of than 76% compared to its previous level. This is a clear indication that many are investing in the current downward trend waiting for better indicators of improve market performance. However, there is one disadvantage that may have an impact on the increase in optimism – the fact that Pi Network has not been included in the Binance Vote to List . Currently, in the second stage of voting, Binance is allowing only projects related to BNB coin to vote. Without a listing on major platforms like Binance or Coinbase, Pi Network could continue to face challenges in attracting new investors. This absence from large exchanges suggests that PI price may struggle to maintain upward momentum in the coming weeks unless it secures new listings or makes significant progress with its platform. Leadership and Community Concerns The members of the Pi Core Team are under pressure from the Pi Network community. Most people think that the leadership is out of touch with happenings within the network. Although over 125,000 sellers took part in the PiFest event some members of the community feel that the Core Team fails to respond to some profound issues such as mainnet delays, slow KYC, or the absence of listings. One of its critics has been claiming that the Pi Core Team should start with the transparent disclosure of information, as the monthly updates now look artificial and do not reflect the key issues the communities face. Some of the recommendations that have been made regarding the project include decentralizing the decision-making process to enhance accountability.

This week’s event is more modest than average and much smaller than last week’s massive end-of-month and end-of-quarter expiry event. The impact on spot markets is likely to be minimal as spot traders are still reeling from the Trump administration’s wide-sweeping global tariff announcement on Wednesday. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 1.27, meaning that there are more put (short) contracts expiring than calls (longs). There is also a max pain point of $85,000, which is where most losses will be made. Moreover, open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, is falling at higher prices, with around $850 million at $90,000 and $100,000 strike prices, according to Deribit. There is also more than $900 million in OI at the lower $80,000 strike price and over $700 million at $70,000 as derivatives traders lose confidence in higher prices and turn bearish on the longer time frames. Options Expiry Alert! Last week’s quarterly expiry brought the heat, this week’s setup is quieter, but positioning still matters. At 08:00 UTC tomorrow, ~$2.5B in crypto options are set to expire. $BTC : $2.16B notional | Put/Call: 1.27 | Max Pain: $85K $ETH : $371M… pic.twitter.com/zPezzcVn1B — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) April 3, 2025 Crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live said the group was “predominantly bearish, expecting continued choppy price action” in an options market update this week. “Traders are positioning for more blood and four more years of chop with many selling calls, particularly at the $87k and $90k to $94k levels for April 4th expiry,” it stated. Greeks noted the diminishing bullish sentiment, stating “There’s skepticism about upward movement with one trader noting nobody is ready to ‘bullieve’ anymore.” In addition to today’s tranche of Bitcoin options, there are around 204,000 Ethereum contracts that are also expiring today, with a notional value of $372 million, a max pain point of $1,850, and a put/call ratio of 1.32. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $2.5 billion. Crypto Market Outlook Spot markets have continued to retreat this week with a 6.5% decline in total capitalization since this time last Friday, dropping it to $2.75 trillion at the time of writing. Bitcoin remains weakened , having fallen below $81,500 in an intraday low before a minor recovery. It reclaimed $83,000 but fell below it again during Friday morning trading in Asia, suggesting that further downside pressure remains. Ethereum is at bear market lows, having dumped below $1,800 again and trading at levels last seen in October 2023. Meanwhile, altcoins across the board continue to weaken as market sentiment turns bearish.

According to a March 31 update from real estate firm Sterling Bay Properties, Gemini has signed a lease in Miami’s Wynwood Art District, a growing hub for tech and crypto firms, Bloomberg reported . The expansion marks a strategic move by Gemini to broaden its U.S. presence beyond its current offices in New York and Europe. Gemini Set to Open Miami Office as Early as May, Says Bloomberg Bloomberg reports the exchange could begin operating from the new location as early as May. The office opening comes as the SEC’s enforcement action against Gemini appears to be approaching a resolution. A federal judge recently ordered a 60-day pause in the case to allow both parties to explore a potential settlement. The lawsuit, initially filed in January 2023, accuses Gemini of offering and selling unregistered securities through its now-defunct Gemini Earn program.

Earlier this year, Gemini also agreed to pay a $5 million fine to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over alleged misrepresentations during its 2017 effort to launch Bitcoin futures. Gemini reportedly filed confidential paperwork for an initial public offering (IPO) in early 2024, potentially reviving plans first considered in 2021. Miami’s appeal to crypto firms continues to grow, thanks in part to Florida’s business-friendly policies and the absence of a state income tax.

Also brought a Head of State to X.” CZ’s tweet came shortly after he signed an agreement with the Kyrgyz National Investment Agency to help build the nation’s Web3 capacities. Kyrgyzstan’s A7A5 stablecoin, pegged to the Russian ruble and focused on emerging markets, is a cornerstone of that plan. Kyrgyzstan🇰🇬 Crypto adoption, one country at a time. Also brought a Head of State to X. https://t.co/jYYOdiJI4z — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) April 3, 2025 How CZ is helping Kyrgyzstan Thanks to the ton of experience he amassed as Binance’s CEO, CZ has claimed that he has been advising several governments “officially and unofficially” regarding crypto. More countries worldwide are becoming increasingly interested in crypto integration, so it is not surprising that Kyrgyzstan, which has not been a particular hub for crypto activity, is shifting its stance, too. According to recent announcements, the country is now in the process of developing a new A7A5 stablecoin pegged to the Russian ruble. CZ’s claim to be constantly working with world leaders who need his input on crypto holds up as he is a very influential figure in crypto and has been involved with a few official governments in his career. CZ finds the help he provides these people meaningful and has said as much about it on X. “I officially and unofficially advise a few governments on their crypto regulatory frameworks and blockchain solutions for gov efficiency, expanding blockchain to more than trading. I find this work extremely meaningful,” ~ Changpeng Zhao (CZ). His connection with Kyrgyzstan’s new A7A5 stablecoin is yet to be fully disclosed, but it would align with recent allegations of Trump dealings. “A Memorandum of Understanding has been signed between the National Investment Agency under the President of the Kyrgyz Republic and Changpeng Zhao (CZ). In accordance with the Memorandum, the parties intend to cooperate in the development of the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology ecosystem in the Kyrgyz Republic,” claimed President Sadyr Zhaparov in the MoU. A Memorandum of Understanding has been signed between the National Investment Agency under the President of the Kyrgyz Republic and Changpeng Zhao (CZ) In accordance with the Memorandum, the parties intend to cooperate in the development of the cryptocurrency and blockchain… — Sadyr Zhaparov (@sadyrzhaparovkg) April 3, 2025 According to Zhaparov’s statement, the Binance founder will provide things like infrastructural, technological support, technical expertise, and consulting services on crypto and blockchain technologies. The president also stated that this agreement with CZ will strengthen Kyrgyzstan’s standing in the growing Web3 environment. The long-term plan is to help create new opportunities for Kyrgyz businesses and society as a whole. This will presumably involve some cooperation with Russia, as A7A5’s press release mentions “a new class of digital assets tied to the Russian economy.” Kyrgyzstan has strong ties with Russia. In 2012, both countries signed an agreement which led to the creation of a joint military base in Kyrgyzstan. Kyrgyzstan’s move may be part of its strategy to capitalize on emerging markets. At best, this is a novel experiment that could reveal new market opportunities and challenge the dominance of USD-pegged stablecoins in the region. Kyrgyzstan’s past relationship with crypto Like many other places in the world, Kyrgyzstan initially approached crypto with lots of regulations in an attempt to protect its citizens from scams and the like. Of course, a large part of it also stemmed from the fact that the government knew only the bad things the mainstream media said about crypto. Eventually, in 2020, the National Bank of Kyrgyzstan published draft legislation that would legally define cryptocurrency and how it may be used in the Central Asian nation. The legislation was the central bank’s way of following the call of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to regulate cryptocurrencies and prevent related money laundering and terrorism financing risks, according to an explanatory note . It was a necessary step to mitigate the risks as Kyrgyz’ citizens were becoming increasingly interested and exposed to cryptocurrencies, while the technology continues to gain traction in electronic commerce worldwide. The regulator announced the proposed legislation on December 31, 2020, publishing it with a package of drafts detailing why the new bill was needed and how it fits into Kyrgyzstan’s existing regulations. This laid the groundwork for Kyrgyzstan to adopt an even more comprehensive package of laws regulating the cryptocurrency market. This year, the country has introduced full legislation on digital assets, covering all major aspects of the industry — from exchanges to token issuers, thereby creating a new institutional infrastructure the market previously lacked. One of the unique innovations is the mechanism for registering token issuances under official state supervision. This gives regulators authority to ensure that token emissions comply with regulatory requirements, have fiat backing, undergo regular audits, and meet obligations to token holders. The first issuance of A7A5 (mint) was carried out in complete accordance with the new national legislation — under the control of regulatory authorities and directed to an officially registered, regulated broker. The A7A5 token can be traded on the regulated exchange Meer Exchange and is expected to be listed on decentralized platforms in the future. Its fiat backing is stored in bank accounts, and its volume is audited by an independent firm on a quarterly basis. However, the key advantage of A7A5 is the opportunity it offers to earn up to 20% annually, driven by its link to the refinancing rate of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and additional income strategies in DeFi.

The digital asset currently trades at $1.98, a daily trading volume of $10.50 billion and market value of $115 billion. Over the last 24 hours, XRP has declined by 7.7%, which mirrors larger market trends. Related Reading: XRP’s Rise To Rarity: Only 1% May Afford It, Expert Says Bitcoin’s Roller Coaster Affects Altcoin Market Bitcoin’s recent price move to $81,700 and subsequent sharp pullback has sent ripple effects throughout other cryptocurrencies.

According to this analysis, if prices hit the anticipated bottom, a rally of as much as 70% might ensue. Lull Period Pre-Surge The price history of the cryptocurrency depicts cycles of protracted periods of quietness preceded by explosive bursts. With recent market conditions contributing to a perfect storm of inputs, investors are closely watching price charts for subtle early indications of XRP’s next big move. RP has tended to catch investors off guard with unanticipated action, and April could be a decisive month for the coin. Traders are bracing for a few different scenarios: more consolidation, a breakout, or a sudden market change. Related Reading: XRP To $27 In 60 Days? Analyst Sees Deja Vu In Price Action April May Mark End Of Consolidation Meanwhile, several market watchers define XRP’s present trend as a period of consolidation that usually precedes considerable price action. According to analysts, this phase could end soon, potentially propelling XRP into more robust positive momentum. A final test around the $2 level may be used as a springboard for what some expect to be a major breakthrough. While near-term uncertainty exists, the long-term picture is cautiously optimistic from the perspective of market observers. Technical signals alongside economic fundamentals indicate a phase of heightened price activity in the next few weeks.

With this, the US stocks had their worst day ever since 2020 . As a result, the investors are scared of further escalation and economic fallout. The negative impact has been seen over the crypto markets as Bitcoin & Ethereum remain consolidated within a range. While the technical implications suggest a bullish outlook for the ETH price rally, the whales do not appear to be confident enough. A major institutional tsunami is detected, which is expected to create serious atmospheric pressure. Millions of liquidity are hitting the exchanges, which suggests a storm is forming that may shake up the entire market. New on-chain data reveals a lot of ETH have been deposited into the exchanges in the past 24 hours. This could be a matter of concern, as it may mount enough pressure over the ETH price. As per data shared by The Data Nerd , an on-chain data provider, massive amounts of ETH have been transferred back into ETH. Grayscale deposited 16,247 ETH, worth $28.63 ETH; Blackrock deposited 10,000 ETH, worth $17.94 ETH; Wintermute deposited 34,634 ETH, worth $62.9 million; Andre Cronje deposited 2000 ETH, worth over $3.44 million; and James Fickle deposited 2.35K ETH, worth $4.19 million. On the other hand, yet another whale scooped nearly 6500 ETH , spending 11.5 million USDC that could have kept the price consolidated above the crucial support. While Ethereum faces equal pressure on both sides, will whale accumulation outweigh the uncertainty caused by institutional ETH transfers? Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis It’s a known fact that bears have been capitulating ETH price for over a period, which has kept the levels restricted within a descending range. However, a major change could be expected soon as the token has reached the end of the consolidation. However, the technicians do not suggest bullish reversal or display any bullish divergence, which raises concerns over the next price action. The ETH price in the daily timeframe is approaching the tip of the falling wedge, which is expected to trigger a huge breakout towards the immediate resistance. Meanwhile, the Accum/Dist suggests the token’s distribution is going on, and the price may begin to rise once the accumulation resumes. On the other hand, RSI remains consolidated within the lower bands, suggesting a massive drop in the strength of the rally.

With the sweeping tariffs from Donald Trump, the stock and crypto markets have become correlated and are sensitive to macroeconomic developments. Regardless, the top trader notes that a breakdown of the US Dollar Index below a key support zone could spark the bull run for BTC price. Crypto Trader Says Breakdown of DXY Below 100 Could Spark Bitcoin Price Rally The US Dollar Index (DXY) has crashed 8% in the past 80 days, dropping from a high of 110.176 to 101.267. In the same period, Bitcoin price has shed 13%. Typically, a weak US dollar promotes risk-on behavior, allowing the stock market to rally. However, the recent intervention of Trump and his tariffs on more than 100 of US trading patterns has caused the US stock markets and BTC price to collapse.. Top trader CarpeNoctom explains that the recent crash from 103 to 101 should see crypto markets rally. Through his chart , the analyst notes Bitcoin price and the broader crypto market could ‘explode higher,’ aka restart the bull run. US Dollar Index Crashed 8% Since Jan 13 Arthur Hayes adds credence to this bullish Bitcoin price prediction by noting that BTC should decorrelate from the US tech stock. Why Collapsing DXY, Decorrelation from US Tech Stocks is Good for BTC Arthur Hayes, the recently pardoned founder of BitMEX exchange, said that he “loved tariffs.” Hayes explained, “Global imbalances will be corrected, and the pain papered over with printed money, which is good for $BTC.” The tariffs have caused the dollar to weaken while prompting foreign investors to sell US tech stocks to “bring money home.” Hayes notes that this is good for Bitcoin and gold over the medium term. Key Levels to Watch as Bitcoin Consolidates According to TraderMagus, a popular analyst and trader, the two key Bitcoin price levels to watch include $80K and $90K. Magus explains that a risk-on scenario would appear if BTC drips below $80K or if price climbs to $90K and shows strength above this level. The trader explains that intraday plays are the way to go and that investors should not get their capital chopped up. “I think it’s a massive buy opportunity once the dust settles on all this for equites & btc” To conclude, the crypto market outlook remains uncertain in the short term. In the mid-term, a sweep of $80K followed by a recovery could send Bitcoin’s value to $90K. However, a rejection at $90K could push BTC back into consolidation. On the contrary, a bearish outlook involves a breakdown of the $80K level without any support from buyers. Such a development could see the price crash to $69K, the next key foothold, where demand from long-term investors could come back.

There was a break below a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.170 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could extend losses if it breaks the $0.1550 support zone. Dogecoin Price Dips Again Dogecoin price started a fresh decline after it failed to clear $0.180, like Bitcoin and Ethereum .

Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.1880 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.1950. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.170 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.160 level. The next major support is near the $0.1550 level. The main support sits at $0.150. If there is a downside break below the $0.150 support, the price could decline further.

Pi has also hit a new All-time low of $0.53. This sudden decline comes after Binance once again excluded Pi Network from its latest round of the “Vote to List” initiative—a community-driven program that allows Binance users to vote on which cryptocurrencies should be listed on the platform. In the latest voting round, Binance selected 12 tokens: Virtual Protocol, Big Time, UXLINK, Morpho, Grass, Aethir, Walrus, Safe, Zeta, Story, Ondo, and Plume. In the first round, the chosen tokens were BANANAS31, BID, Broccoli, and KOMA (Koma Inu) among others. Despite being part of earlier community voting efforts, Pi Network’s absence from the latest list has sparked frustration among Pi holders, who feel overlooked in favor of meme coins and other projects with less utility-driven focus. This sentiment is amplified by the fact that Binance’s voting system is designed to reflect community preferences, yet Pi Network’s strong following was not enough to secure a spot. Pi Coin Price Analysis: Pi coin has hit record lows, dropping over 80% since its recent all-time high of $2.981 in February. The network’s mining rate has also fallen by 1.18%, indicating decreasing interest. With major exchanges like Binance still not listing Pi, its market momentum remains weak. However, a breakout above $0.71 could spark a short-term rally. Binance’s “Vote to List” initiative is intended to give the community more influence in listing decisions, but the exclusion of Pi Network raises questions about the criteria used for selection. While Binance has not yet provided an official statement regarding Pi’s omission, the market’s reaction has been swift, with Pi Coin’s price reflecting the disappointment among its supporters.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-04 05:13:47

This latest decline came after a former PI proponent alleged the project to be a slow rug pull, while others have questioned the team’s viability. PI Token Price. Source: CoinGecko PI’s Latest Plunge The first month and a half after PI’s official launch and ability to be traded are a perfect example of a typical ‘sell-the-news’ event in the cryptocurrency industry amid massive hype. Recall that the project actually started roughly seven years ago, and it was in development until February 20, 2025. Within this rather extensive time period, its community grew substantially even though it saw countless delays and controversial moves. After PI went live, its price shot up from under $2 to $3 to mark a new all-time high. That was on February 26. Since then, it has been nothing short of a spectacular downfall . At press time, PI trades at $0.55, which is 81.5% lower than its record. Hours ago, it charted a new all-time low of $0.54 (according to data from CoinGecko) after dumping by another 16-7% in the past day. Admittedly, the entire crypto market has struggled in the last 36 hours after Trump’s latest tariffs, but very few large or mid-cap alts have produced such massive declines. Actually, PI is the biggest loser from the top 100 alts. Next in line is SUI with -10% and all others are with single-digit drops, even the ever-volatile meme coins. PI has fallen out of the top 30 alts by market cap. Recall that the asset was close to the top 10 just over a month ago. Further Troubles Ahead? The new all-time low comes just a day after a former PI proponent did an 180 and called Pi Network a “slow rug.” Crypto X is full with analysts and commentators that are trying to make sense of what is happening with PI’s price and in the overall Pi Network ecosystem. Dr Altcoin was skeptical about PI’s long-term potential since most major exchanges, such as Binance, seem reluctant to list it, at least until the ‘Pi Core Team (PCT) becomes fully transparent about its tokenomics.’ ‘At such a low price, the Pi community will struggle to utilize DApps within the Pi Ecosystem. If this continues for months, most Pi holders will sell off their coins and shift to newer crypto projects.’ – Dr Altcoin added. The only move ahead, the X user concluded, is to ‘burn billions of Pi coins from its Pi Foundation wallets. This is the only way to push the price above $10 and sustain the network’s long-term value.’ The post Pi Network Under Fire: PI Token Plummets 16% to an All-Time Low appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Pi Network (PI),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-04-04 05:14:44

Ripple will pay a reduced civil penalty of $50 million , a 60% cut from the initially proposed $125 million. In exchange, the SEC has agreed to request the removal of a key injunction that previously required Ripple to register future securities sales. But the resolution has not sparked the market reaction many expected. XRP’s price has remained mostly unchanged, confounding speculators who anticipated a post-settlement rally. Meanwhile, the case has taken a new turn with an unexpected emergency filing from a third party. SEC drops injunction, Ripple to pay $50 million Under the terms of the settlement, Ripple avoids a prolonged legal process by paying a significantly reduced fine. The SEC will also ask Judge Analisa Torres to remove the “obey the law” injunction—an order that restricted Ripple from engaging in unregistered securities sales in the future. The decision comes months after the court ruled that Ripple’s XRP token was not, in itself, a security under federal law. While the resolution marks a legal win for Ripple, the broader crypto market has shown limited enthusiasm. XRP, which many traders expected to surge after the outcome, has remained stagnant. Unlike the price jumps seen in previous SEC settlements involving crypto platforms like Kraken and Cumberland, XRP has yet to respond, reflecting muted market sentiment or possibly pricing-in of the legal outcome beforehand. Keener files surprise evidence in case Just as the case appeared to be over, a new twist emerged. On 29 March 2025, an emergency motion was filed in the Ripple docket by a man named Justin W. Keener. Keener claims he possesses “decisive evidence in favour of the defendants and in favour of liberty for the American people.” According to his filing, this evidence is related to physical investment contracts he has been collecting, although no further details have been provided. Eleanor Terrett @EleanorTerrett · Follow 🚨NEW: An odd filing just now in the @SECGov vs. @Ripple docket — an emergency request to “present decisive evidence in favor of the defendants and in favor of liberty for the American people.” The letter, from a man named Justin W. Keener, doesn’t make clear what the so-called 4:13 AM · Apr 4, 2025 1.6K Reply Copy link Read 230 replies Keener, also known as “Jason W. Keener,” is not new to SEC enforcement. He was previously sued by the regulator for operating as an unregistered penny stock dealer and was ordered by the court to pay over $10 million in damages. His attempt to intervene in the Ripple case has raised questions about motive and relevance, especially given his own legal history with the agency. The emergency request does not appear to have any immediate bearing on the finalised settlement but has drawn fresh attention to the case file just as it seemed to be concluding. The filing has been listed in the public docket, and its inclusion may prompt further procedural clarifications from the court. XRP community awaits SEC statement Despite the closure, members of the XRP community are still awaiting a formal public statement from the SEC. In past settlements involving crypto entities, the Commission has issued detailed press releases outlining the rationale and implications. No such announcement has yet been published regarding the Ripple settlement. This silence has added to speculation around the implications of the deal, particularly regarding XRP’s legal classification in future transactions. As of now, the final judgement in favour of Ripple remains intact, including Judge Torres’ ruling that XRP is not a security when traded on public exchanges. However, the SEC retains authority over institutional sales and continues to monitor compliance with securities regulations across the digital asset space. XRP price flat despite settlement The most notable market reaction, or lack thereof, has been from XRP itself. Since news of the settlement emerged, XRP has traded sideways , failing to break past key resistance levels. Analysts suggest that the outcome may have already been priced into XRP, or that investors are awaiting further regulatory clarity before entering new positions. The absence of a price surge contrasts with patterns seen in similar cases. When Kraken and Cumberland reached their own settlements with the SEC, their associated tokens saw short-term gains. XRP’s flat performance highlights continued investor caution and possibly reflects a larger trend of uncertainty in the US crypto regulatory environment.

Why did TOSHI make this list of the best cryptos to buy now? Because it’s one of the top meme coins on Base, leveraging Coinbase’s infrastructure to push for long-term growth. 3. SPX6900 (SPX) – The Meme Coin Fueling Decentralized Hype SPX6900 (SPX) has built a strong presence with its meme-driven culture and community-first approach. Backed by deflationary mechanics and a highly engaged user base, SPX has continued to grow while keeping its decentralization ethos intact. Why is SPX6900 here among the best cryptos to buy now? It’s proving that meme coins with active communities and scarcity mechanics can stay relevant beyond the hype. 4.

This gamified approach attracted millions of players, making it one of the fastest-growing interactive crypto projects.

Gemini, the crypto exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, is expanding to Miami as a key SEC enforcement case against the firm sees signs of resolution. Meanwhile, decentralized exchange aggregator ParaSwap has rebranded to Velora, launching a protocol upgrade aimed at enhancing user control and minimizing MEV-related risks in DeFi trading. Gemini Expands to Miami as SEC Lawsuit Nears Resolution Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by billionaire twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, is setting up shop in Miami’s trendy Wynwood Art District — a move that comes as the firm appears to be putting major regulatory headwinds behind it. The expansion into South Florida may mark the start of a new chapter for the exchange, which has navigated intense scrutiny from US regulators over the past few years. Sterling Bay Properties post (Source: Instagram) According to a March 31 announcement from real estate developer Sterling Bay Properties, Gemini has officially signed a lease for office space in Wynwood. Bloomberg reported that the company expects to take occupancy by May, placing the New York-based exchange among a growing list of crypto firms planting roots in Florida. While Gemini has yet to issue a formal statement on the move, the strategic decision comes at a time when the company’s regulatory battles appear to be de-escalating. A Legal Cloud Begins to Clear Gemini’s Miami expansion follows a significant development in the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) ongoing lawsuit against the company. In January 2023, the SEC accused Gemini of offering unregistered securities through its now-defunct Gemini Earn program — a yield-bearing service that was popular among retail crypto investors before being abruptly shuttered during the 2022 crypto winter. However, in a recent court order, a federal judge granted a 60-day stay on the case, offering both parties time to “explore a potential resolution.” This pause may indicate that the long-standing legal dispute could soon reach a settlement or be dropped altogether. The news comes as a welcome shift for Gemini, which has struggled to grow amid an uncertain regulatory landscape. Adding to this narrative, Cameron Winklevoss revealed in February that the SEC had closed a separate investigation into the company. Earlier this year, Gemini also agreed to pay a $5 million fine to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) related to alleged misrepresentations during a 2017 application to offer Bitcoin futures contracts. The settlement removed another legal hurdle from Gemini’s path. The Miami office move is more than a geographical pivot — it signals Gemini’s intent to reaccelerate growth in the United States and potentially reenter public markets. In early 2025, the firm reportedly filed confidential paperwork for an initial public offering (IPO), reviving ambitions it had explored as early as 2021. Though details remain scarce, the IPO filing suggests that Gemini is preparing for a new phase of transparency, expansion, and investor engagement. Should the SEC lawsuit reach a favorable conclusion, Gemini would be in a stronger position to attract institutional partnerships, scale its products, and compete more directly with rivals like Coinbase and Kraken, both of which have been actively expanding their US and global footprints. Why Miami? Miami's appeal to crypto firms has only grown in recent years. The city offers a unique mix of tax incentives, tech talent, and cultural vibrancy — especially in Wynwood, known for its murals, galleries, and burgeoning tech community. Florida's lack of a state income tax makes it especially attractive for both companies and high-net-worth individuals seeking to relocate operations or headquarters. Ripple Labs already maintains an office in Wynwood, while Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), one of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin miners, is based in nearby Fort Lauderdale. The presence of these major players may have helped influence Gemini’s decision to choose the area as its new U.S. base of operations outside of New York. The move also aligns with broader trends in the industry. With regulatory uncertainty in states like New York and California, crypto companies are increasingly looking to regions with more favorable or clear-cut frameworks for digital assets. ParaSwap Rebrands to Velora as It Pushes Into the Future of Intents-Based DeFi Trading Gemini is not the only company making moves. ParaSwap, the prominent decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator, has officially rebranded to Velora, marking a significant transformation not only in name but also in function. Alongside the rebrand, Velora unveiled the latest version of its protocol — Delta v2.5 — designed to further the platform’s vision of “intents-based trading” and deliver a more customizable, efficient, and fair trading experience. The rebranding and protocol upgrade signal a deepening commitment to tackling one of DeFi’s most persistent challenges: Maximum Extractable Value (MEV). As bots continue to exploit transaction ordering for profit at the expense of users, Velora is doubling down on technical innovations meant to neutralize these exploitative dynamics. From ParaSwap to Velora: A New Chapter in DeFi Velora's new name and direction reflect a broader shift in the DEX aggregator’s mission. Since launching intents-based trading in mid-2024, the platform has focused on transforming how decentralized trades are executed. The Delta v2.5 upgrade builds on that by enhancing trade flexibility, unlocking advanced tools like limit orders, and making way for cross-chain execution — a key demand in today's multi-chain DeFi environment. Over the past year, ParaSwap (now Velora) saw over 4.3 million smart contract interactions and drew approximately 18,000 monthly active users, according to data from TokenTerminal . Paraswap daily active users (Source: TokenTerminal) This active engagement reflects strong interest in alternatives to traditional execution models, especially among users seeking deeper control over trades and better protection from predatory behavior on-chain. At the heart of Velora’s transformation is its unique approach to combatting MEV — a challenge that has long undermined fairness and transparency in decentralized markets. MEV bots typically front-run transactions, reorder trades for profit, or perform arbitrage in ways that extract value from regular users. The consequence isn’t just individual transaction losses — it’s a systemic erosion of trust in decentralized finance, according to Velora founder Mounir Benchemled. Velora’s response is an intent-based architecture that breaks down each order into three stages: Preprocessing the intent — defining what the user wants, including expected price and execution preferences. Submitting to an auction layer — where competing execution agents determine the most optimal path for the trade across liquidity pools, timing windows, and block constraints. Execution by the winning agent — chosen based on efficiency and MEV protection capabilities. This system is designed not only to neutralize malicious bots but also to abstract execution complexity away from users, allowing them to interact with DeFi in a more intuitive and safer manner. A Better UX for DeFi’s Next Wave Velora’s implementation of intents-based execution comes amid a broader DeFi trend toward user experience simplification. Despite DeFi’s explosive growth, many new users remain intimidated by the technical complexity of smart contracts, gas optimization, and transaction finality. In an interview, Sergej Kunz, co-founder of rival DEX aggregator 1inch, endorsed the broader movement toward intent-based systems: “An intent-based system is designed to shift all risk and complexity away from users and into the hands of professionals who specialize in executing advanced DeFi strategies,” Kunz said. “A true intent-based DEX must provide MEV protection at the protocol level and offload execution complexity to professional trading bots.” This philosophy underpins Velora’s Delta v2.5 upgrade, which promises to give users greater control over their trades without requiring them to navigate the nuances of block timing, gas fees, or routing logic. Features like limit orders and multi-block execution further expand the possibilities for strategic trading on-chain. The Velora rebrand and upgrade come at a pivotal time. With DeFi once again gaining momentum amid renewed institutional interest and rising crypto prices, users are demanding more from decentralized platforms — not just in terms of yields or trading pairs, but in security, fairness, and usability. Velora is positioning itself as a key player in this next wave of innovation, building on ParaSwap’s legacy while venturing into the frontier of intent-driven finance. If successful, it could usher in a more user-friendly and equitable DeFi experience — one where human intent drives market logic, not just bots and algorithms.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|FORKS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-04 05:30:00

China will be subject to an even steeper 54% levy. The announcement sent tech stocks tumbling, and analysts warned of far-reaching disruptions rippling through the digital advertising landscape, retail media and supply chains more broadly. Meta and Amazon at risk as tariffs threaten Chinese advertising ecosystem The broad tariffs, which cover all products entering the U.S. from abroad, are a distinct danger to companies like Meta and Amazon, which increasingly depend on advertising by Chinese sellers and brands. Meta, for instance, has about $10 billion in revenue from international advertisers, mostly from China, according to veteran advertising analyst Brian Wieser. Amazon is also exposed, however, because the Chinese merchants that dominate its marketplace are responsible for almost half of its top sellers. Many of these sellers use Amazon’s advertising ecosystem to target their products to American shoppers, an industry now threatened with disruption. “The biggest losers you’re going to see right now are companies based on Chinese-based advertising: social media and retail media,” said Eric Haggstrom, director of market intelligence at Advertiser Perceptions. He added that the most immediate effect would probably be in categories such as apparel and home goods, where Chinese sellers are a linchpin. Digital Ad ecosystem faces disruption as tariffs impact spending and shift priorities Ad analysts say the tariffs will send shock waves throughout the digital advertising ecosystem. With many consumer products manufactured in China and Vietnam, companies such as Meta and Amazon advertisers might trim spending amid higher prices. However, establishment ad-driven platforms, including Meta, Amazon, and Google, are said to be resilient thanks to their scale, precise targeting, and ability to deliver results that can be measured. “The retail media outlets are just going to continue to win,” said Nadja Bellan-White, the CEO of M+C Saatchi Group. However, she said that advertisers will expect clearer return-on-investment guarantees now. Pinterest, Reddit, and Snap may be at the most risk because they lack the scale and familiarity among advertisers that Meta and Google have, according to analysts at NewStreet Research. Reddit, in particular, has niche communities that are more difficult for brands to reach, making it potentially an easier ad budget cut. Media giants and digital platforms face economic uncertainty as tariff impact looms Non-tech giants are bracing for fallout, too, as media and entertainment companies react to the news. Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and Netflix were all mixed after the tariff announcement, with their stocks diving. Morningstar analysts warned that weakness in the economy caused by the trade war could weigh on consumer spending, which would hurt companies that depend on both direct consumer purchases and advertising revenue. Disney’s theme parks and experiences business, a big driver of profits, may feel the pinch if a recession follows the implementation of the tariffs, which could lead attendance to decline. Its streaming business is growing, which might soften the blow somewhat. Likewise, WBD’s recent streaming gains could offset ad-driven losses, though it carries a heavy debt burden and is therefore more vulnerable to tightening credit markets. While Netflix does not depend on physical goods, it may experience slower growth in Europe if retaliatory tariffs arise. Bernstein analysts flagged the threat of Europe responding with measures that could hurt Netflix’s dominant position in the continent’s biggest streaming markets. Among the biggest uncertainties surrounding the tariffs is what happens with TikTok. Known as the Tariff Man, Trump has teased that he could use the tariffs to push China into permitting the app’s sale. TikTok has made some strides in demonstrating its effectiveness as an advertising platform. However, many brands still appear hesitant to invest in the platform, presumably due to fear of regulatory scrutiny and the possibility of a ban in the U.S. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Technical indicators point to SOL getting prepared for a notable upward rise following a sequence of price swings and periods of consolidation. Expert analysis indicates Solana is creating a classic technical structure connected with bullish momentum—a cup and handle pattern on its weekly chart. This pattern usually signifies the end of a consolidation phase and the possibility of a fresh rise. Solana’s cup and handle formulation The development of the cup and handle pattern is a fundamental technical indicator for traders, especially on a long-term chart. For Solana, this trend started to show itself during the January rejection of Bitcoin at the $295 resistance level. SOL had a substantial downturn following this rejection, steadying at $125. This price action produced the “cup” part of the pattern, in which SOL circled the bottom as the market cooled off. The “handle” portion of the pattern is the phase that followed, which had a more minor consolidation of close to $125. The price goes sideways in this period, usually going through a last shakeout before a possible breakout. Analysts believe Solana might rocket toward new highs, aiming for the $400 mark, if she can break above the $295 resistance with significant volume. The path forward: a potential breakout? Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez thinks one key element will determine Solana’s future price action: volume. A breakout over the $295 neckline would need significant purchasing pressure to cement the positive trend. Should SOL sustain this increasing momentum, it may set off a rally pushing the token into unexplored territory based on analysts’ speculations about $400 being within reach. One significant drawback is that should Solana fail to break over this crucial barrier with considerable volume, the market may reverse. SOL may revert into a bearish trend without constant buying pressure, therefore revisiting reduced support levels. Traders and investors should be attentive to these events since the result could significantly affect SOL’s future. Rexas Finance (RXS) – the new market disrupter While Solana’s potential breakout generates excitement, a more significant rally might be underway elsewhere. A more recent venture in the cryptocurrency market, Rexas Finance (RXS), is attracting much interest for its creative method of tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs). Rexas Finance is building a unique ecosystem on the blockchain, hoping to make illiquid assets, such as real estate, commodities, and private equity, globally tradable. With 91.46% of the authorized tokens sold for its last stage, the project’s presale has succeeded dramatically. From $0.03 in Stage 1 to $0.20 in Stage 12, RXS’s price has surged, a 567% increase. The presale has generated $47.4 million; with the official exchange debut only over the horizon, analysts are projecting a significant increase in the token’s price once it lists on international platforms. The much-awaited Rexas Finance (RXS) exchange debut is on June 19, 2025. With a verified listing price of $0.25, the project intends to list on at least three of the top ten worldwide exchanges. This launch should generate significant liquidity, increasing demand for the token even more. Based on past performance following comparable high-profile events, analysts project a 30,000% increase in RXS’s price following launch. Rexas Finance’s creative use case—which provides concrete real-world applications—helps explain the growing curiosity about it. The concept immediately attracts investors and blockchain engineers since Rexas Finance guarantees the revolutionization of conventional finance through flawless tokenized asset trade. Avalanche (AVAX): gearing up for a comeback Avalanche (AVAX) has recently recovered from recent lows and indicates a possible rally. At $18.46, AVAX witnessed a slight 0.31% decline over the previous 24 hours, yet experts think it is about to recover. AVAX has demonstrated positive momentum following a rebound from the $16 support level; charts reveal a five-wave impulse pattern. Analysts believe AVAX may reach $200 if Avalanche surpasses important resistance levels. Developers find the platform especially appealing because of its quick and low-cost blockchain architecture; institutional demand for blockchain-based smart contracts and payments keeps growing. The bigger picture Projects like Rexas Finance (RXS) and Avalanche (AVAX) are becoming popular with their creative ideas and practical applications, even while Solana is still a major participant in the crypto scene and might witness a breakout to the $295 mark. Rexas Finance attracts much interest since it emphasizes tokenizing illiquid assets and creating new investment opportunities. These initiatives will lead the way in 2025 as the market turns toward more sensible uses of blockchain technology.

In the four-hour timeframe, SOL price has already broken out of a falling logarithmic trend and is currently retesting a previously established support level of around $124. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

While its V-shaped recovery pattern is still intact, it is likely to resume bearish avtions if the price continues to drop daily. Last month saw most altcoins through a temporal halt in selling as they retraced significantly, but many short-lived the momentum following a sharp rejection and they quickly lost steam after tapping a month’s high. However, TON’s retracement is still looking intact on the daily chart as it continues to form a V-shaped pattern, but the crypto recently shed losses following a bearish weekly start. This loss came as a result of the retracement of the bullish impulsive movement, which came in the form of a higher high and higher low pattern on the hourly chart. If this bullish pattern continues to play, we can expect a bounce back soon. This should bring more increase to sustain the bullish V-shaped pattern on the daily chart. As mentioned in the previous analysis, this reversal pattern is capable of sending the price to $7, to form an inverse head-and-shoulder pattern after a major pullback. On the other hand, a sharp drop from the current trading level could bring us back to the recent bottom. Such a move would invalidate the current bullish signal daily, especially if the price breaks down. TON’s Key Level to Watch Source: Tradingview In the latest drop, there’s close support at $3.52. If this support fails to produce a bounce, the price may roll over to the $3.18, $2.74 and $2.36 levels before breaking lower. Retaking the weekly lost $4.21 high, TON may advance buying towards the $4.79 level. The higher resistance level to watch for a surge is $5.66. Key Resistance Levels: $4.21, $4.79, $5.66 Key Support Levels: $3.52, $3.18, $2.74 Spot Price: $3.66 Trend: Bullish Volatility: Low Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Crypto markets saw high volatility on Wednesday and Thursday in the run-up to the tariff announcement, where President Donald Trump levied a minimum 10% fee on all imports to the country. Major tokens bitcoin (BTC) , ether (ETH) , Solana’s SOL , XRP (XRP) , and others, zoomed ahead of the speech and slumped as global markets fell, reversing all gains from the start of the week. Markets have since shown an uptick in prices on Friday morning, with BTC steady above $83,100, ETH retaking $1,800 and XRP, SOL and ADA rising over 2%. Ahead of Trump’s speech, investors transferred larger volumes of Bitcoin, ETH, and XRP into exchanges, suggesting a growing intent to sell, per a CryptoQuant note shared with CoinDesk on Thursday. Bitcoin transactions surged to as much as 2,500 BTC in a single block just hours after Trump began speaking. In the U.S., Coinbase also saw a rise in bitcoin deposits, particularly from large holders. Similarly, ETH inflows into exchanges spiked to an hourly peak of approximately 80,000 ETH. XRP transfers into Binance jumped to 130 million in one hour, up from under 10 million XRP per hour throughout most of the previous day. These rising exchange inflows reflected investor willingness to exit positions amid growing economic uncertainty, CryptoQuant said, with demand for Bitcoin and ETH declining in the perpetual futures market as traders closed their long positions to take profits. But with headwinds behind and a new economic data set to be released later Friday could provide the impetus for a short-term relief in markets. Attention is on the non-farm payroll report scheduled for a Friday release. The monthly U.S. economic indicator released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the change in employment, reflecting job creation, unemployment trends, and wage growth, offering insight into economic health. “Investors are bracing for signs of softness in the U.S. labour market,” Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast earlier Friday. “ A weaker-than-expected print would bolster the case for further Fed rate cuts this year, as policymakers attempt to cushion a decelerating economy.” Data shows markets are pricing in four rate cuts in 2025 — 0.25 bps each in June, July, September and December. Rate cuts occur when a central bank, like the Federal Reserve, lowers interest rates to stimulate economic growth by making borrowing cheaper. Bitcoin, and the broader market, tend to react positively to rate cuts, as lower rates reduce the appeal of traditional investments like bonds, driving investors toward alternatives like BTC. Additionally, a weaker dollar can enhance BTC’s value as a hedge against inflation or currency devaluation. QCP Capital said it continues to observe elevated volatility in the short term, with more buyers of downside protection. “That said, with positioning now light and risk assets largely oversold, the stage may be set for a near-term bounce,” the fund said.",Markets|Bitcoin|XRP|Trading,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-04 05:45:54
42884930,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=705366,1743746106,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42884930.jpeg,"An odd filing just graced the SEC vs Ripple docket, “liberty for the American people”",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/odd-filing-just-graced-sec-vs-ripple-docket/,"A non-party filed an emergency letter dated April 2 to federal Judge Analisa Torres, who oversaw the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) case against Ripple Labs. The letter claimed to have “decisive evidence” to settle pertinent questions in the lawsuit. FOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett first reported on the “odd filing” on social media platform X late Wednesday. She mentioned that Justin W. Keener, the one who filed the letter, said his plea was an “emergency request to present decisive evidence in favor of the defendants and in favor of liberty for the American people.” In the letter , Keener doesn’t explain what this “decisive evidence” is other than a vague reference to “physical investment contracts” he has collected. He described himself as a concerned citizen with no financial stake in the case, stating his aim is to expose what he sees as government overreach in the SEC’s legal strategy. Who is Justin Keener? According to a December 2022 published report on the SEC website, Keener was sued by the financial regulator in 2020, alleging that he acted as an unregistered dealer while transacting hundreds of millions in penny stocks. A federal court, led by US District Court for the Southern District of Florida Judge Beth Bloom, ordered him to pay more than $10 million in penalties. In its final judgment, the court ordered Keener to pay a total of $10.2 million, including $7.79 million in disgorgement, $1.43 million in prejudgment interest, and a $1.03 million civil penalty. The judgment also imposed a permanent injunction and a five-year ban on participating in penny stock offerings. Additionally, Keener was required to relinquish certain stock holdings and conversion rights tied to existing convertible securities. His request to the court seems like a self-serving attempt to restore his public image, although supporters may see that his filing proportionately touches on the SEC’s “unfair” actions. Keener’s letter argues that the SEC’s proposed $2 billion penalty is excessive, unfair, and threatens American innovation. He points to the July 2023 summary judgment, in which the court found Ripple’s past direct sales of XRP to institutional investors violated Section 5 of the Securities Act but also ruled that other sales, such as programmatic ones, did not. “ Ripple has represented that it ceased making institutional sales of XRP in the United States after the SEC filed suit. These facts make clear that any violation was limited in scope and duration, and there is no ongoing violation of the securities laws. Importantly, the SEC has never alleged fraud or misrepresentation by Ripple ,” he surmised. He also talked about past SEC settlements that involved far higher capital raises but resulted in far lower penalties: $24 million for Block.one, $18.5 million for Telegram, $5 million for Kik, and $21 million for Genesis. “ Given the absence of fraud and the limited violation scope, ” the letter continues, “ a $2 billion penalty appears designed to punish rather than remedy. This may violate the Supreme Court’s stance on civil penalties, which must remain remedial in nature .” XRP struggles continue post-SEC court battle Meanwhile, Ripple’s native token XRP has yet to register a profound positive price action. It is now trading at $2.05, 1.2% down in the last 24 hours, and well below moving averages, with signs of a growing distribution phase. Per TradingView’s technical analysis , momentum indicators reaffirm the downward trajectory, with a dangerously oversold Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 38.6, and a bearish Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) crossover signaling no immediate relief for bulls. Short-term traders are watching the $2.01 support level, which, if broken, could send prices down to $1.97. For any bullish rebound to take shape, the price needs to clear $2.16 with volume support. Mark watchers have pinned the most advantageous short entry in the $2.16–$2.27 resistance zone, with stop-loss orders recommended above $2.27 for a much lower risk.

In a 13-11 party-line decision, the committee approved Paul Atkins to be the next Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Jonathan Gould as Comptroller of the Currency. With this approval, their nominations now move to the full Senate for a final vote. If confirmed, they’ll officially take charge of these key financial regulatory agencies. Senator Tim Scott Praises Atkins and Gould Senator Tim Scott, who chairs the committee, spoke highly of both nominees, praising their experience in the financial industry. He emphasized that their leadership would help keep financial regulations focused on what’s best for the economy, without getting caught up in political agendas. “Paul Atkins, the former SEC commissioner, will promote capital formation and provide much-needed clarity for digital assets ,” Scott said. And of Gould, he noted that the nominee, once chief counsel at the OCC, will “put an end to the politically-motivated debanking” which is a major concern in the industry. Senator Warren Criticises the Nominations However, Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the committee, voted against the nominations, saying they’re too focused on deregulating for Wall Street’s benefit. She also pointed to recent government worker layoffs and efforts by Trump and billionaire Elon Musk to shut down agencies. “I won’t support these nominees while Trump and Musk are actively trying to destroy these agencies,” she said. She also noted that Paul Atkins messed up before the 2008 crisis while at the SEC and that Jonathan Gould weakened banking rules at the OCC, making the financial system less safe. Besides, the committee also approved Luke Pettit, a former Senate staffer, as assistant secretary of the U.S. Treasury, and Marcus Molinaro as the new federal transit administrator. Furthering its efforts, the SEC is hosting a series of roundtable talks from April to June to clarify crypto rules. The SEC’s crypto roundtable series features some exciting discussions. What’s Next? Coming up next, on April 11, the session titled “Between a Block and a Hard Place: Tailoring Regulation for Crypto Trading” will take place. This will be followed by sessions on crypto custody on April 25, tokenization on May 12, and decentralized finance (DeFi) on June 6.

BTC price today is down by just 1% to $82,698 after facing strong volatility earlier this week. Investors will be looking forward to next month’s FOMC meeting and whether Fed Chair Jerome Powell blinks for rate cuts amid the Trump-led market turmoil. Where is Bitcoin Price Heading Next After Trump Tariffs? Bitcoin price has been seeing severe volatility over the past week, oscillating between $82,000-$89,000. Just as the Trump reciprocal tariffs kicked in on April 2, BTC price came crashing down from $88,000 to the lows of $82,000. However, despite Nasdaq falling 6%, and S&P 500 falling 5% on Thursday, BTC and the broader crypto market have shown greater resilience recently. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted a key technical milestone for BTC’s potential market rebound. According to Martinez, the first clear signal that Bitcoin is ready to resume its bull run would be reclaiming the short-term holder realized price level, which currently sits at $90,570. Source: Ali Martinez Will Fed Rate Cuts Come During May FOMC? Traders are assigning just a 27.1% probability to a 25 basis point rate cut at the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting scheduled for May 7, according to the latest market data. The low odds suggest that investors believe the U.S. Federal Reserve is unlikely to shift from its current monetary policy path. Fed Chair Jerome Powell continues to strike a cautious tone, signaling that more evidence of cooling inflation may be needed before easing begins. Popular crypto analyst Titan of Crypto shows that Bitcoin price needs to break out from the falling wedge pattern. The analyst shared optimism noting: “Over the next couple of months, CPI and Core PCE are likely to improve, as Trueflation data shows inflation cooling off significantly”. Source: Titan of Crypto Will Altcoins Recover Anytime Soon? Since the beginning of 2025, altcoins have faced a brutal correction with Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and others dropping between 30-40%. Some market analysts believe that this could be the end to any further correction from here onwards. They also thinks that the bottom is in and altcoins are set for a further rally from here onwards. Crypto analyst Wimar.X has issued a bullish signal for the altcoin market, noting that a key technical crossover has now formed — historically preceding massive rallies. According to Wimar.X, similar signals in past cycles triggered altcoin market surges of 1,000% to 2,000%.

The firm added that it anticipates the contract going live on April 21. According to the certification filing , the XRP ( XRP ) futures contract will be a monthly cash-settled and margined contract trading under the symbol XRL. The contract tracks XRP’s price and is settled in US dollars. Each contract represents 10,000 XRP, currently worth about $20,000 at $2 per token. Contracts can be traded for the current month and two months ahead, and trading will be paused as a safety measure if spot XRP prices move more than 10% in an hour. “The exchange has spoken with FCMs (Futures Commission Merchants) and market participants who support the decision to launch a XRP contract,” the firm stated. Coinbase is not the first to launch XRP futures in the United States. In March, Chicago-based crypto exchange Bitnomial announced the launch of the “first-ever CFTC-regulated XRP futures in the US.” XRP futures trading is available on many of the world's leading centralized crypto exchanges, such as Binance, OKX, Bybit and BitMEX. Funding rates remain negative In late March, Cointelegraph reported that XRP derivatives’ funding rates had flipped negative as investor sentiment turned bearish. Related: XRP funding rate flips negative — Will smart traders flip long or short? Funding rates are periodic payments between traders in perpetual futures markets that help keep the futures price aligned with the spot price. Positive funding rates mean that long traders (buyers) pay short traders, while negative funding rates mean short traders (sellers) pay long traders. When funding rates go negative, it means short traders are willing to pay a premium to maintain their positions, indicating strong conviction from bearish derivatives traders.

EU regulators allege that X has violated the Digital Services Act and will use a section of the act to calculate a fine based on revenue that includes other companies Musk controls, according to an April 3 report by the newspaper, which cited four people with knowledge of the plan. Under the Digital Services Act, which came into law in October 2022 to police social media companies and “prevent illegal and harmful activities online,” companies can be fined up to 6% of global revenue for violations. A spokesman for the European Commission, the bloc’s executive branch, declined to comment on this case to The New York Times but did say it would “continue to enforce our laws fairly and without discrimination toward all companies operating in the EU.” In a statement, X’s Global Government Affairs team said that if the reports about the EU's plans are accurate, it “represents an unprecedented act of political censorship and an attack on free speech.” “X has gone above and beyond to comply with the EU’s Digital Services Act, and we will use every option at our disposal to defend our business, keep our users safe, and protect freedom of speech in Europe,” X's global government affairs team said. Source: Global Government Affairs Along with the fine, the EU regulators could reportedly demand product changes at X, with the full scope of any penalties to be announced in the coming months. Still, a settlement could be reached if the social media platform agrees to changes that satisfy regulators, according to the Times. One of the officials who spoke to the Times also said that X is facing a second investigation alleging the platform’s approach to policing user-generated content has made it a hub of illegal hate speech and disinformation, which could result in more penalties. X EU investigation ongoing since 2023 The EU investigation began in 2023. A preliminary ruling in July 2024 found X had violated the Digital Services Act by refusing to provide data to outside researchers, provide adequate transparency about advertisers, or verify the authenticity of users who have a verified account.

Analytics Company Reveals Estimated Record Date,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-bitcoin-hit-a-new-record-this-year-despite-recent-declines-analytics-company-reveals-estimated-record-date/,"Cryptocurrency analytics firm Alphractal has assessed the market situation following Bitcoin’s recent decline. According to the firm’s analysis, Supply Age Bands data, which categorizes Bitcoin supply by age, shows a sharp decline in the Short-Term Trader (STH) supply of up to 3 months. This indicates that buying interest in Bitcoin is decreasing. Historically, high levels of this indicator are observed during periods of market enthusiasm and public interest, while low levels coincide with price corrections. Alphractal notes that by analyzing the supply of up to 6 months, it is possible to better understand the impact of Short-Term Investors on Bitcoin. If this supply increases, the price tends to rise, while when it decreases, declines are usually observed. Related News: Cardano (ADA) Announces New Initiative Amid Decline However, despite the decline in STH supply, it is possible for Bitcoin to reach new highs. In 2021, although the STH supply began to decrease in April, Bitcoin reached new ATH levels in October and November. Similarly, in 2013, this supply recovered within a few months, leading to new highs in the short term. In line with these analyses, Alphractal states that despite the current conditions, new ATH levels for Bitcoin are possible in 2025. However, it is estimated that it will take at least another 6 months for this to happen. *This is not investment advice.

The total value locked in DeFi fell 27% to $156 billion, as per DappRadar’s Q1 2025 report . DeFi’s decline was caused by several high-profile security breaches, falling crypto prices, and macroeconomic uncertainty. The biggest blow was Bybit’s $1.4 billion exploit, which the FBI connected to the TraderTraitor group from North Korea. In this exploit, hackers stole about 401,000 Ethereum ( ETH ), converted it to Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other assets, and distributed it among wallets. DeFi’s position was further affected by a 45% decline in ETH over the quarter. Except for Berachain ( BERA ), which grew as a result of its mainnet launch, a token distribution event, and a $142 million funding round, most of the major blockchains saw a drop in DeFi activity. You might also like: AI tokens Bittensor, Render, Grass plunge after key Microsoft news While DeFi struggled, AI-powered dApps thrived, as shown by the 29% increase in daily unique active wallets to 2.6 million. Furthermore, the number of social dApps grew by 10% to 2.8 million dUAW. This shift was largely due to sites like Pump.fun, which made it simpler for users to launch new tokens. Pump.fun saw a 112% rise in activity. NFTs had a weaker quarter as well, with a 24% decline in trading volume to $1.5 billion. The fact that sales only fell 10%, however, points to lower prices rather than a mass exit. PFP collections accounted for the majority of sales, making up 56% of the total NFT volume. In terms of transactions, OpenSea continued to be the most popular marketplace, but OKX had the highest trading volume. Meanwhile, over $2 billion was lost to scams and hacks. Rug pulls like LIBRA and MELANIA resulted in losses of $450 million, but Bybit’s $1.5 billion exploit was by far the largest security breach event. A $50 million hack of the Infini stablecoin platform also exposed underlying security flaws in the industry.

Videos on social media show a new “Dill Bit” server farm location in the game — made to look like a cryptocurrency mining operation. There are other locations on the map where it has appeared. Players in the game can collect Dill Bits by destroying the equipment. It’s a unique resource that is typically hard to obtain. Solana-based memecoin Dill Bits, inspired by the Fortnite in-game currency, spiked 200% to $0.0005 on April 4 as the crypto community also took notice of the latest addition. Fortnite introduced Dill Bits as an in-game currency in February as a jest toward crypto. However, these can only be used to buy in-game items. At the time, the announcement of the in-game currency prompted an anonymous crypto user to create their own version of the token on Solana. The recent spike is nowhere near previous surges, however. When the memecoin first launched in February, it surged 4,500% in price to reach a market cap of $4.8 million. Another huge spike for the memecoin occurred on March 9, after Fortnite released a video promoting its latest “Rugpull” storyline, which saw the token pump over 4,000% in just a few minutes again.

Bitcoin really becoming mainstream for a game like Fortnite to add this little easter egg,” commented one player on Reddit after becoming aware of the secret location on April 3. The gimmick is not likely new for Fortnite players, as other hidden server mines have been discovered in other parts of the map since the in-game currency was introduced.
