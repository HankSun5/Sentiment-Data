These different market movements have put the spotlight on the hottest crypto picks in February: Trump, DOGE, Shiba Inu, Pepe, Popcat, and Panshibi but one coin appears to be topping the charts. Let's dive in on the top altcoins in 2025 Official Trump Coin (TRUMP) Official Trump remains a market mover, mainly because of the massive value uptrend, as $TRUMP rose to nearly $5.5bn (£4.5bn) following its launch, according to CoinMarketCap.com . The coin launch featured his 'fight fight fight' gesture from the July assassination attempt, recording a 300% surge within hours after the launch, creating millionaires while at it. However, this rally didn't last long as the coin plunged more than 80% from its January peak, falling from over $15 billion in January to around $2.9 billion today. However, technical indicators indicate a potential Official Trump token rebound in the coming days, especially as seen in marginal increases in token price over the last few days. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin price has risen 6% in the past week, according to CoinMarketCap , as DOGE lovers nurse higher hopes for a long rally. DOGE’s rise is mainly buoyed by institutional interest and ETF speculations , as Bloomberg analysts have also hinted that Dogecoin ETF will likely receive approval and will be considered a commodity by the SEC. Analysts predict that this news presents a major boost for DOGE, which has recorded increases over the last few days despite the overall bearish sentiment in the crypto market today. Shiba Inu For the most part, Shiba Inu price prediction was primarily dependent on its rising acceptability and fanfare. Analysts predict SHIB to hit $0.005, but the reality is much different as falling investor interest continues to stall a positive momentum for Shiba Inu. Technical indicators sport minimal trading activity, confirming a spate of minimal interest from SHIB investors. According to CoinMarketCap , Shiba Inu plunged by 21.38% in the past month and 8.52% in the past week, suggesting a long price may be a possibility. However, 50% SHIB drop projection by chat gpt and the vanishing prospects of the altcoin price reaching $0.005, investors have had to migrate into top altcoins like Panshibi, which is generating waves in the crypto community, even now in the presale stage. PEPE PEPE was a top-performing meme coin of the current market cycle, increasing nearly 30,000% post-launch and reaching an all-time high price of $0.0000283 in December 2024. However, the PEPE rally lost steam and had fallen 70% since its all-time high. However, PEPE is enjoying a bull run, which may be attributed to the growing interest and investment in the token from Michigan. Popcat POPCAT launched in February 2024 and has increased since then, emerging among the top altcoins in the crypto market today. The coin saw a record 37,000% growth and reached its all-time high in November 2024. POPCAT has enjoyed the favours of the crypto market but momentum has shifted since it fell 80% from its all-time high. However, POPCAT has recorded marginal increases over the past few days and has been tipped as one of the top altcoins in February 2025. Why New Crypto, Panshibi, has been Tipped to Join the Top Altcoinsfor February 2025 A new crypto, Panshibi (SHIB) , is all the crypto market is talking about. The Asian meme coin sensation is a panda-inspired project combining social-FI and AI to create wealth for investors and traders. It towers around three communities, Asia, memecoin and panda lovers- and each community offers additional benefits to your journey to financial freedom. Panshibi’s staking system has been tipped as a major X factor as it offers APYs as high as 1,200% whilst offering its investors and HODLers a chance to gain long-term passive and stable income. Early presale buyers enjoy several perks, including instant access to the Bamboo Private VIP Club and exclusive access to new features and networking opportunities with top investors and whales. The Panshibi has locked its liquidity pool for 10 years and team tokens for two years as part of its efforts to deepen trust and security and strengthen the SHIB token for higher positions in the market. What's more, the leading blockchain cybersecurity firm, Coinsult, confirms that the Panshibi smart contact is safe and secure. Panshibi Presale Igniting 1000X Dreams SHIBI is currently selling at $0.004 and going strong. The price for the next stage is $0.005, and by then, presale buyers will have lower gains from the 1,200% capped in the first and second stages. It's time to jump in now, as presale holders get a 145,000% ROI on their tokens after the token has been listed on multiple DEX and Uniswap. Never too late to join the train and buy your SHIBI tokens.

These various market dynamics have brought attention to February's most promising crypto picks: Trump, DOGE, Shiba Inu, Pepe, Popcat, and Panshibi , with one coin standing out as a leader. Let's explore the leading altcoins heading into 2025. Official Trump Coin (TRUMP) The Official Trump coin has been a major market influencer, primarily due to its significant value surge. After launching, $TRUMP soared to nearly $5.5 billion (£4.5 billion), according to CoinMarketCap.com . Its launch showcased his 'fight fight fight' gesture from the July assassination attempt, resulting in a 300% increase within hours, creating millionaires in the process. Nonetheless, this rally was short-lived as the coin dropped over 80% from its January high, plummeting from more than $15 billion in January to roughly $2.9 billion today. However, technical signals suggest a possible rebound for the Official Trump token in the coming days, as evidenced by slight increases in its price recently. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin's price has climbed 6% over the past week, per CoinMarketCap , as DOGE enthusiasts hope for a prolonged rally. DOGE's rise is largely driven by institutional interest and ETF speculations ; Bloomberg analysts have also suggested that a Dogecoin ETF could soon receive approval and be classified as a commodity by the SEC. Experts believe this development is a significant boost for DOGE, which has seen price increases in recent days despite the prevailing bearish outlook in the crypto market. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu's price forecast has largely hinged on its growing acceptance and popularity. Analysts anticipated SHIB could reach $0.005; however, diminishing investor interest has hindered positive momentum for Shiba Inu. Technical indicators show minimal trading activity, reflecting a lack of interest from SHIB investors. According to CoinMarketCap , Shiba Inu has declined by 21.38% over the last month and 8.52% in the past week, hinting at a potential long-term price drop. However, the 50% SHIB drop prediction by chat gpt and the dwindling hopes of the altcoin price reaching $0.005 have led investors to gravitate towards top altcoins like Panshibi, making waves within the crypto community, even at the presale phase. PEPE PEPE was a standout meme coin in the current market cycle, soaring nearly 30,000% after its launch and achieving an all-time high of $0.0000283 in December 2024. However, the PEPE surge has lost momentum, falling 70% from its peak. Despite this, PEPE is experiencing a bullish run, likely due to increasing interest and investment from Michigan. Popcat POPCAT made its debut in February 2024 and has been on the rise since then, becoming one of the top altcoins in today's crypto market. The coin experienced a remarkable 37,000% increase and reached its all-time high in November 2024. Although POPCAT has been favored in the crypto market, its momentum has shifted, dropping 80% from its peak. Nevertheless, POPCAT has seen slight gains in recent days and is considered one of February 2025's top altcoins. Why New Crypto, Panshibi, is Poised to Join the Top Altcoinsfor February 2025 A new player in the crypto scene, Panshibi (SHIB) , is creating a buzz. This Asian meme coin, inspired by pandas, merges social-FI and AI to generate wealth for investors and traders. It revolves around three communities: Asia, memecoin enthusiasts, and panda lovers, each offering additional benefits on your path to financial independence. Panshibi’s staking system is considered a key advantage, offering APYs up to 1,200%, and providing investors and HODLers with opportunities for long-term passive and steady income. Early presale participants enjoy numerous benefits, including immediate access to the Bamboo Private VIP Club and exclusive entry to new features and networking opportunities with top investors and whales. Panshibi has secured its liquidity pool for 10 years and team tokens for two years to enhance trust and security, aiming to strengthen the SHIB token's market position. Furthermore, leading blockchain cybersecurity firm Coinsult has verified that the Panshibi smart contract is both safe and secure. Panshibi Presale Fueling 1000X Dreams Currently, SHIBI is priced at $0.004 and gaining momentum. The next stage will see the price rise to $0.005, at which point presale buyers will see reduced gains from the 1,200% cap in the first and second stages. Now is the time to get involved, as presale holders can achieve a 145,000% ROI on their tokens once they are listed on multiple DEX and Uniswap.

On-chain data shows an unusual increase in BTC deposits on exchanges, a move that could potentially trigger a breakout from the prolonged consolidation phase observed this week. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Stagnates Amid Mixed Market Signals Bitcoin (BTC) price has displayed an unusually flat performance this week as bullish and bearish market signals counteracted each other. On the bearish side, hotter-than-expected inflation figures in the U.S. CPI report published on Feb. 13 exerted downward pressure. This data caused investors to reallocate capital away from risk assets, anticipating a hawkish Fed stance on interest rates in the coming weeks. Conversely, the U.S. SEC acknowledged Grayscale ETF filings for XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE) spot ETFs. This triggered positive speculation that altcoin ETF approvals could drive capital inflows into the crypto sector, signaling a potential shift in regulatory sentiment. The acknowledgment helped sustain BTC prices, preventing bears from exerting dominance for an extended period this week. Bitcoin Price Action (BTCUSDT), Feb 15, 2025 According to the chart, BTC price only increased by a mild 0.18% this week, opening at $96,444 on Sunday, Feb. 9, and currently trading at $97,500 at press time on Saturday, Feb. 15. The data suggests BTC’s price action remained in a neutral phase, as bullish catalysts from SEC ETF acknowledgment counterbalanced the negative sentiment stemming from overheated U.S. CPI data. Investors Have Deposited 12,000 BTC Into Trading Platforms in the Last 10 Days While spot market sentiment remains neutral, BTC’s on-chain transaction patterns suggest a potential breakout move ahead. CryptoQuant ’s Exchange Reserve chart shows the total BTC deposits across crypto exchanges and trading platforms. Typically, an increase in exchange reserves signals potential sell-off risks, while declines indicate accumulation trends, as traders shift assets into cold storage for long-term holding. Bitcoin (BTC) Exchange Reserves | Source: CryptoQuant The referenced chart reveals Bitcoin Exchange Reserves jumped from 2.35 million BTC on Feb. 6 to 2.47 million BTC as of Feb. 15. This represents an increase of 12,000 BTC deposited into exchanges—valued at over $1.2 billion at current prices—diluting market supply within the past 10 days. The rise in exchange reserves amid BTC’s price consolidation suggests heightened selling pressure. While altcoins like XRP, SOL, and DOGE experienced notable gains, more traders could be positioning to exit BTC in the coming days. This development presents a bearish outlook, as increasing market supply, coupled with stagnating prices, historically precedes downside movements. Bitcoin Price Forecast: $90,000 Breakdown Risk Signals Emerge Bitcoin price forecast charts shows BTC trading at $97,501, hovering just above the VWAP level of $97,565, with key support at the 100-day SMA near $97,093. The BTC price action remains confined within a rising wedge pattern, historically a bearish formation that suggests momentum exhaustion. Volume has been decreasing, indicating waning buying pressure, while the ADR at 1.40 signals compressed volatility, often a precursor to an imminent breakout. Bitcoin Price Forecast (BTCUSDT) If Bitcoin maintains its position above the 100-day SMA and VWAP, bulls could attempt to reclaim the $98,784 resistance marked by the 50-day SMA, which would invalidate the immediate bearish bias. A successful move beyond this level could reignite upward momentum, opening the door for a retest of the psychological $100,000 mark. However, failure to sustain above current levels would expose Bitcoin to a significant breakdown. The downside scenario gains credibility if Bitcoin falls below the rising wedge’s lower trendline. A confirmed breakdown could trigger a cascading sell-off, aligning with the chart’s projected target around $50,000. This bearish target coincides with the 200-day SMA, adding technical confluence. Should selling pressure intensify, Bitcoin risks breaching $90,000, accelerating toward lower support levels.

This bullish move signals renewed strength in the market, with buyers stepping in to drive momentum higher. After weeks of sideways trading, XRP’s breakout could be the catalyst for further gains, but can the bulls sustain this rally? With technical indicators flashing positive signals, XRP now faces the challenge of turning this breakout into a lasting uptrend. If buying pressure remains strong, the crypto might be eyeing higher resistance zones, setting the stage for an extended rally. However, if the price struggles to hold above $2.7, a pullback would likely come into play. Market Sentiment Shifts As XRP Gains Momentum XRP’s breakout above $2.7 and the 100-day SMA have injected fresh optimism into the market, shifting sentiment in favor of the bulls. After a period of consolidation, traders are now seeing renewed confidence as buying pressure pushes the price higher. Investor enthusiasm is growing, with many anticipating further upside if key resistance levels continue to fall. Related Reading: Analyst Shares Upper And Lower Targets For XRP Price The breakout has sparked renewed buying interest, evident in the rising trading volume and improving technical indicators, which suggest a potential continuation of the upward trend. As more market participants recognize the breakout as a bullish signal, demand for XRP is increasing, reinforcing positive sentiment in the market. One of the key indicators confirming this upward push is the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which is currently trending higher above the zero line. This positioning signals that bullish momentum is strengthening, with the MACD line diverging more from the signal line, a classic indication that buying pressure is increasing. However, despite the growing optimism, market volatility remains a factor. If the altcoin fails to maintain its position above $2.7, it could trigger profit-taking, leading to a short-term retracement. That said, as long as market sentiment remains positive and XRP holds above key support levels, the bulls might maintain control and push the price higher in the coming sessions. Key Levels To Watch After The Breakout With XRP surging past $2.7 and the 100-day SMA, all eyes are now on the next critical price levels that could determine the coin’s next move. Holding above this breakout zone is crucial for bulls to maintain control and push the price toward higher targets. Related Reading: XRP Price Explodes 25%: Will The Recovery Sustain or Fizzle Out? Immediate resistance to watch is the $2.9 level, which currently stands as a crucial hurdle for XRP’s price action. A decisive breakout above this range may confirm that bulls are firmly in control, setting the stage for more upside momentum such as the $3.4 range. A drop below the $2.7 level could signal that the recent breakout was not sustainable, potentially leading to a shift in market sentiment. If XRP fails to establish $2.7 as a strong support zone, it may indicate a false breakout, where bullish momentum fades and sellers regain control.

While Bitcoin’s dominance dips, analysts predict an incoming altcoin season, hailing it an “altseason.” Despite fluctuations, top altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Binance Coin (BNB) regain traction, marking significant gains. Altcoin Season Alert: Signs of a Market Shift As the crypto market gears up for a significant shift, analysts and experts hint at the potential arrival of an altseason, or an altcoin season. According to analyst Ted, the altcoin surge in 2024 was merely a warm-up for what’s to come. Adding to the point, he forecasts a record-breaking altseason in 2025 that is expected to make history. Notably, in an X post , Ted highlights key drivers of the altseason. They include potential developments including multiple altcoin ETF approvals, Ethereum’s upgrade, Ethereum ETF’s staking feature etc. Reinforcing Ted’s prediction, analyst CryptoGoos asserted that altcoins would explode, driven by a combination of factors. He explained his analysis through past patterns, in which altcoins saw major uptrends in 2017 and 2021, paving the way for a potential major altseason in 2025. In another X thread, CryptoGoos wrote, “Altcoins will pump.” Similarly, emphasizing the historical trend of major altcoin seasons occurring in the month of February, analyst Shib Spain forecasted a recurrence. The analyst suggested that the current market conditions are ripe for a repeat of past altcoin rallies that have typically taken place during this time of year. Corroborating this idea, Max Brown also stated, “Altseason starts in February.” Altcoin ETF Approvals Ahead Asset managers have taken the initiative to launch multiple altcoin ETFs, pending regulatory approval. The proposed ETFs are set to track a diverse range of altcoins, including XRP, Solana, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Cardano. As the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently acknowledged Grayscale’s 19b-4 filings to list XRP and Dogecoin ETFs, the odds are high for an altcoin ETF in 2025. According to Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, the Litecoin ETF has a 90% chance of receiving regulatory approval, making it the most likely to gain approval among the altcoin ETFs. Meanwhile, the Dogecoin, Solana, and XRP ETFs also have significant approval chances, with 75%, 70%, and 65% probabilities, respectively. Notably, the Trump administration has a more favorable stance towards crypto ETF approvals, with a higher probability of approval compared to the previous government. This positive sentiment has sparked expectations of an altcoin season in the near future. Upcoming Altcoin Season: What To Know More Recently, the Ethereum blockchain released a roadmap for its Pectra upgrade. The activation is planned to occur on February 24 on the Holesky testnet, followed by March 5 on Sepolia, with a mainnet release targeted for April 8. Meanwhile, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has proposed to introduce staking in spot Ethereum ETFs on behalf of Grayscale, seeking approval from the SEC. These developments have further fueled the hype surrounding an impending altcoin season, with Ethereum, as the leading altcoin, playing a pivotal role in driving these expectations. Top Altcoins Stay Strong Both historical trends and current market sentiment highlight the possibility of an upcoming altcoin season. Top altcoins show bullish signals ahead with the overall market gearing up for a significant resurgence. As of press time, Ethereum is priced at $2,690, up by 2.06% in a week. Meanwhile, XRP has exhibited a massive growth of 12% over the last seven days. Despite Solana’s marginal decline, BNB surged by more than 5% over the past week.

As the market continues to evolve, some tokens are showing ultra-bullish momentum, which could lead to impressive returns. Solana, BNB, and Remittix (RTX) are among the top contenders, each bringing unique features and strong growth potential. For seasoned investors and new investors, these top 3 cryptocurrencies are catching the attention of analysts and investors alike. Remittix Leads the Top 3 Cryptocurrencies to Buy Now Remittix (RTX) is quickly becoming a favorite among those looking for practical uses of cryptocurrency. It solves a major issue that many networks have not fully addressed: the easy conversion of crypto to regular money (FIAT) for everyday transactions. Remittix allows users to convert their digital assets into FIAT and deposit the funds directly into nearly any bank account worldwide, making it perfect for international money transfers. Because of its clear focus on real-world utility, Remittix is being called one of the top 3 cryptocurrencies to buy right now, especially if you're interested in the trillion-dollar global remittance market. In its presale phase, the project has already gained tens of thousands of supporters, showing strong belief in its ability to make cross-border payments easier and cheaper. Unlike Solana and BNB, which focus on high-speed smart contracts, Remittix is all about creating a simple, user-friendly platform that works for everyone—from beginners to experienced investors. By making it easy to convert crypto into regular money and link it to traditional banking systems, Remittix is opening up blockchain technology to people who might have been hesitant before. Experts believe that once Remittix fully launches, it could see significant growth, with some predicting 10x to 20x returns. If the demand for easier international payments grows quickly, Remittix could even outpace other platforms, becoming one of the most useful and widely adopted crypto solutions. Solana’s Recovery Potential Relies On $220 Resistance Break Solana's price is also exhibiting signs of recovery, trading at $194.95 following some consolidation. The price just went through a corrective wave that might herald a turn upward. Source: Coinmarketcap Solana has recently announced new ecosystem tools to help developers integrate DeFi and enhance NFT abilities. Experts think those developments could push Solana past $220 by the next cycle. Binance Coin (BNB) Price Surge: Is This the Beginning of a New BNB Season? Binance Coin (BNB) surged by 13% in 7 days to $666.72. This surge moved BNB above Solana (SOL) and to the fifth spot among the top 3 cryptocurrencies by market cap. The rally came with a huge increase in daily trading volume, which shot up 84% to $4.72 billion. This spike in volume helped BNB’s market cap soar to over $95 billion. Source: CoinMarketCap The recent BNB surge is closely tied to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which is working to become the go-to platform for meme coins. This is happening through the launch of the MyShell initial DEX offering (IDO) on BSC . In the last 24 hours, a massive $173 million has been bridged from Solana and Ethereum to BSC, signaling strong interest in the Binance ecosystem. As the price of BNB continues to rise, investors are now questioning whether this is the start of a full-fledged BNB season. Crypto analysts are divided, but many see potential for further growth, especially if the price holds above $750. If BNB manages to break past the $800 mark, it could signal a new long-position opportunity, particularly if it aligns with Bitcoin’s movements. Get in on Remittix, the Best Crypto to Buy Now Choosing the top 3 cryptocurrencies to buy really depends on what you’re looking for as an investor. For investors who are willing to take their investment to the next level, a new project like Remittix is the best option. The RTX presale is proof that it deserves a spot among the top 3 cryptocurrencies. The token has raised millions in its presale, and more investors are buying in. These top 3 cryptocurrencies have strong communities, solid tech behind them, and a plan for future growth. But experts back Remittix to be a great option for 100x profits in 2025.

Mert Mumtaz, the Helius Lab CEO is a hardcore member of that community with the battle scars to show for it. He proved his love for the chain again earlier today when he rose to Solana’s defense following the disaster of the Libra meme token which reportedly allowed $4.4B to be extracted from the ecosystem by grifters. Mert has words for those tagging Solana as a haven of scams Mert was not having the negativity triggered by the Libra token rugpull on Solana and took to X, formerly Twitter, to share his opinions. As far as Mert is concerned, many of those complaining about scams on Solana are maxis from a chain that has significantly less activity than Solana. In one post, he attributed all the noise to “cope” which he called “the most addictive drug.” you are not upset that there are scams on Solana you are upset that your chain has no activity ""New York City has more crime than my farm in Alabama"" is not a dunk — mert | helius.dev (@0xMert_) February 15, 2025 “Crypto’s history is almost all speculation — L1 coins, ICOs, NFTs, L2 coins, and now memecoins,” he wrote . “The function is the same, the form is different, it is raw brainworms to think “the validator client that is named Solana is encouraging scams.” Mert said all Solana does is make “assets fast and cheap to move,” and reminded everyone that “every ecosystem has shitcoins and has always had immense speculation.” Mert urged those who have a problem with Solana to channel their energy into building an alternative instead of resorting to “endless moral posturing to hate-farm some dopamine hits from pessimists.” He also mocked Ethereum maxis, many of whom have used the Libra rug to call out Solana as a rug chain, for often glazing their chain’s founder, Vitalik Buterin, who recently agreed that the L1 he created needs higher gas limits. Of course, Mert’s defense did not go without responses from trolls, which only seemed to piss him off more. At some point, he shared a post that saw him reveal he was asked why he was “enabling scams” even though, according to him, he never shills tokens despite numerous daily temptations and only focuses on “scaling the tech, shitposting, and helping startups/institutions adopt crypto.” Notably, Bitcoin and USDT on the Tron blockchain have faced the same accusations as Mert Mumtaz and Solana in the past, with detractors implicating the projects for the nature of users’ activities. What happened to the Libra token? The Libra meme was a token that Argentina’s president Javier Milei had initially promoted in a now-deleted post on X. It was linked to the Viva La Libertad Project, which claimed to have plans to support Argentina’s economy by funding small businesses. Now-deleted X post of Argentina’s president, Javier Milei, endorsing the Libra meme token launch on Solana. Source: @i_bot404 (X/Twitter) The president took down his tweets after allegedly learning more details and confessed that he had failed to conduct proper due diligence before endorsing the project. “I initially supported a supposed private enterprise with which I have no connection. After becoming aware of the details, I decided to discontinue spreading the word,” he said. The announcement caused panic among holders who had rushed in to buy Libra , pushing its market capitalization to $4.5 billion after Milei’s initial endorsement. As doubts about the project’s legitimacy spread, the token’s price tumbled from $4.50 to $0.50, and trading volume hit $1.1 billion in just a few hours before the sell-off intensified. On-chain analysis immediately turned up a red flag as blockchain data revealed that 82% of Libra’s total supply was spread among a few wallets. According to on-chain analytics firm Bubblemaps, the project’s developers sped up the demise of the token because they withdrew $87 million from liquidity pools. Chainalysis also pointed out that the address that created the Libra token and the one holding a major portion of its supply, seemed to be controlled by a single private key, rather than a multi-signature setup, the more secure option. The Libra token rug was only successful thanks to the participation of Milei, who endorsed it without doing enough research. However, this is not the first time Milei has gotten involved with a crypto scam. In 2021, he endorsed CoinX, which promised big returns through AI-powered trading but was revealed to be an alleged Ponzi scheme. Milei later faced litigation for losses between 30 and 40 million Pesos ($300,000) after regulators shut down CoinX.

He shared this perspective during an episode of the Gokhstein Media podcast , released on February 13, in a discussion about market trends and future outlooks. Market Resilience and Instituti;.onal Influence Hoskinson dismissed speculation that the ongoing bull market was nearing its end, arguing instead that market momentum remained strong. He pointed to the market’s rapid recovery from the downturn on February 3 as evidence of its resilience. On that day, widespread liquidations affected over 700,000 leveraged traders, erasing more than $2 billion in positions. The downturn was triggered by newly announced tariffs from former U.S. President Donald Trump . Hoskinson noted that while recovery from past major collapses, such as the FTX and LUNA crises, took nearly two years, this market correction reversed in just two days. According to Hoskinson, the swift rebound highlights a significant shift in the crypto market’s structure. He attributed this resilience to increased institutional involvement, describing the current cycle as the first to be primarily driven by institutional investors. This shift, he suggested, has led to a stronger focus on well-established cryptocurrencies, sometimes referred to as “dinosaur coins.” He argued that assets like ADA, ETH, and XRP, which have a long-standing presence in the market, are viewed as more stable and reliable compared to newer projects. Performance of ADA, ETH, and XRP Recent market trends support this view, with Cardano (ADA) and XRP achieving substantial triple-digit percentage gains in the fourth quarter of 2024. Additionally, these assets and Ethereum, have drawn considerable interest from firms seeking to launch exchange-traded funds (ETFs), further reinforcing their relevance in institutional portfolios. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bitcoin’s Future and Long-Term Market Outlook Despite his confidence in ADA, ETH, and XRP, Hoskinson maintained that Bitcoin would remain the dominant cryptocurrency. He predicted that as more nations adopt Bitcoin as part of their financial reserves, its value could rise significantly, potentially reaching at least $250,000. This view contrasts with an earlier prediction by well-known analyst EGRAG CRYPTO, who suggested that XRP could gain enough market traction to achieve a 20% dominance over Bitcoin. When discussing the timeline for the next market surge, Hoskinson estimated that the upward trend could resume within six to twelve months. He identified regulatory developments—particularly those concerning stablecoins—as a crucial factor in determining market direction. He hopes that once stablecoin regulations are implemented, U.S. policymakers will turn their attention to broader issues such as token classification and custody regulations, providing further clarity for the industry. However, in the immediate future, however, Hoskinson cautioned that market conditions would likely remain volatile. While the overall trajectory appears positive, investors should be prepared for fluctuations as the market grows.

XRP’s investors have enjoyed successes in recent times fueled by SEC’s approval of the top altcoin. Ripple investors are now buzzing about the next big opportunity to diversify their fat portfolios into. While XRP remains the gold standard for cross-border transactions, many in the market are looking for a fresh alternative that might replicate—or even surpass—its success. Recently, a new Defi project has caught the eye of many, as it is priced at less than $0.1 and is being hailed by some as the potential ""next XRP."" The excitement isn’t just about low prices; it’s about the promise of a token that could revolutionize the way money moves globally. XRP: The Veteran of Cross-Border Transactions The crypto revolution has placed XRP at its forefront for multiple years because of its position within RippleNet which enables rapid cross-border payment services. XRP maintains a trading price of $2.75 while showing a 17.5% increase during the last 7 days. The current Ripple price demonstrates sustained investor optimism together with stability through the regulatory obstacles which XRP encountered throughout its history. The legal battles faced by Ripple Labs since 2020 have created price volatility for XRP because of their role as XRP's developer. A favorable 2023 court decision brought positive changes after it determined the status of XRP during exchange transactions. The court decision has sparked fresh enthusiasm among XRP holders because XRP's existing partnerships drive continuous growth of its network. Ripple demonstrates its commitment to global financial system value through its partnership with Unicâmbio in Portugal for quick payments between Brazil and Portugal . The value of XRP fluctuates according to how legal cases and regulatory oversight turn out. Across XRP’s ecosystem, there's a range of XRP price predictions for the coming years. Some analysts, like @TallGuyTycoon, have suggested XRP could see levels at $2.78, followed by $3.87, and potentially a rapid rise to $8. The overall sentiment on X shows a mix of optimism for short-term gains and varied long-term expectations, with a consensus leaning towards significant growth if regulatory clarity and adoption increase. Remittix Is Ushering In The New Wave in Crypto Payments Enter Remittix , a promising new altcoin that is rapidly making a name for itself in the digital payments space.

Its unique Pay API model allows companies to handle payments efficiently, supporting over 50 crypto pairings and 30 fiat currencies. Both XRP and Remittix have their unique strengths.

Traditional copyright laws weren't designed for AI, leaving artists, developers, and legal experts struggling with questions of ownership and originality. This uncertainty has led to copyright disputes, concerns over AI learning from existing works, and fears that human artists could lose recognition and income. Without clear protections, both AI-generated and human-created digital art remain at risk. The good news is that blockchain technology offers solutions. Some blockchain platforms are stepping in to provide even more accessibility to verify ownership, transparency, and fair compensation—helping to protect digital art, no matter who (or what) creates it. What is AI-Generated Art? AI-generated art is artwork created with the help of artificial intelligence. Instead of a person drawing or painting by hand, AI tools use data and patterns to create images, music, or even designs. These tools can copy famous styles, make something new, or help artists bring their ideas to life. AI-created art has made creativity more accessible. Anyone can type a description, and AI will turn it into a detailed image in seconds. Some artists use AI to experiment with new ideas, while others let the technology generate entire pieces. The First Forms of Machine-Generated Art Machine-generated art has been developing for decades, something surprising for many people long before it became widely known. In the 1960s, artists and computer scientists experimented with early algorithms to create abstract patterns and geometric designs. These early works, often created using basic programming languages, laid the foundation for what would later become AI-driven creativity. As technology improved, AI art moved beyond simple patterns. Researchers developed neural networks in the 1990s and early 2000s capable of recognizing and replicating artistic styles. This led to AI programs that could transform photos into paintings, like how apps today can apply filters to mimic famous artists. However, one of the biggest shifts came with NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). Before NFTs, digital art—including AI-generated pieces—was difficult to sell or claim ownership over because anyone could copy and share it. NFTs changed this by using blockchain technology to verify ownership and uniqueness. AI artists could sell their work as digital assets, creating a new art market. Some of the first AI-based NFT projects demonstrated how AI and blockchain could work together, making digital art more valuable and collectible. With these advancements, AI-created art has become a recognized form of creative expression. Today, AI can generate paintings, sculptures, music, and animations, and artists and collectors are embracing the possibilities. The Challenges of AI-Created Art And as all good things come with challenges, AI-created art is no exception. While it has opened up new creative possibilities, it has also raised serious questions and concerns, especially around ownership, originality, and ethics. One of the biggest problems is copyright and ownership. Since AI can create artwork without direct human involvement, who owns the final piece is unclear. In most legal systems, AI cannot hold copyright, meaning ownership usually falls to the person who gave the AI instructions or the company that built the AI. However, when AI generates highly detailed images with minimal human input, this creates a gray area in copyright law, making it difficult to determine who deserves credit and compensation. Another issue is AI learning from existing art. AI models are trained on vast amounts of data, often including copyrighted artworks. This raises the question: is AI-generated content truly original, or is it just an altered version of existing works? Many artists argue that AI should not be trained on their creations without permission, while developers claim it falls under fair use or transformation. This debate continues to grow as more AI-generated pieces resemble real artists' styles. There are also concerns about the devaluation of human creativity. If AI can generate high-quality art in seconds, will human artists struggle to compete? Some fear that AI-generated content could flood the market, making it harder for traditional artists to earn recognition and income. Others see AI as just another tool, like photography or digital editing, that artists can use to enhance their creativity rather than replace it. These challenges highlight the need for clearer laws and ethical guidelines to protect artists and AI-generated creativity's future. But until then, it will help at least some tools that can help in this regard. How to Protect AI-Created Art? With the growing presence of AI-created art, protecting ownership and ensuring fair use has become a major concern. Since AI challenges traditional copyright laws, artists and developers need new ways to verify authorship, prove originality, and secure rights over their creations. Fortunately, several emerging solutions are helping address these issues. One promising approach is blockchain technology, which creates a transparent, unchangeable record of ownership. NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) were one of the first tools to bring this idea to digital art, allowing artists to assign unique ownership to their works. However, while NFTs helped establish authenticity, they didn't fully solve the issue of protecting AI-generated content, especially when proving originality or determining fair use. A more advanced solution is the 7007 protocol , which provides verifiable ownership and authenticity for AI-generated content (AIGC) on the blockchain. Unlike NFTs, this protocol protects AI-created art and human-generated works, ensuring that both digital and traditional artists can safeguard their intellectual property. The 7007 protocol offers a transparent and traceable system where creators—whether human or AI—can securely register and manage their works. This helps prevent unauthorized use while making it easier for artists to monetize their creations fairly and efficiently. Aside from blockchain-based solutions, another important approach is developing clearer copyright laws. However, since implementing such laws is a complex and lengthy process, platforms like the 7007 protocol have become essential go-to solutions for creators today. Conclusion We hope you now have a clearer understanding of AI-generated art and the challenges it brings. As technology evolves, new solutions like blockchain (including different blockchain platforms) and improved copyright laws are helping protect digital creativity. The future is still unfolding, but AI-created art can become more secure for everyone with the right tools, ownership, and fairness.

As 2025 advances, analysts are placing their bets on which altcoins will soar to new heights. Dogecoin and Avalanche remain strong contenders, but an unexpected player, WallitIQ (WLTQ), has captured the spotlight. With its AI-driven innovations and growing investor interest, WallitIQ (WLTQ) could deliver unprecedented returns, making its presale a tempting opportunity for those seeking exponential growth. But where will these three coins stand by the end of 2025? Let’s break it down. Dogecoin (DOGE): Meme Coin With Staying Power Dogecoin (DOGE) has earned a reputation as the original meme coin with an enthusiastic community and notable backers, including Elon Musk. Its widespread popularity has kept it in the top-tier rankings on CoinMarketCap. DOGE currently priced around $0.2641, continues to thrive despite market fluctuations. Analysts are optimistic, projecting a potential climb to $5 by the end of 2025, driven by growing adoption and market optimism. However, WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers a more compelling investment case. Unlike Dogecoin, which thrives primarily on community hype, this altcoin boasts real-world utility powered by AI functionalities. The platform’s predictive analytics, QR code payment system, and anomaly detection technology make it a practical tool for crypto investors seeking smarter financial management. With a presale price of just $0.0420 , the token is primed for an epic rise, potentially outpacing DOGE in terms of profitability. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The High-Potential AI Altcoin You Can’t Ignore WallitIQ (WLTQ) stands out as a game-changing AI-powered platform designed to transform crypto wallet management. With its SolidProof- audited smart contract and the newly launched MVP mobile app, the platform is already making waves in the market. The app offers flawless wallet management for ETH and USDT, real-time pricing integration through CoinGecko API, and essential transaction features. The soon-to-be-released Beta platform promises even more advanced capabilities. This Ethereum-based gem goes beyond basic wallet functionalities by integrating anomaly detection technology to safeguard transactions and AI-driven suggestions for DeFi interactions. Its physical-to-digital payment feature through QR codes simplifies everyday crypto payments, setting it apart from Dogecoin and Avalanche. Unlike DOGE, which lacks robust use cases, WallitIQ (WLTQ) combines innovative technology with a user-friendly interface to attract both novice and seasoned investors. Analysts predict that this AI-driven token could surge by as much as 50,000% by mid-2025, making its current presale price of $0.0420 a bargain that’s hard to ignore. Avalanche (AVAX): A Platform With Solid Fundamentals Avalanche has earned its place as one of the most technologically advanced blockchain networks. Known for its scalability, high throughput, and low fees, Avalanche has attracted numerous DeFi projects and dApp developers. Priced at approximately $26.42 according to Coingecko, AVAX remains a top contender in the crypto market. Analysts believe it has the potential to appreciate significantly by the end of 2025, driven by ongoing network upgrades and increased adoption. However, despite its technological prowess, Avalanche lacks the explosive growth potential seen in WallitIQ (WLTQ). As crypto whales shift their focus toward emerging gems, this platform has become a hot topic for its innovative AI functionalities and presale momentum. Investors are recognizing that WallitIQ (WLTQ) could deliver bigger gains than both Dogecoin and Avalanche combined, thanks to its strong fundamentals and cutting-edge features. The Verdict: WallitIQ (WLTQ) Leads The Pack If you’re looking to position yourself for massive gains in 2025, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is the clear winner. While Dogecoin m and Avalanche have their merits, WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) AI-driven platform, utility-focused features, and strategic presale pricing at $0.0420 make it a high-growth contender. With analysts projecting a staggering 50,000% increase post-launch, this hidden altcoin gem offers unmatched profit potential. Don’t miss out—join the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale now at $0.0420 and secure your position in one of the most promising crypto projects of 2025.

While many traders are drawn to meme coins for quick profits, the real game-changers are those with long-term potential. Finding meme coins that offer sustainability, innovation, and real returns can be challenging, but a few standout projects are rewriting the script. Arctic Pablo Coin , Dogwifhat, and SPX6900 lead the charge, offering unique narratives and impressive financial potential. One meme coin turning heads is Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC)—an adventure-driven token that takes investors through Earth’s hidden locations, uncovering mystical wealth. Unlike traditional meme coins, Arctic Pablo isn’t just about hype; it’s about bridging myth and reality, creating an immersive investment experience. Meanwhile, Dogwifhat ($WIF) is proving to be a Solana-backed powerhouse, riding the waves of massive adoption and exchange listings, while SPX6900 is pushing financial satire to the extreme, skyrocketing in value as it mocks traditional markets. Let’s dive into these three top meme coins to join for the long term and why they could be life-changing investments for those who get in early. Arctic Pablo: The Legendary Meme Coin That’s Reshaping Crypto Adventures Deep within the icy landscapes of the unknown, Arctic Pablo embarks on an extraordinary quest. This isn’t just a meme coin—it’s a journey. As Pablo traverses enchanted frostbitten realms, each presale phase unlocks new hidden locations, fueling excitement and scarcity. Investors don’t just buy a coin; they become part of the legend. Arctic Pablo Coin operates with a narrative-driven presale, where each phase is tied to a unique location instead of traditional token sale stages. This keeps engagement high and builds an immersive investment experience. The coin follows a deflationary model, with unsold tokens burned weekly, increasing scarcity and long-term value. High-APY staking allows holders to earn 66% APY while securing passive income and participating in the ecosystem’s growth. Built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Arctic Pablo accepts various cryptocurrencies, including BNB, ETH, USDT, BTC, SOLANA, and XRP. With an engaging story, strong tokenomics, and unmatched ROI potential, Arctic Pablo isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a movement. Investors can ride this once-in-a-lifetime journey and claim their share of legendary riches. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) has already raised over $1.24 million, with the current location, Aqua Frost, offering tokens at just $0.000059. With a projected launch price of $0.008, early investors stand to gain an eye-watering 13,451% ROI. Imagine turning $500 into $67,796.60—this isn’t just a fantasy; it’s the reality of Arctic Pablo’s explosive potential. Dogwifhat: The Meme Coin With Unstoppable Momentum If one meme coin has been making waves, it’s Dogwifhat (WIF). What started as a joke has transformed into a Solana-powered juggernaut, delivering mind-blowing returns to investors. In just one week, Dogwifhat surged 360%, smashing all-time highs and reaching a $1.7 billion market cap. Several key factors drive Dogwifhat’s success. The coin has been listed on major exchanges like Robinhood Europe, significantly increasing its reach and credibility. Speculation is growing over a potential Coinbase or Binance listing, further fueling investor excitement. The Solana blockchain provides low fees and lightning-fast transactions, making WIF highly efficient for trading. The project thrives on a dedicated, viral community reminiscent of early Dogecoin and Shiba Inu hype. While the ride has been exhilarating, meme coin volatility is real. However, Dogwifhat’s growing adoption and market traction suggest it’s not fading anytime soon. Those looking to join a meme coin with serious momentum should watch WIF as it sets new records. SPX6900: The Meme Coin That’s Mocking TradFi While Printing Profits For those who love wild returns and financial satire, SPX6900 (SPX) is a meme coin that delivers both. Exploding 60x in just one month, SPX has become the ultimate anti-establishment investment, mocking Wall Street while generating life-changing gains. SPX6900 taps into a unique market by blending financial satire with meme culture, attracting investors who love the chaos of meme coins but want something with a sharp, rebellious edge. The market cap recently surged to $480 million, proving this is more than just a fleeting meme. Viral marketing campaigns have cemented SPX as a cult-favorite among crypto traders, with many investors eager to ride its wave of success. Recent exchange listings have made it more accessible, increasing demand and market liquidity. As with any high-flying meme coin, risk is part of the game. Investors should stay updated and be strategic, as fast-rising tokens can correct sharply. But for those who love wild rides and huge upside potential, SPX6900 is a meme coin worth watching. Conclusion: The Meme Coin Gold Rush is Here Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo, Dogwifhat, and SPX6900 stand out as the top meme coins to join for the long term. Whether it’s the mythical adventure of Arctic Pablo, the viral surge of Dogwifhat, or the rebellious rise of SPX6900, these tokens offer unique opportunities for early investors to ride the next big wave.

BTFD Coin’s Presale at $0.00016 and High-Yield Staking Could Be the Next Big Move,https://thecoinrise.com/still-kicking-yourself-over-floki-inu-btfd-coins-presale-at-0-00016-and-high-yield-staking-could-be-the-next-big-move/,"The meme coin market has turned small bets into life-changing money, and nowhere was that more obvious than with Floki Inu’s explosive rally. What started as a simple meme coin named after Elon Musk’s dog quickly became a billion-dollar powerhouse. Early investors saw unreal returns, and many latecomers were left wondering—what if? But here’s the thing about meme coins: the biggest profits always come from getting in early. Now, a new challenger has arrived—BTFD Coin (BTFD)—and this time, you don’t have to sit on the sidelines. With a fully live Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, 90% APY staking rewards, and a Bulls Squad community that’s growing fast, BTFD is positioning itself as the next major meme coin breakout. With Stage 14 of the presale live at just $0.00016, this is one of the top new meme coins to join this weekend before it takes off. BTFD Coin’s P2E Game Is Changing the Meme Coin Game Most meme coins rely purely on hype and community strength, but BTFD Coin is bringing actual utility to the table. The P2E game, which launched on January 1, 2025, is already attracting players who are earning real crypto rewards while having fun. Think about it—instead of just holding a meme coin and hoping it pumps, BTFD lets you actively earn more tokens through gameplay. Players can battle, level up, and stack their $BTFD holdings just by playing the game. This isn’t just speculation—it’s an ecosystem designed for long-term engagement and demand. But that’s not all. BTFD also offers 90% APY staking, allowing holders to earn massive passive rewards while they wait for the token’s price to skyrocket. Let’s break this down with an example: If you invest $6,000 at the current price of $0.00016, you’ll own 37.5 million BTFD tokens. Now, let’s say you stake those tokens for one year at 90% APY—your holdings would grow to 71.25 million tokens. If BTFD reaches its projected $0.006 post-launch price, that would be worth $427,500. That’s not a dream—it’s a real possibility for early adopters who jump in before the presale ends. This is exactly why BTFD Coin is one of the top new meme coins to join this weekend before the next surge happens. Getting in early is simple: Download MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT, connect to the BTFD presale page , select the amount you want to invest, and confirm your purchase. Your tokens will be ready to claim before launch. Floki Inu’s Wild Ride—The One That Got Away? Floki Inu started as just another meme token inspired by Elon Musk, but what happened next was pure magic. The Floki community exploded, marketing campaigns went viral, and the token surged into the billions in market cap. Some investors made life-changing money, watching their $100 investments turn into $100,000 or more. The hype was real, the gains were insane, and many investors who hesitated early on were left regretting their decision. But as with all viral meme coins, the biggest wins went to those who got in early. Now, Floki Inu is still a solid project, but the days of 1000x returns are long gone. The real question now is—where’s the next opportunity? That’s why BTFD Coin is one of the top new meme coins to join this weekend—because it’s still in the early stages of its presale, meaning the biggest profits are yet to come. The Next Big Meme Coin Play Is Here—Are You Ready? If you watched Floki Inu moon without you, you’re probably not looking to make the same mistake twice. The truth is, meme coins with strong communities, real utility, and massive hype tend to explode—and right now, BTFD Coin is checking all those boxes. With a fully live P2E game, 90% APY staking, and a growing Bulls Squad community, the pieces are already in place. The only thing left is to secure your presale position before the price jumps higher. With $6.08 million raised, 69 billion tokens sold, and 10,700+ holders, the demand is already building fast. This isn’t a moment to sit back—this is your shot. The presale price of $0.00016 won’t last, and once BTFD hits the open market, the next wave of investors will have to pay much more to get in. So, don’t miss out and join BTFD Coin presale today . FAQs When will BTFD Coin officially launch? BTFD Coin is currently in Stage 14 of its presale, with a listing price of $0.0006. Investors can claim their tokens before the official listing and start earning rewards immediately. How much can I potentially make if BTFD Coin reaches its projected price? If you invest $6,000 at $0.00016, you will receive 37.5 million BTFD tokens. If the price reaches $0.006 post-launch, your holdings would be worth $427,500. Why is BTFD Coin considered one of the top new meme coins to join this weekend? BTFD Coin is still in its early presale stages, meaning investors can enter at a low price before the hype kicks in. With its live P2E game, 90% APY staking, and strong community, it has real utility and explosive growth potential.

Let’s start from the beginning. At exactly 10:01 PM UTC, Javier made a post on X announcing that $LIBRA was launching to “boost Argentina’s economy.” Source: The Kobeissi Letter Of course people weren’t sure if he was serious. Some thought his X account got hacked. Others assumed it was another political stunt. But then, many Argentine politicians confirmed it was real, so as per usual, retail traders dove in headfirst. Within minutes, $LIBRA hit a $4.6 billion market cap. The whole thing was ridiculous, as meme coins tend to be. There was no whitepaper, no tokenomics, no investor protections, just a basic, terrible-looking website that linked to a Google Form. The pitch on the website’s landing page was, and I quote, “Funding small projects to boost Argentina’s economy.” But the reality turned out to be a blatant liquidity trap. On-chain data showed the domain was registered hours before launch. No public owner. One-year registration. Multiple restricted domain statuses. Everything about this screamed cash grab. By the time people started asking questions, it was already too late. Insiders had drained $87.4 million within three hours, according to data from Bubblemaps. 82% of the supply sat in a single cluster. And then, the real dumping began. Insiders cashed out as retail traders took the hit At 10:40 PM UTC, $LIBRA hit its all-time high, and immediately, multiple large holders liquidated millions in minutes, with some pulling in $4 million+ each before the market even caught on. By press time, $LIBRA has fallen below $600,000 in market cap, meaning $4.59 billion is now gone. Yeesh! The selling was so aggressive that only 27% of transactions were actual sales. That means for every insider dumping millions, there were two retail traders panic-buying the dip. More than $1.1 billion in volume was traded, but by then, the only ones making money were the ones who got in before the public knew what hit them. Javier deleted his announcement tweet and tried to distance himself. Speaking in Spanish via a post on X, he said : “A few hours ago I posted a tweet, as I have so many other times, supporting a supposed private enterprise with which I obviously have no connection whatsoever. I was not aware of the details of the project and after having become aware of it I decided not to continue spreading the word (that is why I deleted the tweet). To the filthy rats of the political caste who want to take advantage of this situation to do harm, I want to say that every day they confirm how vile politicians are, and they increase our conviction to kick them in the ass.” The fallout didn’t stop with $LIBRA. Trump’s infamous meme coin, $TRUMP, lost $500 million in market cap overnight. The entire meme coin market bled out over $6 billion in the aftermath. More than 50,000 wallets held $LIBRA before the collapse, and most of them are worthless as of press time. On-chain analysts started digging into the wallets behind the biggest dumps. That’s when things got even darker. A notorious trader known as LeBron made $4.56 million in a single day from $LIBRA alone, according to data from Lookonchain. His wallet history goes like this: $8.9 million from $MELANIA, $3.2 million from $TRUMP, and $1 million from $HARRYBOLZ. His $LIBRA play was textbook. He bought 128.8 million tokens for $4,807.19 at an average price of $0.037 per token. Once the price surged, he offloaded in chunks, pocketing a multimillion-dollar return hours before the crash wiped everyone else out. Crypto Twitter calls out the scam—and the people behind it Traders weren’t quiet. Crypto Twitter exploded with accusations. One guy said, “This is how the CIA funds itself now. Meme coins are their bread and butter. Stay away from anything unverified and able to be rugged. PERIOD.” “Can we stop calling these rug pulls? Because by calling it that we are suggesting that it was unexpected,” another user said. One trader who was particularly furious posted that: “How the f*ck you ret*rds trust a nigga that look like Willy Wonka on a 5-day fenty bender? Y’all deserve to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. I don’t think it’s a good idea that presidents of countries launch meme coins.” Meanwhile, Solana investor Darky said , “Unpopular take but I think $LIBRA was what we needed to finish this meme coin shit meta. Every meme trader has been liquidated. Let the smart money move into alts and AI coins finally.” That wasn’t all. Moonshot listed $LIBRA before the launch and delisted it right after insiders dumped $100 million. Kelsier Venture, the company allegedly tied to $LIBRA’s creation, was linked to Arunkumar Sugadevan, a notorious Indian serial rug puller. His on-chain footprint connected him to $MELANIA, $ENRON, and OG.Fun—all of which had similar pump-and-dump histories, according to this one investor who said he and his friend lost over $2 million in $LIBRA. TRON founder Justin Sun also spoke out. Commenting under Javier’s post, Justin said: “I have great respect for President Milei. I believe that he should take some responsibility in this matter, urging the culprits to return the funds to the victims and assume the corresponding legal responsibilities. Protecting investors is a very serious legal duty, and we must take it seriously.” Javier built his entire political career on fighting corruption and government abuse. Now, his name is directly tied to the biggest meme coin rug pull in history. One trader called it out: “Javier made his whole campaign about stopping corruption and people abusing the government to drain resources. Then, once in power, he uses his political position to launch a token for his own personal benefit, to likely make 9 figs.” Others compared his “I had no idea” defense to previous celebrity rug pulls, especially after rap star Kanye West exposed an influencer a week ago. One user said: “Kanye posted an offer he refused. He promotes a rug pull. Then says his account was hacked after the rug. We saw the exact same play by Dean Norris. The same thing is done here ‘oops wasn’t me.’ Assange did it too. Rugged $55m from the DAO and blanked the community after.” The real question? Who was actually behind $LIBRA? And will anyone ever be held accountable?

40381174,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=675534,1739659675,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40381174.jpeg,Strategy defies market trends as STRK and Bitcoin holdings surge,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/strategy-strk-and-bitcoin-holdings-surge/,"Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) preferred stock, STRK, had a record-breaking performance in its first two weeks. According to the company, STRK is now the best-performing out of 115 preferred stocks listed in the US since 2022. Per information shared on X, STRK is first in price performance with 19% more gains than the average preferred stock. It has also attracted more interest from investors, with a trading volume that is 7x the average. The company founder, Michael Saylor , also noted the stock’s strong performance, saying: “In the initial two weeks of trading, $STRK is the best performing and most liquid perpetual preferred security.” The performance highlights how well investors have taken to STRK despite earlier speculations from some analysts that it could fail to meet expectations. Barron’s analyst Andrew Bary had said in January that Strategy might have to cut the price of the stock offering by 8%. With STRK now doing better than expected, Coindesk senior analyst James Van Straten said he had contacted Barry about possibly updating his article. Another market expert noted that Barron’s take is not surprising because Wall Street underwriters usually want issuers to underprice deals so that they can appear as a big success in hindsight. STRK is Strategy’s Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock, a convertible preferred stock through which Strategy seeks to raise $250 million that will be spent on buying Bitcoin. The stock has a liquidation preference of $100 and can be converted into Class A common stock under certain conditions. Strategy continues positive performance despite BTC decline The performance of STRK highlights how Strategy has been performing positively this year despite Bitcoin itself struggling. The business intelligence turned Bitcoin company has seen a strong performance, with its stock up 16.61% year to date. By comparison, Bitcoin is only up 3.42% YTD, with the flagship asset stuck below $100,000 for almost two weeks. BTC’s struggles are due to several reasons, including macroeconomic factors such as inflation and tariffs, but Strategy, which positions itself as a Bitcoin company, has not seen much negative impact. Despite Strategy’s last two Bitcoin acquisitions costing more than BTC’s current price, investors seem to have a strong positive sentiment about Strategy’s position, which also spreads to STRK. There are no clear reasons for this, but the company has made several moves since the start of this year that show its focus on Bitcoin acquisition without diluting shareholder value. It is also expected to start applying the FASB accounting rules by 2025 Q1, which could boost its financials. Interestingly, the positive sentiments are not limited to Strategy but include other Bitcoin institutional investment products. Spot Bitcoin Exchange-traded funds (ETF) continue to see massive interest from institutional investors despite BTC’s current price struggles, showing how this group of investors perceive them. For instance, Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Company is BlackRock IBIT’s seventh largest known holder, with $461.23 million. Tudor Investment , the firm of legendary investor Paul Tudor James, also owns $426.9 million worth of IBIT shares. IBIT’s performance has stood out, particularly from other Bitcoin ETFs. Since Donald Trump became president, IBIT has only had two outflows, all worth a combined $50 million.

The DeFi token rallied past the $10 mark in the final hours of Friday, February 14, reflecting the improving climate of the general crypto market. Uniswap Price Jumps 10% In The Past Week The UNI token was one of the beneficiaries of the bullish momentum that shook the market on Friday evening. As of this writing, the price of Uniswap stands at around $10.18, reflecting an over 3% increase in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin At Risk? Analyst Says Breaking This Price Level Could Spark Significant Volatility This single-day action pushed the Uniswap price performance in the last week to double digits; a nearly 11% climb according to data from CoinGecko. While things seem to be looking up for the altcoin, its performance on broader timeframes is still something to worry about. Due primarily to the recent drop beneath the $8 level, the price of UNI is down by almost 15% in the last two weeks and 30% in the past month. However, the Uniswap price appears to be gearing for a bullish breakout over the next few days. Here’s How UNI Price Could Reach $13 In a February 14 post on the X platform, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez put forward an exciting bullish outlook for the price of UNISWAP over the coming days. According to the crypto pundit, the DeFi coin could travel as high as $13 following the potential bullish breakout. The rationale behind this optimistic prediction is the formation of the Adam & Eve pattern on UNI’s hourly price chart. The Adam & Eve pattern is a technical analysis formation characterized by two distinct troughs (price swing lows). The first depression, Adam, is a sharp V-shaped dip, while the second trough, Eve, is marked by a more rounded, U-shaped bottom. This price formation is often a reversal indicator, suggesting a potential shift in market sentiment from bearish to bullish. However, it is most crucial after identifying an Adam and Eve pattern to wait for the confirmation of a bullish breakout. The bullish setup is validated once the asset’s price breaches and successfully closes above its highest high. In UNI’s current situation — as shown in the highlighted chart, the significant level to confirm the bullish breakout is around the $10.1 mark. According to Martinez, a successful close above this level could set the stage for a Uniswap price rally to $13 — about 30% from the current price point.

The crypto investment firm says the fund will be approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) next. Why Pantera Capital is Optimistic About Solana ETF Cosmo Jiang, General Partner, and Eric Wallach, Investment Analyst of Pantera Capital, noted this conclusion in their February 2025 Blockchain Letter issue. They cited an increase in developer and economic activity, rapid ecosystem growth, and the outstanding performance of SOL’s price fueling this optimism. For more perspective, these key industry players highlighted Solana’s emergence in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector. The blockchain suddenly became a dominant smart contracts platform when it became the leader in attracting new developers. In no time, Solana processed the largest volume of DEX trading and even outperformed Ethereum (ETH) in generated fees. Solana-based Products Trigger Positive Momentum in the Ecosystem Amongst other Decentralized Exchanges (DEXes), Solana’s flagship product, Raydium (RAY), also exceeded Uniswap (UNI) by a 30% increase in trading volume for two consecutive months. Considering Uniswap’s reputation as a dominant EVM DEX, this marked a significant win for Solana. Then there is Pump.fun, the reigning Solana memecoin launchpad, which keeps raising the bar. Pump.Fun broke records when it earned $100 million in revenue within 217 days. On January 24, it set a new milestone by amassing $15.38 million in daily fees, driven by Vine Coin. These records and the growing memecoin mania on the launchpad have contributed to Solana’s leadership in creating new tokens. Out of the new tokens launched in Q4 2024, the Solana blockchain welcomed more than 90%. Top Asset Managers Awaits SOL ETF Approval Some asset managers have pushed out their applications on the subject of Solana ETFs. In no particular order, Bitwise, VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital have filed their spot Solana ETF S-1 registration with the US SEC. More proactively, Cboe BZX Exchange has filed four 19b-4 proposals on their behalf. Before 2024 ended, Grayscale also submitted its application to convert its existing Grayscale Solana Trust into a spot Solana ETF.

This downturn has investors pondering if ADA can bounce back or if it’s poised for further declines. Amidst ADA’s downturn, the crypto landscape observes a contrasting trend; notably, Dogecoin and Web3Bay whales are making significant plays. This shifting dynamic suggests that while ADA’s future looks uncertain, savvy investors are channeling funds into assets with more robust growth prospects. In this dynamic, Web3Bay is distinguishing itself, not merely as another speculative crypto but as a blockchain-driven solution poised to revolutionize a colossal industry—e-commerce. With its significant whale backing, over $1M in presale achievements, and its potential to upend major centralized commerce platforms, Web3Bay is emerging as the one of the best cryptos to buy now. Cardano’s 25% Drop—Is Recovery in Sight? Over the past week, ADA has seen a precipitous drop, dragging its market cap down to around $26 billion. Trading volumes have dipped by 35%, a sign that investor interest in ADA is waning as they look for more promising opportunities. The Average Directional Index (ADX) has risen to 41.6, solidifying ADA’s strong bearish momentum. A particularly alarming sign is the static whale activity; the count of wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million ADA hasn’t changed, indicating that major investors are not buying into the dip. This lack of significant support from whales suggests that ADA’s potential for a rapid recovery is diminishing, fueling concerns of further losses. Dogecoin Whales Gear Up—Is a Price Rally on the Horizon? Contrasting with ADA, Dogecoin is witnessing a spike in whale activity, suggesting that big players are positioning for an upcoming rally. Historical data shows that when whales start accumulating DOGE in significant amounts, a price surge often follows, positioning it as an asset to watch. While Dogecoin’s appeal has been largely speculative, backed by a robust community and its status among the most traded cryptocurrencies, it remains challenged by its dependence on social sentiment and meme appeal rather than substantive use cases. Even with potential whale-induced spikes, DOGE’s lack of practical applications could hinder its ability to sustain momentum over the long haul. Web3Bay: The Blockchain Innovator Attracting Big Investments The real headline in whale activity centers on Web3Bay, as substantial investments pivot towards this promising Web3 venture set to make waves in 2025. Unlike speculative altcoins reliant on market hype, Web3Bay is transforming online commerce by decentralizing it, removing intermediaries, and empowering users. As a project driven by its community, Web3Bay evolves in alignment with user needs, providing a genuine decentralized alternative to established commerce behemoths. Unlike ADA, which is battling to retain investor confidence, the increasing whale activity around Web3Bay signals strong belief in its long-term viability. With over $1M secured in its presale, Web3Bay has already showcased robust investor interest, a stark contrast to ADA’s current predicament. The substantial upside for early backers is highlighted by Web3Bay’s current token price of just $0.004562, presenting a significant undervaluation against its potential long-term worth. Should Web3Bay hit its targeted initial price of $0.1959, early investors could see an immediate 4,193% return. As demand surges and institutional money starts flowing in, projections suggest that Web3Bay might climb to $0.50 or more in 2025, potentially delivering a 10,000% ROI for early investors. Why Web3Bay Stands Out as the Optimal Crypto Investment Today The stark contrast between Cardano’s downturn and the vigorous accumulation around Web3Bay underscores where the real opportunity lies. While ADA investors grapple with uncertainty, astute investors are aligning with Web3Bay in anticipation of its breakout. While Dogecoin might lure short-term traders with its whale-driven surges, Web3Bay presents a sustainable value proposition beyond typical market cycles. With its decentralized commerce framework, burgeoning investor support, and demonstrated demand during the presale, Web3Bay is shaping up as one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025 . Far from being just speculative, Web3Bay represents a functional business model with a clear trajectory towards widespread adoption, marking it as the optimal investment as its presale concludes and market demand intensifies.

This move signals growing institutional interest in Cardano, with many speculating that approval could lead to a significant price rally. While ADA’s future looks bright, another crypto, PropiChain (PCHAIN) , is quickly gaining momentum. PCHAIN is a blockchain-powered real estate investment platform that experts believe could skyrocket 500x in just three weeks. How the Cardano ETF Could Impact the Market The Cardano ETF represents a huge milestone for ADA and the broader crypto industry. Exchange-traded funds provide institutional investors with a safe, regulated way to gain exposure to digital assets, leading to significant capital inflows. If the SEC gives it the green light, ADA could experience a price surge similar to what happened with Bitcoin after its ETF approval. Historically, ETF approvals have triggered massive rallies. When the Bitcoin ETF hit the market, BTC surged as mainstream investors jumped in. If the same happens for Cardano, ADA holders could see major gains. However, while Cardano ETF speculation is creating buzz, smart investors are also looking for crypto opportunities with even higher growth potential. That’s where PropiChain comes in. Why Investors Are Turning to PropiChain PropiChain offers real-world solutions by revolutionizing the real estate market with blockchain, AI, and tokenization. One of the biggest challenges in real estate investing is affordability. Traditional property investments require significant capital, but PropiChain makes it accessible to anyone. With its fractional ownership model, investors can purchase small shares of high-value properties instead of needing millions for full ownership. You can own a piece of a luxury apartment in New York with just a few hundred dollars. Beyond affordability, PropiChain’s AI-powered analytics help investors make smarter decisions. The platform uses machine learning to analyze market trends, identifying undervalued properties before they appreciate in value. It’s like having a personal investment advisor, but powered by data rather than speculation. Metaverse integration is another game-changer. As virtual real estate grows in value, PropiChain allows users to invest in digital properties within virtual worlds. Just like in the physical world, owning metaverse real estate can generate passive income through rentals, sponsorships, or resale opportunities. Additionally, PropiChain integrates DeFi tools like staking and lending, allowing investors to earn passive income. For example, users can stake their PCHAIN tokens to earn rewards or participate in lending pools, generating interest on their holdings. Another groundbreaking feature is that buying, selling, and trading property shares is seamless and transparent. If an investor wants to sell their share of a property, they can do so instantly through PropiChain’s marketplace, avoiding the lengthy paperwork of traditional real estate transactions. Security is also a major factor in PropiChain’s appeal. Unlike many emerging crypto projects, PropiChain has undergone a third-party security audi , ensuring its smart contracts and blockchain infrastructure are secure and reliable. Investors can trust that their assets are protected from potential vulnerabilities. Adding to its legitimacy, PropiChain has been listed on CoinMarketCap , a key milestone that boosts its visibility and credibility in the crypto space. These developments are fueling speculation that PropiChain could experience a parabolic price surge. The Investment Potential: How Much Can You Earn? With Cardano ETF approval on the horizon, ADA is expected to climb. However, PropiChain ’s presale offers an even bigger opportunity for those who get in early. Currently in stage 2 of its presale, PCHAIN is available at just $0.011 per token. A $500 investment today would be worth an incredible $250,000 if PropiChain reaches its projected 500x growth. A $1,000 investment could soar to $500,000. This is an extraordinary return that traditional markets simply can’t match. With institutional interest in blockchain-based real estate solutions growing, many believe PropiChain is the next crypto poised for a breakout. Cardano ETF and PropiChain; Two Massive Opportunities The potential approval of the Cardano ETF is a huge catalyst that could send ADA soaring, making it a smart bet for investors. But those looking for even higher returns are turning to PropiChain , a crypto that offers practical solutions, strong security, and the potential for 500x gains. Its CoinMarketCap listing and ongoing presale at $0.011 provide a rare opportunity to enter before a potential breakout. With projections of massive growth in the coming weeks, investors are positioning themselves now; before PropiChain becomes a mainstream success. For those seeking the next crypto opportunity, PropiChain could be the best bet; before the window closes.

Unlike previous blockchain projects that struggled with fragmentation and inefficiencies, Qubetics introduces a non-custodial multi-chain wallet, allowing users to seamlessly manage assets across different networks. This game-changing solution enhances both security and convenience, making crypto transactions smoother than ever. With its strong momentum and growing adoption, Qubetics is quickly becoming a top contender in the Web3 space, attracting attention from both investors and analysts. Qubetics: The Future of Blockchain Interoperability Qubetics , the world’s first Layer 1 Web3 aggregator, designed to unify leading blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. This innovative platform aims to enhance scalability, security, and interoperability across the crypto ecosystem. A standout feature of Qubetics is its non-custodial multi-chain wallet, which allows users to manage assets across multiple blockchains seamlessly.

Similarly, a small business owner can accept payments from customers using different cryptocurrencies without worrying about compatibility issues. The ongoing Qubetics presale has garnered significant attention, with over $12.7 million raised and more than 471 million $TICS tokens sold. Currently, in its 21st stage, the token is priced at $0.0733. Analysts predict that $TICS could reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, translating into a 209.67% return on investment. Looking ahead, forecasts suggest that $TICS could hit $1 after the presale and potentially $15 following the mainnet launch, offering substantial growth opportunities for early investors. Ethereum: The Pioneer of Smart Contracts Ethereum, launched in 2015, revolutionized the crypto space by introducing smart contracts, enabling decentralized applications (dApps) to flourish. Over the years, it has maintained a strong position in the market, with a current price of approximately $2,583.38. Analysts have varied predictions for Ethereum’s future, with some forecasting prices reaching $5,990 by 2025, while others suggest more conservative estimates. Despite its success, Ethereum has faced challenges, particularly with scalability and high transaction fees. The network’s congestion has led to slower transaction times and increased costs, prompting the development of Layer 2 solutions and the transition to Ethereum 2.0 to address these issues. Conclusion: Seizing the Opportunity with Qubetics While Ethereum has paved the way for decentralized applications, its limitations have opened the door for new innovations. Qubetics addresses these challenges head-on with its focus on interoperability and user-friendly solutions.

In return, Moscow freed American schoolteacher Marc Fogel, who had been detained on drug charges. Vinnik’s Role in BTC-e and Legal Troubles Vinnik operated the BTC-e platform from 2011 to 2017 when he was arrested by police in Greece at the request of American law enforcement agencies. According to the U.S. Justice Department, the exchange processed transactions worth more than $9 billion across six years, much of which was allegedly tied to crimes such as ransomware attacks, drug trafficking, and identity theft. Authorities claim that BTC-e’s lack of anti-money laundering (AML) and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) policies made it attractive to cybercriminals. Vinnik was extradited to France in 2020 and sentenced to five years for money laundering. He was later sent back to Greece before finally being handed over to the Americans in 2022. In May 2024, the Russian pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering and faced up to 20 years in prison. During his trial, prosecutors accused Vinnik of facilitating over $120 million in losses and described BTC-e as a “significant cybercrime and online money laundering entity.” Millions of dollars worth of assets belonging to the platform were seized, including $90 million that authorities bagged in New Zealand. Additionally, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed a $120 million fine on the exchange, with Vinnik personally facing a $12 million penalty. A Long-Running Extradition Battle Before his transfer to the U.S., the 45-year-old had been at the center of an international legal battle involving France, Russia, and the United States. While Russia sought his extradition on lesser fraud charges amounting to just $11,000, France and the U.S. pursued him for broader financial crimes. In 2023, his lawyers tried to include him in a U.S.-Russia prisoner swap involving journalist Evan Gershkovich, but it was unsuccessful. His exchange for Fogel, an American teacher detained in Russia, marks a rare moment of cooperation between the two countries, especially coming against the backdrop of the ongoing Ukraine war.

If the ETH price dips below $2,000, panic-driven liquidations could follow, leaving investors in search of a perfect hedge to safeguard their portfolios. This uncertainty has driven these Ethereum whales and other investors toward WallitIQ (WLTQ) , an AI Coin that is quickly gaining traction in the crypto space. Currently, in its presale phase at just $0.0420 , early adopters have a rare opportunity to secure the WLTQ AI coin before the price increases to $0.0620 in the next stage. With major exchange listings on the horizon, an AI-powered ecosystem, staking rewards, and near-zero swapping fees , this crypto project stands as a hedge against the Ethereum price market instability. Ethereum Whales’ Sell-Off Whisper A Price Drop Below $2,000: A Strategic Hedge Gains Attention The current Ethereum price stands at $2,640, reflecting a 19.2% decline in the past month and a 0.5% drop in the last 24 hours. While the Ethereum price has seen a 2.2% gain in the past week, Ethereum whales remain concerned about whether it can hold above the critical $2,000 level. Large Ethereum whale movements have traders on edge, as their sell-offs often trigger cascading losses.

33767162,[object Object],1739664004,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"As Crypto Fraud Expands, Pig Butchering Scams Skyrocket 210%",https://bitcoinist.com/as-crypto-fraud-expands-pig-butchering-scams-skyrocket-210/,"With criminals using fresh tactics to maximize their illegal earnings, the terrain of crypto scams is changing at a concerning speed. Recent data from blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis reveals a significant shift in how scammers operate, showing a preference for targeting more victims with smaller amounts rather than focusing on big fish. This transformation represents a pivotal turning point in the crypto crime scene, where criminal success appears to depend on adaptation. The Rise Of Pig Butchering And High-Yield Investment Schemes The figures show a clear picture of the present scene of crypto frauds. Representing 50% and 33% respectively, high-yield investment scams and pig slaughtering operations dominated the sector. The pig butchering phenomenon, in particular, saw a staggering 210% increase in total deposits throughout 2024, despite a 55% drop in average deposit size per victim. These frauds, which used to build confidence before committing fraud, are now speedier and more widespread. Since 2020, Chainalysis’ fraud projections have climbed by 24% annually. If its growth rate matches the Crypto Crime Report from this year, its 2024 totals might approach $12 billion. From Southeast Asia To Worldwide Operations What started in the shadowy corners of Southeast Asian fraud hotspots has now expanded throughout the world. The evolution has been rapid and purposeful. Scammers now use quick-turnaround employment scams and fake work-from-home opportunities in addition to their typical long-con tactics. Its development has been deliberate, not only spatial. For example, the Huione Guarantee platform has handled a whopping $70 billion in digital currency transactions since 2021, which begs serious questions regarding the role supposedly reliable platforms play in allowing these frauds. The New Face Of Crypto Crime The evolution of crypto scams goes beyond basic “pig killing.” The explosive character of these attacks is shown by a 15,000% rise in address-poisoning schemes following a major attack in May last year. Not far behind with a 70% deposit increase and a 170% income surge were crypto drainers. The emergence of livestream frauds and the prevalence of blackmail and sextortion ploys paint a disturbing image of these dirty activities. The data points to a more calculated criminal approach than a declining degree of fraud sophistication. Con artists invest less time tending to each victim and target fewer funds to simplify their operations. The widespread use of cryptocurrency for fraud has created new problems for law enforcement and bitcoin users. As these programs get bigger, it becomes more important to understand more advanced monitoring methods and how they protect possible victims from threats that are always changing.

With a staggering $195.5 million raised in its presale, currently in batch 27 at a price of $0.0248 per BDAG coin, representing a 2,340% increase from its initial batch, and over 18.5 billion coins already circulating, the project is generating considerable excitement. This success story is interwoven with the expertise of advisors like Dr. Maurice Herlihy, a luminary in distributed computing. This article will examine Herlihy’s influence on BlockDAG and explore the technology’s potential. The original focus on BlockDAG’s architecture remains but with a fresh perspective. The Architect of Decentralization: Dr. Maurice Herlihy’s BlockDAG Blueprint Dr. Maurice Herlihy isn’t just another name on BlockDAG’s team; he is a force in computer science and distributed computing. His academic credentials, including an A.B. in Mathematics from Harvard and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from M.I.T., speak to his deep understanding of the field. His experience spans prestigious institutions like Carnegie Mellon University and DEC Cambridge Research Lab, where his work has significantly impacted how we understand and build distributed systems. Herlihy’s contributions aren’t just theoretical; they’re the foundation upon which scalable and secure decentralized networks, like BlockDAG, are built. A Legacy of Innovation: Herlihy’s Awards and BlockDAG’s Foundation Herlihy’s recognition within the scientific community is extensive. He received the Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing not once, but twice (2003 and 2012), a testament to his lasting impact. The Gödel Prize (2004), the ISCA Influential Paper Award (2008), and the Wallace McDowell Award (2013) further solidify his position as a leader in distributed systems research. These accolades highlight his ability to craft systems that empower decentralized computing, smart contracts, and efficient validation – crucial elements for any blockchain, especially BlockDAG. His involvement with BlockDAG ensures the project’s architecture is rooted in proven research and technical mastery. Fortifying BlockDAG’s Core: Security, Efficiency, and Scalability BlockDAG’s future hinges on its ability to scale without compromising security or decentralization. Here, Herlihy’s expertise is indispensable. He contributes to refining consensus protocols, improving smart contract performance, and streamlining transaction validation. His research in parallel processing and concurrency control directly informs BlockDAG’s drive to boost transaction throughput, tackling the bottlenecks that often plague conventional blockchains. With Herlihy’s guidance, BlockDAG is developing a network designed for both security and efficiency, making it a viable option for high-volume uses like decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and enterprise solutions. His presence gives developers and institutions seeking a balanced blockchain confidence in BlockDAG’s technical foundation. BlockDAG: A New Paradigm in Distributed Ledger Technology BlockDAG represents a departure from the traditional blockchain structure. Instead of a linear chain of blocks, BlockDAG uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This allows for parallel transaction processing, greatly improving scalability and efficiency. Imagine a network where transactions aren’t processed one after the other but can occur concurrently. This is the power of BlockDAG. This architecture is at the heart of BlockDAG’s potential. It allows the network to handle an increased volume of transactions, a critical requirement for widespread adoption. The enhanced throughput and quicker confirmation times are attractive features for various uses, from micro-payments to real-time trading. BlockDAG’s consensus mechanisms ensure network integrity and thwart malicious activity, preserving the security of the transaction network. Although a relatively new technology, BlockDAG offers substantial promise. As development progresses, it could become a cornerstone of decentralized applications. The $195.5 Million Question: What Drives BlockDAG’s Presale Success? BlockDAG’s presale success is undeniable. The $195.5 million raised, the batch 27 price of $0.0248 (a 2,340% increase), and the sale of over 18.5 billion coins point to significant market interest. This isn’t just about hype; it’s about recognizing the potential of a blockchain supported by experts like Herlihy. His contributions to distributed computing provide a level of assurance that resonates with those seeking promising opportunities in the digital asset space. The Future of Decentralization: BlockDAG’s Trajectory Herlihy’s understanding of decentralized computing is a key asset for BlockDAG’s development team. His advisory role helps shape the project’s roadmap, ensuring its infrastructure is built for long-term growth and adaptability. His combined academic and practical experience in distributed computing makes him an invaluable resource for BlockDAG’s leadership. As blockchain technology evolves, having an advisor of Herlihy’s stature positions BlockDAG as a project built on solid research and technical principles. His involvement strengthens the project’s credibility and ensures BlockDAG continues to be a key player in the development of decentralized technologies.

According to experts, the crypto AI rally has yet to begin, but when it does, these 3 projects will absolutely dominate. However, from these 3 cryptos AI, one is at its lowest price ever, meaning that it has the biggest growth potential. Of course, we’re talking about RCO Finance, a new SolidProof audited financial platform that hasn’t even launched on crypto exchanges yet! RCO Finance Emerges as the Leader of the 3 Cryptos AI Even though all the 3 cryptos AI on this list are quite promising, none can compare with RCO Finance. That’s because RCO Finance brings crypto AI features unlike we’ve seen before, ones that can completely change the cryptos AI landscape and usher in a new era in trading and investing. And RCO Finance has already shown us its revolutionary nature during its presale. Namely, unlike most other crypto AI projects that wait until after the launch to offer a product or service, RCO Finance is doing it as the presale takes place! It recently launched its Beta Platform , allowing investors to see what it offers before investing in the presale. This is a revolutionary move, as investors don’t have to “go in blind” and wait until launch for something tangible anymore. Anyone can now access the Beta Platform and see what it offers, and so far, the reactions are amazing. The Beta Platform offers an incredibly intuitive dashboard, making trading/investing much simpler than before. It also allows people to trade/invest in over 120,000 assets from one place, allowing them to finally waste time moving between multiple platforms. Furthermore, users can manage multiple crypto wallets on one dashboard, making asset management a breeze. And if all that wasn’t enough, RCO Finance is a non-KYC platform, removing all the obstacles that users usually have to go through on legacy trading platforms! But that’s not all. RCO Finance’s true power can be seen through its innovative AI Robo Advisor. This is a groundbreaking crypto AI tool that takes AI-based trading and investing to unprecedented levels. Namely, the AI Robo Advisor creates sophisticated investment strategies for all RCO Finance users, tailoring them to their requirements. In order to do that, the AI Robo Advisor first gathers info on each user’s financial goals, risk tolerance, and market preferences. It then combines this with historical market trends, current data, and TA. As a result, the AI Robo Advisor creates a tailored and data-driven strategy for every single RCO Finance user. Moreover, it digests real-time financial info from trusted global sources like Bloomberg and Reuters and injects it directly into users’ trades. With this, RCO Finance users are able to make money in all market conditions! And again, that’s not all! Namely, the AI Robo Advisor also catches potential crypto runners early, helping you make life-changing gains on a weekly basis. So, with it, you can now catch coins like PROUD, which went from a $630K MC to a $26 million MC in just a few hours! So, with all of these amazing features under its belt, it’s really not a surprise that experts see RCO Finance as the most promising contender out of all cryptos AI in the market! FET Might Be Going to $5 Soon FET is among the most popular cryptos AI in the market. As such, experts say that it’ll bring in massive returns during the 2025 crypto AI run. As for now, FET is currently recovering from the recent market crash, and it’s already doing better than many other crypto coins. Namely, FET is at $0.77 right now, up by 2.55% in one week. This is very bullish for FET, as it shows that it has started to recover from the crash. With all this in mind, experts say that this is a great buying level for FET, as they expect FET to reach $5 by year-end. Driven by the cryptos AI run and the larger-scale AI boom we’re seeing, FET represents a very promising long-term coin. And when FET reaches $5, it’ll bring an ROI of 549% for current buyers! GRT Is Rising Steadily Toward $1.50 The Graph is another great cryptos AI contender that’s set to perform extremely well in 2025. Driven by the crypto AI run, experts see GRT as a great long-term hold from here. Right now, GRT is trading around $0.14, up by 5.54% in one week. So, like FET, The Graph is also showing great strength right now, as its recovery has already started. Also, 88% of The Graph community is bullish on GRT, which is another great sign. Experts see this as a great buying level for GRT, as they say that positive market conditions can take The Graph to $1.50 by year-end. So, by investing in GRT now, you’ll be able to make an ROI of 971% by year-end! This is nearly a 10x rise for current The Graph buyers. This is massive for GRT, but it still doesn’t come close to what RCO Finance offers. Still, it makes The Graph a great contender among the best cryptos AI right now! >>> BUY RCOF NOW RCOF: A Life-Changing 1,000x Investment Potential While FET and The Graph have massive rallies ahead, they can’t compete with RCOF. That’s because, thanks to its amazing crypto AI tools, RCOF has the potential to lead cryptos AI this year. Also, RCOF is still in its presale, which means that it hasn’t even had its first rally yet. So, right now, you can invest in RCOF in Stage 5 of its presale at $0.1. However, you’d need to hurry, because the RCOF presale is selling out very fast. Once Stage 5 ends, RCOF’s price will increase, and this will continue until RCOF launches at $0.4-$0.6. After the launch, RCOF’s first-ever rally is set to begin, right as the cryptos AI trend starts. With this in mind, experts say that RCOF can surge by 1,000x by mid-2025, bringing life-changing gains to early adopters. Also, RCOF is set to rise even more by year-end and beyond!

More Chainlink & Dogecoin Market Performance,https://thecoinrise.com/web3bay-presale-heats-up-stage-4-nears-sell-out-more-chainlink-dogecoin-market-performance/,"Is Chainlink’s Latest Move a Key Shift for DeFi? What Lies Ahead for Dogecoin’s Bullish Run? Chainlink (LINK) continues to gain traction in decentralized finance (DeFi), with its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) boosting adoption. The LINK price remains steady as CCIP expands across more platforms. Meanwhile, Dogecoin’s bullish momentum stays focused, driven by speculation on future integrations and increased whale activity. As these two projects make headlines, another rising sector—Web3 e-commerce—is capturing attention. Online shopping is evolving toward decentralization, and Web3Bay is at the forefront by cutting out middlemen and empowering users with full control of their transactions. Its blockchain-powered platform ensures transparency and lowers costs, making it a standout in Web3 e-commerce. With solid support from the crypto community, Web3Bay’s presale offers an early entry into this growing space. Web3Bay Revolutionizes E-commerce with Blockchain– Presale Hits $1.18M Online shopping is moving away from centralized systems that control user transactions and charge high fees. Web3 e-commerce offers buyers and sellers greater control, using blockchain to secure payments, lower costs, and provide transparency. Decentralized platforms are reshaping e-commerce by eliminating middlemen and allowing direct transactions between users. Web3Bay stands out in this space by offering a secure, blockchain-based marketplace where users benefit from reduced fees and faster processing times. All transactions are verifiable on-chain, ensuring transparency and eliminating fraud. Shoppers can access discounts when using the 3BAY token, giving real utility from the start. Unlike traditional marketplaces, Web3Bay puts the power back in the hands of its users. The presale has raised over $1.18 million so far, with buyers securing early access at $0.004562625 per 3BAY token. Web3Bay is on track to become a significant player in decentralized commerce, bringing the same efficiency to e-commerce that Chainlink brings to DeFi. Chainlink Maintains Strong Position with Cross-Chain Expansions Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) continues to grow in adoption, helping its LINK price hold steady. More platforms are integrating Chainlink to enable secure cross-chain transactions, making it essential for decentralized applications. Corn, an Ethereum Layer-2 solution focused on Bitcoin, recently adopted CCIP, further boosting Chainlink’s role in blockchain interoperability. Additionally, Chainlink has partnered with Ripple to improve stablecoin pricing data for RLUSD, expanding its use cases. These moves are positioning Chainlink as a vital part of DeFi, proving its value far beyond price speculation. Dogecoin Bullish Momentum Keeps Traders Alert Dogecoin’s bullish momentum remains strong as it holds above $0.26, despite recent market fluctuations. Whale activity and speculation about future integrations continue to attract interest. However, losing key support levels could trigger a short-term correction. Dogecoin is gaining more attention in traditional finance. Grayscale Investments recently launched the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust, making DOGE more accessible to accredited investors. On the political front, the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), co-led by Elon Musk, has sparked new discussions about Dogecoin’s role. Final Thoughts Chainlink’s expanding integrations keep its LINK price stable, making it a key technology in DeFi. Meanwhile, Dogecoin’s bullish trend remains strong, driven by growing adoption and speculation around future developments. Both projects continue to prove their relevance in the evolving crypto market. In contrast, Web3 e-commerce is reshaping how we buy and sell online. Web3Bay’s blockchain-based platform eliminates intermediaries, reduces costs, and gives users full control over their transactions. With over $1.18 million raised so far, Web3Bay is following in Chainlink’s footsteps—bringing blockchain efficiency to e-commerce and offering a shopping experience built for the future.

On-chain data trends show increased retail activity on the XRP ledger network could see XRP price hold relatively high support levels as euphoria from SEC acknowledging XRP and DOGE etfs subsides. Ripple (XRP) Racks Up 22% Gains in 5 Consecutive Days in Green Ripple (XRP) was among the standout performers in the crypto markets this week, outperforming Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum (ETH) as it surged 22% over five consecutive days. This rally was fueled by two major catalysts: Ripple’s decision to drop charges against XRP and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledging an XRP spot ETF filing. The combination of favorable regulatory developments and rising investor sentiment triggered a notable influx of capital into XRP. XRP Price Action, Feb 15 2025 The Ripple price chart above illustrates its impressive rally, climbing from an opening price of $2.40 on Monday, Feb. 10, to a peak of $2.84 by Saturday, Feb. 15. This sustained upward momentum has propelled XRP’s market capitalization above $155 billion at press time. The five consecutive daily green candles indicate a strong bullish trend, suggesting that demand remains robust even as broader market sentiment stabilizes following the SEC’s latest regulatory actions. Historically, such sustained upward movements have signaled an extended bullish phase. If current momentum holds, XRP could see further upside potential, with the next key resistance levels forming near the $3.00 psychological threshold. However, traders will be closely watching whether XRP can maintain support levels in case of profit-taking in the coming days. Retail Demand Drives up XRP Ledger Blockchain Network Activity by 39% While much of the media attention has focused on the SEC’s acknowledgment of the XRP spot ETF filing and Ripple dropping charges against XRP, on-chain data suggests another key bullish factor at play: a significant rise in network activity. CryptoQuant ’s Active Addresses chart, which tracks the daily number of unique addresses executing transactions, indicates a sharp rise in user engagement on the XRP Ledger. Typically, an increase in active addresses suggests growing retail interest, as individual traders transact more frequently. Ripple (XRP) Exchange Reserves | Source: CryptoQuant The chart above reveals that active addresses surged 39%, rising from 24,272 on Feb. 5 to 33,801 on Feb. 14. This increase in network activity coincides with XRP’s price rally, indicating that the current bullish trend is being driven by organic retail demand rather than isolated whale movements. When a rally is accompanied by heightened retail participation, it tends to establish firmer support levels, reducing the likelihood of an abrupt price correction. This trend suggests that XRP’s price surge is not merely speculative but supported by a broader user base. With heightened transaction activity backing the price rally, XRP could maintain relatively strong support even as market euphoria surrounding the SEC’s acknowledgment cools down. XRP Price Forecast: Bulls to Hold $2.50 Support if Rally Stalls XRP’s 22% price surge has positioned it within a strong technical uptrend, currently trading at $2.77. The chart signals a bullish structure, with XRP hovering above key moving averages and consolidating gains. The 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $2.68 now acts as immediate support, reinforcing the bullish outlook. Additionally, the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) at $2.77 suggests that XRP is trading near its fair market value, indicating stability in buying momentum. If bulls sustain price action above this level, XRP could look to retest the $2.84 resistance, with an extended breakout paving the way for a potential move toward the $3.00 mark. XRP Price Forecast Conversely, a failure to maintain current levels could see XRP test lower support zones. The 100-day SMA, currently positioned near $2.50, represents a crucial defensive line for bulls. A drop below this threshold could signal a loss of momentum, exposing XRP to a retracement toward the $2.30 region, where stronger buying interest is likely to reemerge. Overall, XRP remains in a bullish posture as long as it maintains support above $2.50. The ongoing surge in retail participation and positive regulatory catalysts provide strong tailwinds, though traders should remain cautious of potential profit-taking at key resistance zones.

Every cycle, a new viral token emerges, turning early investors into winners while latecomers are left wondering what they missed. In 2024, Just A Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) became one of the biggest surprises in the market, skyrocketing in value thanks to its strong community and viral appeal. But the next breakout meme coin is already here—and smart investors aren’t waiting this time. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is stealing the spotlight, with its Bulls Squad becoming one of the most exclusive and rewarding communities in crypto. With a record-breaking presale, exclusive Bulls Squad benefits, and unmatched investment potential, analysts are calling it one of the best new meme coins to invest in for short term . BTFD Coin’s Bulls Squad Is the Exclusive Club Everyone Wants In BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme token—it’s a community-driven ecosystem designed to reward its holders through multiple income streams. At the heart of this success is the Bulls Squad, an exclusive investor community that offers early access to premium staking rewards, private investment discussions, and lucrative referral bonuses. With its strong focus on Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming, staking, and community-building, BTFD Coin is quickly gaining traction among serious investors looking for high-ROI opportunities. It’s no surprise that analysts are calling it one of the best new meme coins to invest in for short term, given the huge earning potential for early adopters. Unlike most meme coins that offer little beyond speculation, BTFD Coin is creating real value for its holders through the Bulls Squad. This elite group grants members access to premium staking rewards, private community discussions, and exclusive investment insights before the rest of the market catches on. It’s a meme coin investment strategy designed for long-term profitability. Imagine purchasing $5,000 worth of BTFD tokens during the presale and securing an early stake in the Bulls Squad. With premium staking rewards and insider investment knowledge, those holdings could grow exponentially before BTFD even hits major exchanges. By the time BTFD Coin reaches its listing price of $0.0006, that initial investment would already be worth $18,750. If the projected moon price of $0.006 is hit, that same investment could be worth $187,500, proving the Bulls Squad is a direct gateway to high-ROI opportunities. With over $6.05 million raised and 69 billion tokens sold, BTFD Coin’s presale is one of the most explosive in the meme coin space. Currently in Stage 14, BTFD Coin is priced at $0.00016 per token, but that won’t last much longer. Once the presale ends, BTFD Coin will list at $0.0006, and analysts predict it could skyrocket to $0.006 soon after. With the Bulls Squad growing rapidly, the P2E game already live, and staking rewards in full effect, BTFD Coin is being called one of the best new meme coins to invest in for short term—but only for those who act fast. Buying BTFD Coin is fast and easy. Investors need to set up a MetaMask or Trust Wallet and fund it with BNB, ETH, or USDT. Once their wallet is ready, they can visit the official BTFD presale page , connect their wallet, select the amount of BTFD tokens they wish to purchase, and confirm the transaction. After the presale ends, tokens can be claimed, and investors can start staking for maximum gains. With each presale stage selling out rapidly, now is the time to secure a position in one of the best new meme coins to invest in for short term before prices rise. Just A Chill Guy’s Explosive Rise—What Comes Next? Just A Chill Guy started as an under-the-radar meme coin, but it didn’t take long before the project exploded onto the scene. As crypto communities picked up on its potential, word spread across social media like wildfire. Influencers, traders, and meme enthusiasts fueled the hype, and Just A Chill Guy quickly became a trending sensation. Its lighthearted branding and strong community backing made it a favorite among retail investors, leading to a surge in demand and skyrocketing prices. Momentum was at an all-time high as trading volumes spiked, and early adopters saw their portfolios multiply. Some investors managed to ride the wave to massive profits, with returns of 10X, 50X, and even 100X for those who got in at the right time. But as with all viral meme coins, the market moved fast. Latecomers hoping for another surge found themselves chasing the pump, only to watch the hype fade. The biggest winners were those who recognized the opportunity before it became mainstream, proving once again that timing is everything in the meme coin market. With Just A Chill Guy’s rally behind them, investors are now looking for the next big meme coin before it takes off. Many are turning their attention to BTFD Coin, recognizing the same early-stage momentum that fueled previous meme coin booms. Unlike hype-driven tokens, BTFD Coin’s Bulls Squad offers real value, positioning it as one of the best new meme coins to invest in for short term. As the presale moves into its final stages, the next wave of high-growth investors is already securing their positions—because in crypto, the biggest gains always go to those who act early. Final Thoughts If Just A Chill Guy token’s meteoric rise showed us anything, it’s that waiting on the sidelines leads to missed profits. BTFD Coin’s Bulls Squad is the next exclusive opportunity, offering investors early staking rewards, premium investment insights, and the chance to be part of the next major meme coin success story. With a record-breaking presale, elite community benefits, and insane profit potential, BTFD Coin is quickly becoming one of the best new meme coins to invest in for short term. The only question is—will you secure your spot in the Bulls Squad, or will you be watching from the sidelines again? Don’t miss out and join the BTFD Coin presale today . FAQs What is the Bulls Squad, and why should I join? The Bulls Squad is an exclusive investor community for BTFD Coin holders, offering premium staking rewards, insider investment insights, and early access to key opportunities. Members gain an edge over the market, making it one of the most valuable crypto investor groups. How high can BTFD Coin’s price go? BTFD Coin’s presale price is $0.00016, and it will list at $0.0006.

Santiment tracks the number of altcoin transactions worth more than $100,000, which it considers “whale transactions.” The firm subsequently identifies which altcoins clock the biggest percent changes in whale transactions week over week. This week, Fasttoken ( FTN ) topped Santiment’s list with a staggering 600% increase in whale transaction count (TC). FTN is the native token of the layer-1 Bahamut blockchain, which utilizes a unique consensus mechanism called Proof of Stake and Activity (PoSA). Explains the project’s whitepaper, “Proof-of-stake systems preach that the higher stake you have, the more ‘voting power’ you get. However, when considering a fair block creation reward distribution environment, it’s not fair to give the higher chance to the node that is simply ‘faster’ or ‘richer.’ Rather, we give the priority to the node that brings value to others by deploying smart contracts (or in other words creating apps) that users interact with. We have developed a variation of the proof-of-stake consensus, which involves taking into account the users’ activity with a smart contract (the software program that underlies any blockchain-based application) in addition to the stake, whenever considering the chance to become a block validator.” FTN, the 66th-ranked crypto asset by market cap with a $1.691 billion valuation, is trading at $3.94 at time of writing.
