These different market movements have put the spotlight on the hottest crypto picks in February: Trump, DOGE, Shiba Inu, Pepe, Popcat, and Panshibi but one coin appears to be topping the charts. Let's dive in on the top altcoins in 2025 Official Trump Coin (TRUMP) Official Trump remains a market mover, mainly because of the massive value uptrend, as $TRUMP rose to nearly $5.5bn (£4.5bn) following its launch, according to CoinMarketCap.com . The coin launch featured his 'fight fight fight' gesture from the July assassination attempt, recording a 300% surge within hours after the launch, creating millionaires while at it. However, this rally didn't last long as the coin plunged more than 80% from its January peak, falling from over $15 billion in January to around $2.9 billion today. However, technical indicators indicate a potential Official Trump token rebound in the coming days, especially as seen in marginal increases in token price over the last few days. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin price has risen 6% in the past week, according to CoinMarketCap , as DOGE lovers nurse higher hopes for a long rally. DOGE’s rise is mainly buoyed by institutional interest and ETF speculations , as Bloomberg analysts have also hinted that Dogecoin ETF will likely receive approval and will be considered a commodity by the SEC. Analysts predict that this news presents a major boost for DOGE, which has recorded increases over the last few days despite the overall bearish sentiment in the crypto market today. Shiba Inu For the most part, Shiba Inu price prediction was primarily dependent on its rising acceptability and fanfare. Analysts predict SHIB to hit $0.005, but the reality is much different as falling investor interest continues to stall a positive momentum for Shiba Inu. Technical indicators sport minimal trading activity, confirming a spate of minimal interest from SHIB investors. According to CoinMarketCap , Shiba Inu plunged by 21.38% in the past month and 8.52% in the past week, suggesting a long price may be a possibility. However, 50% SHIB drop projection by chat gpt and the vanishing prospects of the altcoin price reaching $0.005, investors have had to migrate into top altcoins like Panshibi, which is generating waves in the crypto community, even now in the presale stage. PEPE PEPE was a top-performing meme coin of the current market cycle, increasing nearly 30,000% post-launch and reaching an all-time high price of $0.0000283 in December 2024. However, the PEPE rally lost steam and had fallen 70% since its all-time high. However, PEPE is enjoying a bull run, which may be attributed to the growing interest and investment in the token from Michigan. Popcat POPCAT launched in February 2024 and has increased since then, emerging among the top altcoins in the crypto market today. The coin saw a record 37,000% growth and reached its all-time high in November 2024. POPCAT has enjoyed the favours of the crypto market but momentum has shifted since it fell 80% from its all-time high. However, POPCAT has recorded marginal increases over the past few days and has been tipped as one of the top altcoins in February 2025. Why New Crypto, Panshibi, has been Tipped to Join the Top Altcoinsfor February 2025 A new crypto, Panshibi (SHIB) , is all the crypto market is talking about. The Asian meme coin sensation is a panda-inspired project combining social-FI and AI to create wealth for investors and traders. It towers around three communities, Asia, memecoin and panda lovers- and each community offers additional benefits to your journey to financial freedom. Panshibi’s staking system has been tipped as a major X factor as it offers APYs as high as 1,200% whilst offering its investors and HODLers a chance to gain long-term passive and stable income. Early presale buyers enjoy several perks, including instant access to the Bamboo Private VIP Club and exclusive access to new features and networking opportunities with top investors and whales. The Panshibi has locked its liquidity pool for 10 years and team tokens for two years as part of its efforts to deepen trust and security and strengthen the SHIB token for higher positions in the market. What's more, the leading blockchain cybersecurity firm, Coinsult, confirms that the Panshibi smart contact is safe and secure. Panshibi Presale Igniting 1000X Dreams SHIBI is currently selling at $0.004 and going strong. The price for the next stage is $0.005, and by then, presale buyers will have lower gains from the 1,200% capped in the first and second stages. It's time to jump in now, as presale holders get a 145,000% ROI on their tokens after the token has been listed on multiple DEX and Uniswap. Never too late to join the train and buy your SHIBI tokens.

These various market dynamics have brought attention to February's most promising crypto picks: Trump, DOGE, Shiba Inu, Pepe, Popcat, and Panshibi , with one coin standing out as a leader. Let's explore the leading altcoins heading into 2025. Official Trump Coin (TRUMP) The Official Trump coin has been a major market influencer, primarily due to its significant value surge. After launching, $TRUMP soared to nearly $5.5 billion (£4.5 billion), according to CoinMarketCap.com . Its launch showcased his 'fight fight fight' gesture from the July assassination attempt, resulting in a 300% increase within hours, creating millionaires in the process. Nonetheless, this rally was short-lived as the coin dropped over 80% from its January high, plummeting from more than $15 billion in January to roughly $2.9 billion today. However, technical signals suggest a possible rebound for the Official Trump token in the coming days, as evidenced by slight increases in its price recently. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin's price has climbed 6% over the past week, per CoinMarketCap , as DOGE enthusiasts hope for a prolonged rally. DOGE's rise is largely driven by institutional interest and ETF speculations ; Bloomberg analysts have also suggested that a Dogecoin ETF could soon receive approval and be classified as a commodity by the SEC. Experts believe this development is a significant boost for DOGE, which has seen price increases in recent days despite the prevailing bearish outlook in the crypto market. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu's price forecast has largely hinged on its growing acceptance and popularity. Analysts anticipated SHIB could reach $0.005; however, diminishing investor interest has hindered positive momentum for Shiba Inu. Technical indicators show minimal trading activity, reflecting a lack of interest from SHIB investors. According to CoinMarketCap , Shiba Inu has declined by 21.38% over the last month and 8.52% in the past week, hinting at a potential long-term price drop. However, the 50% SHIB drop prediction by chat gpt and the dwindling hopes of the altcoin price reaching $0.005 have led investors to gravitate towards top altcoins like Panshibi, making waves within the crypto community, even at the presale phase. PEPE PEPE was a standout meme coin in the current market cycle, soaring nearly 30,000% after its launch and achieving an all-time high of $0.0000283 in December 2024. However, the PEPE surge has lost momentum, falling 70% from its peak. Despite this, PEPE is experiencing a bullish run, likely due to increasing interest and investment from Michigan. Popcat POPCAT made its debut in February 2024 and has been on the rise since then, becoming one of the top altcoins in today's crypto market. The coin experienced a remarkable 37,000% increase and reached its all-time high in November 2024. Although POPCAT has been favored in the crypto market, its momentum has shifted, dropping 80% from its peak. Nevertheless, POPCAT has seen slight gains in recent days and is considered one of February 2025's top altcoins. Why New Crypto, Panshibi, is Poised to Join the Top Altcoinsfor February 2025 A new player in the crypto scene, Panshibi (SHIB) , is creating a buzz. This Asian meme coin, inspired by pandas, merges social-FI and AI to generate wealth for investors and traders. It revolves around three communities: Asia, memecoin enthusiasts, and panda lovers, each offering additional benefits on your path to financial independence. Panshibi’s staking system is considered a key advantage, offering APYs up to 1,200%, and providing investors and HODLers with opportunities for long-term passive and steady income. Early presale participants enjoy numerous benefits, including immediate access to the Bamboo Private VIP Club and exclusive entry to new features and networking opportunities with top investors and whales. Panshibi has secured its liquidity pool for 10 years and team tokens for two years to enhance trust and security, aiming to strengthen the SHIB token's market position. Furthermore, leading blockchain cybersecurity firm Coinsult has verified that the Panshibi smart contract is both safe and secure. Panshibi Presale Fueling 1000X Dreams Currently, SHIBI is priced at $0.004 and gaining momentum. The next stage will see the price rise to $0.005, at which point presale buyers will see reduced gains from the 1,200% cap in the first and second stages. Now is the time to get involved, as presale holders can achieve a 145,000% ROI on their tokens once they are listed on multiple DEX and Uniswap.

On-chain data shows an unusual increase in BTC deposits on exchanges, a move that could potentially trigger a breakout from the prolonged consolidation phase observed this week. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Stagnates Amid Mixed Market Signals Bitcoin (BTC) price has displayed an unusually flat performance this week as bullish and bearish market signals counteracted each other. On the bearish side, hotter-than-expected inflation figures in the U.S. CPI report published on Feb. 13 exerted downward pressure. This data caused investors to reallocate capital away from risk assets, anticipating a hawkish Fed stance on interest rates in the coming weeks. Conversely, the U.S. SEC acknowledged Grayscale ETF filings for XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE) spot ETFs. This triggered positive speculation that altcoin ETF approvals could drive capital inflows into the crypto sector, signaling a potential shift in regulatory sentiment. The acknowledgment helped sustain BTC prices, preventing bears from exerting dominance for an extended period this week. Bitcoin Price Action (BTCUSDT), Feb 15, 2025 According to the chart, BTC price only increased by a mild 0.18% this week, opening at $96,444 on Sunday, Feb. 9, and currently trading at $97,500 at press time on Saturday, Feb. 15. The data suggests BTC’s price action remained in a neutral phase, as bullish catalysts from SEC ETF acknowledgment counterbalanced the negative sentiment stemming from overheated U.S. CPI data. Investors Have Deposited 12,000 BTC Into Trading Platforms in the Last 10 Days While spot market sentiment remains neutral, BTC’s on-chain transaction patterns suggest a potential breakout move ahead. CryptoQuant ’s Exchange Reserve chart shows the total BTC deposits across crypto exchanges and trading platforms. Typically, an increase in exchange reserves signals potential sell-off risks, while declines indicate accumulation trends, as traders shift assets into cold storage for long-term holding. Bitcoin (BTC) Exchange Reserves | Source: CryptoQuant The referenced chart reveals Bitcoin Exchange Reserves jumped from 2.35 million BTC on Feb. 6 to 2.47 million BTC as of Feb. 15. This represents an increase of 12,000 BTC deposited into exchanges—valued at over $1.2 billion at current prices—diluting market supply within the past 10 days. The rise in exchange reserves amid BTC’s price consolidation suggests heightened selling pressure. While altcoins like XRP, SOL, and DOGE experienced notable gains, more traders could be positioning to exit BTC in the coming days. This development presents a bearish outlook, as increasing market supply, coupled with stagnating prices, historically precedes downside movements. Bitcoin Price Forecast: $90,000 Breakdown Risk Signals Emerge Bitcoin price forecast charts shows BTC trading at $97,501, hovering just above the VWAP level of $97,565, with key support at the 100-day SMA near $97,093. The BTC price action remains confined within a rising wedge pattern, historically a bearish formation that suggests momentum exhaustion. Volume has been decreasing, indicating waning buying pressure, while the ADR at 1.40 signals compressed volatility, often a precursor to an imminent breakout. Bitcoin Price Forecast (BTCUSDT) If Bitcoin maintains its position above the 100-day SMA and VWAP, bulls could attempt to reclaim the $98,784 resistance marked by the 50-day SMA, which would invalidate the immediate bearish bias. A successful move beyond this level could reignite upward momentum, opening the door for a retest of the psychological $100,000 mark. However, failure to sustain above current levels would expose Bitcoin to a significant breakdown. The downside scenario gains credibility if Bitcoin falls below the rising wedge’s lower trendline. A confirmed breakdown could trigger a cascading sell-off, aligning with the chart’s projected target around $50,000. This bearish target coincides with the 200-day SMA, adding technical confluence. Should selling pressure intensify, Bitcoin risks breaching $90,000, accelerating toward lower support levels.

This bullish move signals renewed strength in the market, with buyers stepping in to drive momentum higher. After weeks of sideways trading, XRP’s breakout could be the catalyst for further gains, but can the bulls sustain this rally? With technical indicators flashing positive signals, XRP now faces the challenge of turning this breakout into a lasting uptrend. If buying pressure remains strong, the crypto might be eyeing higher resistance zones, setting the stage for an extended rally. However, if the price struggles to hold above $2.7, a pullback would likely come into play. Market Sentiment Shifts As XRP Gains Momentum XRP’s breakout above $2.7 and the 100-day SMA have injected fresh optimism into the market, shifting sentiment in favor of the bulls. After a period of consolidation, traders are now seeing renewed confidence as buying pressure pushes the price higher. Investor enthusiasm is growing, with many anticipating further upside if key resistance levels continue to fall. Related Reading: Analyst Shares Upper And Lower Targets For XRP Price The breakout has sparked renewed buying interest, evident in the rising trading volume and improving technical indicators, which suggest a potential continuation of the upward trend. As more market participants recognize the breakout as a bullish signal, demand for XRP is increasing, reinforcing positive sentiment in the market. One of the key indicators confirming this upward push is the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which is currently trending higher above the zero line. This positioning signals that bullish momentum is strengthening, with the MACD line diverging more from the signal line, a classic indication that buying pressure is increasing. However, despite the growing optimism, market volatility remains a factor. If the altcoin fails to maintain its position above $2.7, it could trigger profit-taking, leading to a short-term retracement. That said, as long as market sentiment remains positive and XRP holds above key support levels, the bulls might maintain control and push the price higher in the coming sessions. Key Levels To Watch After The Breakout With XRP surging past $2.7 and the 100-day SMA, all eyes are now on the next critical price levels that could determine the coin’s next move. Holding above this breakout zone is crucial for bulls to maintain control and push the price toward higher targets. Related Reading: XRP Price Explodes 25%: Will The Recovery Sustain or Fizzle Out? Immediate resistance to watch is the $2.9 level, which currently stands as a crucial hurdle for XRP’s price action. A decisive breakout above this range may confirm that bulls are firmly in control, setting the stage for more upside momentum such as the $3.4 range. A drop below the $2.7 level could signal that the recent breakout was not sustainable, potentially leading to a shift in market sentiment. If XRP fails to establish $2.7 as a strong support zone, it may indicate a false breakout, where bullish momentum fades and sellers regain control.

While Bitcoin’s dominance dips, analysts predict an incoming altcoin season, hailing it an “altseason.” Despite fluctuations, top altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Binance Coin (BNB) regain traction, marking significant gains. Altcoin Season Alert: Signs of a Market Shift As the crypto market gears up for a significant shift, analysts and experts hint at the potential arrival of an altseason, or an altcoin season. According to analyst Ted, the altcoin surge in 2024 was merely a warm-up for what’s to come. Adding to the point, he forecasts a record-breaking altseason in 2025 that is expected to make history. Notably, in an X post , Ted highlights key drivers of the altseason. They include potential developments including multiple altcoin ETF approvals, Ethereum’s upgrade, Ethereum ETF’s staking feature etc. Reinforcing Ted’s prediction, analyst CryptoGoos asserted that altcoins would explode, driven by a combination of factors. He explained his analysis through past patterns, in which altcoins saw major uptrends in 2017 and 2021, paving the way for a potential major altseason in 2025. In another X thread, CryptoGoos wrote, “Altcoins will pump.” Similarly, emphasizing the historical trend of major altcoin seasons occurring in the month of February, analyst Shib Spain forecasted a recurrence. The analyst suggested that the current market conditions are ripe for a repeat of past altcoin rallies that have typically taken place during this time of year. Corroborating this idea, Max Brown also stated, “Altseason starts in February.” Altcoin ETF Approvals Ahead Asset managers have taken the initiative to launch multiple altcoin ETFs, pending regulatory approval. The proposed ETFs are set to track a diverse range of altcoins, including XRP, Solana, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Cardano. As the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently acknowledged Grayscale’s 19b-4 filings to list XRP and Dogecoin ETFs, the odds are high for an altcoin ETF in 2025. According to Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, the Litecoin ETF has a 90% chance of receiving regulatory approval, making it the most likely to gain approval among the altcoin ETFs. Meanwhile, the Dogecoin, Solana, and XRP ETFs also have significant approval chances, with 75%, 70%, and 65% probabilities, respectively. Notably, the Trump administration has a more favorable stance towards crypto ETF approvals, with a higher probability of approval compared to the previous government. This positive sentiment has sparked expectations of an altcoin season in the near future. Upcoming Altcoin Season: What To Know More Recently, the Ethereum blockchain released a roadmap for its Pectra upgrade. The activation is planned to occur on February 24 on the Holesky testnet, followed by March 5 on Sepolia, with a mainnet release targeted for April 8. Meanwhile, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has proposed to introduce staking in spot Ethereum ETFs on behalf of Grayscale, seeking approval from the SEC. These developments have further fueled the hype surrounding an impending altcoin season, with Ethereum, as the leading altcoin, playing a pivotal role in driving these expectations. Top Altcoins Stay Strong Both historical trends and current market sentiment highlight the possibility of an upcoming altcoin season. Top altcoins show bullish signals ahead with the overall market gearing up for a significant resurgence. As of press time, Ethereum is priced at $2,690, up by 2.06% in a week. Meanwhile, XRP has exhibited a massive growth of 12% over the last seven days. Despite Solana’s marginal decline, BNB surged by more than 5% over the past week.

As the market continues to evolve, some tokens are showing ultra-bullish momentum, which could lead to impressive returns. Solana, BNB, and Remittix (RTX) are among the top contenders, each bringing unique features and strong growth potential. For seasoned investors and new investors, these top 3 cryptocurrencies are catching the attention of analysts and investors alike. Remittix Leads the Top 3 Cryptocurrencies to Buy Now Remittix (RTX) is quickly becoming a favorite among those looking for practical uses of cryptocurrency. It solves a major issue that many networks have not fully addressed: the easy conversion of crypto to regular money (FIAT) for everyday transactions. Remittix allows users to convert their digital assets into FIAT and deposit the funds directly into nearly any bank account worldwide, making it perfect for international money transfers. Because of its clear focus on real-world utility, Remittix is being called one of the top 3 cryptocurrencies to buy right now, especially if you're interested in the trillion-dollar global remittance market. In its presale phase, the project has already gained tens of thousands of supporters, showing strong belief in its ability to make cross-border payments easier and cheaper. Unlike Solana and BNB, which focus on high-speed smart contracts, Remittix is all about creating a simple, user-friendly platform that works for everyone—from beginners to experienced investors. By making it easy to convert crypto into regular money and link it to traditional banking systems, Remittix is opening up blockchain technology to people who might have been hesitant before. Experts believe that once Remittix fully launches, it could see significant growth, with some predicting 10x to 20x returns. If the demand for easier international payments grows quickly, Remittix could even outpace other platforms, becoming one of the most useful and widely adopted crypto solutions. Solana’s Recovery Potential Relies On $220 Resistance Break Solana's price is also exhibiting signs of recovery, trading at $194.95 following some consolidation. The price just went through a corrective wave that might herald a turn upward. Source: Coinmarketcap Solana has recently announced new ecosystem tools to help developers integrate DeFi and enhance NFT abilities. Experts think those developments could push Solana past $220 by the next cycle. Binance Coin (BNB) Price Surge: Is This the Beginning of a New BNB Season? Binance Coin (BNB) surged by 13% in 7 days to $666.72. This surge moved BNB above Solana (SOL) and to the fifth spot among the top 3 cryptocurrencies by market cap. The rally came with a huge increase in daily trading volume, which shot up 84% to $4.72 billion. This spike in volume helped BNB’s market cap soar to over $95 billion. Source: CoinMarketCap The recent BNB surge is closely tied to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which is working to become the go-to platform for meme coins. This is happening through the launch of the MyShell initial DEX offering (IDO) on BSC . In the last 24 hours, a massive $173 million has been bridged from Solana and Ethereum to BSC, signaling strong interest in the Binance ecosystem. As the price of BNB continues to rise, investors are now questioning whether this is the start of a full-fledged BNB season. Crypto analysts are divided, but many see potential for further growth, especially if the price holds above $750. If BNB manages to break past the $800 mark, it could signal a new long-position opportunity, particularly if it aligns with Bitcoin’s movements. Get in on Remittix, the Best Crypto to Buy Now Choosing the top 3 cryptocurrencies to buy really depends on what you’re looking for as an investor. For investors who are willing to take their investment to the next level, a new project like Remittix is the best option. The RTX presale is proof that it deserves a spot among the top 3 cryptocurrencies. The token has raised millions in its presale, and more investors are buying in. These top 3 cryptocurrencies have strong communities, solid tech behind them, and a plan for future growth. But experts back Remittix to be a great option for 100x profits in 2025.

Mert Mumtaz, the Helius Lab CEO is a hardcore member of that community with the battle scars to show for it. He proved his love for the chain again earlier today when he rose to Solana’s defense following the disaster of the Libra meme token which reportedly allowed $4.4B to be extracted from the ecosystem by grifters. Mert has words for those tagging Solana as a haven of scams Mert was not having the negativity triggered by the Libra token rugpull on Solana and took to X, formerly Twitter, to share his opinions. As far as Mert is concerned, many of those complaining about scams on Solana are maxis from a chain that has significantly less activity than Solana. In one post, he attributed all the noise to “cope” which he called “the most addictive drug.” you are not upset that there are scams on Solana you are upset that your chain has no activity ""New York City has more crime than my farm in Alabama"" is not a dunk — mert | helius.dev (@0xMert_) February 15, 2025 “Crypto’s history is almost all speculation — L1 coins, ICOs, NFTs, L2 coins, and now memecoins,” he wrote . “The function is the same, the form is different, it is raw brainworms to think “the validator client that is named Solana is encouraging scams.” Mert said all Solana does is make “assets fast and cheap to move,” and reminded everyone that “every ecosystem has shitcoins and has always had immense speculation.” Mert urged those who have a problem with Solana to channel their energy into building an alternative instead of resorting to “endless moral posturing to hate-farm some dopamine hits from pessimists.” He also mocked Ethereum maxis, many of whom have used the Libra rug to call out Solana as a rug chain, for often glazing their chain’s founder, Vitalik Buterin, who recently agreed that the L1 he created needs higher gas limits. Of course, Mert’s defense did not go without responses from trolls, which only seemed to piss him off more. At some point, he shared a post that saw him reveal he was asked why he was “enabling scams” even though, according to him, he never shills tokens despite numerous daily temptations and only focuses on “scaling the tech, shitposting, and helping startups/institutions adopt crypto.” Notably, Bitcoin and USDT on the Tron blockchain have faced the same accusations as Mert Mumtaz and Solana in the past, with detractors implicating the projects for the nature of users’ activities. What happened to the Libra token? The Libra meme was a token that Argentina’s president Javier Milei had initially promoted in a now-deleted post on X. It was linked to the Viva La Libertad Project, which claimed to have plans to support Argentina’s economy by funding small businesses. Now-deleted X post of Argentina’s president, Javier Milei, endorsing the Libra meme token launch on Solana. Source: @i_bot404 (X/Twitter) The president took down his tweets after allegedly learning more details and confessed that he had failed to conduct proper due diligence before endorsing the project. “I initially supported a supposed private enterprise with which I have no connection. After becoming aware of the details, I decided to discontinue spreading the word,” he said. The announcement caused panic among holders who had rushed in to buy Libra , pushing its market capitalization to $4.5 billion after Milei’s initial endorsement. As doubts about the project’s legitimacy spread, the token’s price tumbled from $4.50 to $0.50, and trading volume hit $1.1 billion in just a few hours before the sell-off intensified. On-chain analysis immediately turned up a red flag as blockchain data revealed that 82% of Libra’s total supply was spread among a few wallets. According to on-chain analytics firm Bubblemaps, the project’s developers sped up the demise of the token because they withdrew $87 million from liquidity pools. Chainalysis also pointed out that the address that created the Libra token and the one holding a major portion of its supply, seemed to be controlled by a single private key, rather than a multi-signature setup, the more secure option. The Libra token rug was only successful thanks to the participation of Milei, who endorsed it without doing enough research. However, this is not the first time Milei has gotten involved with a crypto scam. In 2021, he endorsed CoinX, which promised big returns through AI-powered trading but was revealed to be an alleged Ponzi scheme. Milei later faced litigation for losses between 30 and 40 million Pesos ($300,000) after regulators shut down CoinX.

He shared this perspective during an episode of the Gokhstein Media podcast , released on February 13, in a discussion about market trends and future outlooks. Market Resilience and Instituti;.onal Influence Hoskinson dismissed speculation that the ongoing bull market was nearing its end, arguing instead that market momentum remained strong. He pointed to the market’s rapid recovery from the downturn on February 3 as evidence of its resilience. On that day, widespread liquidations affected over 700,000 leveraged traders, erasing more than $2 billion in positions. The downturn was triggered by newly announced tariffs from former U.S. President Donald Trump . Hoskinson noted that while recovery from past major collapses, such as the FTX and LUNA crises, took nearly two years, this market correction reversed in just two days. According to Hoskinson, the swift rebound highlights a significant shift in the crypto market’s structure. He attributed this resilience to increased institutional involvement, describing the current cycle as the first to be primarily driven by institutional investors. This shift, he suggested, has led to a stronger focus on well-established cryptocurrencies, sometimes referred to as “dinosaur coins.” He argued that assets like ADA, ETH, and XRP, which have a long-standing presence in the market, are viewed as more stable and reliable compared to newer projects. Performance of ADA, ETH, and XRP Recent market trends support this view, with Cardano (ADA) and XRP achieving substantial triple-digit percentage gains in the fourth quarter of 2024. Additionally, these assets and Ethereum, have drawn considerable interest from firms seeking to launch exchange-traded funds (ETFs), further reinforcing their relevance in institutional portfolios. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bitcoin’s Future and Long-Term Market Outlook Despite his confidence in ADA, ETH, and XRP, Hoskinson maintained that Bitcoin would remain the dominant cryptocurrency. He predicted that as more nations adopt Bitcoin as part of their financial reserves, its value could rise significantly, potentially reaching at least $250,000. This view contrasts with an earlier prediction by well-known analyst EGRAG CRYPTO, who suggested that XRP could gain enough market traction to achieve a 20% dominance over Bitcoin. When discussing the timeline for the next market surge, Hoskinson estimated that the upward trend could resume within six to twelve months. He identified regulatory developments—particularly those concerning stablecoins—as a crucial factor in determining market direction. He hopes that once stablecoin regulations are implemented, U.S. policymakers will turn their attention to broader issues such as token classification and custody regulations, providing further clarity for the industry. However, in the immediate future, however, Hoskinson cautioned that market conditions would likely remain volatile. While the overall trajectory appears positive, investors should be prepared for fluctuations as the market grows.

XRP’s investors have enjoyed successes in recent times fueled by SEC’s approval of the top altcoin. Ripple investors are now buzzing about the next big opportunity to diversify their fat portfolios into. While XRP remains the gold standard for cross-border transactions, many in the market are looking for a fresh alternative that might replicate—or even surpass—its success. Recently, a new Defi project has caught the eye of many, as it is priced at less than $0.1 and is being hailed by some as the potential ""next XRP."" The excitement isn’t just about low prices; it’s about the promise of a token that could revolutionize the way money moves globally. XRP: The Veteran of Cross-Border Transactions The crypto revolution has placed XRP at its forefront for multiple years because of its position within RippleNet which enables rapid cross-border payment services. XRP maintains a trading price of $2.75 while showing a 17.5% increase during the last 7 days. The current Ripple price demonstrates sustained investor optimism together with stability through the regulatory obstacles which XRP encountered throughout its history. The legal battles faced by Ripple Labs since 2020 have created price volatility for XRP because of their role as XRP's developer. A favorable 2023 court decision brought positive changes after it determined the status of XRP during exchange transactions. The court decision has sparked fresh enthusiasm among XRP holders because XRP's existing partnerships drive continuous growth of its network. Ripple demonstrates its commitment to global financial system value through its partnership with Unicâmbio in Portugal for quick payments between Brazil and Portugal . The value of XRP fluctuates according to how legal cases and regulatory oversight turn out. Across XRP’s ecosystem, there's a range of XRP price predictions for the coming years. Some analysts, like @TallGuyTycoon, have suggested XRP could see levels at $2.78, followed by $3.87, and potentially a rapid rise to $8. The overall sentiment on X shows a mix of optimism for short-term gains and varied long-term expectations, with a consensus leaning towards significant growth if regulatory clarity and adoption increase. Remittix Is Ushering In The New Wave in Crypto Payments Enter Remittix , a promising new altcoin that is rapidly making a name for itself in the digital payments space.

Its unique Pay API model allows companies to handle payments efficiently, supporting over 50 crypto pairings and 30 fiat currencies. Both XRP and Remittix have their unique strengths.

Traditional copyright laws weren't designed for AI, leaving artists, developers, and legal experts struggling with questions of ownership and originality. This uncertainty has led to copyright disputes, concerns over AI learning from existing works, and fears that human artists could lose recognition and income. Without clear protections, both AI-generated and human-created digital art remain at risk. The good news is that blockchain technology offers solutions. Some blockchain platforms are stepping in to provide even more accessibility to verify ownership, transparency, and fair compensation—helping to protect digital art, no matter who (or what) creates it. What is AI-Generated Art? AI-generated art is artwork created with the help of artificial intelligence. Instead of a person drawing or painting by hand, AI tools use data and patterns to create images, music, or even designs. These tools can copy famous styles, make something new, or help artists bring their ideas to life. AI-created art has made creativity more accessible. Anyone can type a description, and AI will turn it into a detailed image in seconds. Some artists use AI to experiment with new ideas, while others let the technology generate entire pieces. The First Forms of Machine-Generated Art Machine-generated art has been developing for decades, something surprising for many people long before it became widely known. In the 1960s, artists and computer scientists experimented with early algorithms to create abstract patterns and geometric designs. These early works, often created using basic programming languages, laid the foundation for what would later become AI-driven creativity. As technology improved, AI art moved beyond simple patterns. Researchers developed neural networks in the 1990s and early 2000s capable of recognizing and replicating artistic styles. This led to AI programs that could transform photos into paintings, like how apps today can apply filters to mimic famous artists. However, one of the biggest shifts came with NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). Before NFTs, digital art—including AI-generated pieces—was difficult to sell or claim ownership over because anyone could copy and share it. NFTs changed this by using blockchain technology to verify ownership and uniqueness. AI artists could sell their work as digital assets, creating a new art market. Some of the first AI-based NFT projects demonstrated how AI and blockchain could work together, making digital art more valuable and collectible. With these advancements, AI-created art has become a recognized form of creative expression. Today, AI can generate paintings, sculptures, music, and animations, and artists and collectors are embracing the possibilities. The Challenges of AI-Created Art And as all good things come with challenges, AI-created art is no exception. While it has opened up new creative possibilities, it has also raised serious questions and concerns, especially around ownership, originality, and ethics. One of the biggest problems is copyright and ownership. Since AI can create artwork without direct human involvement, who owns the final piece is unclear. In most legal systems, AI cannot hold copyright, meaning ownership usually falls to the person who gave the AI instructions or the company that built the AI. However, when AI generates highly detailed images with minimal human input, this creates a gray area in copyright law, making it difficult to determine who deserves credit and compensation. Another issue is AI learning from existing art. AI models are trained on vast amounts of data, often including copyrighted artworks. This raises the question: is AI-generated content truly original, or is it just an altered version of existing works? Many artists argue that AI should not be trained on their creations without permission, while developers claim it falls under fair use or transformation. This debate continues to grow as more AI-generated pieces resemble real artists' styles. There are also concerns about the devaluation of human creativity. If AI can generate high-quality art in seconds, will human artists struggle to compete? Some fear that AI-generated content could flood the market, making it harder for traditional artists to earn recognition and income. Others see AI as just another tool, like photography or digital editing, that artists can use to enhance their creativity rather than replace it. These challenges highlight the need for clearer laws and ethical guidelines to protect artists and AI-generated creativity's future. But until then, it will help at least some tools that can help in this regard. How to Protect AI-Created Art? With the growing presence of AI-created art, protecting ownership and ensuring fair use has become a major concern. Since AI challenges traditional copyright laws, artists and developers need new ways to verify authorship, prove originality, and secure rights over their creations. Fortunately, several emerging solutions are helping address these issues. One promising approach is blockchain technology, which creates a transparent, unchangeable record of ownership. NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) were one of the first tools to bring this idea to digital art, allowing artists to assign unique ownership to their works. However, while NFTs helped establish authenticity, they didn't fully solve the issue of protecting AI-generated content, especially when proving originality or determining fair use. A more advanced solution is the 7007 protocol , which provides verifiable ownership and authenticity for AI-generated content (AIGC) on the blockchain. Unlike NFTs, this protocol protects AI-created art and human-generated works, ensuring that both digital and traditional artists can safeguard their intellectual property. The 7007 protocol offers a transparent and traceable system where creators—whether human or AI—can securely register and manage their works. This helps prevent unauthorized use while making it easier for artists to monetize their creations fairly and efficiently. Aside from blockchain-based solutions, another important approach is developing clearer copyright laws. However, since implementing such laws is a complex and lengthy process, platforms like the 7007 protocol have become essential go-to solutions for creators today. Conclusion We hope you now have a clearer understanding of AI-generated art and the challenges it brings. As technology evolves, new solutions like blockchain (including different blockchain platforms) and improved copyright laws are helping protect digital creativity. The future is still unfolding, but AI-created art can become more secure for everyone with the right tools, ownership, and fairness.

As 2025 advances, analysts are placing their bets on which altcoins will soar to new heights. Dogecoin and Avalanche remain strong contenders, but an unexpected player, WallitIQ (WLTQ), has captured the spotlight. With its AI-driven innovations and growing investor interest, WallitIQ (WLTQ) could deliver unprecedented returns, making its presale a tempting opportunity for those seeking exponential growth. But where will these three coins stand by the end of 2025? Let’s break it down. Dogecoin (DOGE): Meme Coin With Staying Power Dogecoin (DOGE) has earned a reputation as the original meme coin with an enthusiastic community and notable backers, including Elon Musk. Its widespread popularity has kept it in the top-tier rankings on CoinMarketCap. DOGE currently priced around $0.2641, continues to thrive despite market fluctuations. Analysts are optimistic, projecting a potential climb to $5 by the end of 2025, driven by growing adoption and market optimism. However, WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers a more compelling investment case. Unlike Dogecoin, which thrives primarily on community hype, this altcoin boasts real-world utility powered by AI functionalities. The platform’s predictive analytics, QR code payment system, and anomaly detection technology make it a practical tool for crypto investors seeking smarter financial management. With a presale price of just $0.0420 , the token is primed for an epic rise, potentially outpacing DOGE in terms of profitability. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The High-Potential AI Altcoin You Can’t Ignore WallitIQ (WLTQ) stands out as a game-changing AI-powered platform designed to transform crypto wallet management. With its SolidProof- audited smart contract and the newly launched MVP mobile app, the platform is already making waves in the market. The app offers flawless wallet management for ETH and USDT, real-time pricing integration through CoinGecko API, and essential transaction features. The soon-to-be-released Beta platform promises even more advanced capabilities. This Ethereum-based gem goes beyond basic wallet functionalities by integrating anomaly detection technology to safeguard transactions and AI-driven suggestions for DeFi interactions. Its physical-to-digital payment feature through QR codes simplifies everyday crypto payments, setting it apart from Dogecoin and Avalanche. Unlike DOGE, which lacks robust use cases, WallitIQ (WLTQ) combines innovative technology with a user-friendly interface to attract both novice and seasoned investors. Analysts predict that this AI-driven token could surge by as much as 50,000% by mid-2025, making its current presale price of $0.0420 a bargain that’s hard to ignore. Avalanche (AVAX): A Platform With Solid Fundamentals Avalanche has earned its place as one of the most technologically advanced blockchain networks. Known for its scalability, high throughput, and low fees, Avalanche has attracted numerous DeFi projects and dApp developers. Priced at approximately $26.42 according to Coingecko, AVAX remains a top contender in the crypto market. Analysts believe it has the potential to appreciate significantly by the end of 2025, driven by ongoing network upgrades and increased adoption. However, despite its technological prowess, Avalanche lacks the explosive growth potential seen in WallitIQ (WLTQ). As crypto whales shift their focus toward emerging gems, this platform has become a hot topic for its innovative AI functionalities and presale momentum. Investors are recognizing that WallitIQ (WLTQ) could deliver bigger gains than both Dogecoin and Avalanche combined, thanks to its strong fundamentals and cutting-edge features. The Verdict: WallitIQ (WLTQ) Leads The Pack If you’re looking to position yourself for massive gains in 2025, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is the clear winner. While Dogecoin m and Avalanche have their merits, WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) AI-driven platform, utility-focused features, and strategic presale pricing at $0.0420 make it a high-growth contender. With analysts projecting a staggering 50,000% increase post-launch, this hidden altcoin gem offers unmatched profit potential. Don’t miss out—join the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale now at $0.0420 and secure your position in one of the most promising crypto projects of 2025.

While many traders are drawn to meme coins for quick profits, the real game-changers are those with long-term potential. Finding meme coins that offer sustainability, innovation, and real returns can be challenging, but a few standout projects are rewriting the script. Arctic Pablo Coin , Dogwifhat, and SPX6900 lead the charge, offering unique narratives and impressive financial potential. One meme coin turning heads is Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC)—an adventure-driven token that takes investors through Earth’s hidden locations, uncovering mystical wealth. Unlike traditional meme coins, Arctic Pablo isn’t just about hype; it’s about bridging myth and reality, creating an immersive investment experience. Meanwhile, Dogwifhat ($WIF) is proving to be a Solana-backed powerhouse, riding the waves of massive adoption and exchange listings, while SPX6900 is pushing financial satire to the extreme, skyrocketing in value as it mocks traditional markets. Let’s dive into these three top meme coins to join for the long term and why they could be life-changing investments for those who get in early. Arctic Pablo: The Legendary Meme Coin That’s Reshaping Crypto Adventures Deep within the icy landscapes of the unknown, Arctic Pablo embarks on an extraordinary quest. This isn’t just a meme coin—it’s a journey. As Pablo traverses enchanted frostbitten realms, each presale phase unlocks new hidden locations, fueling excitement and scarcity. Investors don’t just buy a coin; they become part of the legend. Arctic Pablo Coin operates with a narrative-driven presale, where each phase is tied to a unique location instead of traditional token sale stages. This keeps engagement high and builds an immersive investment experience. The coin follows a deflationary model, with unsold tokens burned weekly, increasing scarcity and long-term value. High-APY staking allows holders to earn 66% APY while securing passive income and participating in the ecosystem’s growth. Built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Arctic Pablo accepts various cryptocurrencies, including BNB, ETH, USDT, BTC, SOLANA, and XRP. With an engaging story, strong tokenomics, and unmatched ROI potential, Arctic Pablo isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a movement. Investors can ride this once-in-a-lifetime journey and claim their share of legendary riches. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) has already raised over $1.24 million, with the current location, Aqua Frost, offering tokens at just $0.000059. With a projected launch price of $0.008, early investors stand to gain an eye-watering 13,451% ROI. Imagine turning $500 into $67,796.60—this isn’t just a fantasy; it’s the reality of Arctic Pablo’s explosive potential. Dogwifhat: The Meme Coin With Unstoppable Momentum If one meme coin has been making waves, it’s Dogwifhat (WIF). What started as a joke has transformed into a Solana-powered juggernaut, delivering mind-blowing returns to investors. In just one week, Dogwifhat surged 360%, smashing all-time highs and reaching a $1.7 billion market cap. Several key factors drive Dogwifhat’s success. The coin has been listed on major exchanges like Robinhood Europe, significantly increasing its reach and credibility. Speculation is growing over a potential Coinbase or Binance listing, further fueling investor excitement. The Solana blockchain provides low fees and lightning-fast transactions, making WIF highly efficient for trading. The project thrives on a dedicated, viral community reminiscent of early Dogecoin and Shiba Inu hype. While the ride has been exhilarating, meme coin volatility is real. However, Dogwifhat’s growing adoption and market traction suggest it’s not fading anytime soon. Those looking to join a meme coin with serious momentum should watch WIF as it sets new records. SPX6900: The Meme Coin That’s Mocking TradFi While Printing Profits For those who love wild returns and financial satire, SPX6900 (SPX) is a meme coin that delivers both. Exploding 60x in just one month, SPX has become the ultimate anti-establishment investment, mocking Wall Street while generating life-changing gains. SPX6900 taps into a unique market by blending financial satire with meme culture, attracting investors who love the chaos of meme coins but want something with a sharp, rebellious edge. The market cap recently surged to $480 million, proving this is more than just a fleeting meme. Viral marketing campaigns have cemented SPX as a cult-favorite among crypto traders, with many investors eager to ride its wave of success. Recent exchange listings have made it more accessible, increasing demand and market liquidity. As with any high-flying meme coin, risk is part of the game. Investors should stay updated and be strategic, as fast-rising tokens can correct sharply. But for those who love wild rides and huge upside potential, SPX6900 is a meme coin worth watching. Conclusion: The Meme Coin Gold Rush is Here Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo, Dogwifhat, and SPX6900 stand out as the top meme coins to join for the long term. Whether it’s the mythical adventure of Arctic Pablo, the viral surge of Dogwifhat, or the rebellious rise of SPX6900, these tokens offer unique opportunities for early investors to ride the next big wave.

BTFD Coin’s Presale at $0.00016 and High-Yield Staking Could Be the Next Big Move,https://thecoinrise.com/still-kicking-yourself-over-floki-inu-btfd-coins-presale-at-0-00016-and-high-yield-staking-could-be-the-next-big-move/,"The meme coin market has turned small bets into life-changing money, and nowhere was that more obvious than with Floki Inu’s explosive rally. What started as a simple meme coin named after Elon Musk’s dog quickly became a billion-dollar powerhouse. Early investors saw unreal returns, and many latecomers were left wondering—what if? But here’s the thing about meme coins: the biggest profits always come from getting in early. Now, a new challenger has arrived—BTFD Coin (BTFD)—and this time, you don’t have to sit on the sidelines. With a fully live Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, 90% APY staking rewards, and a Bulls Squad community that’s growing fast, BTFD is positioning itself as the next major meme coin breakout. With Stage 14 of the presale live at just $0.00016, this is one of the top new meme coins to join this weekend before it takes off. BTFD Coin’s P2E Game Is Changing the Meme Coin Game Most meme coins rely purely on hype and community strength, but BTFD Coin is bringing actual utility to the table. The P2E game, which launched on January 1, 2025, is already attracting players who are earning real crypto rewards while having fun. Think about it—instead of just holding a meme coin and hoping it pumps, BTFD lets you actively earn more tokens through gameplay. Players can battle, level up, and stack their $BTFD holdings just by playing the game. This isn’t just speculation—it’s an ecosystem designed for long-term engagement and demand. But that’s not all. BTFD also offers 90% APY staking, allowing holders to earn massive passive rewards while they wait for the token’s price to skyrocket. Let’s break this down with an example: If you invest $6,000 at the current price of $0.00016, you’ll own 37.5 million BTFD tokens. Now, let’s say you stake those tokens for one year at 90% APY—your holdings would grow to 71.25 million tokens. If BTFD reaches its projected $0.006 post-launch price, that would be worth $427,500. That’s not a dream—it’s a real possibility for early adopters who jump in before the presale ends. This is exactly why BTFD Coin is one of the top new meme coins to join this weekend before the next surge happens. Getting in early is simple: Download MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT, connect to the BTFD presale page , select the amount you want to invest, and confirm your purchase. Your tokens will be ready to claim before launch. Floki Inu’s Wild Ride—The One That Got Away? Floki Inu started as just another meme token inspired by Elon Musk, but what happened next was pure magic. The Floki community exploded, marketing campaigns went viral, and the token surged into the billions in market cap. Some investors made life-changing money, watching their $100 investments turn into $100,000 or more. The hype was real, the gains were insane, and many investors who hesitated early on were left regretting their decision. But as with all viral meme coins, the biggest wins went to those who got in early. Now, Floki Inu is still a solid project, but the days of 1000x returns are long gone. The real question now is—where’s the next opportunity? That’s why BTFD Coin is one of the top new meme coins to join this weekend—because it’s still in the early stages of its presale, meaning the biggest profits are yet to come. The Next Big Meme Coin Play Is Here—Are You Ready? If you watched Floki Inu moon without you, you’re probably not looking to make the same mistake twice. The truth is, meme coins with strong communities, real utility, and massive hype tend to explode—and right now, BTFD Coin is checking all those boxes. With a fully live P2E game, 90% APY staking, and a growing Bulls Squad community, the pieces are already in place. The only thing left is to secure your presale position before the price jumps higher. With $6.08 million raised, 69 billion tokens sold, and 10,700+ holders, the demand is already building fast. This isn’t a moment to sit back—this is your shot. The presale price of $0.00016 won’t last, and once BTFD hits the open market, the next wave of investors will have to pay much more to get in. So, don’t miss out and join BTFD Coin presale today . FAQs When will BTFD Coin officially launch? BTFD Coin is currently in Stage 14 of its presale, with a listing price of $0.0006. Investors can claim their tokens before the official listing and start earning rewards immediately. How much can I potentially make if BTFD Coin reaches its projected price? If you invest $6,000 at $0.00016, you will receive 37.5 million BTFD tokens. If the price reaches $0.006 post-launch, your holdings would be worth $427,500. Why is BTFD Coin considered one of the top new meme coins to join this weekend? BTFD Coin is still in its early presale stages, meaning investors can enter at a low price before the hype kicks in. With its live P2E game, 90% APY staking, and strong community, it has real utility and explosive growth potential.

Let’s start from the beginning. At exactly 10:01 PM UTC, Javier made a post on X announcing that $LIBRA was launching to “boost Argentina’s economy.” Source: The Kobeissi Letter Of course people weren’t sure if he was serious. Some thought his X account got hacked. Others assumed it was another political stunt. But then, many Argentine politicians confirmed it was real, so as per usual, retail traders dove in headfirst. Within minutes, $LIBRA hit a $4.6 billion market cap. The whole thing was ridiculous, as meme coins tend to be. There was no whitepaper, no tokenomics, no investor protections, just a basic, terrible-looking website that linked to a Google Form. The pitch on the website’s landing page was, and I quote, “Funding small projects to boost Argentina’s economy.” But the reality turned out to be a blatant liquidity trap. On-chain data showed the domain was registered hours before launch. No public owner. One-year registration. Multiple restricted domain statuses. Everything about this screamed cash grab. By the time people started asking questions, it was already too late. Insiders had drained $87.4 million within three hours, according to data from Bubblemaps. 82% of the supply sat in a single cluster. And then, the real dumping began. Insiders cashed out as retail traders took the hit At 10:40 PM UTC, $LIBRA hit its all-time high, and immediately, multiple large holders liquidated millions in minutes, with some pulling in $4 million+ each before the market even caught on. By press time, $LIBRA has fallen below $600,000 in market cap, meaning $4.59 billion is now gone. Yeesh! The selling was so aggressive that only 27% of transactions were actual sales. That means for every insider dumping millions, there were two retail traders panic-buying the dip. More than $1.1 billion in volume was traded, but by then, the only ones making money were the ones who got in before the public knew what hit them. Javier deleted his announcement tweet and tried to distance himself. Speaking in Spanish via a post on X, he said : “A few hours ago I posted a tweet, as I have so many other times, supporting a supposed private enterprise with which I obviously have no connection whatsoever. I was not aware of the details of the project and after having become aware of it I decided not to continue spreading the word (that is why I deleted the tweet). To the filthy rats of the political caste who want to take advantage of this situation to do harm, I want to say that every day they confirm how vile politicians are, and they increase our conviction to kick them in the ass.” The fallout didn’t stop with $LIBRA. Trump’s infamous meme coin, $TRUMP, lost $500 million in market cap overnight. The entire meme coin market bled out over $6 billion in the aftermath. More than 50,000 wallets held $LIBRA before the collapse, and most of them are worthless as of press time. On-chain analysts started digging into the wallets behind the biggest dumps. That’s when things got even darker. A notorious trader known as LeBron made $4.56 million in a single day from $LIBRA alone, according to data from Lookonchain. His wallet history goes like this: $8.9 million from $MELANIA, $3.2 million from $TRUMP, and $1 million from $HARRYBOLZ. His $LIBRA play was textbook. He bought 128.8 million tokens for $4,807.19 at an average price of $0.037 per token. Once the price surged, he offloaded in chunks, pocketing a multimillion-dollar return hours before the crash wiped everyone else out. Crypto Twitter calls out the scam—and the people behind it Traders weren’t quiet. Crypto Twitter exploded with accusations. One guy said, “This is how the CIA funds itself now. Meme coins are their bread and butter. Stay away from anything unverified and able to be rugged. PERIOD.” “Can we stop calling these rug pulls? Because by calling it that we are suggesting that it was unexpected,” another user said. One trader who was particularly furious posted that: “How the f*ck you ret*rds trust a nigga that look like Willy Wonka on a 5-day fenty bender? Y’all deserve to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. I don’t think it’s a good idea that presidents of countries launch meme coins.” Meanwhile, Solana investor Darky said , “Unpopular take but I think $LIBRA was what we needed to finish this meme coin shit meta. Every meme trader has been liquidated. Let the smart money move into alts and AI coins finally.” That wasn’t all. Moonshot listed $LIBRA before the launch and delisted it right after insiders dumped $100 million. Kelsier Venture, the company allegedly tied to $LIBRA’s creation, was linked to Arunkumar Sugadevan, a notorious Indian serial rug puller. His on-chain footprint connected him to $MELANIA, $ENRON, and OG.Fun—all of which had similar pump-and-dump histories, according to this one investor who said he and his friend lost over $2 million in $LIBRA. TRON founder Justin Sun also spoke out. Commenting under Javier’s post, Justin said: “I have great respect for President Milei. I believe that he should take some responsibility in this matter, urging the culprits to return the funds to the victims and assume the corresponding legal responsibilities. Protecting investors is a very serious legal duty, and we must take it seriously.” Javier built his entire political career on fighting corruption and government abuse. Now, his name is directly tied to the biggest meme coin rug pull in history. One trader called it out: “Javier made his whole campaign about stopping corruption and people abusing the government to drain resources. Then, once in power, he uses his political position to launch a token for his own personal benefit, to likely make 9 figs.” Others compared his “I had no idea” defense to previous celebrity rug pulls, especially after rap star Kanye West exposed an influencer a week ago. One user said: “Kanye posted an offer he refused. He promotes a rug pull. Then says his account was hacked after the rug. We saw the exact same play by Dean Norris. The same thing is done here ‘oops wasn’t me.’ Assange did it too. Rugged $55m from the DAO and blanked the community after.” The real question? Who was actually behind $LIBRA?

40381174,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=675534,1739659675,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40381174.jpeg,Strategy defies market trends as STRK and Bitcoin holdings surge,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/strategy-strk-and-bitcoin-holdings-surge/,"Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) preferred stock, STRK, had a record-breaking performance in its first two weeks. According to the company, STRK is now the best-performing out of 115 preferred stocks listed in the US since 2022. Per information shared on X, STRK is first in price performance with 19% more gains than the average preferred stock. It has also attracted more interest from investors, with a trading volume that is 7x the average. The company founder, Michael Saylor , also noted the stock’s strong performance, saying: “In the initial two weeks of trading, $STRK is the best performing and most liquid perpetual preferred security.” The performance highlights how well investors have taken to STRK despite earlier speculations from some analysts that it could fail to meet expectations. Barron’s analyst Andrew Bary had said in January that Strategy might have to cut the price of the stock offering by 8%. With STRK now doing better than expected, Coindesk senior analyst James Van Straten said he had contacted Barry about possibly updating his article. Another market expert noted that Barron’s take is not surprising because Wall Street underwriters usually want issuers to underprice deals so that they can appear as a big success in hindsight. STRK is Strategy’s Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock, a convertible preferred stock through which Strategy seeks to raise $250 million that will be spent on buying Bitcoin. The stock has a liquidation preference of $100 and can be converted into Class A common stock under certain conditions. Strategy continues positive performance despite BTC decline The performance of STRK highlights how Strategy has been performing positively this year despite Bitcoin itself struggling. The business intelligence turned Bitcoin company has seen a strong performance, with its stock up 16.61% year to date. By comparison, Bitcoin is only up 3.42% YTD, with the flagship asset stuck below $100,000 for almost two weeks. BTC’s struggles are due to several reasons, including macroeconomic factors such as inflation and tariffs, but Strategy, which positions itself as a Bitcoin company, has not seen much negative impact. Despite Strategy’s last two Bitcoin acquisitions costing more than BTC’s current price, investors seem to have a strong positive sentiment about Strategy’s position, which also spreads to STRK. There are no clear reasons for this, but the company has made several moves since the start of this year that show its focus on Bitcoin acquisition without diluting shareholder value. It is also expected to start applying the FASB accounting rules by 2025 Q1, which could boost its financials. Interestingly, the positive sentiments are not limited to Strategy but include other Bitcoin institutional investment products. Spot Bitcoin Exchange-traded funds (ETF) continue to see massive interest from institutional investors despite BTC’s current price struggles, showing how this group of investors perceive them. For instance, Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Company is BlackRock IBIT’s seventh largest known holder, with $461.23 million. Tudor Investment , the firm of legendary investor Paul Tudor James, also owns $426.9 million worth of IBIT shares. IBIT’s performance has stood out, particularly from other Bitcoin ETFs. Since Donald Trump became president, IBIT has only had two outflows, all worth a combined $50 million.

40385201,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=675070,1739660400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40385201.jpeg,Each of These 2 Penny Cryptos Will Yield Higher ROI Than Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) Combined,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/each-of-these-2-penny-cryptos-will-yield-higher-roi-than-ripple-xrp-and-cardano-ada-combined/,"Two names in the crypto market are currently challenging the dominance of established giants like Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA). Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rising decentralized finance (DeFi) project, are capturing investor attention with explosive growth potential. Dogecoin’s recent technical breakout signals a possible surge past $2, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters its presale phase at $0.01, promising early backers a 600% return at launch. Both tokens have high-reward opportunities poised to outperform traditional holdings, with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) particularly positioned for a 100x leap to $1 in 2025. Dogecoin (DOGE) Eyes Historic Rally Dogecoin trades at $0.25, but technical charts hint at a dramatic climb. A recent Elliott Wave analysis identifies a bullish pattern tracing back to Dogecoin’s 2021 peak. After months of sideways movement, DOGE shattered a critical resistance trendline in late 2024, signaling the end of its consolidation phase. Historically, such breakouts precede major price rallies. Adding fuel to the momentum, the Federal Reserve’s potential interest rate cuts could drive fresh capital into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. If Dogecoin surpasses $0.26, analysts anticipate a domino effect propelling it toward $2.43, an 860% increase from current levels. This trajectory positions DOGE not just as a meme-driven asset but as a legitimate competitor to top-tier cryptos. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Ignites Investor Frenzy While Dogecoin’s rise relies on market sentiment, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers tangible utility through its decentralized lending ecosystem. The project’s presale has already raised $465,878.05 from 710 holders in its opening phase, with tokens priced at $0.01. Early participants lock in a guaranteed 600% profit at launch, as MUTM’s listing price is set at $0.06. Beyond presale gains, experts forecast a surge to $1 post-launch, a 100x return, driven by platform adoption and tokenomics. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) distinguishes itself with a dual lending model: peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P). Lenders earn passive income by depositing assets like USDT into liquidity pools, while borrowers leverage crypto holdings as collateral without selling. This flexibility addresses a key DeFi pain point, attracting users seeking liquidity without sacrificing asset ownership. A buy-and-distribute mechanism further stabilizes MUTM’s value. A portion of platform fees automatically purchases tokens from the market, redistributing them to stakers. This creates constant demand, shielding the token from volatility. Combined with an upcoming overcollateralized stablecoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) integrates features typically seen in mature DeFi platforms. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Outshines Competitors Unlike Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA), which face regulatory hurdles and slow adoption, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates in the high-growth DeFi sector. Its presale success underscores market confidence, with the first phase nearing capacity. The $100,000 giveaway for early supporters amplifies urgency, incentivizing rapid participation before price increments in subsequent phases. The project’s roadmap includes a beta platform launch coinciding with its exchange debut, ensuring immediate utility upon listing. This operational readiness contrasts with rivals that often launch tokens before completing infrastructure. As transaction volume grows, so does demand for MUTM, creating a self-sustaining cycle of appreciation. Investors recognize the narrow window to secure MUTM at $0.01, the lowest price point. With each presale stage increasing the token cost, delaying entry risks missing the 600% launch gain. Post-launch, MUTM is set to skyrocket to $1, thanks to its scalable model, which aligns with rising DeFi adoption rates. The crypto market rarely offers opportunities with such defined upside. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represent different strategies, one capitalizing on technical trends, the other on foundational innovation, yet both share unmatched ROI potential. For investors seeking exponential returns, these tokens eclipse conventional options like XRP and ADA. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sets itself apart, merging DeFi utility with aggressive growth targets. Its opening presale phase, now 71% filled, is closing swiftly as investors rush to claim early positions. Secure MUTM at $0.01 before the next price hike, and position your portfolio for a record-breaking 2025.

The DeFi token rallied past the $10 mark in the final hours of Friday, February 14, reflecting the improving climate of the general crypto market. Uniswap Price Jumps 10% In The Past Week The UNI token was one of the beneficiaries of the bullish momentum that shook the market on Friday evening. As of this writing, the price of Uniswap stands at around $10.18, reflecting an over 3% increase in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin At Risk? Analyst Says Breaking This Price Level Could Spark Significant Volatility This single-day action pushed the Uniswap price performance in the last week to double digits; a nearly 11% climb according to data from CoinGecko. While things seem to be looking up for the altcoin, its performance on broader timeframes is still something to worry about. Due primarily to the recent drop beneath the $8 level, the price of UNI is down by almost 15% in the last two weeks and 30% in the past month. However, the Uniswap price appears to be gearing for a bullish breakout over the next few days. Here’s How UNI Price Could Reach $13 In a February 14 post on the X platform, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez put forward an exciting bullish outlook for the price of UNISWAP over the coming days. According to the crypto pundit, the DeFi coin could travel as high as $13 following the potential bullish breakout. The rationale behind this optimistic prediction is the formation of the Adam & Eve pattern on UNI’s hourly price chart. The Adam & Eve pattern is a technical analysis formation characterized by two distinct troughs (price swing lows). The first depression, Adam, is a sharp V-shaped dip, while the second trough, Eve, is marked by a more rounded, U-shaped bottom. This price formation is often a reversal indicator, suggesting a potential shift in market sentiment from bearish to bullish. However, it is most crucial after identifying an Adam and Eve pattern to wait for the confirmation of a bullish breakout. The bullish setup is validated once the asset’s price breaches and successfully closes above its highest high. In UNI’s current situation — as shown in the highlighted chart, the significant level to confirm the bullish breakout is around the $10.1 mark. According to Martinez, a successful close above this level could set the stage for a Uniswap price rally to $13 — about 30% from the current price point.

The crypto investment firm says the fund will be approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) next. Why Pantera Capital is Optimistic About Solana ETF Cosmo Jiang, General Partner, and Eric Wallach, Investment Analyst of Pantera Capital, noted this conclusion in their February 2025 Blockchain Letter issue. They cited an increase in developer and economic activity, rapid ecosystem growth, and the outstanding performance of SOL’s price fueling this optimism. For more perspective, these key industry players highlighted Solana’s emergence in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector. The blockchain suddenly became a dominant smart contracts platform when it became the leader in attracting new developers. In no time, Solana processed the largest volume of DEX trading and even outperformed Ethereum (ETH) in generated fees. Solana-based Products Trigger Positive Momentum in the Ecosystem Amongst other Decentralized Exchanges (DEXes), Solana’s flagship product, Raydium (RAY), also exceeded Uniswap (UNI) by a 30% increase in trading volume for two consecutive months. Considering Uniswap’s reputation as a dominant EVM DEX, this marked a significant win for Solana. Then there is Pump.fun, the reigning Solana memecoin launchpad, which keeps raising the bar. Pump.Fun broke records when it earned $100 million in revenue within 217 days. On January 24, it set a new milestone by amassing $15.38 million in daily fees, driven by Vine Coin. These records and the growing memecoin mania on the launchpad have contributed to Solana’s leadership in creating new tokens. Out of the new tokens launched in Q4 2024, the Solana blockchain welcomed more than 90%. Top Asset Managers Awaits SOL ETF Approval Some asset managers have pushed out their applications on the subject of Solana ETFs. In no particular order, Bitwise, VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital have filed their spot Solana ETF S-1 registration with the US SEC. More proactively, Cboe BZX Exchange has filed four 19b-4 proposals on their behalf. Before 2024 ended, Grayscale also submitted its application to convert its existing Grayscale Solana Trust into a spot Solana ETF.

40380765,https://thecoinrise.com/web3bay-rises-as-the-best-crypto-to-buy-among-whales-despite-cardanos-drop-dogecoins-status/,1739660457,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/40380765.jpeg,"Web3Bay Rises as the Best Crypto to Buy Among Whales, Despite Cardano’s Drop & Dogecoin’s Status",https://thecoinrise.com/web3bay-rises-as-the-best-crypto-to-buy-among-whales-despite-cardanos-drop-dogecoins-status/,"Cardano is currently weathering one of its toughest weekly downturns in months, plunging 25% in just a week. This downturn has investors pondering if ADA can bounce back or if it’s poised for further declines. Amidst ADA’s downturn, the crypto landscape observes a contrasting trend; notably, Dogecoin and Web3Bay whales are making significant plays. This shifting dynamic suggests that while ADA’s future looks uncertain, savvy investors are channeling funds into assets with more robust growth prospects. In this dynamic, Web3Bay is distinguishing itself, not merely as another speculative crypto but as a blockchain-driven solution poised to revolutionize a colossal industry—e-commerce. With its significant whale backing, over $1M in presale achievements, and its potential to upend major centralized commerce platforms, Web3Bay is emerging as the one of the best cryptos to buy now. Cardano’s 25% Drop—Is Recovery in Sight? Over the past week, ADA has seen a precipitous drop, dragging its market cap down to around $26 billion. Trading volumes have dipped by 35%, a sign that investor interest in ADA is waning as they look for more promising opportunities. The Average Directional Index (ADX) has risen to 41.6, solidifying ADA’s strong bearish momentum. A particularly alarming sign is the static whale activity; the count of wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million ADA hasn’t changed, indicating that major investors are not buying into the dip. This lack of significant support from whales suggests that ADA’s potential for a rapid recovery is diminishing, fueling concerns of further losses. Dogecoin Whales Gear Up—Is a Price Rally on the Horizon? Contrasting with ADA, Dogecoin is witnessing a spike in whale activity, suggesting that big players are positioning for an upcoming rally. Historical data shows that when whales start accumulating DOGE in significant amounts, a price surge often follows, positioning it as an asset to watch. While Dogecoin’s appeal has been largely speculative, backed by a robust community and its status among the most traded cryptocurrencies, it remains challenged by its dependence on social sentiment and meme appeal rather than substantive use cases. Even with potential whale-induced spikes, DOGE’s lack of practical applications could hinder its ability to sustain momentum over the long haul. Web3Bay: The Blockchain Innovator Attracting Big Investments The real headline in whale activity centers on Web3Bay, as substantial investments pivot towards this promising Web3 venture set to make waves in 2025. Unlike speculative altcoins reliant on market hype, Web3Bay is transforming online commerce by decentralizing it, removing intermediaries, and empowering users. As a project driven by its community, Web3Bay evolves in alignment with user needs, providing a genuine decentralized alternative to established commerce behemoths. Unlike ADA, which is battling to retain investor confidence, the increasing whale activity around Web3Bay signals strong belief in its long-term viability. With over $1M secured in its presale, Web3Bay has already showcased robust investor interest, a stark contrast to ADA’s current predicament. The substantial upside for early backers is highlighted by Web3Bay’s current token price of just $0.004562, presenting a significant undervaluation against its potential long-term worth. Should Web3Bay hit its targeted initial price of $0.1959, early investors could see an immediate 4,193% return. As demand surges and institutional money starts flowing in, projections suggest that Web3Bay might climb to $0.50 or more in 2025, potentially delivering a 10,000% ROI for early investors. Why Web3Bay Stands Out as the Optimal Crypto Investment Today The stark contrast between Cardano’s downturn and the vigorous accumulation around Web3Bay underscores where the real opportunity lies. While ADA investors grapple with uncertainty, astute investors are aligning with Web3Bay in anticipation of its breakout. While Dogecoin might lure short-term traders with its whale-driven surges, Web3Bay presents a sustainable value proposition beyond typical market cycles. With its decentralized commerce framework, burgeoning investor support, and demonstrated demand during the presale, Web3Bay is shaping up as one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025 . Far from being just speculative, Web3Bay represents a functional business model with a clear trajectory towards widespread adoption, marking it as the optimal investment as its presale concludes and market demand intensifies.

This move signals growing institutional interest in Cardano, with many speculating that approval could lead to a significant price rally. While ADA’s future looks bright, another crypto, PropiChain (PCHAIN) , is quickly gaining momentum. PCHAIN is a blockchain-powered real estate investment platform that experts believe could skyrocket 500x in just three weeks. How the Cardano ETF Could Impact the Market The Cardano ETF represents a huge milestone for ADA and the broader crypto industry. Exchange-traded funds provide institutional investors with a safe, regulated way to gain exposure to digital assets, leading to significant capital inflows. If the SEC gives it the green light, ADA could experience a price surge similar to what happened with Bitcoin after its ETF approval. Historically, ETF approvals have triggered massive rallies. When the Bitcoin ETF hit the market, BTC surged as mainstream investors jumped in. If the same happens for Cardano, ADA holders could see major gains. However, while Cardano ETF speculation is creating buzz, smart investors are also looking for crypto opportunities with even higher growth potential. That’s where PropiChain comes in. Why Investors Are Turning to PropiChain PropiChain offers real-world solutions by revolutionizing the real estate market with blockchain, AI, and tokenization. One of the biggest challenges in real estate investing is affordability. Traditional property investments require significant capital, but PropiChain makes it accessible to anyone. With its fractional ownership model, investors can purchase small shares of high-value properties instead of needing millions for full ownership. You can own a piece of a luxury apartment in New York with just a few hundred dollars. Beyond affordability, PropiChain’s AI-powered analytics help investors make smarter decisions. The platform uses machine learning to analyze market trends, identifying undervalued properties before they appreciate in value. It’s like having a personal investment advisor, but powered by data rather than speculation. Metaverse integration is another game-changer. As virtual real estate grows in value, PropiChain allows users to invest in digital properties within virtual worlds. Just like in the physical world, owning metaverse real estate can generate passive income through rentals, sponsorships, or resale opportunities. Additionally, PropiChain integrates DeFi tools like staking and lending, allowing investors to earn passive income. For example, users can stake their PCHAIN tokens to earn rewards or participate in lending pools, generating interest on their holdings. Another groundbreaking feature is that buying, selling, and trading property shares is seamless and transparent. If an investor wants to sell their share of a property, they can do so instantly through PropiChain’s marketplace, avoiding the lengthy paperwork of traditional real estate transactions. Security is also a major factor in PropiChain’s appeal. Unlike many emerging crypto projects, PropiChain has undergone a third-party security audi , ensuring its smart contracts and blockchain infrastructure are secure and reliable. Investors can trust that their assets are protected from potential vulnerabilities. Adding to its legitimacy, PropiChain has been listed on CoinMarketCap , a key milestone that boosts its visibility and credibility in the crypto space. These developments are fueling speculation that PropiChain could experience a parabolic price surge. The Investment Potential: How Much Can You Earn? With Cardano ETF approval on the horizon, ADA is expected to climb. However, PropiChain ’s presale offers an even bigger opportunity for those who get in early. Currently in stage 2 of its presale, PCHAIN is available at just $0.011 per token. A $500 investment today would be worth an incredible $250,000 if PropiChain reaches its projected 500x growth. A $1,000 investment could soar to $500,000. This is an extraordinary return that traditional markets simply can’t match. With institutional interest in blockchain-based real estate solutions growing, many believe PropiChain is the next crypto poised for a breakout. Cardano ETF and PropiChain; Two Massive Opportunities The potential approval of the Cardano ETF is a huge catalyst that could send ADA soaring, making it a smart bet for investors. But those looking for even higher returns are turning to PropiChain , a crypto that offers practical solutions, strong security, and the potential for 500x gains. Its CoinMarketCap listing and ongoing presale at $0.011 provide a rare opportunity to enter before a potential breakout. With projections of massive growth in the coming weeks, investors are positioning themselves now; before PropiChain becomes a mainstream success. For those seeking the next crypto opportunity, PropiChain could be the best bet; before the window closes.

While the administration claims the initiative has uncovered billions in fraudulent government spending, watchdog groups, state officials, and federal employees are now pushing back—some through lawsuits targeting Musk himself. Watchdogs say D.O.G.E. exposes waste but politicizes the issue For decades, government oversight experts have warned about waste, fraud, and abuse in federal spending, frustrated that Washington has ignored the problem. When President Donald Trump put Elon Musk in charge of fixing it, many hoped this would lead to real accountability. But watchdogs now say D.O.G.E. is creating more problems than solutions. “Elon Musk is saying we’ve got shocking amounts of fraud, and you’re right, we do. No one’s really cared until now,” said Linda Miller, a fraud prevention expert who previously worked for the Government Accountability Office (GAO). But Miller and others say Musk’s approach is reckless. One of D.O.G.E.’s first major reports highlighted government-funded arts projects linked to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, claiming them as examples of wasteful spending. Some of those projects, however, were never actually funded by the agencies Musk accused. “It makes the government sound like it’s a mockery,” Miller said. Despite the controversy, Trump is standing by Musk’s efforts, saying at a press briefing this week that D.O.G.E. had already identified ‘billions and billions of dollars’ in fraudulent spending. But the White House did not provide specific numbers to back up that claim. Musk targets government payments, calls system ‘insane’ One of D.O.G.E.’s biggest targets so far is the “Do Not Pay” system, a federal database meant to block fraudulent payments. The system is supposed to prevent payments to deceased individuals, sanctioned foreign nationals, and people barred from receiving federal funds. Musk blasted the outdated system in a post on X (formerly Twitter), saying the list of ineligible recipients wasn’t updated frequently enough and contained people supposedly still receiving benefits despite being 150 years old. “There’s crazy things, like, just a cursory examination of Social Security and we’ve got people in there that are about 150 years old,” Musk said in a press briefing on Wednesday. The scale of improper government payments is massive. In 2023 alone, the GAO reported that the federal government made an estimated $236 billion in improper payments, including overpayments, underpayments, and payments to ineligible recipients. “There is absolutely waste, fraud, and abuse, and there are improper payments, and there are inefficiencies,” said Dylan Hedtler-Gaudette, director of government affairs at the Project On Government Oversight, a nonpartisan watchdog group. “And they just come up with all kinds of reasons that basically come down to ‘It’s too hard, and we don’t want to do it.’” Musk is pushing for major updates to the “Do Not Pay” system, including automated fraud detection, real-time monitoring, and daily updates to prevent payments from slipping through the cracks. Lawsuits accuse Musk of wielding too much power Musk’s expanding role in federal government spending is now at the center of two major lawsuits. Legal challenges filed in Washington, D.C., and Maryland this week argue that Musk is exercising executive power without Senate confirmation, violating the Constitution’s Appointments Clause. D.O.G.E. was created through a Trump executive order—not through Congress—meaning it is not an official government agency. Despite that, Musk has been operating out of the White House, controlling federal budgets, and making key financial decisions. The first lawsuit, filed by a group of federal employees, accuses Musk of holding unprecedented power over federal operations. “His power includes, at least, the authority to cease the payment of congressionally approved funds, access sensitive and confidential data across government agencies, cut off systems access to federal employees and contractors at will, and take over and dismantle entire independent federal agencies,” the lawsuit states. A second lawsuit, filed by a coalition of state governments, argues that Musk’s unchecked authority is destabilizing government operations. They claim his role has created ‘mass chaos and confusion’ for state and local governments, federal employees, and the American people. Legal experts say these cases could escalate all the way to the Supreme Court, potentially determining whether a president has the power to appoint an unelected official to control federal spending without Senate approval. Musk takes over US Digital Services, fires staffers Musk’s latest move under D.O.G.E. has triggered another controversy—the firing of federal IT workers from the U.S. Digital Service (USDS), an agency that has provided IT and cybersecurity support to the government since the Obama administration. For weeks, USDS employees were left in limbo, unsure of their job status. But starting Friday, Musk’s team began issuing termination letters to staffers, citing Trump’s January 20 executive order that established D.O.G.E. The termination letters, sent from “U.S. DOGE SERVICE”, stated: “Due to the restructuring and changes to USDS’s mission, USDS no longer has need for your services.” More than a dozen employees have already been dismissed, according to two sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. The remaining USDS employees were separately told by the U.S. DOGE Service that they must report to a physical office by April 15. Before Musk’s takeover, USDS played a key role in modernizing government systems, including the revamp of the federal student aid portal when it crashed last year under the Department of Education. The White House and the Office of Management and Budget have not responded to requests for comment on the terminations and restructuring of USDS under D.O.G.E. D.O.G.E. has now put Musk at the center of one of the biggest government shakeups in decades. Federal agencies are being restructured, funding is being slashed, and lawsuits are mounting. Whether Musk’s take-no-prisoners approach will permanently reshape federal spending or collapse under legal challenges is still unclear. But one thing is certain—D.O.G.E. is disrupting Washington like nothing before.

In return, Moscow freed American schoolteacher Marc Fogel, who had been detained on drug charges. Vinnik’s Role in BTC-e and Legal Troubles Vinnik operated the BTC-e platform from 2011 to 2017 when he was arrested by police in Greece at the request of American law enforcement agencies. According to the U.S. Justice Department, the exchange processed transactions worth more than $9 billion across six years, much of which was allegedly tied to crimes such as ransomware attacks, drug trafficking, and identity theft. Authorities claim that BTC-e’s lack of anti-money laundering (AML) and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) policies made it attractive to cybercriminals. Vinnik was extradited to France in 2020 and sentenced to five years for money laundering. He was later sent back to Greece before finally being handed over to the Americans in 2022. In May 2024, the Russian pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering and faced up to 20 years in prison. During his trial, prosecutors accused Vinnik of facilitating over $120 million in losses and described BTC-e as a “significant cybercrime and online money laundering entity.” Millions of dollars worth of assets belonging to the platform were seized, including $90 million that authorities bagged in New Zealand. Additionally, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed a $120 million fine on the exchange, with Vinnik personally facing a $12 million penalty. A Long-Running Extradition Battle Before his transfer to the U.S., the 45-year-old had been at the center of an international legal battle involving France, Russia, and the United States. While Russia sought his extradition on lesser fraud charges amounting to just $11,000, France and the U.S. pursued him for broader financial crimes. In 2023, his lawyers tried to include him in a U.S.-Russia prisoner swap involving journalist Evan Gershkovich, but it was unsuccessful. His exchange for Fogel, an American teacher detained in Russia, marks a rare moment of cooperation between the two countries, especially coming against the backdrop of the ongoing Ukraine war. Vinnik will have to forfeit tens of millions of dollars in assets as part of the deal.

It also rewards early investors with referral bonuses , automated airdrops , yield farming opportunities, and staking rewards of up to 180% APY . Market Jitters: WallitIQ (WLTQ) Is The AI Coin Poised To Thrive As Ethereum Price Faces Pressure Beyond being a perfect hedge, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is on track for exponential growth. Its presale is rapidly selling out, with WLTQ currently priced at $0.0420 , a price that won’t last long, as the next stage will increase it to $0.0620. Investors who act now will secure their positions at the lowest possible price before WallitIQ (WLTQ) lists on top-tier exchanges, which is expected to drive even greater demand. In terms of innovation, WallitIQ (WLTQ) recently launched its MVP (Minimum Viable Product) mobile app, an intuitive crypto wallet management tool. This AI-powered app allows everyday payment through a Scan & Pay QR feature, provides real-time crypto pricing, and supports easy multi-wallet management.

It also boasts other security features like AES & ECC encryption, Escrow Connect, AI-powered analog alt detection, and a sophisticated P2D technology that makes identity verification easier while protecting users’ private data. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Presale Still At $0.0420: ThIs Is The Perfect Time To Place Your Bets The ETH price volatility is pushing Ethereum whales and other investors to find alternatives, and WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) AI coin has emerged as the perfect hedge. With its low presale price of $0.0420 , its holistic ecosystem, low fees, tokenomics, and early investor rewards, Ethereum whales are recognizing this AI coin as the solution to ongoing market volatility. The presale window for this AI coin is closing fast with prices set to increase soon. Those who act now will secure a position at the lowest price before it hits top-tier exchanges while those who hesitate will either pay more or lose out completely.

With a staggering $195.5 million raised in its presale, currently in batch 27 at a price of $0.0248 per BDAG coin, representing a 2,340% increase from its initial batch, and over 18.5 billion coins already circulating, the project is generating considerable excitement. This success story is interwoven with the expertise of advisors like Dr. Maurice Herlihy, a luminary in distributed computing. This article will examine Herlihy’s influence on BlockDAG and explore the technology’s potential. The original focus on BlockDAG’s architecture remains but with a fresh perspective. The Architect of Decentralization: Dr. Maurice Herlihy’s BlockDAG Blueprint Dr. Maurice Herlihy isn’t just another name on BlockDAG’s team; he is a force in computer science and distributed computing. His academic credentials, including an A.B. in Mathematics from Harvard and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from M.I.T., speak to his deep understanding of the field. His experience spans prestigious institutions like Carnegie Mellon University and DEC Cambridge Research Lab, where his work has significantly impacted how we understand and build distributed systems. Herlihy’s contributions aren’t just theoretical; they’re the foundation upon which scalable and secure decentralized networks, like BlockDAG, are built. A Legacy of Innovation: Herlihy’s Awards and BlockDAG’s Foundation Herlihy’s recognition within the scientific community is extensive. He received the Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing not once, but twice (2003 and 2012), a testament to his lasting impact. The Gödel Prize (2004), the ISCA Influential Paper Award (2008), and the Wallace McDowell Award (2013) further solidify his position as a leader in distributed systems research. These accolades highlight his ability to craft systems that empower decentralized computing, smart contracts, and efficient validation – crucial elements for any blockchain, especially BlockDAG. His involvement with BlockDAG ensures the project’s architecture is rooted in proven research and technical mastery. Fortifying BlockDAG’s Core: Security, Efficiency, and Scalability BlockDAG’s future hinges on its ability to scale without compromising security or decentralization. Here, Herlihy’s expertise is indispensable. He contributes to refining consensus protocols, improving smart contract performance, and streamlining transaction validation. His research in parallel processing and concurrency control directly informs BlockDAG’s drive to boost transaction throughput, tackling the bottlenecks that often plague conventional blockchains. With Herlihy’s guidance, BlockDAG is developing a network designed for both security and efficiency, making it a viable option for high-volume uses like decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and enterprise solutions. His presence gives developers and institutions seeking a balanced blockchain confidence in BlockDAG’s technical foundation. BlockDAG: A New Paradigm in Distributed Ledger Technology BlockDAG represents a departure from the traditional blockchain structure. Instead of a linear chain of blocks, BlockDAG uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This allows for parallel transaction processing, greatly improving scalability and efficiency. Imagine a network where transactions aren’t processed one after the other but can occur concurrently. This is the power of BlockDAG. This architecture is at the heart of BlockDAG’s potential. It allows the network to handle an increased volume of transactions, a critical requirement for widespread adoption. The enhanced throughput and quicker confirmation times are attractive features for various uses, from micro-payments to real-time trading. BlockDAG’s consensus mechanisms ensure network integrity and thwart malicious activity, preserving the security of the transaction network. Although a relatively new technology, BlockDAG offers substantial promise. As development progresses, it could become a cornerstone of decentralized applications. The $195.5 Million Question: What Drives BlockDAG’s Presale Success? BlockDAG’s presale success is undeniable. The $195.5 million raised, the batch 27 price of $0.0248 (a 2,340% increase), and the sale of over 18.5 billion coins point to significant market interest. This isn’t just about hype; it’s about recognizing the potential of a blockchain supported by experts like Herlihy. His contributions to distributed computing provide a level of assurance that resonates with those seeking promising opportunities in the digital asset space. The Future of Decentralization: BlockDAG’s Trajectory Herlihy’s understanding of decentralized computing is a key asset for BlockDAG’s development team. His advisory role helps shape the project’s roadmap, ensuring its infrastructure is built for long-term growth and adaptability. His combined academic and practical experience in distributed computing makes him an invaluable resource for BlockDAG’s leadership. As blockchain technology evolves, having an advisor of Herlihy’s stature positions BlockDAG as a project built on solid research and technical principles. His involvement strengthens the project’s credibility and ensures BlockDAG continues to be a key player in the development of decentralized technologies.

According to experts, the crypto AI rally has yet to begin, but when it does, these 3 projects will absolutely dominate. However, from these 3 cryptos AI, one is at its lowest price ever, meaning that it has the biggest growth potential. Of course, we’re talking about RCO Finance, a new SolidProof audited financial platform that hasn’t even launched on crypto exchanges yet! RCO Finance Emerges as the Leader of the 3 Cryptos AI Even though all the 3 cryptos AI on this list are quite promising, none can compare with RCO Finance. That’s because RCO Finance brings crypto AI features unlike we’ve seen before, ones that can completely change the cryptos AI landscape and usher in a new era in trading and investing. And RCO Finance has already shown us its revolutionary nature during its presale. Namely, unlike most other crypto AI projects that wait until after the launch to offer a product or service, RCO Finance is doing it as the presale takes place! It recently launched its Beta Platform , allowing investors to see what it offers before investing in the presale. This is a revolutionary move, as investors don’t have to “go in blind” and wait until launch for something tangible anymore. Anyone can now access the Beta Platform and see what it offers, and so far, the reactions are amazing. The Beta Platform offers an incredibly intuitive dashboard, making trading/investing much simpler than before. It also allows people to trade/invest in over 120,000 assets from one place, allowing them to finally waste time moving between multiple platforms. Furthermore, users can manage multiple crypto wallets on one dashboard, making asset management a breeze. And if all that wasn’t enough, RCO Finance is a non-KYC platform, removing all the obstacles that users usually have to go through on legacy trading platforms! But that’s not all. RCO Finance’s true power can be seen through its innovative AI Robo Advisor. This is a groundbreaking crypto AI tool that takes AI-based trading and investing to unprecedented levels. Namely, the AI Robo Advisor creates sophisticated investment strategies for all RCO Finance users, tailoring them to their requirements. In order to do that, the AI Robo Advisor first gathers info on each user’s financial goals, risk tolerance, and market preferences. It then combines this with historical market trends, current data, and TA. As a result, the AI Robo Advisor creates a tailored and data-driven strategy for every single RCO Finance user. Moreover, it digests real-time financial info from trusted global sources like Bloomberg and Reuters and injects it directly into users’ trades. With this, RCO Finance users are able to make money in all market conditions! And again, that’s not all! Namely, the AI Robo Advisor also catches potential crypto runners early, helping you make life-changing gains on a weekly basis. So, with it, you can now catch coins like PROUD, which went from a $630K MC to a $26 million MC in just a few hours! So, with all of these amazing features under its belt, it’s really not a surprise that experts see RCO Finance as the most promising contender out of all cryptos AI in the market! FET Might Be Going to $5 Soon FET is among the most popular cryptos AI in the market. As such, experts say that it’ll bring in massive returns during the 2025 crypto AI run. As for now, FET is currently recovering from the recent market crash, and it’s already doing better than many other crypto coins. Namely, FET is at $0.77 right now, up by 2.55% in one week. This is very bullish for FET, as it shows that it has started to recover from the crash. With all this in mind, experts say that this is a great buying level for FET, as they expect FET to reach $5 by year-end. Driven by the cryptos AI run and the larger-scale AI boom we’re seeing, FET represents a very promising long-term coin. And when FET reaches $5, it’ll bring an ROI of 549% for current buyers! GRT Is Rising Steadily Toward $1.50 The Graph is another great cryptos AI contender that’s set to perform extremely well in 2025. Driven by the crypto AI run, experts see GRT as a great long-term hold from here. Right now, GRT is trading around $0.14, up by 5.54% in one week. So, like FET, The Graph is also showing great strength right now, as its recovery has already started. Also, 88% of The Graph community is bullish on GRT, which is another great sign. Experts see this as a great buying level for GRT, as they say that positive market conditions can take The Graph to $1.50 by year-end. So, by investing in GRT now, you’ll be able to make an ROI of 971% by year-end! This is nearly a 10x rise for current The Graph buyers. This is massive for GRT, but it still doesn’t come close to what RCO Finance offers. Still, it makes The Graph a great contender among the best cryptos AI right now! >>> BUY RCOF NOW RCOF: A Life-Changing 1,000x Investment Potential While FET and The Graph have massive rallies ahead, they can’t compete with RCOF. That’s because, thanks to its amazing crypto AI tools, RCOF has the potential to lead cryptos AI this year. Also, RCOF is still in its presale, which means that it hasn’t even had its first rally yet. So, right now, you can invest in RCOF in Stage 5 of its presale at $0.1. However, you’d need to hurry, because the RCOF presale is selling out very fast. Once Stage 5 ends, RCOF’s price will increase, and this will continue until RCOF launches at $0.4-$0.6. After the launch, RCOF’s first-ever rally is set to begin, right as the cryptos AI trend starts. With this in mind, experts say that RCOF can surge by 1,000x by mid-2025, bringing life-changing gains to early adopters. Also, RCOF is set to rise even more by year-end and beyond!

More Chainlink & Dogecoin Market Performance,https://thecoinrise.com/web3bay-presale-heats-up-stage-4-nears-sell-out-more-chainlink-dogecoin-market-performance/,"Is Chainlink’s Latest Move a Key Shift for DeFi? What Lies Ahead for Dogecoin’s Bullish Run? Chainlink (LINK) continues to gain traction in decentralized finance (DeFi), with its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) boosting adoption. The LINK price remains steady as CCIP expands across more platforms. Meanwhile, Dogecoin’s bullish momentum stays focused, driven by speculation on future integrations and increased whale activity. As these two projects make headlines, another rising sector—Web3 e-commerce—is capturing attention. Online shopping is evolving toward decentralization, and Web3Bay is at the forefront by cutting out middlemen and empowering users with full control of their transactions. Its blockchain-powered platform ensures transparency and lowers costs, making it a standout in Web3 e-commerce. With solid support from the crypto community, Web3Bay’s presale offers an early entry into this growing space. Web3Bay Revolutionizes E-commerce with Blockchain– Presale Hits $1.18M Online shopping is moving away from centralized systems that control user transactions and charge high fees. Web3 e-commerce offers buyers and sellers greater control, using blockchain to secure payments, lower costs, and provide transparency. Decentralized platforms are reshaping e-commerce by eliminating middlemen and allowing direct transactions between users. Web3Bay stands out in this space by offering a secure, blockchain-based marketplace where users benefit from reduced fees and faster processing times. All transactions are verifiable on-chain, ensuring transparency and eliminating fraud. Shoppers can access discounts when using the 3BAY token, giving real utility from the start. Unlike traditional marketplaces, Web3Bay puts the power back in the hands of its users. The presale has raised over $1.18 million so far, with buyers securing early access at $0.004562625 per 3BAY token. Web3Bay is on track to become a significant player in decentralized commerce, bringing the same efficiency to e-commerce that Chainlink brings to DeFi. Chainlink Maintains Strong Position with Cross-Chain Expansions Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) continues to grow in adoption, helping its LINK price hold steady. More platforms are integrating Chainlink to enable secure cross-chain transactions, making it essential for decentralized applications. Corn, an Ethereum Layer-2 solution focused on Bitcoin, recently adopted CCIP, further boosting Chainlink’s role in blockchain interoperability. Additionally, Chainlink has partnered with Ripple to improve stablecoin pricing data for RLUSD, expanding its use cases. These moves are positioning Chainlink as a vital part of DeFi, proving its value far beyond price speculation. Dogecoin Bullish Momentum Keeps Traders Alert Dogecoin’s bullish momentum remains strong as it holds above $0.26, despite recent market fluctuations. Whale activity and speculation about future integrations continue to attract interest. However, losing key support levels could trigger a short-term correction. Dogecoin is gaining more attention in traditional finance. Grayscale Investments recently launched the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust, making DOGE more accessible to accredited investors. On the political front, the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), co-led by Elon Musk, has sparked new discussions about Dogecoin’s role. Final Thoughts Chainlink’s expanding integrations keep its LINK price stable, making it a key technology in DeFi. Meanwhile, Dogecoin’s bullish trend remains strong, driven by growing adoption and speculation around future developments. Both projects continue to prove their relevance in the evolving crypto market. In contrast, Web3 e-commerce is reshaping how we buy and sell online. Web3Bay’s blockchain-based platform eliminates intermediaries, reduces costs, and gives users full control over their transactions. With over $1.18 million raised so far, Web3Bay is following in Chainlink’s footsteps—bringing blockchain efficiency to e-commerce and offering a shopping experience built for the future.

On-chain data trends show increased retail activity on the XRP ledger network could see XRP price hold relatively high support levels as euphoria from SEC acknowledging XRP and DOGE etfs subsides. Ripple (XRP) Racks Up 22% Gains in 5 Consecutive Days in Green Ripple (XRP) was among the standout performers in the crypto markets this week, outperforming Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum (ETH) as it surged 22% over five consecutive days. This rally was fueled by two major catalysts: Ripple’s decision to drop charges against XRP and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledging an XRP spot ETF filing. The combination of favorable regulatory developments and rising investor sentiment triggered a notable influx of capital into XRP. XRP Price Action, Feb 15 2025 The Ripple price chart above illustrates its impressive rally, climbing from an opening price of $2.40 on Monday, Feb. 10, to a peak of $2.84 by Saturday, Feb. 15. This sustained upward momentum has propelled XRP’s market capitalization above $155 billion at press time. The five consecutive daily green candles indicate a strong bullish trend, suggesting that demand remains robust even as broader market sentiment stabilizes following the SEC’s latest regulatory actions. Historically, such sustained upward movements have signaled an extended bullish phase. If current momentum holds, XRP could see further upside potential, with the next key resistance levels forming near the $3.00 psychological threshold. However, traders will be closely watching whether XRP can maintain support levels in case of profit-taking in the coming days. Retail Demand Drives up XRP Ledger Blockchain Network Activity by 39% While much of the media attention has focused on the SEC’s acknowledgment of the XRP spot ETF filing and Ripple dropping charges against XRP, on-chain data suggests another key bullish factor at play: a significant rise in network activity. CryptoQuant ’s Active Addresses chart, which tracks the daily number of unique addresses executing transactions, indicates a sharp rise in user engagement on the XRP Ledger. Typically, an increase in active addresses suggests growing retail interest, as individual traders transact more frequently. Ripple (XRP) Exchange Reserves | Source: CryptoQuant The chart above reveals that active addresses surged 39%, rising from 24,272 on Feb. 5 to 33,801 on Feb. 14. This increase in network activity coincides with XRP’s price rally, indicating that the current bullish trend is being driven by organic retail demand rather than isolated whale movements. When a rally is accompanied by heightened retail participation, it tends to establish firmer support levels, reducing the likelihood of an abrupt price correction. This trend suggests that XRP’s price surge is not merely speculative but supported by a broader user base. With heightened transaction activity backing the price rally, XRP could maintain relatively strong support even as market euphoria surrounding the SEC’s acknowledgment cools down. XRP Price Forecast: Bulls to Hold $2.50 Support if Rally Stalls XRP’s 22% price surge has positioned it within a strong technical uptrend, currently trading at $2.77. The chart signals a bullish structure, with XRP hovering above key moving averages and consolidating gains. The 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $2.68 now acts as immediate support, reinforcing the bullish outlook. Additionally, the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) at $2.77 suggests that XRP is trading near its fair market value, indicating stability in buying momentum. If bulls sustain price action above this level, XRP could look to retest the $2.84 resistance, with an extended breakout paving the way for a potential move toward the $3.00 mark. XRP Price Forecast Conversely, a failure to maintain current levels could see XRP test lower support zones. The 100-day SMA, currently positioned near $2.50, represents a crucial defensive line for bulls. A drop below this threshold could signal a loss of momentum, exposing XRP to a retracement toward the $2.30 region, where stronger buying interest is likely to reemerge. Overall, XRP remains in a bullish posture as long as it maintains support above $2.50. The ongoing surge in retail participation and positive regulatory catalysts provide strong tailwinds, though traders should remain cautious of potential profit-taking at key resistance zones.

Every cycle, a new viral token emerges, turning early investors into winners while latecomers are left wondering what they missed. In 2024, Just A Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) became one of the biggest surprises in the market, skyrocketing in value thanks to its strong community and viral appeal. But the next breakout meme coin is already here—and smart investors aren’t waiting this time. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is stealing the spotlight, with its Bulls Squad becoming one of the most exclusive and rewarding communities in crypto. With a record-breaking presale, exclusive Bulls Squad benefits, and unmatched investment potential, analysts are calling it one of the best new meme coins to invest in for short term . BTFD Coin’s Bulls Squad Is the Exclusive Club Everyone Wants In BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme token—it’s a community-driven ecosystem designed to reward its holders through multiple income streams. At the heart of this success is the Bulls Squad, an exclusive investor community that offers early access to premium staking rewards, private investment discussions, and lucrative referral bonuses. With its strong focus on Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming, staking, and community-building, BTFD Coin is quickly gaining traction among serious investors looking for high-ROI opportunities. It’s no surprise that analysts are calling it one of the best new meme coins to invest in for short term, given the huge earning potential for early adopters. Unlike most meme coins that offer little beyond speculation, BTFD Coin is creating real value for its holders through the Bulls Squad. This elite group grants members access to premium staking rewards, private community discussions, and exclusive investment insights before the rest of the market catches on. It’s a meme coin investment strategy designed for long-term profitability. Imagine purchasing $5,000 worth of BTFD tokens during the presale and securing an early stake in the Bulls Squad. With premium staking rewards and insider investment knowledge, those holdings could grow exponentially before BTFD even hits major exchanges. By the time BTFD Coin reaches its listing price of $0.0006, that initial investment would already be worth $18,750. If the projected moon price of $0.006 is hit, that same investment could be worth $187,500, proving the Bulls Squad is a direct gateway to high-ROI opportunities. With over $6.05 million raised and 69 billion tokens sold, BTFD Coin’s presale is one of the most explosive in the meme coin space. Currently in Stage 14, BTFD Coin is priced at $0.00016 per token, but that won’t last much longer. Once the presale ends, BTFD Coin will list at $0.0006, and analysts predict it could skyrocket to $0.006 soon after. With the Bulls Squad growing rapidly, the P2E game already live, and staking rewards in full effect, BTFD Coin is being called one of the best new meme coins to invest in for short term—but only for those who act fast. Buying BTFD Coin is fast and easy. Investors need to set up a MetaMask or Trust Wallet and fund it with BNB, ETH, or USDT. Once their wallet is ready, they can visit the official BTFD presale page , connect their wallet, select the amount of BTFD tokens they wish to purchase, and confirm the transaction. After the presale ends, tokens can be claimed, and investors can start staking for maximum gains. With each presale stage selling out rapidly, now is the time to secure a position in one of the best new meme coins to invest in for short term before prices rise. Just A Chill Guy’s Explosive Rise—What Comes Next? Just A Chill Guy started as an under-the-radar meme coin, but it didn’t take long before the project exploded onto the scene. As crypto communities picked up on its potential, word spread across social media like wildfire. Influencers, traders, and meme enthusiasts fueled the hype, and Just A Chill Guy quickly became a trending sensation. Its lighthearted branding and strong community backing made it a favorite among retail investors, leading to a surge in demand and skyrocketing prices. Momentum was at an all-time high as trading volumes spiked, and early adopters saw their portfolios multiply. Some investors managed to ride the wave to massive profits, with returns of 10X, 50X, and even 100X for those who got in at the right time. But as with all viral meme coins, the market moved fast. Latecomers hoping for another surge found themselves chasing the pump, only to watch the hype fade. The biggest winners were those who recognized the opportunity before it became mainstream, proving once again that timing is everything in the meme coin market. With Just A Chill Guy’s rally behind them, investors are now looking for the next big meme coin before it takes off. Many are turning their attention to BTFD Coin, recognizing the same early-stage momentum that fueled previous meme coin booms. Unlike hype-driven tokens, BTFD Coin’s Bulls Squad offers real value, positioning it as one of the best new meme coins to invest in for short term. As the presale moves into its final stages, the next wave of high-growth investors is already securing their positions—because in crypto, the biggest gains always go to those who act early. Final Thoughts If Just A Chill Guy token’s meteoric rise showed us anything, it’s that waiting on the sidelines leads to missed profits. BTFD Coin’s Bulls Squad is the next exclusive opportunity, offering investors early staking rewards, premium investment insights, and the chance to be part of the next major meme coin success story. With a record-breaking presale, elite community benefits, and insane profit potential, BTFD Coin is quickly becoming one of the best new meme coins to invest in for short term. The only question is—will you secure your spot in the Bulls Squad, or will you be watching from the sidelines again? Don’t miss out and join the BTFD Coin presale today . FAQs What is the Bulls Squad, and why should I join?

Santiment tracks the number of altcoin transactions worth more than $100,000, which it considers “whale transactions.” The firm subsequently identifies which altcoins clock the biggest percent changes in whale transactions week over week. This week, Fasttoken ( FTN ) topped Santiment’s list with a staggering 600% increase in whale transaction count (TC). FTN is the native token of the layer-1 Bahamut blockchain, which utilizes a unique consensus mechanism called Proof of Stake and Activity (PoSA). Explains the project’s whitepaper, “Proof-of-stake systems preach that the higher stake you have, the more ‘voting power’ you get. However, when considering a fair block creation reward distribution environment, it’s not fair to give the higher chance to the node that is simply ‘faster’ or ‘richer.’ Rather, we give the priority to the node that brings value to others by deploying smart contracts (or in other words creating apps) that users interact with. We have developed a variation of the proof-of-stake consensus, which involves taking into account the users’ activity with a smart contract (the software program that underlies any blockchain-based application) in addition to the stake, whenever considering the chance to become a block validator.” FTN, the 66th-ranked crypto asset by market cap with a $1.691 billion valuation, is trading at $3.94 at time of writing.

40385003,https://thecoinrise.com/stellar-major-traders-consider-web3bay-the-best-crypto-to-buy/,1739667629,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/40385003.jpeg,Stellar & Toncoin Not the Best Bets as They Face Decline; Major Traders Consider Web3Bay the Best Crypto to Buy,https://thecoinrise.com/stellar-major-traders-consider-web3bay-the-best-crypto-to-buy/,"Crypto markets are currently experiencing another period of high volatility. Stellar (XLM) has seen a 21% decrease year-to-date, indicating ongoing downward trends, while Toncoin (TON) has fallen 20% as it tries to find stability. Both cryptocurrencies are affected by a negative market outlook, with technical analysis suggesting potential additional declines. In contrast, the Web3Bay (3BAY) presale is thriving, with over $1.18 million raised and 300 million tokens sold. Differing from XLM and TON, Web3Bay addresses real issues in the vast e-commerce sector, marking its presale performance as notably robust. Stellar’s Price Falls 21% YTD: Potential Decrease Ahead Stellar (XLM) has decreased by 21.75% year-to-date, with the current price at $0.33 amid strong bearish trends. The occurrence of a death cross in the daily chart, where the 50-day EMA moves above the 20-day EMA, suggests a risk of extended losses. This chart pattern is typically a sign of further corrections, and investors are keeping an eye on critical support levels. Furthermore, the decrease in Stellar’s Sharpe ratio from 4.21 to 3.21 over the past month indicates a less favorable risk-to-reward scenario. The decline in open interest in XLM futures below $100 million also shows a drop in market confidence and a possible continuation of selling pressure. Should current trends continue, Stellar’s price might reduce another 35% to $0.22. Conversely, a rise above $0.38 could lead to a recovery, pushing prices towards $0.52. Toncoin Drops 20% – Chance to Buy or Expect More Decline? Toncoin (TON) has recorded a 90-day loss exceeding 20%, showing market instability and a growing bearish outlook. Trading at about $3.85, TON is struggling to overcome key resistance at the 50 and 100-period EMAs, currently at $4.25 and $4.57. A failure to surpass these levels could lead to further price drops. Previous patterns have shown that significant price drops in Toncoin have been buying opportunities for long-term investors. For instance, during the 2022 downturn, TON plummeted by 61% but then substantially recovered. Although the current decrease is not as steep, cautious investment is advised, especially with a 34% drop in trading volume. Web3Bay: Transforming Decentralized E-Commerce Web3Bay is transforming the trillion-dollar e-commerce industry by removing intermediaries, giving users complete control of their transactions. Unlike centralized platforms such as Amazon and eBay, which have high fees and restrictive policies, Web3Bay utilizes blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and cost efficiency. The 3BAY token facilitates transactions within the ecosystem, enabling buyers and sellers to interact directly, thus reducing fees and offering direct governance through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). A key feature of Web3Bay is its smart contract renouncement after the presale, ensuring no centralized authority can control the platform. This level of decentralization is uncommon in e-commerce and positions Web3Bay as a pioneer in online transactions. The project has successfully raised over $1.18 million and sold 300 million tokens in its presale. Presently, the 3BAY token is priced at $0.00456 in Stage 4, with an anticipated launch price of $0.1959, presenting an impressive 4,200% ROI for early backers. As blockchain technology becomes more widespread, Web3Bay is emerging as the hottest crypto to buy in February, offering tangible utility, staking rewards, and a community-driven marketplace. With an increasing demand for decentralized solutions, Web3Bay is set to revolutionize online shopping in 2025 and beyond. The Bottom Line While Stellar and Toncoin struggle with downward trends and uncertain futures, Web3Bay is advancing with successful crypto presale and practical applications. The stark contrast between the declining interest in XLM and TON and the booming demand for Web3Bay is evident. For those searching for the best crypto to buy in February, Web3Bay presents the greatest potential for growth with practical utility, staking benefits, and decentralized governance. As the market begins to recover, 3BAY stands out as a leading choice, poised to reshape the e-commerce landscape on the blockchain in 2025 and onward.

With the tokens supporting everyday crypto payments through its Scan & Pay QR feature and a deflationary supply model, a $200 WallitIQ (WLTQ) price prediction becomes less of a fantasy and more of an inevitability. Why The Low Presale Price Is WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Key To Soaring Future Gains WallitIQ (WLTQ) is currently in its presale phase at an incredibly low price of $0.0420 , but savvy investors understand that this won’t last long.

However, with these meme coins’ prices stabilizing, their biggest investors are now searching for the next explosive altcoin to multiply their wealth. PropiChain (PCHAIN) is emerging as the best low-priced altcoin, with a 22,000% growth prediction. Currently priced at just $0.011, PropiChain is offering an early-entry opportunity similar to what Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) once provided Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Struggles After Hitting Resistance Dogecoin (DOGE) has been one of the biggest success stories in crypto. However, DOGE has struggled to maintain its momentum. Currently, Dogecoin is trading at $0.254, down 65.28% from its all-time high. Despite periodic spikes in price, DOGE has remained range-bound, unable to break past the $0.26 resistance level for weeks. While Dogecoin (DOGE) still has a loyal community, investors are increasingly looking for new altcoins with higher upside potential. Many Dogecoin millionaires are now moving their funds into PropiChain (PCHAIN), believing its real-world use case could lead to significant long-term gains. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Faces Volatility as Millionaires Look Elsewhere Shiba Inu (SHIB) followed Dogecoin’s path but gained even more momentum, delivering an impressive surge in 2021. However, as the hype around meme coins cools down, SHIB has faced significant sell-offs. Right now, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.00001579, which is 81% below its all-time high of $0.000086. With meme coin growth slowing, many Shiba Inu (SHIB) millionaires are looking for altcoins with long-term viability. This is where PropiChain’s blockchain-backed real estate model is catching attention, offering a completely different kind of investment potential. PropiChain (PCHAIN): The Cheap Altcoin Set for a 22,000% Rally While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) rely on community-driven price movements, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is backed by real-world utility. The global real estate market is worth over $634 trillion, yet most investors struggle to enter due to high costs and legal barriers. PropiChain solves this issue by tokenizing real estate assets, allowing anyone to buy fractional shares of properties just like they would trade crypto. Instead of needing hundreds of thousands of dollars to invest in real estate, PropiChain makes it possible with as little as $500. Using AI-driven market analytics, PropiChain (PCHAIN) also provides automated property valuations and investment recommendations, giving users data-backed insights for smarter real estate decisions. The platform’s metaverse integration allows investors to explore digital versions of properties, attend real estate events, and even complete transactions online. PropiChain has successfully passed a full security audit by BlockAudit, confirming its smart contract security and transaction reliability and is officially listed on CoinMarketCap, increasing its visibility and credibility within the broader crypto market. These milestones make PropiChain (PCHAIN) one of the most promising early-stage altcoins, drawing in investors who are looking for a secure, long-term investment opportunity. What A 22,000% ROI Means For Investors With the PCHAIN token currently priced at $0.011, the potential for massive returns is significant. This means that a $1,000 investment today would be worth $220,000, If PropiChain hits its 22,000% projection. Given its real-world application, AI-powered analytics, and blockchain-backed real estate model, DOGE and SHIB millionaires believe this projection is more than possible, as they buy into this cheap altcoin. PropiChain (PCHAIN) Is The Best Altcoin for Dogecoin & Shiba Inu Investors Dogecoin and Shiba Inu proved that early investments in undervalued altcoins can deliver exponential returns. However, with their biggest price surges already behind them, many of their wealthiest investors are now shifting to PropiChain (PCHAIN) . With its AI-powered real estate investment platform, tokenization, and metaverse integration, PropiChain is set to disrupt a trillion-dollar industry. Unlike meme coins, it offers real utility, strong fundamentals, and institutional-level investment appeal. At just $0.011 per token, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is still in its early-stage presale. This is a rare chance to buy before prices surge, secure your investment today!

On-chain data shows a $16 billion decline in ETH whale transaction volumes could title momentum in favor of the bears. Ethereum (ETH) Flatlines at $2,700 as Bulls and Bears Lock Horns Ethereum (ETH) price has displayed an unusually flat performance this week as bullish and bearish market signals counteracted each other. On the bearish side, weakening whale demand and persistent macroeconomic uncertainties have weighed on ETH’s upside potential. The latest on-chain data from IntoTheBlock indicates that institutional participation has significantly waned over the past two weeks, reducing the likelihood of sustained upward momentum. Ethereum Price Action (ETHUSD) Conversely, ETH price action has remained resilient amid broader crypto market consolidation. While Bitcoin’s dominance continues to suppress Ethereum’s relative strength, optimism surrounding future ETF approvals for altcoins has helped maintain ETH within its current range. Additionally, major ETH staking platforms have continued to see inflows, suggesting that long-term holders remain confident despite short-term volatility. According to market data, Ethereum (ETH) has remained within a tight trading range, opening the week at $2,693 and currently trading at $2,701 as of February 15. This marginal 0.3% movement underscores a neutral market stance, with traders awaiting a definitive catalyst to dictate ETH’s next directional move. With dwindling whale activity and a precarious technical setup, Ethereum could soon be at risk of a breakdown below $2,500 if selling pressure intensifies. Ethereum Whale Demand Plunges $16B in Two Weeks While spot market sentiment remains neutral, ETH on-chain transaction patterns suggest potential downside risks ahead. The latest data from IntoTheBlock ’s Large Transaction Volume metric reveals a significant drop in high-value ETH transfers over the past two weeks, signaling reduced interest from institutional investors and large holders. Ethereum Large Transactions Volume | Source: IntoTheBlock The chart above indicates that Ethereum’s large transaction volume fell from $23.5 billion on February 3 to $7.3 billion by February 14. This $16.2 billion decline represents a major contraction in market demand, explaining why ETH’s price has struggled to sustain momentum. Such a sharp decline in transaction volume typically suggests waning institutional interest, particularly as capital shifts toward other assets like Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP, which have gained traction amid the SEC’s recent ETF acknowledgment. Historically, large transaction volume serves as a key leading indicator for market sentiment. A sustained downturn in this metric often precedes further price weakness, as fewer whales are willing to absorb selling pressure. If this trend continues, ETH may face additional downside risks, particularly if buying interest fails to recover in the coming weeks. Ethereum Price Forecast: $2,500 Breakdown Risks Heighten Ethereum price forecast shows the ETH market momentum remains precarious as it struggles to reclaim key resistance levels amid fading institutional demand. The daily chart highlights persistent downward pressure, with ETH trading below its 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $2,821 and its 100-day EMA at $3,044. These levels now serve as formidable resistance zones, preventing any meaningful recovery attempts. The Parabolic SAR indicator continues to flash bearish signals, with its dots hovering above price action, reinforcing the downtrend. Additionally, the Bull-Bear Power (BBP) indicator remains deeply negative at -99, indicating that bearish momentum remains dominant. Ethereum Price Forecast (ETHUSD) If ETH fails to reclaim the $2,821 resistance level in the coming sessions, a retest of $2,500 appears increasingly likely. A break below this key psychological support could expose ETH to deeper losses, potentially targeting the $2,300 region. However, if Ethereum manages to attract fresh buying interest, reclaiming the 50-day EMA could shift momentum in favor of the bulls, allowing for a potential recovery toward $3,000. With institutional demand waning and technical indicators skewing bearish, Ethereum remains at risk of further declines. Traders should closely monitor large transaction volumes and key resistance levels to gauge ETH’s next major move.

The upgrade enhances transaction efficiency and reduces congestion through expanded validator capabilities that allow them to process multiple bids per three-second block window. BNB Chain upgrades block processing to prioritize high-value transactions Before the update, BSC validators stopped assessing bids after reaching the block cap. Time-sensitive transactions like meme coin swaps became delayed or failed despite users paying increased gas fees for fast processing. Now, validators will be allowed to gather more bids inside the same 3-second window, potentially allowing higher-value transactions to take the place of lower-priority ones. BNB Chain stated that: This will allow validators to gather more bids, increasing the chance of incorporating the best ones and improving overall block-building performance, especially during periods of high network activity. In other words, we will give transactions interacting with time-sensitive (meme coin) contracts a higher priority. BNB Chain BNB Chain sets record gas fees as meme coin surge drives network activity The network upgrade occurs as BNB Chain experiences its highest-ever gas fees. According to Nansen data, transaction fees on it reached $15 million last week, breaking through Ethereum’s $7 million level yet falling short of Solana’s $29 million. BSC gas fees rose 114% throughout the week, ending ahead of all blocks except Solana, alongside Ethereum and Base, which saw their fees decline. As Nansen analyst Aurelie Barthere observed, Binance’s 60-day suspension from legal action with the SEC supposedly drew investors back to BSC. The rise of meme coins inspired by Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao’s dog Broccoli has also led to activity on the network, bolstering the decentralized exchange PancakeSwap in turn. Over the past week, BNB’s price rose 13% while its market cap surpassed $104 billion to outperform SOL. The BNB Chain’s performance, processing 68.3 million transactions in the last 30 days, also shows the same trend. According to Dune data, BNB has more than 6% of the total transactions, second only to Solana. As a result, it has become the largest Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain in terms of monthly transactions. At the same time, it is also experiencing a meme coin revival as Four.meme platform is picking up pace. This platform has enabled the creation of more than 12,000 meme tokens in a single day.

Coinbase Leads With F1 USDC Sponsorship In a blog post on February 14, Coinbase announced its latest strategic deal with the Aston Martin Aramco which will allow the American exchange service as the exclusive crypto partner for the reputable Formula One racing team. While the financial details of the partnership remain private, Coinbase has shared that its investment will be entirely paid in the USDC stablecoin, thereby directly onboarding Aston Martin Aramco as a client on Coinbase Prime. As part of his sponsorship deal, the Coinbase brand will be displayed on the halo and red wing end plate of Aston Martin’s AMR25 and the racing suits of drivers Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll for the season. Commenting on this deal, Jefferson Slack, managing director of Commercial at Aston Martin Aramco, shows satisfaction on the novel terms of this stablecoin-sponsored partnership. Slack said : This partnership shows the trust and confidence we place in Coinbase’s expertise as a leader in digital finance. By transacting this deal fully in USDC, we’re signaling our commitment to innovation, building a sustainable, forward-thinking relationship with Coinbase With this recent announcement, the American exchange joins a host of other crypto firms in Formula One. These include Crypto.com, Kraken, OKX, Bybit , Tezos, etc. Brand Expansion Continues Following its partnership with Aston Martin Aramco, Coinbase widens its affiliations with companies across different sectors to promote mainstream crypto adoption. These include payment processing company Stripe, Borussia Dortmund Football Club, and the Canadian Football League. Interestingly, Bloomberg journalist Yueqi Yang reports that Coinbase is also in discussion with multiple large US banks looking to venture into crypto trading. The crypto exchange is reportedly offering to serve as custody and trading partner for these banks which allegedly include Citi, Goldman Sachs, State Street, and BNY. However, Yang indicates this is potentially long-term development as these Wall Street Titans will be required to obtain regulatory clearance from the banking regulators. Amidst this positive expansion, Coinbase remains in court battling multiple cases. Most notably, the American exchange is currently processing an intercultural appeal in its case with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that seeks clarification on applying the Howey Test to digital assets. At press time, the total crypto market cap remains valued at $3.2 trillion following a 1.71% gain in the past day.",Coinbase|Aston Martin Aramco|Bloomberg|coinbase|partnership|USDC|Wall Street Banks,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-16 01:30:18

Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction as a new DeFi project, offering decentralized lending solutions and real-world use cases. With its presale attracting early investors, MUTM stands out as a potential high-reward investment during this market dip. Market Dip Creates Opportunities: Mutuum Finance, Solana, and XRP Set for Growth Solana (SOL) has remained a key player in the blockchain space, despite facing market fluctuations. Known for its fast and low-cost transactions, the network continues to attract developers building decentralized applications. Its growing adoption in DeFi and NFTs suggests that demand for SOL could strengthen as the market stabilizes. XRP has also maintained investor interest, with its price movements largely influenced by regulatory updates. While short-term volatility persists, XRP’s role in cross-border payments and increasing adoption among financial institutions provide a strong foundation for long-term growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining attention as a promising DeFi project offering decentralized lending solutions. Unlike many altcoins, it focuses on real use cases, allowing users to lend and borrow assets without intermediaries. Why Mutuum Finance Stands Out as a Top Investment During the Market Dip While many cryptocurrencies are struggling to regain momentum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction as it enters a crucial phase of development. Currently in its first presale phase at $0.01 per token, Mutuum offers early investors a unique opportunity to secure tokens at the lowest possible price before its launch. With over $490,000 raised and more than 760 holders, the strong early demand signals confidence in the project’s long-term potential. As the broader market remains uncertain, investing in a presale-stage project like Mutuum Finance allows investors to enter at a lower cost before its expected price appreciation. Mutuum Finance is a fully decentralized lending and borrowing protocol designed to eliminate intermediaries and provide users with complete control over their assets. Unlike traditional financial systems, where banks dictate lending rates and impose restrictions, Mutuum enables users to lend and borrow directly on the blockchain. Mutuum Finance offers two lending models: Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending and Peer-to-Contract (P2C) Lending, both designed for secure and flexible borrowing. In P2P Lending , borrowers and lenders set their own terms, including interest rates and collateral. This model supports a wide range of assets, including stablecoins and meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), giving users greater control over their agreements. P2C Lending operates through smart contract-managed liquidity pools. Lenders deposit assets and earn passive income, while borrowers access liquidity instantly with secured collateral. This fully decentralized system ensures transparency and eliminates intermediaries. In addition to its lending solutions, Mutuum Finance is also developing an overcollateralized stablecoin that will operate transparently on the blockchain. Unlike centralized stablecoins controlled by issuing entities, Mutuum’s stablecoin will be backed by on-chain assets and minted through collateral deposits. This feature will enhance liquidity within the ecosystem while ensuring stability and decentralization. With its utility-driven approach, growing presale success, and upcoming platform launch, Mutuum Finance presents a compelling opportunity for investors seeking long-term growth. As crypto markets remain volatile, entering at the presale stage allows early adopters to secure MUTM tokens at the lowest price, positioning themselves for potential gains as the project expands.

However, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL is emerging as a potential game-changer, with analysts predicting a breakout of up to 50,000%. What Makes THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL Stand Out? 1. Limited Supply for Maximum Value: With a total supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN leverages a deflationary model to ensure scarcity and drive demand. This gives it a major edge over tokens like Solana (SOL) and Kaspa (KAS), which have higher supply and more gradual demand growth. 2.

Kaspa (KAS, $0.12): A rising star in blockchain, yet its growth doesn’t match the explosive potential seen in this new token.

Currently, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Polkadot (DOT) are under selling pressure, forcing traders to reconsider their positions. SHIB’s burn rate has plunged by 60%, reducing its deflationary impact, while Polkadot’s failed bullish breakout has led to a 20% price drop, raising concerns over further losses. However, not all cryptocurrencies are struggling. Web3Bay (3BAY) is emerging as a strong contender, offering a real-world use case in decentralized e-commerce. Unlike SHIB and DOT, Web3Bay is more than just a token—it is a blockchain-powered marketplace aimed at disrupting traditional platforms like Amazon and eBay. With a rapidly growing presale and strong market demand, Web3Bay is positioning itself as one of the best crypto to buy right now. Shiba Inu’s 60% Burn Rate Decline Raises Questions Shiba Inu’s burn rate has dropped 60.59% in the last 24 hours, sparking concerns about its long-term deflationary strength. While the weekly burn rate still shows a 3,500% increase, suggesting ongoing community efforts to limit supply, technical indicators paint a more cautious outlook. At the moment, SHIB is trading at $0.00001644, with key support levels under close watch. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 36.53, hovering near the oversold zone, signaling the potential for short-term stabilization. However, the MACD remains negative, reinforcing existing selling pressure. From a bullish perspective, a contracting triangle pattern is forming. Should SHIB manage to break past resistance at $0.00001688, $0.000017549, or $0.000018966, it could signal the start of a recovery. Polkadot’s 20% Decline Sparks Uncertainty Polkadot has experienced a sharp 20% price decline, falling from $6.50 to $4.82 and invalidating what was previously a promising bullish pennant formation. The failure of this breakout has shifted market sentiment, leaving DOT struggling to maintain support levels. Technical indicators suggest further downside risks. The RSI is at 31.64, nearing the oversold zone, reflecting persistent selling pressure. Moreover, funding rates have turned negative, signaling increased short interest, which could drive Polkadot’s price even lower. Should this downward momentum continue, DOT may slide further to $3.59. However, if oversold conditions trigger a reversal, there is a possibility for a bounce toward $8.57, aligning with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. Web3Bay: The Best Crypto to Buy for February? Web3Bay (3BAY) is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about crypto investments of the month, bringing blockchain innovation to the trillion-dollar e-commerce sector. Unlike centralized platforms like Amazon and eBay which impose high fees and data control, Web3Bay is building a decentralized, cost-efficient marketplace where users have complete ownership over transactions. A key feature that sets Web3Bay apart is its smart contract renouncement after the presale, ensuring that no central authority can alter the platform. Additionally, governance is entirely community-driven through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), making Web3Bay one of the few truly decentralized marketplaces in the crypto space. Users can also stake 3BAY tokens to earn passive income, benefiting from low transaction fees and enhanced blockchain security via IPFS storage. Web3Bay’s presale is gaining significant traction, with over $1.18 million raised and 290 million tokens sold across multiple stages. Currently, 3BAY is priced at $0.00456 in Stage 4, with a projected launch price of $0.1959, offering an astonishing 4,200% ROI for early investors. As blockchain adoption continues to disrupt traditional industries, Web3Bay is standing out as the best crypto to buy for those looking at high-growth investment opportunities. Final Thoughts While Shiba Inu and Polkadot remain prominent names in the crypto space, both are facing notable challenges. SHIB’s burn rate decline and bearish technical indicators suggest increased selling pressure, while Polkadot’s price weakness indicates that further losses may be possible before any meaningful recovery. Meanwhile, Web3Bay is redefining the online marketplace model. With its decentralized governance, staking incentives, and blockchain-based security, it offers real-world utility beyond just speculation. The Web3Bay presale has already surpassed $1.18 million in funding, with 290 million tokens sold, solidifying its position as one of the most promising blockchain projects currently available. For investors looking for the best crypto to buy , Web3Bay presents a rare opportunity to enter an emerging sector before mainstream adoption accelerates.

While Bitcoin dominates headlines, there’s a whole world of digital assets that could offer exponential growth, especially those still flying under the radar. The trick is identifying the right projects before they take off. One name that’s turning heads in the crypto space is Qubetics . As a top crypto under a penny, it’s bringing game-changing innovation with real-world asset tokenization and Web3 aggregation. Meanwhile, Litecoin continues to prove itself as one of the most reliable altcoins, and Terra Classic is making waves with its community-driven revival. If you’re looking for the best crypto under a penny to watch right now, these three should be on your list. Qubetics: The Best Crypto Under a Penny With Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics is making serious noise in the crypto world. It’s not just another project—it’s a Web3 aggregator that enhances blockchain interoperability, making cross-chain transactions effortless. Currently, in its 21st presale stage, Qubetics has already sold over 471 million tokens to more than 19,900 holders, raising a jaw-dropping $12.8 million. With each $TICS token priced at $0.0733, investors are securing their positions before the next 10% price surge at the end of this stage. One of Qubetics’ biggest innovations is real-world asset tokenization. Imagine being able to buy fractional shares of real estate, fine art, or even luxury cars without the hassle of traditional investing. With Qubetics, businesses and individuals can tokenize physical assets and trade them on the blockchain, creating new financial opportunities that never existed before. Let’s say you own a commercial building but don’t want to sell the entire property. Tokenization allows you to fractionalize ownership, enabling multiple investors to buy shares in the property. The same applies to artists, musicians, and content creators who want to sell digital ownership rights securely on-chain. Analysts Predict Major Growth for $TICS at $0.25 by the presale end = 209.67% returns $TICS at $1 post-presale = 1,138.70% returns $TICS at $5 post-presale = 6,093.48% returns $TICS at $15 after mainnet launch = 18,480.45% returns With real-world asset tokenization, Web3 aggregation, and seamless cross-border transactions, Qubetics is shaping up to be the best crypto under a penny to watch. TICSScan Qubetics is also launching TICSScan, a blockchain explorer that provides real-time transaction tracking, smart contract monitoring, and network analytics. Transparency is key in crypto, and TICSScan ensures that Qubetics remains one of the most trusted platforms in Web3. Litecoin: The Digital Silver to Bitcoin’s Gold Litecoin ($LTC) is one of the oldest and most trusted altcoins, often referred to as Bitcoin’s little brother. It was created as a faster, cheaper alternative to Bitcoin, making it a favorite among crypto investors for over a decade. Litecoin processes transactions four times faster than Bitcoin, with lower fees, making it ideal for everyday transactions. It has seen major adoption, with businesses worldwide accepting it as a payment method. Many analysts believe Litecoin is an undervalued asset, making it a strong long-term investment. As crypto adoption grows, Litecoin’s speed and affordability make it a go-to option for payments and transfers, solidifying its status as a top altcoin with staying power. Terra Classic: A Community-Driven Comeback Terra Classic ($LUNC) was at the center of one of crypto’s biggest crashes, but instead of fading into obscurity, it has become one of the most resilient community-driven projects in the space. Despite facing one of the biggest setbacks in crypto history, Terra Classic’s dedicated community has kept the project alive, working to restore its ecosystem. With multiple proposals in the works and increased developer activity, Terra Classic is proving that revival in crypto is possible. With a large and loyal holder base, Terra Classic remains one of the most watched cryptos under a penny, making it a potential comeback story for investors willing to take the risk. Conclusion: Which Crypto Should You Bet On? If you’re looking for the best crypto under a penny, these three offer unique opportunities: Qubetics is leading innovation with real-world asset tokenization and Web3 aggregation, making it a top crypto under a penny with huge growth potential. Litecoin remains a trusted and widely adopted altcoin, providing fast and low-cost transactions that continue to attract investors. Terra Classic is riding on the strength of its dedicated community, proving that crypto projects can rebuild and come back stronger. Crypto markets reward early adopters. Whether you’re looking at Qubetics’ presale for high returns, Litecoin for stability, or Terra Classic for a comeback play, these are some of the best options for investors seeking high-upside opportunities.

Each $TICS token is priced at $0.0733, with a 10% price surge expected at the end of this stage. Why is Litecoin still relevant in 2025? Litecoin is faster and cheaper than Bitcoin, making it ideal for payments. It continues to gain adoption and remains one of the most reliable altcoins in the market. Can Terra Classic make a comeback? With a strong community and ongoing development efforts, Terra Classic has potential for a rebound.

Can bull traders maintain their positions ahead of the upcoming Mainnet Launch ? Pi Network Price Retests $80 Amid Bybit, Binance Listing Pi Network (PI) price 20% this week, grazing the $80 mark on Feb. 16, fueled by its recent listing on major exchanges like Bybit and Binance. This marked a 20% gain within a week, defying broader market uncertainty caused by hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation data. Despite macroeconomic headwinds, investor sentiment around Pi Network remained bullish as the long-anticipated exchange listings provided greater liquidity and accessibility to traders. The price rally reflected increased speculation ahead of the network’s full mainnet launch, which is expected to be a major milestone for the project. Pi Network Price Action, Feb 16, 2025 | Source: CoinCodex Pi’s listing on Binance was particularly significant, as the exchange’s dominance in the crypto market often serves as a validation signal for new digital assets. Moreover, its availability on Bybit, a derivatives-heavy platform, suggests traders are positioning themselves for heightened volatility in the coming weeks. Data from CoinCodex shows that PI trading volume spiked 60% within 48 hours of the Bybit and Binance listings, with PI Price climbing 20% within the 7-day timeframe. This is in contrast to the wider crypto market, which saw capital outflows due to concerns over persistent inflation and potential Federal Reserve rate hikes. While the price rally is encouraging for early adopters, the true test for PI will come post-mainnet launch when the network transitions into full functionality with an open ecosystem. Bulls to Maintain Positions Ahead of Pi Network Mainnet Launch Date Pi Network price forecast has been a major topic of discussion as its official launch approaches, with many speculating on where it will trade once fully unlocked.The project has built massive hype due to its mobile mining model, attracting millions of users eager to earn PI tokens without expensive hardware. With its IOU price showing stability between $61 and $70, this range could provide an early indicator of where PI may settle in the open market. Pi Network is one of the most hyped crypto launches in recent history. It aims to make mining accessible to anyone with a mobile phone. Unlike traditional proof-of-work networks that require expensive hardware, Pi allows users to mine its native token simply by running a lightweight mobile app. This approach has generated massive interest, with millions of users already participating before the official launch. As Bitcoin mining has evolved into a capital-intensive industry dominated by large mining farms, Pi’s promise of free and easy mining has captured the attention of a global audience. Anticipation has driven prices sharply higher in recent days ahead of the network’s official launch on February 20. IOU prices represent speculative trading of the token on certain exchanges before it becomes officially transferable, meaning traders are betting on its future value. The sudden spike has led to debates within the crypto community about what price Pi will debut at once the network is fully operational. With interest growing quickly, traders and early adopters are closely watching how the market will react post-launch.
