Notably, the Bitcoin price has now returned into a full bullish sentiment, with the crypto fear and greed index now pointing to extreme greed. In a recent technical analysis, crypto analyst Gert van Lagen identified a bullish pattern in Bitcoin’s price chart, specifically pointing to a confirmed breakout of the classic ‘cup-and-handle’ pattern formation that has essentially kicked off a bullish Wave 5 run. Bitcoin Price Sets Sights On $320,000 As Wave 5 Begins Bitcoin’s price action has been nothing short of impressive in the past few days. Notably, the Bitcoin price has created multiple all-time highs in quick succession, as many investors start to pour in. This sustained demand has created successive bullish candles on both the daily and weekly charts, illustrating a continued strong upward momentum. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price To $1 Soon? Textbook Weekly Golden Cross Shows What’s Coming Next Interestingly, these bullish candle formations have validated what crypto analyst Gert van Lagen called the start of a sub-wave 5 formation. This wave, which is known to be bullish, is expected to be the final sub-wave formation in a larger Elliot wave uptrend that has been in play since January 2023. Supporting the possibility of the wave 5 formation, technical analysis of the Bitcoin price formation shows that the recent price rally has seen Bitcoin breaking out of a cup-and-handle formation. This pattern, which is known to be bullish, has been in formation since 2022. The ‘cup’ portion of this pattern began forming in early 2022 and eventually ended with Bitcoin’s peak above $73,700 in March 2024. The subsequent consolidation phase, which lasted until October, represents the ‘handle’ segment of the pattern. In addition to this, Bitcoin has managed to break free from what van Lagen described as a ‘base 4 step-wise formation,’ effectively shaking off a bear trap. With this breakout now confirmed, van Lagen’s analysis points to a projected target range between $220,000 and $320,000. This range marks what he considers a ‘major sell line,’ which is a zone where profit-taking might intensify as Bitcoin reaches these upper limits. Related Reading: This Crypto Trader Correctly Called Dogecoin Price Break Above $0.3 Back In October, The True Target Will Shock You Current State Of BTC At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $89,500 with a market cap of $1.77 trillion and an all-time high of $89,864, having increased by about 10.5% in the past 24 hours. However, given this trend, this all-time high might not last long. The bullish sentiment and inflow surrounding Bitcoin has been so massive that investors don’t know when to take profit at the moment. The RSI is above 70 on every single timeframe from the daily to the yearly. This shows how strong the buying momentum is at the moment. Nevertheless, the momentum is expected to continue, with the next target at $90,000 and another at $100,000. A move to Gert van Lagen’s target of $220,000 to $320,000 will represent a 145% and 255% increase, respectively, from the current price.

Hayes argues that forthcoming US economic policies under the second term of Donald Trump could set the stage for unprecedented Bitcoin growth. Hayes draws parallels between the economic strategies of the United States and China, coining the term “American Capitalism with Chinese Characteristics.” He suggests that, similar to China’s approach under Deng Xiaoping and continued by Xi Jinping, the US is moving toward a system where the government’s primary goal is to retain power, regardless of whether policies are capitalist, socialist, or fascist. Why The Fiat System Is Broken “Similar to Deng, the elite that rule Pax Americana care not whether the economic system is Capitalist, Socialist, or Fascist, but whether implemented policies help them retain their power,” Hayes writes. He emphasizes that America ceased being purely capitalist in the early 20th century, noting, “Capitalism means that the rich lose money when they make bad decisions. That was outlawed as early as 1913 when the US Federal Reserve was created.” Hayes critiques the historical shift from “trickle-down economics” to direct stimulus measures, particularly those implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. He distinguishes between “QE for the rich” and “QE for the poor,” highlighting how direct stimulus to the general population spurred economic growth, whereas quantitative easing primarily benefited wealthy asset holders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Blasts Through $82,000: These Are The Key Reasons “From 2Q2020 until 1Q2023, Presidents Trump and Biden bucked the trend. Their Treasury departments issued debt that the Fed purchased using printed dollars (QE), but instead of handing it out to rich [individuals], the Treasury mailed checks out to everyone,” he explains. This led to a decrease in the US debt-to-nominal GDP ratio, as the increased spending power of the average citizen stimulated real economic activity. Looking ahead, Hayes anticipates that Trump’s return to power will usher in policies focused on re-shoring critical industries to the US, financed by expansive government spending and bank credit growth. He references Scott Bassett, whom he believes will be Trump’s pick for Treasury Secretary, noting that Bassett’s speeches outline plans to “run nominal GDP hot by providing government tax credits and subsidies to re-shore critical industries.” “The plan is to run nominal GDP hot by providing government tax credits and subsidies to re-shore critical industries (shipbuilding, semiconductor fabs, auto manufacturing, etc.). Companies that qualify will then receive cheap bank financing,” Hayes states. He warns that such policies would lead to significant inflation and currency debasement, adversely affecting holders of long-term bonds or savings deposits. To hedge against this, Hayes advocates for investing in assets like Bitcoin and gold. “Instead of saving in fiat bonds or bank deposits, purchase gold (the boomer financial repression hedge) or Bitcoin (the millennial financial repression hedge),” he advises. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Be Ready For ‘Phase 2’ Of This Historical Bull Pattern Hayes supports his argument by analyzing the mechanics of monetary policy and bank credit creation. He illustrates how “QE for the poor” can stimulate economic growth through increased consumer spending, as opposed to “QE for the rich,” which inflates asset prices without contributing to real economic activity. “QE for poor people stimulates economic growth. The Treasury handing out stimmies encouraged the plebes to buy trucks. Due to the demand for goods, Ford was able to pay its employees and apply for a loan to increase production,” he elaborates. Furthermore, Hayes discusses potential regulatory changes, such as exempting banks from the Supplemental Leverage Ratio (SLR), which would enable them to purchase an unlimited amount of government debt without additional capital requirements. He argues that this would pave the way for “infinite QE” directed at productive sectors of the economy. “If Treasuries, central bank reserves, and/or approved corporate debt securities were exempted from the SLR, a bank could purchase an infinite amount of debt without having to encumber themselves with any expensive equity,” he explains. “The Fed has the power to grant an exemption. They did just that from April 2020 to March 2021.” How Bitcoin Could Reach $1 Million Hayes believes that the combination of aggressive fiscal policies and regulatory changes will result in an explosion of bank credit, leading to higher inflation and a weakening US dollar: The combination of legislated industrial policy and the SLR exemption will result in a gusher of bank credit. I have already shown how the monetary velocity of such policies is much higher than that of traditional QE for rich people overseen by the Fed. Therefore, we can expect that Bitcoin and crypto will perform as well, if not better, than they did from March 2020 until November 2021. In such an environment, he asserts that Bitcoin stands to benefit the most due to its scarcity and decentralized nature. “This is how Bitcoin goes to $1 million, because prices are set on the margin. As the freely traded supply of Bitcoin dwindles, the most fiat money in history will be chasing a safe haven,” he predicts. Hayes backs this claim by referencing his custom index that tracks US bank credit supply, demonstrating that Bitcoin has outperformed other assets when adjusted for bank credit growth. “What is [..] important is how an asset performs when deflated by the supply of bank credit. Bitcoin (white), the S&P 500 Index (gold), and gold (green) have all been divided by my bank credit index. The values are indexed to 100, and as you can see, Bitcoin is the standout performer, rising over 400% since 2020. If you can only do one thing to counter the fiat debasement, it is Bitcoin. You can’t argue with the math,” he asserts. In concluding his essay, Hayes urges investors to position themselves accordingly in anticipation of these macroeconomic shifts. “Get long, and stay long. If you doubt my analysis of the impact of QE for poor people, just read up on the Chinese economic history of the past thirty years, and you will understand why I call the new economic system of Pax Americana, “American Capitalism with Chinese Characteristics,” he advises. At press time, BTC traded at $87,660.

A dollar-cost-averaging strategy is key, as exemplified by Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy, meaning Bitcoin is a buy at any price. Institutional inflows from ETFs and corporate treasury strategies, alongside the 2024 Bitcoin halving, create a favorable opportunity for accumulation. Despite criticisms, Bitcoin's growing 'hodler' base and nation-state interest suggest an opportunity for a parabolic price period in 2025, making it a buy even at all-time highs. Prelude The digital asset Bitcoin USD (BTC-USD) has continued to break new all-time highs after Trump's victory and the sweeping 'Red Wave' led to optimism of a looser regulatory environment and whispers of a 'Strategic Bitcoin Reserve' . I last wrote about bitcoin in an article titled Becoming A Bitcoiner: Understanding Blockchain Technology And Metcalfe's Law. In that article, I described Blockchain technology and the difficulty of valuing disruptive new technologies. I rated Bitcoin a buy due largely to the continued increase in mining hash rate, signaling the ongoing acceptance of the Bitcoin network. Today, I am reiterating my Buy rating on a rapid improvement in fundamentals due to Trump's victory. My articles on Bitcoin are titled 'Becoming a Bitcoiner' because they document my continued education into Bitcoin and what makes this asset trade the way it does. ""Bitcoiners"" are the hardcore believers in blockchain technology and its capacity to change life as we know it. They believe Bitcoin is heralding in a new digital age where we can transact on the internet with a trustless digital native currency. Bitcoiners see Bitcoin as a currency. They believe that it is a buy at any price because it's simply better to hold over most time frames than cash is. With this in mind, I return to the title of this article: buying at all-time highs is an integral part of being (and becoming) a Bitcoiner. This is mostly because Bitcoiners believe you should always be buying Bitcoin. The dollar-cost-averaging approach is useful for retail investors and institutions alike. The largest individual holder of Bitcoin (besides the creator Satoshi Nakamoto), Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy ( MSTR ), is the most prominent example of this approach. Saylor is the loudest proponent of Bitcoin that I'm aware of, and his shift to holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset instead of cash has been enormously beneficial to shareholders. Many skeptics will still be hesitant to buy at all-time highs, though. Such a volatile asset is due for a correction, right? In this article, let's discuss the factors that, I believe, will contribute to continued parabolic returns in Bitcoin. In fact, I believe the next time we see a material correction in Bitcoin, it may be 'correcting' to a price far higher than where we're at now. Despite being at all-time highs, it is still a very opportune time to accumulate bitcoin. Supply-Demand Dynamics The most widely understood benefit of Bitcoin over fiat money is its fixed supply. In all Economics 101 courses, students are taught that the balance between supply and demand dictates pricing behavior in free and open markets. For many years, demand for Bitcoin was generated from a small subset of enthusiasts, cypherpunks, and criminals. Bitcoin's first commercial use case was on the dark web marketplace the 'Silk Road' where many people bought and sold illegal goods. Much of the bitcoin within this marketplace was seized by the US government, who still holds those coins. It later became viewed as the leading indicator for bull runs across the broader cryptosphere, such as the ICO (initial coin offering) boom of 2017, the NFT (non-fungible token) boom of 2021, and more recently the memecoin boom in 2024. Through each of these periods, Bitcoin undergoes intense upward price movements that re-baseline it at higher highs and higher lows. Data by YCharts I believe we are at the onset of another period of intense upward price performance in Bitcoin because of increased institutional participation amidst the ever-slowing supply that is baked into the core of Bitcoin's Blockchain. Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy made headlines by announcing that the company plans to secure another $42b in new funding for Bitcoin purchases over the next three years. Block, Inc. ( SQ ) also purchases Bitcoin monthly using 10% of its gross profit from Bitcoin products. Block is also working on a leading-edge mining chip and has a leading self-custody hardware wallet known as Bitkey. Additionally, ETFs from major institutions like BlackRock ( BLK ) and Fidelity ( FNF ) have spurred major inflows and purchases of bitcoin. The approval of these ETFs earlier in 2024 already caused a significant run in the price of bitcoin. Meanwhile, Microsoft ( MSFT ) has an open proposal for shareholders to vote on Bitcoin purchasing plans. Even though management has recommended shareholders vote against this, it's indicative of a broader acceptance and conversation around bitcoin being used as a treasury asset. Shareholders like Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street ( STT ) will be eligible to vote on the proposal in December, all of whom now have a vested interest in increasing the rate of Bitcoin adoption. Increasing institutional ownership of bitcoin also comes at a time when some nations have begun accepting bitcoin as legal tender. Meanwhile, a recent Chainalysis report shows an increasing number of participants in the crypto sphere. The confluence of factors contributing to demand growth for bitcoin is powerful. When taken in tandem with the 2024 Bitcoin halving cutting supply growth in half and the optimism around a pro-crypto Trump administration, this is nothing short of a golden opportunity to accumulate bitcoin. The loudest criticism of bitcoin is a lack of use cases. Critics say that it is still valueless, since it doesn't have the same transactional utility as fiat money or store-of-value utility like gold or silver. Frankly, this doesn't matter. What matters is an increasing number of 'hodlers' (the bitcoiner term for someone that buys and holds bitcoin with no intent of ever selling), increasing institutional adoption, and increasing adoption by nation-states. The increasingly loud rhetoric around a US strategic reserve of Bitcoin has the potential of setting off another parabolic period for the price of bitcoin. From the nation-state perspective, bitcoin ownership is a matter of game theory. It's risky to be the first mover, but it is equally risky to be a laggard. If the US begins accumulating bitcoin, virtually all other nations will have the incentive to accumulate bitcoin, since their US Dollar reserves will now be linked to bitcoin by proxy. Some analysts believe this could help the US pay down its exploding national debt, but I won't pontificate on that at this time. Investor Takeaway Regardless of your opinion on blockchain technology or cryptocurrency, it's dangerous to bet against basic economics. Bitcoin's economic reality currently features exploding demand and slowing supply. With the confluence of factors contributing to strong demand growth, I expect another parabolic period for the price of Bitcoin in 2025. The next 'correction' will likely be a 'higher low' from where we are now (or *to* where we are now). Regardless, it remains an opportune time to accumulate bitcoin, even if for a momentum trade. Bitcoin remains a buy despite hitting all-time highs.",BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|FIAT|TOKEN SALE|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-11-12 23:59:26

BITO ETF tracks bitcoin via CME futures, but its structure leads to high dividends and lagging performance compared to spot bitcoin ETFs like IBIT. BITO's high monthly dividend impacts price performance, making it better suited for short-term options rather than long-term LEAPs. Despite its flaws, BITO is the only bitcoin ETF offering options, making it useful for conservative investors until other ETFs implement options. Thesis If an investor opened their trading screens today in the cryptocurrency sector, they might have had a bit of a shock: Bitcoin funds are up roughly +10% on the day, with other crypto names outperforming. While today's price action might remind some investors of 2021, the current bull run can go on longer than expected, with momentum a powerful factor to consider. While we are having a hard time valuing Bitcoin (BTC-USD) on traditional fundamental factors (i.e. cash flow, earnings, etc.), it has undoubtedly become an asset class that exhibits the same characteristics as other high beta investments. With momentum behind bitcoin, we are going to show investors why the ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ) is an imperfect instrument to use when looking for capturing long-term spot moves in the cryptocurrency, and why the exchange-traded fund is better suited for option positions. BITO - a fund based on bitcoin futures BITO is an ETF which seeks to track the price of bitcoin: BITO seeks results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to the performance of bitcoin. BITO invests in bitcoin futures and does not invest in bitcoin. There is no guarantee the fund will closely track bitcoin returns. However, the fund takes a traditional capital markets approach and does not use crypto wallets, investing via CME listed bitcoin futures: Holdings (Fund website) As per the above table from the fund website, the name is currently holding the front month bitcoin futures. A large amount of the fund net cash is parked in T-Bills. Investing via futures has an expense aspect to it as well as the futures 'roll' effect. As we will notice in the next section, BITO lags outright bitcoin funds when looked at on a year to date basis due to these factors. Year to date performance highlights the problems with BITO Although bitcoin is up over 76% for the year, BITO is lagging: Bitcoin funds Total Returns (Seeking Alpha) We are using the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) as a comparison and a graph start date of January 15, 2024, to account for the IBIT start date. Also, kindly note, we are using a total return graph above to account for BITO's high dividend. If we were using just a price graph, it would look like this: Price move (Seeking Alpha) BITO tends to distribute all its gains via a high dividend yield, whereas IBIT tracks the bitcoin price and thus provides for capital gains. High dividend distribution Due to the ETF structure that uses futures rather than spot Bitcoin, BITO distributes a very high monthly dividend: Dividends (Seeking Alpha) Most of the fund gains actually come via the dividend distribution rather than capital gains. This is very important for investors who look at tax implications and choosing an asset class which appreciates in value versus one that offers a high distribution. Furthermore, when structuring options, it is important to understand the price implications for a high distribution. An option is the right to purchase BITO at a later date at a certain price. When a fund has a high distribution, in effect, it undercuts the price performance. Although bitcoin is up significantly for the year, BITO is roughly flat. When structuring options and their price, an investor needs to factor in the high distribution. In effect, from a price perspective, BITO is a series of 1-month options. If an investor buys a long-dated option here, they run the risk of small returns even if bitcoin moves higher, due to the distributive nature of the fund. As we can see from the above table, the ETF pays out every month, at the beginning of the month. From October 1, 2024, to November 1, 2024, the BITO price was the result of the intra-period move in the cryptocurrency. Post the distribution, the price went down. Thus, the structure favors shorter dated options. Are there options on other bitcoin ETFs? Not yet. What sets BITO apart though is the access it offers to options . As per the Seeking Alpha platform page, we can see that an investor can easily trade options on BITO, thus gaining access to using options on the underlying asset class. Options are favored by many when it comes to bitcoin due to the large moves observed historically for this asset class. Conservative investors can also limit the damage to their accounts when drawdowns occur via options (as a reminder, a bought call has the paid premium as the maximum downside). Ideally, an investor should have access to options on IBIT or the other spot bitcoin ETFs. While the SEC has now approved the move, options have yet to be implemented: Oct 18 (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator has granted ""accelerated approval"" to the New York Stock Exchange to list and trade options tied to three spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to a regulatory filing. Therefore, as of today, investors are still reliant on BITO and its structure in order to utilize options. Despite the above-mentioned structuring issues, BITO is still the only ETF that allows for the efficient use of options in order to take positions on bitcoin via a traditional brokerage account. Conclusion Bitcoin is now an established asset class with a very volatile return profile. The BITO ETF seeks to track bitcoin's performance via CME listed futures, but represents an imperfect way to track the asset class. Due to tax implications and its structure, BITO pays out a very high monthly dividend yield, thus disbursing gains via its dividends rather than capital appreciation. Furthermore, due to the fund's high expense ratio of 0.95% and the 'roll' effect present for futures, BITO lags spot bitcoin ETFs such as IBIT (over 9% lag in 2024). The one feature that BITO has, but other bitcoin ETFs currently don't, is the ability to use options. Investors are able to use BITO call options to profit from bitcoin's appreciation, while waiting for the market implementation for other bitcoin ETFs after the SEC's approval. We are of the opinion that a retail investor looking to get outright bitcoin exposure for an extended period is better served by ETFs such as IBIT, whereas more conservative market players looking for bitcoin plays via options are correct in looking at BITO.",IBIT|BITO,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|REGULATION|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-11-13 00:14:19

Long-term holders of the firstborn cryptocurrency are now becoming interested in Bitcoin, as the digital coin is fast approaching the much-anticipated $90,000 mark. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Data Signals Big Moves Ahead As Stakeholder Activity Spikes $90K Is Just Around The Corner Data showed that BTC’s price continues to surge, and analysts are confident that it will hit the $90,000 level sooner than expected. Just several days after Donald Trump reclaimed the White House, Bitcoin price has been moving upward as the upcoming administration offers a favorable treatment of the cryptocurrency sector. For the first time, Bitcoin went beyond the $87,000 mark after reaching $87,198, which more than doubled the $37,000 recorded 12 months ago. Then, it slightly slipped a bit on Monday. In early Tuesday, BTC once again hit another all-time high when the coin hit $89,804, which raised its total market value to a whopping $1.77 trillion. The leading crypto asset saw a gentle drop as long-term holders started to make movements. At the time of writing, Bitcoin price is pegged at $88,800. The alpha coin hit a new all-time high on Monday. On Bitstamp, BTC registered $89,899. Analysts also noted that as BTC’s price moves upward so does its daily trading volume increases with a current value of $133 billion. Bitcoin: The Domino Effect Analysts said that the positive sentiment on Bitcoin is also having a domino effect on the entire cryptocurrency sector. Its price surge is also pulling the price of other digital currencies worldwide. CoinGecko noted that in the past 24 hours, the market capitalization of the global cryptocurrency was boosted by 4.7% and now boasted a record high of $3.11 trillion. In addition, in the past week, the crypto market has already experienced a massive $765 billion increase. In another report, crypto analysts said that crypto-related investment products recorded the virtual coin’s highest year-to-date inflows of about $31.3 billion, and the total amount of assets under management hit $116 billion.

Many people who follow the market say that if a crypto-friendly candidate wins, XRP could go through a big jump, similar to what happened after other elections. Could this be the start of another rally? Related Reading: Shiba Inu Strategic US Hub Plan Sends SHIB Price On A 23% Moonshot After the 2016 and 2020 US elections, XRP’s value skyrocketed, as expected by market observers. These two major occurrences benefited cryptocurrencies, which analysts expect to happen again in 2024 under Donald Trump. Market expert Mikkybull observes a “symmetrical triangle” pattern that preceded these elections and led to significant achievements. Since XRP has achieved these highs before, some wonder if history will repeat. $XRP huge acceleration is coming Look at the past elections and see what follows. pic.twitter.com/ufcqC8v5Y5 — Mikybull 🐂Crypto (@MikybullCrypto) November 8, 2024 Patterns Of XRP In The Past: From Triangle To Surge Mikkybull observes that the price of XRP fell marginally after the 2016 elections but eventually increased by 60,000%, reaching the all-time high (ATH) level of $3.31. The 2020 election caused another upward spike which resulted in the altcoin increasing by 170% within the span of one month. There was also a liquidity crunch in December for the cryptocurrency market however this was occasioned by the contrary ruling from the SEC against Ripple Labs. In light of the ongoing litigation, the election rally evokes interest because it proposes that such increases could be achieved in 2024. Given the current bullish sentiment in the market, Mikkybull believes that another rally is almost imminent. Positive Technical Indicators At present, XRP is trading at approximately $0.6393 and is encountering a resistance level at $0.6533. The prospective path to the next target at $0.7463 is seen by analysts if it can overcome this barrier. Volume is increasing, and recent gains may provide the necessary impetus. RippleLord, a market expert, predicts that the price of XRP may even resume its 2017 highs if this rally continues. In 2017, XRP experienced a significant increase from $0.06 to nearly $3.84. RippleLord believes that XRP could at least reach a consolidation level of $3, with a longer-term peak potentially reaching $28 if market conditions coincide, despite the fact that repeating such a massive run may be ambitious. This is the anatomy of the alt-season. We had this analysis before, and I’ve mentioned that November 24 will start the Crypto Bull Run.
