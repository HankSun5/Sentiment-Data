Notably, the Bitcoin price has now returned into a full bullish sentiment, with the crypto fear and greed index now pointing to extreme greed. In a recent technical analysis, crypto analyst Gert van Lagen identified a bullish pattern in Bitcoin’s price chart, specifically pointing to a confirmed breakout of the classic ‘cup-and-handle’ pattern formation that has essentially kicked off a bullish Wave 5 run. Bitcoin Price Sets Sights On $320,000 As Wave 5 Begins Bitcoin’s price action has been nothing short of impressive in the past few days. Notably, the Bitcoin price has created multiple all-time highs in quick succession, as many investors start to pour in. This sustained demand has created successive bullish candles on both the daily and weekly charts, illustrating a continued strong upward momentum. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price To $1 Soon? Textbook Weekly Golden Cross Shows What’s Coming Next Interestingly, these bullish candle formations have validated what crypto analyst Gert van Lagen called the start of a sub-wave 5 formation. This wave, which is known to be bullish, is expected to be the final sub-wave formation in a larger Elliot wave uptrend that has been in play since January 2023. Supporting the possibility of the wave 5 formation, technical analysis of the Bitcoin price formation shows that the recent price rally has seen Bitcoin breaking out of a cup-and-handle formation. This pattern, which is known to be bullish, has been in formation since 2022. The ‘cup’ portion of this pattern began forming in early 2022 and eventually ended with Bitcoin’s peak above $73,700 in March 2024. The subsequent consolidation phase, which lasted until October, represents the ‘handle’ segment of the pattern. In addition to this, Bitcoin has managed to break free from what van Lagen described as a ‘base 4 step-wise formation,’ effectively shaking off a bear trap. With this breakout now confirmed, van Lagen’s analysis points to a projected target range between $220,000 and $320,000. This range marks what he considers a ‘major sell line,’ which is a zone where profit-taking might intensify as Bitcoin reaches these upper limits. Related Reading: This Crypto Trader Correctly Called Dogecoin Price Break Above $0.3 Back In October, The True Target Will Shock You Current State Of BTC At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $89,500 with a market cap of $1.77 trillion and an all-time high of $89,864, having increased by about 10.5% in the past 24 hours. However, given this trend, this all-time high might not last long. The bullish sentiment and inflow surrounding Bitcoin has been so massive that investors don’t know when to take profit at the moment. The RSI is above 70 on every single timeframe from the daily to the yearly. This shows how strong the buying momentum is at the moment. Nevertheless, the momentum is expected to continue, with the next target at $90,000 and another at $100,000. A move to Gert van Lagen’s target of $220,000 to $320,000 will represent a 145% and 255% increase, respectively, from the current price.

Hayes argues that forthcoming US economic policies under the second term of Donald Trump could set the stage for unprecedented Bitcoin growth. Hayes draws parallels between the economic strategies of the United States and China, coining the term “American Capitalism with Chinese Characteristics.” He suggests that, similar to China’s approach under Deng Xiaoping and continued by Xi Jinping, the US is moving toward a system where the government’s primary goal is to retain power, regardless of whether policies are capitalist, socialist, or fascist. Why The Fiat System Is Broken “Similar to Deng, the elite that rule Pax Americana care not whether the economic system is Capitalist, Socialist, or Fascist, but whether implemented policies help them retain their power,” Hayes writes. He emphasizes that America ceased being purely capitalist in the early 20th century, noting, “Capitalism means that the rich lose money when they make bad decisions. That was outlawed as early as 1913 when the US Federal Reserve was created.” Hayes critiques the historical shift from “trickle-down economics” to direct stimulus measures, particularly those implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. He distinguishes between “QE for the rich” and “QE for the poor,” highlighting how direct stimulus to the general population spurred economic growth, whereas quantitative easing primarily benefited wealthy asset holders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Blasts Through $82,000: These Are The Key Reasons “From 2Q2020 until 1Q2023, Presidents Trump and Biden bucked the trend. Their Treasury departments issued debt that the Fed purchased using printed dollars (QE), but instead of handing it out to rich [individuals], the Treasury mailed checks out to everyone,” he explains. This led to a decrease in the US debt-to-nominal GDP ratio, as the increased spending power of the average citizen stimulated real economic activity. Looking ahead, Hayes anticipates that Trump’s return to power will usher in policies focused on re-shoring critical industries to the US, financed by expansive government spending and bank credit growth. He references Scott Bassett, whom he believes will be Trump’s pick for Treasury Secretary, noting that Bassett’s speeches outline plans to “run nominal GDP hot by providing government tax credits and subsidies to re-shore critical industries.” “The plan is to run nominal GDP hot by providing government tax credits and subsidies to re-shore critical industries (shipbuilding, semiconductor fabs, auto manufacturing, etc.). Companies that qualify will then receive cheap bank financing,” Hayes states. He warns that such policies would lead to significant inflation and currency debasement, adversely affecting holders of long-term bonds or savings deposits. To hedge against this, Hayes advocates for investing in assets like Bitcoin and gold. “Instead of saving in fiat bonds or bank deposits, purchase gold (the boomer financial repression hedge) or Bitcoin (the millennial financial repression hedge),” he advises. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Be Ready For ‘Phase 2’ Of This Historical Bull Pattern Hayes supports his argument by analyzing the mechanics of monetary policy and bank credit creation. He illustrates how “QE for the poor” can stimulate economic growth through increased consumer spending, as opposed to “QE for the rich,” which inflates asset prices without contributing to real economic activity. “QE for poor people stimulates economic growth. The Treasury handing out stimmies encouraged the plebes to buy trucks. Due to the demand for goods, Ford was able to pay its employees and apply for a loan to increase production,” he elaborates. Furthermore, Hayes discusses potential regulatory changes, such as exempting banks from the Supplemental Leverage Ratio (SLR), which would enable them to purchase an unlimited amount of government debt without additional capital requirements. He argues that this would pave the way for “infinite QE” directed at productive sectors of the economy. “If Treasuries, central bank reserves, and/or approved corporate debt securities were exempted from the SLR, a bank could purchase an infinite amount of debt without having to encumber themselves with any expensive equity,” he explains. “The Fed has the power to grant an exemption. They did just that from April 2020 to March 2021.” How Bitcoin Could Reach $1 Million Hayes believes that the combination of aggressive fiscal policies and regulatory changes will result in an explosion of bank credit, leading to higher inflation and a weakening US dollar: The combination of legislated industrial policy and the SLR exemption will result in a gusher of bank credit. I have already shown how the monetary velocity of such policies is much higher than that of traditional QE for rich people overseen by the Fed. Therefore, we can expect that Bitcoin and crypto will perform as well, if not better, than they did from March 2020 until November 2021. In such an environment, he asserts that Bitcoin stands to benefit the most due to its scarcity and decentralized nature. “This is how Bitcoin goes to $1 million, because prices are set on the margin. As the freely traded supply of Bitcoin dwindles, the most fiat money in history will be chasing a safe haven,” he predicts. Hayes backs this claim by referencing his custom index that tracks US bank credit supply, demonstrating that Bitcoin has outperformed other assets when adjusted for bank credit growth. “What is [..] important is how an asset performs when deflated by the supply of bank credit. Bitcoin (white), the S&P 500 Index (gold), and gold (green) have all been divided by my bank credit index. The values are indexed to 100, and as you can see, Bitcoin is the standout performer, rising over 400% since 2020. If you can only do one thing to counter the fiat debasement, it is Bitcoin. You can’t argue with the math,” he asserts. In concluding his essay, Hayes urges investors to position themselves accordingly in anticipation of these macroeconomic shifts. “Get long, and stay long. If you doubt my analysis of the impact of QE for poor people, just read up on the Chinese economic history of the past thirty years, and you will understand why I call the new economic system of Pax Americana, “American Capitalism with Chinese Characteristics,” he advises. At press time, BTC traded at $87,660.

A dollar-cost-averaging strategy is key, as exemplified by Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy, meaning Bitcoin is a buy at any price. Institutional inflows from ETFs and corporate treasury strategies, alongside the 2024 Bitcoin halving, create a favorable opportunity for accumulation. Despite criticisms, Bitcoin's growing 'hodler' base and nation-state interest suggest an opportunity for a parabolic price period in 2025, making it a buy even at all-time highs. Prelude The digital asset Bitcoin USD (BTC-USD) has continued to break new all-time highs after Trump's victory and the sweeping 'Red Wave' led to optimism of a looser regulatory environment and whispers of a 'Strategic Bitcoin Reserve' . I last wrote about bitcoin in an article titled Becoming A Bitcoiner: Understanding Blockchain Technology And Metcalfe's Law. In that article, I described Blockchain technology and the difficulty of valuing disruptive new technologies. I rated Bitcoin a buy due largely to the continued increase in mining hash rate, signaling the ongoing acceptance of the Bitcoin network. Today, I am reiterating my Buy rating on a rapid improvement in fundamentals due to Trump's victory. My articles on Bitcoin are titled 'Becoming a Bitcoiner' because they document my continued education into Bitcoin and what makes this asset trade the way it does. ""Bitcoiners"" are the hardcore believers in blockchain technology and its capacity to change life as we know it. They believe Bitcoin is heralding in a new digital age where we can transact on the internet with a trustless digital native currency. Bitcoiners see Bitcoin as a currency. They believe that it is a buy at any price because it's simply better to hold over most time frames than cash is. With this in mind, I return to the title of this article: buying at all-time highs is an integral part of being (and becoming) a Bitcoiner. This is mostly because Bitcoiners believe you should always be buying Bitcoin. The dollar-cost-averaging approach is useful for retail investors and institutions alike. The largest individual holder of Bitcoin (besides the creator Satoshi Nakamoto), Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy ( MSTR ), is the most prominent example of this approach. Saylor is the loudest proponent of Bitcoin that I'm aware of, and his shift to holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset instead of cash has been enormously beneficial to shareholders. Many skeptics will still be hesitant to buy at all-time highs, though. Such a volatile asset is due for a correction, right? In this article, let's discuss the factors that, I believe, will contribute to continued parabolic returns in Bitcoin. In fact, I believe the next time we see a material correction in Bitcoin, it may be 'correcting' to a price far higher than where we're at now. Despite being at all-time highs, it is still a very opportune time to accumulate bitcoin. Supply-Demand Dynamics The most widely understood benefit of Bitcoin over fiat money is its fixed supply. In all Economics 101 courses, students are taught that the balance between supply and demand dictates pricing behavior in free and open markets. For many years, demand for Bitcoin was generated from a small subset of enthusiasts, cypherpunks, and criminals. Bitcoin's first commercial use case was on the dark web marketplace the 'Silk Road' where many people bought and sold illegal goods. Much of the bitcoin within this marketplace was seized by the US government, who still holds those coins. It later became viewed as the leading indicator for bull runs across the broader cryptosphere, such as the ICO (initial coin offering) boom of 2017, the NFT (non-fungible token) boom of 2021, and more recently the memecoin boom in 2024. Through each of these periods, Bitcoin undergoes intense upward price movements that re-baseline it at higher highs and higher lows. Data by YCharts I believe we are at the onset of another period of intense upward price performance in Bitcoin because of increased institutional participation amidst the ever-slowing supply that is baked into the core of Bitcoin's Blockchain. Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy made headlines by announcing that the company plans to secure another $42b in new funding for Bitcoin purchases over the next three years. Block, Inc. ( SQ ) also purchases Bitcoin monthly using 10% of its gross profit from Bitcoin products. Block is also working on a leading-edge mining chip and has a leading self-custody hardware wallet known as Bitkey. Additionally, ETFs from major institutions like BlackRock ( BLK ) and Fidelity ( FNF ) have spurred major inflows and purchases of bitcoin. The approval of these ETFs earlier in 2024 already caused a significant run in the price of bitcoin. Meanwhile, Microsoft ( MSFT ) has an open proposal for shareholders to vote on Bitcoin purchasing plans. Even though management has recommended shareholders vote against this, it's indicative of a broader acceptance and conversation around bitcoin being used as a treasury asset. Shareholders like Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street ( STT ) will be eligible to vote on the proposal in December, all of whom now have a vested interest in increasing the rate of Bitcoin adoption. Increasing institutional ownership of bitcoin also comes at a time when some nations have begun accepting bitcoin as legal tender. Meanwhile, a recent Chainalysis report shows an increasing number of participants in the crypto sphere. The confluence of factors contributing to demand growth for bitcoin is powerful. When taken in tandem with the 2024 Bitcoin halving cutting supply growth in half and the optimism around a pro-crypto Trump administration, this is nothing short of a golden opportunity to accumulate bitcoin. The loudest criticism of bitcoin is a lack of use cases. Critics say that it is still valueless, since it doesn't have the same transactional utility as fiat money or store-of-value utility like gold or silver. Frankly, this doesn't matter. What matters is an increasing number of 'hodlers' (the bitcoiner term for someone that buys and holds bitcoin with no intent of ever selling), increasing institutional adoption, and increasing adoption by nation-states. The increasingly loud rhetoric around a US strategic reserve of Bitcoin has the potential of setting off another parabolic period for the price of bitcoin. From the nation-state perspective, bitcoin ownership is a matter of game theory. It's risky to be the first mover, but it is equally risky to be a laggard. If the US begins accumulating bitcoin, virtually all other nations will have the incentive to accumulate bitcoin, since their US Dollar reserves will now be linked to bitcoin by proxy. Some analysts believe this could help the US pay down its exploding national debt, but I won't pontificate on that at this time. Investor Takeaway Regardless of your opinion on blockchain technology or cryptocurrency, it's dangerous to bet against basic economics. Bitcoin's economic reality currently features exploding demand and slowing supply. With the confluence of factors contributing to strong demand growth, I expect another parabolic period for the price of Bitcoin in 2025. The next 'correction' will likely be a 'higher low' from where we are now (or *to* where we are now). Regardless, it remains an opportune time to accumulate bitcoin, even if for a momentum trade. Bitcoin remains a buy despite hitting all-time highs.",BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|FIAT|TOKEN SALE|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-11-12 23:59:26

BITO ETF tracks bitcoin via CME futures, but its structure leads to high dividends and lagging performance compared to spot bitcoin ETFs like IBIT. BITO's high monthly dividend impacts price performance, making it better suited for short-term options rather than long-term LEAPs. Despite its flaws, BITO is the only bitcoin ETF offering options, making it useful for conservative investors until other ETFs implement options. Thesis If an investor opened their trading screens today in the cryptocurrency sector, they might have had a bit of a shock: Bitcoin funds are up roughly +10% on the day, with other crypto names outperforming. While today's price action might remind some investors of 2021, the current bull run can go on longer than expected, with momentum a powerful factor to consider. While we are having a hard time valuing Bitcoin (BTC-USD) on traditional fundamental factors (i.e. cash flow, earnings, etc.), it has undoubtedly become an asset class that exhibits the same characteristics as other high beta investments. With momentum behind bitcoin, we are going to show investors why the ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ) is an imperfect instrument to use when looking for capturing long-term spot moves in the cryptocurrency, and why the exchange-traded fund is better suited for option positions. BITO - a fund based on bitcoin futures BITO is an ETF which seeks to track the price of bitcoin: BITO seeks results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to the performance of bitcoin. BITO invests in bitcoin futures and does not invest in bitcoin. There is no guarantee the fund will closely track bitcoin returns. However, the fund takes a traditional capital markets approach and does not use crypto wallets, investing via CME listed bitcoin futures: Holdings (Fund website) As per the above table from the fund website, the name is currently holding the front month bitcoin futures. A large amount of the fund net cash is parked in T-Bills. Investing via futures has an expense aspect to it as well as the futures 'roll' effect. As we will notice in the next section, BITO lags outright bitcoin funds when looked at on a year to date basis due to these factors. Year to date performance highlights the problems with BITO Although bitcoin is up over 76% for the year, BITO is lagging: Bitcoin funds Total Returns (Seeking Alpha) We are using the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) as a comparison and a graph start date of January 15, 2024, to account for the IBIT start date. Also, kindly note, we are using a total return graph above to account for BITO's high dividend. If we were using just a price graph, it would look like this: Price move (Seeking Alpha) BITO tends to distribute all its gains via a high dividend yield, whereas IBIT tracks the bitcoin price and thus provides for capital gains. High dividend distribution Due to the ETF structure that uses futures rather than spot Bitcoin, BITO distributes a very high monthly dividend: Dividends (Seeking Alpha) Most of the fund gains actually come via the dividend distribution rather than capital gains. This is very important for investors who look at tax implications and choosing an asset class which appreciates in value versus one that offers a high distribution. Furthermore, when structuring options, it is important to understand the price implications for a high distribution. An option is the right to purchase BITO at a later date at a certain price. When a fund has a high distribution, in effect, it undercuts the price performance. Although bitcoin is up significantly for the year, BITO is roughly flat. When structuring options and their price, an investor needs to factor in the high distribution. In effect, from a price perspective, BITO is a series of 1-month options. If an investor buys a long-dated option here, they run the risk of small returns even if bitcoin moves higher, due to the distributive nature of the fund. As we can see from the above table, the ETF pays out every month, at the beginning of the month. From October 1, 2024, to November 1, 2024, the BITO price was the result of the intra-period move in the cryptocurrency. Post the distribution, the price went down. Thus, the structure favors shorter dated options. Are there options on other bitcoin ETFs? Not yet. What sets BITO apart though is the access it offers to options . As per the Seeking Alpha platform page, we can see that an investor can easily trade options on BITO, thus gaining access to using options on the underlying asset class. Options are favored by many when it comes to bitcoin due to the large moves observed historically for this asset class. Conservative investors can also limit the damage to their accounts when drawdowns occur via options (as a reminder, a bought call has the paid premium as the maximum downside). Ideally, an investor should have access to options on IBIT or the other spot bitcoin ETFs. While the SEC has now approved the move, options have yet to be implemented: Oct 18 (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator has granted ""accelerated approval"" to the New York Stock Exchange to list and trade options tied to three spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to a regulatory filing. Therefore, as of today, investors are still reliant on BITO and its structure in order to utilize options. Despite the above-mentioned structuring issues, BITO is still the only ETF that allows for the efficient use of options in order to take positions on bitcoin via a traditional brokerage account. Conclusion Bitcoin is now an established asset class with a very volatile return profile. The BITO ETF seeks to track bitcoin's performance via CME listed futures, but represents an imperfect way to track the asset class. Due to tax implications and its structure, BITO pays out a very high monthly dividend yield, thus disbursing gains via its dividends rather than capital appreciation. Furthermore, due to the fund's high expense ratio of 0.95% and the 'roll' effect present for futures, BITO lags spot bitcoin ETFs such as IBIT (over 9% lag in 2024). The one feature that BITO has, but other bitcoin ETFs currently don't, is the ability to use options. Investors are able to use BITO call options to profit from bitcoin's appreciation, while waiting for the market implementation for other bitcoin ETFs after the SEC's approval. We are of the opinion that a retail investor looking to get outright bitcoin exposure for an extended period is better served by ETFs such as IBIT, whereas more conservative market players looking for bitcoin plays via options are correct in looking at BITO.",IBIT|BITO,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|REGULATION|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-11-13 00:14:19

Long-term holders of the firstborn cryptocurrency are now becoming interested in Bitcoin, as the digital coin is fast approaching the much-anticipated $90,000 mark. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Data Signals Big Moves Ahead As Stakeholder Activity Spikes $90K Is Just Around The Corner Data showed that BTC’s price continues to surge, and analysts are confident that it will hit the $90,000 level sooner than expected. Just several days after Donald Trump reclaimed the White House, Bitcoin price has been moving upward as the upcoming administration offers a favorable treatment of the cryptocurrency sector. For the first time, Bitcoin went beyond the $87,000 mark after reaching $87,198, which more than doubled the $37,000 recorded 12 months ago. Then, it slightly slipped a bit on Monday. In early Tuesday, BTC once again hit another all-time high when the coin hit $89,804, which raised its total market value to a whopping $1.77 trillion. The leading crypto asset saw a gentle drop as long-term holders started to make movements. At the time of writing, Bitcoin price is pegged at $88,800. The alpha coin hit a new all-time high on Monday. On Bitstamp, BTC registered $89,899. Analysts also noted that as BTC’s price moves upward so does its daily trading volume increases with a current value of $133 billion. Bitcoin: The Domino Effect Analysts said that the positive sentiment on Bitcoin is also having a domino effect on the entire cryptocurrency sector. Its price surge is also pulling the price of other digital currencies worldwide. CoinGecko noted that in the past 24 hours, the market capitalization of the global cryptocurrency was boosted by 4.7% and now boasted a record high of $3.11 trillion. In addition, in the past week, the crypto market has already experienced a massive $765 billion increase. In another report, crypto analysts said that crypto-related investment products recorded the virtual coin’s highest year-to-date inflows of about $31.3 billion, and the total amount of assets under management hit $116 billion.

Many people who follow the market say that if a crypto-friendly candidate wins, XRP could go through a big jump, similar to what happened after other elections. Could this be the start of another rally? Related Reading: Shiba Inu Strategic US Hub Plan Sends SHIB Price On A 23% Moonshot After the 2016 and 2020 US elections, XRP’s value skyrocketed, as expected by market observers. These two major occurrences benefited cryptocurrencies, which analysts expect to happen again in 2024 under Donald Trump. Market expert Mikkybull observes a “symmetrical triangle” pattern that preceded these elections and led to significant achievements. Since XRP has achieved these highs before, some wonder if history will repeat. $XRP huge acceleration is coming Look at the past elections and see what follows. pic.twitter.com/ufcqC8v5Y5 — Mikybull 🐂Crypto (@MikybullCrypto) November 8, 2024 Patterns Of XRP In The Past: From Triangle To Surge Mikkybull observes that the price of XRP fell marginally after the 2016 elections but eventually increased by 60,000%, reaching the all-time high (ATH) level of $3.31. The 2020 election caused another upward spike which resulted in the altcoin increasing by 170% within the span of one month. There was also a liquidity crunch in December for the cryptocurrency market however this was occasioned by the contrary ruling from the SEC against Ripple Labs. In light of the ongoing litigation, the election rally evokes interest because it proposes that such increases could be achieved in 2024. Given the current bullish sentiment in the market, Mikkybull believes that another rally is almost imminent. Positive Technical Indicators At present, XRP is trading at approximately $0.6393 and is encountering a resistance level at $0.6533. The prospective path to the next target at $0.7463 is seen by analysts if it can overcome this barrier. Volume is increasing, and recent gains may provide the necessary impetus. RippleLord, a market expert, predicts that the price of XRP may even resume its 2017 highs if this rally continues. In 2017, XRP experienced a significant increase from $0.06 to nearly $3.84. RippleLord believes that XRP could at least reach a consolidation level of $3, with a longer-term peak potentially reaching $28 if market conditions coincide, despite the fact that repeating such a massive run may be ambitious. This is the anatomy of the alt-season. We had this analysis before, and I’ve mentioned that November 24 will start the Crypto Bull Run.

This optimism has been met with major speculation of ETH’s price from the crypto community and analysts, who are observing key indicators within the market to assess the asset’s trajectory. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Volume Hits $60 Billion As ETH Aims For Yearly Highs Ethereum Rise and Market Sentiment According to a report shared by a CryptoQuant analyst known as ‘ShayanBTC,’ Ethereum’s recent price performance, up by 35% in the past week, has been accompanied by positive sentiment in the futures market, providing a detailed look into potential short-term fluctuations. Shayan pointed out that the funding rates for Ethereum futures have remained positive, demonstrating strong demand and bullish sentiment among investors. Notably, positive funding rates typically indicate buyers are willing to pay a premium to hold long positions, which signifies market confidence. The analyst highlighted that this surge in positive sentiment was especially evident when Ethereum surpassed the $3,000 mark, reflecting a similar pattern observed during the March 2024 rally that culminated in a yearly peak. This pattern now raises questions about whether the current momentum can be sustained or if the market is vulnerable to sudden reversals, just as it did following a major rally earlier this year. What Is Expected While positive funding rates are a favorable sign of market interest, they can also indicate heightened risk when they become too elevated. Shayan particularly noted: Although positive funding rates generally signify healthy demand in a bullish market, elevated funding rates can be a red flag. The analyst cautioned that high funding rates may point to an “overheated” market, which could increase the likelihood of a long liquidation cascade if the price faces significant resistance or experiences even a modest correction. Elevated rates suggest that traders may be over-leveraged, creating conditions where a sharp pullback could trigger a wave of sell-offs as leveraged positions are liquidated. The CryptoQuant analyst further revealed that with Ethereum experiencing high funding rates in the current market climate, investors may need to “exercise caution and adopt strategies to mitigate potential risks.” Related Reading: Ethereum Could Be Set To Explore New Highs As On-Chain Metrics Light Up The analyst emphasized that with heightened funding rates comes an increased chance of market volatility. Rapid price movements could lead to liquidations, particularly if profit-taking or minor corrections unsettle the market. Meanwhile, Ethereum has breached the $3,400 price mark to trade as high as $3,424 earlier today. However, at the time of writing, the asset appears to have seen a slight correction with a current trading price of $3,289, albeit still up by 2.2% in the past day.

As BTC surged to new all-time highs, the momentum carried over to altcoins, with Dogecoin leading the pack in aggressive gains. This historic price surge has captured the attention of traders and analysts alike, sparking excitement for DOGE’s future potential in this bullish market phase. Renowned crypto analyst and investor Ali Martinez recently shared a technical analysis highlighting Dogecoin’s upward trajectory, setting bold targets that have left the community buzzing. Related Reading: Bitcoin Data Reveals Bulls Are Growing But Still Behind March 2024 Peak – Details According to Martinez, if DOGE continues to align with its current macro trend channel, it could reach an impressive $2.4 price target soon. Furthermore, Martinez notes that, under certain conditions, Dogecoin could aim as high as $18 should broader market dynamics and macro support levels remain favorable. With DOGE’s explosive growth and heightened investor interest, these next few weeks will be critical. If market conditions persist and BTC’s bullish trend holds, Dogecoin may continue its path upward, pushing into levels previously considered out of reach. Dogecoin Leading The Memecoin Dogecoin has taken the lead in the meme coin market, surging massively over the past few weeks and drawing attention from investors and analysts alike. With renewed momentum, DOGE has started an uptrend, forming a solid bullish structure that suggests further upside. Many analysts now see Dogecoin as a high-potential asset in the current market cycle, especially as broader sentiment remains positive across major cryptocurrencies. Ali Martinez, a well-regarded crypto analyst and investor, recently shared a technical analysis on X highlighting Dogecoin’s impressive setup within a macro channel. According to Martinez, if DOGE tests the middle or upper boundary of this long-term channel, it could potentially reach ambitious price targets of $2.40 or even $18. Martinez’s optimistic analysis aligns with the broader market view that DOGE, a well-established coin with a strong community and historical price resilience, is primed for significant growth. His analysis underscores the potential for this rally to continue in a major way, especially if BTC maintains its bullish trajectory, supporting altcoin momentum. For investors seeking high-risk, high-reward opportunities, DOGE stands out as a viable option with a potentially huge upside.

While volatility is likely, the opportunity for massive gains could attract both retail and institutional interest, setting Dogecoin up as a leading player in this bull market. DOGE Hits Multi-Year Highs Dogecoin has reached a price level not seen since May 2021, breaking several local highs established over the past three and a half years. The recent rally took DOGE to a peak of $0.43, marking a substantial recovery and signaling bullish strength in the meme coin market. After two intense weeks of buying pressure, the price has slightly cooled and is now trading around $0.382, suggesting some consolidation may be underway. A deeper retracement to the $0.34 level would provide a healthy setup, allowing the previous supply zone to flip into a new demand zone, supporting sustained upward movement. Such a pullback would likely appeal to investors looking for re-entry opportunities at a support level before the next bullish leg.

However, with strong price action in play, a continued move toward the next major resistance at $0.45 remains a realistic scenario. Investors closely following DOGE expect further upside, as the coin’s recent momentum could drive another test of this multi-year resistance.

SOL price is correcting gains and must stay above $200 for a fresh increase. SOL price started a fresh increase after it settled above the $188 level against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $212 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $210 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if the bulls defend the $200 support zone.

There was a strong move above the $195 and $200 resistance levels. The price even cleared the $212 level. A high was formed at $225 and the price is now correcting gains.

The price is now approaching the key support at $200 and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $195 swing low to the $225 high. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $208 level. The next major resistance is near the $212 level. The main resistance could be $225. A successful close above the $225 resistance level could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $242. Any more gains might send the price toward the $250 level. More Losses in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $212 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $202 level. The first major support is near the $200 level. A break below the $200 level might send the price toward the $195 zone. If there is a close below the $195 support, the price could decline toward the $185 support in the near term.

As this milestone was crossed, a notable trend emerged with short-term holders transferring their holdings to major exchanges, particularly Binance. According to CryptoQuant analyst Joao Wedson, this behavior suggests that investors with shorter time horizons may be positioning themselves to take profits, leading to potential selling pressure in the market. What To Watch Out For Wedson highlighted that the concentration of Bitcoin deposits to a single exchange like Binance is worth close monitoring, as it could impact liquidity and price stability on the platform, potentially reverberating through the broader market. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Now Overheating? Key Metrics Reveal Crucial Insights For Investors The CryptoQuant analyst emphasized three areas for market participants to watch closely. First, tracking the flow of BTC to exchanges, especially Binance, can provide insights into the potential scale of selling intent among short-term holders. As more coins flow to a major exchange, the potential for market impact rises, making it crucial to gauge the extent of any impending sell-off. Second, the impact on price volatility is expected to be significant as concentrated selling or profit-taking on Binance could create sharp movements, providing both challenges and opportunities for traders. The final area of focus, according to Wedson, is anticipating potential price movements based on these inflows and understanding how they may influence the broader market’s behavior. Bitcoin Market Correction Imminent? Meanwhile, further insights were provided by another CryptoQuant analyst known as “caueconomy.” This analyst pointed out that Bitcoin’s breakout of its previous all-time high has initiated a price discovery process. With this milestone, the market has seen heightened open interest levels, with more than $16 billion added to futures positions over the past week. This surge indicates a rise in leveraged positions, which can lead to heightened risk of corrections in the short term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Buying Pressure Rises, But Here’s Why A Pullback Could Be Coming However, the analyst emphasized that the market’s underlying fundamentals appear much more strong this time around, suggesting that any potential short-term corrections could be viewed as natural adjustments. Rather than signalling a broader downturn, these corrections may offer buying opportunities for investors looking to enter or accumulate during periods of market pullback. Bitcoin trades for $86,441, which has increased by 2.3% in the past day. Notably, this current trading price marks a 3.6% decline from BTC’s latest achieved all-time high of $89,864 earlier today. According to renowned crypto analyst known as Ali on X, key support levels for Bitcoin to watch are between $83,250 – $85,800 and $72,880 – $75,520.

Spot Ethereum ETFs Record Daily Inflows Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of approximately $404 billion, is now gaining ground on BTC, with the platform’s ETH token jumping more than 35% over the past week. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Be Set To Explore New Highs As On-Chain Metrics Light Up While the broader digital assets market has been buoyed by Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 US presidential election, additional factors may also be driving the recent industry boom, especially for ETH. A key data point is the substantial inflow of funds into spot ETH ETFs. On November 11, US-based spot ETH ETFs attracted a record $295 million in daily inflows, the highest amount to date. In comparison, the previous peak for daily inflows into spot ETH ETFs was $106 million, recorded on the first day these ETFs launched in July 2024. According to data from SoSoValue, the record inflows were led by Fidelity’s FETH ETF, which drew in $115.48 million. BlackRock’s ETHA followed with $101.11 million, Grayscale’s ETH with $63.32 million, and Bitwise’s ETHW with $15.57 million. At the time of writing, the total value of net assets held across various spot ETH ETFs stands at $9.72 billion, representing just over 2.41% of Ethereum’s total market cap. Meanwhile, cumulative net outflows from all spot ETH ETFs amount to $41.30 million. ETH Price Action And Resurgence In DeFi Renewed interest from institutional investors in Ethereum ETFs amid record daily inflows appears to be contributing positively to ETH’s price action. Related Reading: Survey Finds Almost 70% Of Ethereum Institutional Investors Engaged In ETH Staking Throughout much of 2024, ETH lagged in price performance among major cryptocurrencies such as BTC and Solana (SOL). However, Q4 2024 holds potential for a dramatic turnaround in ETH’s momentum. Analysis shared by Leon Waidmann, Head of Research at Onchain Foundation indicates that ETH staking levels are at an ATH, while the token’s reserves on crypto exchanges is heading toward record lows. This combination of record-high staking levels and reduced supply on exchanges suggests a potential supply squeeze, which could trigger a parabolic rally for ETH. Additionally, the ETH/BTC ratio seems to be recovering after prolonged losses, with the trading pair rising from 0.034 to 0.040 before dipping to 0.037 at the time of writing. The next major resistance for this pair lies around 0.040, and a successful breakout from this level could lead to more gains for ETH over BTC. At press time, ETH sits about 32% below its ATH value of $4,878 recorded in November 2021. Further, Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) activity seems to be picking steam. Data from DefiLlama shows that the total value locked (TVL) across Ethereum-based DeFi protocols currently sits at $62.36 billion, up from about $24 billion in November 2023. Over half of this TVL is tied to the ETH staking platform Lido, which holds close to $33 billion. Lido is followed by the DeFi lending protocol Aave with $15.21 billion and EigenLayer with $14.57 billion. That said, concerns remain regarding ETH’s “ultrasound money” narrative due to the token’s high issuance rate. At press time, ETH trades at $3,291, up 3.1% in the past 24 hours.

Savvy traders are now making huge hauls from these gains. With top financial institution, BlackRock, surpassing $1B in inflows a single day for the first time in its spot Bitcoin ETF, more attention has been directed to the approval of ETFs for some other top coins like Solana and Ripple. Given the new administration’s bullish stance on crypto, these ETFs are likely to become a reality very soon. This, combined with the long-awaited continuation of the bull run, has ignited a lot of optimism, as more investors flood the crypto market looking for new investment opportunities. In the midst of all this, Cutoshi (CUTO), a new hybrid MemeFi platform, has been silently creating a lot of in its presale, attracting predictions of over 100x growth when it launches. With built-in DeFi market features in this meme coin’s ecosystem, investors are closely watching Cutoshi as it progresses through its presale. Cutoshi Presents Lucrative And Rewarding DeFi Features That Have Attracted Bullish Sentiment Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Cutoshi (CUTO) has successfully distinguished itself from typical meme coins by incorporating practical features that can be used to make DeFi easy and accessible. The Cutoshi hybrid ecosystem offers robust use cases, including the Cutoshi DEX, which facilitates the swapping and exchange of digital assets across multiple chains. Additionally, Cutoshi’s community members and token holders can engage in Cutoshi farming, where they complete quests to earn token rewards. But that’s not all. Cutoshi will also offer a learning academy that has integrated to spread and teach the knowledge of DeFi to the masses – an idea that will empower many new people to start using decentralized technology. And something that makes Cutoshi stand out from other altcoins. This unique MemeFi cryptocurrency draws inspiration from the Chinese Lucky Cat, which is known for prosperity, wealth, and luck. Cutoshi invites users into this mindset for their digital assets while also promoting principles of freedom, anonymity, and monetary empowerment for all. And it all seems to be working since the newbie meme coin has been able to attract significant interest so far. Starting its initial coin offering with a presale price of $0.015, Cutoshi’s native token, $CUTO, is now up by over 72%. The token now sells at a new price of $0.0259, having just reached the third presale stage, and is continuing to attract investors from several financial sectors. With a presale revenue surpassing $775k, Cutoshi is poised to raise over $1M before the end of October, especially as interest keeps surging for the token. Meanwhile, the token’s buyback and burn mechanism is another attractive feature, as investors know that this will facilitate its long-term growth. The reason for this is that the buyback and burn mechanism will deflate CUTO supply while pushing up its price and demand, as a result of scarcity. With a capped supply of only 440 million tokens and an upcoming centralized exchange (CEX) listing post-presale, Cutoshi has laid the groundwork for significant future price appreciation, driven by increased demand for the token. Can Cutoshi Make Top 10 Meme Coins By Market Cap In 2025? Cutoshi has already shown itself as a hybrid cryptocurrency, catering to both the meme coin and DeFi markets, which sets it apart from 90% of meme coins. This unique attribute is not only a game-changer among meme coins, it’s a trend that is on its way to becoming a wider phenomenon in crypto, as traders realize that real utility is king. With Cutoshi pioneering innovation among meme coins, its chances of ranking among the top 10 meme coins in 2025 are high.

This may not be eye candy to investors who are currently on the sidelines waiting for the coin to hit $90k, particularly the release of CPI data set today, November 13. This news is perceived by analysts to have a considerable influence on market sentiment and the expected direction of the alpha crypto asset. Related Reading: XRP Price Patterns And 2024 Election Spark Talk Of A New Rally The Barometer For Inflation Reflecting changes in the prices consumers pay for goods and services, the CPI report is a main indication of inflation. Expectations about the CPI can cause more volatility in the bitcoin markets as inflation rates affect the Federal Reserve’s choices on monetary policy. Recent trends imply that should inflation remain lowered, the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates—historically this has had a positive effect on Bitcoin prices. Reduced borrowing rates sometimes inspire investment in risky assets such as cryptocurrencies, hence increasing demand for Bitcoin. #Bitcoin is up to $90,000 and I think we’re about to get started with the markets. The sweet spot is having a 10% correction towards the CME gap before we continue. I’m slightly bearish going into CPI tomorrow. pic.twitter.com/dfpUc2df1k — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) November 12, 2024 Growing Investor Trust Famous crypto expert Michaël van de Poppe, the founder of MNConsultancy, said that the current state of affairs in the crypto market corresponds well to the positive assessment of Bitcoin. In case CPI statistics would indicate more cases of inflation drops, he says that this would lead to growing investor trust and higher capital inflows into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Will Bitcoin Retrace? He also cautions, though, that unanticipated inflation rises could surprise markets and cause pricing adjustments all around. He anticipates a 10% Bitcoin retracement prior to the release of CPI data, targeting a range of $75,660 to $81,193. Market Reactions And Predictions As traders get ready for the CPI figures, the general market mood remains mixed. Some experts think that positive CPI numbers could lead to a rise in Bitcoin prices, but others say that people shouldn’t get too excited. Meanwhile, many investors are still optimistic about the long-run prospects of Bitcoin. The incoming administration of newly-elected US President Donald Trump adds another layer of complexity to market dynamics.

Meanwhile, as Bitcoin continues in its path for a major price discovery, the focus will be on the CPI data and the impact they have on digital assets. Such an unpredictable environment should be approached with caution by investors while they remain focused on economic events that could swing their investments.

This level could be the bulls’ last stand to regain momentum and prevent a deeper correction. With market sentiment hanging in the balance, all eyes are on whether buyers can mount a comeback at this pivotal support. A successful defense could spark a bullish reversal, bringing fresh optimism to Bonk’s price trajectory. But if the bears hold strong, the path forward may grow more challenging. This analysis aims to examine the meme coin’s recent price movement as it approaches the $0.00002635 support level, assessing whether this key point could spark a potential trend rebound. By analyzing technical indicators, market sentiment, and historical price patterns, this article seeks to provide insights into whether upbeat pressure can reassert itself at this level or if further bearish pressure could drive the price lower. Analyzing Bonk’s Price Trends And Recent Downward Shift Recently, despite staying above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), Bonk has shifted into a bearish phase on the 4-hour chart. After facing resistance at $0.00004002, the price has pulled back toward $0.00002962. This retreat indicates increasing negative pressure, with sellers gaining control. If the price fails to hold at $0.00002962, more declines could follow, possibly testing lower support levels. Also, the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) has fallen from 80% to 63%, signaling a decline in bullish momentum. As the RSI approaches neutral territory, buying pressure has eased, and market confidence in the uptrend is diminishing. Specifically, this change suggests that BONK may be entering a correction phase, with the potential for further downward movement should the trend persist. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Solana-Based BONK Is In Prime Position For Legendary Rally On the daily chart, after facing resistance at $0.00004002, BONK is exhibiting a growing pessimistic sentiment. A negative candlestick pattern and a decline toward $0.00002962 highlight increasing selling pressure as the meme coin struggles to maintain higher levels. This implies that market momentum is shifting, and BONK may face additional downside pressure if it fails to stabilize. Finally, on the 1-day chart, the RSI has dropped from 82% to 67%, signaling a possible shift in momentum suggesting fading buying pressure and a transition from an overbought condition to a more neutral or bearish phase. As the RSI moves further from overbought levels, it indicates weakening upward strength, with sellers possibly gaining control, which could lead to a price correction or consolidation. Navigating The Downturn: Can Bulls Push Back Bonk From Here? As the market faces a downturn and the price drops toward $0.00002962, the critical question is whether bulls can regain control and reverse the trend or if bearish pressure will continue pushing the price lower. If BONK reaches this support level and the Bulls can successfully defend it, a rebound could follow, potentially driving a resurgence toward $0.00004002 and beyond.

Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), the world's largest cryptocurrency, has rocketed since Trump's election win, and is now closing in on the long-speculated $100K mark. On Wednesday, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) topped $93K, but has since retraced a bit to $92.5K. Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) initial surge happened on election night on November 5. As Trump built his lead in electoral votes against Democratic opponent Vice President Kamala Harris, the crypto smashed past the $75K mark for the first time. It has sustained an upward trajectory since. Trump embraced crypto as part of his election campaign - a marked departure from President Joe Biden's current government which has cracked down on the sector. Trump has vowed to turn the U.S. into the ""crypto capital of the planet and the bitcoin superpower of the world."" This year, he became the first-ever major U.S. party nominee to accept donations in bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and other crypto assets. Since November 5 - Election Day - bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has advanced a whopping 36.6% . During this move, its technical relative strength index indicator has also popped up into overbought territory, which may have caused alarm bells to ring for some. As of Wednesday, the RSI on bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) stands at 84.86 which is well above the 70 level that traditionally marks an instrument to be overbought, but high RSI levels for bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) have happened many times before. Back in March 2021, the RSI pushed up to 93.06, while in December 2017, it touched 96.56. Other notable periods were August 2017, when the RSI hit 95.62, and November 2013, when it tagged 95.66. For bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) to hit the six figure target of 100K, the crypto asset would need to rise another 7.8% from its current level. For investors focusing their attention on bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), they can also monitor a group of bitcoin backed exchange-traded funds that aim to mirror the price action of the cryptocurrency for further exposure. Bitcoin-Backed ETFs: ( IBIT ), ( ARKB ), ( GBTC ), ( BRRR ), ( BTCO ), ( HODL ), ( BTCW ), ( FBTC ), ( BITB ), and ( EZBC ).

The same economic factors driving gold's rise could continue to benefit bitcoin. What’s curious is that bitcoin has not rallied alongside gold, whose price has soared to record highs over the past few months amid central-bank buying. By Erik Norland At a Glance Despite historical trends of significant price increases following halvings, bitcoin's price has remained relatively flat even amid its ongoing rally The same economic factors driving gold's rise could continue to benefit bitcoin It's been seven months since bitcoin’s latest halving , which reduced the pace of its annual supply from 330,000 units to 165,000. In the past, bitcoin prices have often gone on post-halving rallies ranging from several hundred percent to even thousands of percent. Yet, thus far, bitcoin prices have been largely flat, trading in a relatively narrow range, at least by historical standards, despite a spike to record highs in a post-election rally. This isn’t to say that the cryptocurrency hasn’t been volatile. Day-to-day price moves have grown somewhat larger over the past few months despite the lack of overall price direction. Source: Blockchain.com, CME Economic Research Calculations Gold’s Rally What’s curious is that bitcoin has not rallied alongside gold, whose price has soared to record highs over the past few months amid central-bank buying and concerns among investors about the size of budget deficits in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China. These large budget deficits have coincided with worldwide central-bank easing, which in the minds of many investors has made holding fiat currencies less attractive compared to hard assets. Source: Bloomberg Professional (GC1) Some of these same forces which are calling into question the value of government-issued fiat currencies and are boosting gold might eventually work out to bitcoin’s benefit. Bitcoin, after all, experienced a meteoric rise in price during the period of low and often near-zero rates in the U.S. from 2009 to 2021. This may have been partly due to bitcoin being new, for the first six years of its existence it was virtually the only crypto asset on the market, giving it a large first-mover advantage. Moreover, while central banks have been cutting rates, they remain far above zero. Core inflation remains 1-1.5% higher than pre-pandemic levels across most of the Western world, which may limit the extent to which central banks will be able to ease policy. While bitcoin rallied in Q1, prices haven’t moved much since March, even amid growing demand for ETFs, which may be increasing the volume of transactions on the bitcoin blockchain. In the past, a rising number of daily transactions has sometimes served as a precursor to rising prices. Source: Blockchain.com Lower Revenue That said, miners’ revenue per transaction (referred to as cost per transaction at blockchain.info/data ) has been exceptionally low in recent months. Historically, periods of relatively low payments to miners for matching trades on the bitcoin blockchain have often been followed by bull markets, although sometimes these periods of rising prices took a while to materialize. Miners’ revenue per transaction spiked ahead of major bitcoin bear markets in 2011, 2014, 2018 and 2022. When it returned to low levels, it sometimes took bitcoin prices a while to begin a new bull market. Source: Blockchain.com Given the growing presence of bitcoin ETFs, the reduced pace of new supply creation, the rising number of transactions and the relatively low level of miners’ revenue per transaction, conditions may be ripening for a new bull market in bitcoin. That said, the cryptocurrency has yet to break its previous record highs decisively to the upside.",,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|FIAT|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-11-13 18:03:00

MSTR's C Corp structure results in double taxation, which is a less favorable tax structure than ETFs such as IBIT. While MSTR has some debt, each dollar of MSTR market cap is currently only backed up by $0.30 of bitcoin, potentially resulting in less bitcoin leverage than investors expect. MSTR Short Thesis MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) is a C corporation that owns 280,000 bitcoins or $100/share, net of debt, and has a software business that is worth ~$7/share, for a total NAV of $107/share. Shares are trading today at $355/share and may have significant downside, regardless of the direction of Bitcoin. There are a few misconceptions that investors do not understand about MSTR that have led to extreme overvaluation, which I will share in this write-up. First, MSTR is a C Corporation, which is subject to double taxation on the sale of any Bitcoin gains. MSTR is subject to double taxation because shareholders who buy MSTR pay short-term or long-term gains on their trading gains in the shares. In addition, the company pays taxes on any gains in bitcoin realized at the corporate level. The company has been a long-term holder of bitcoin, and I expect that to continue; however, eventual tax considerations are important upon making an initial investment. Especially in a scenario where bitcoin really works well, like let's say to $1m, the company would pay capital gains if/when that is ever realized. Contrasting that to an ETF or investment vehicle that does not pay tax at the entity level is a meaningful disadvantage for MSTR versus an ETF like IBIT. There is no way to distribute the bitcoins or monetize the bitcoins without incurring significant tax liability. Because of this structural tax disadvantage, I think that MSTR eventually may trade in-line or even at a discount to NAV, given the superior legal and tax structure of ETFs. Second, MSTR uses what management calls ""intelligent leverage"". However, at this valuation, one dollar of MSTR market cap is only backed by $0.30 of bitcoin, and thus it is not a ""leveraged"" investment to bitcoin. Giving management credit, shares have significantly outperformed bitcoin because its premium to NAV increased from 1x to 3x over the last two years. However, on a go forward basis with only 30% exposure to bitcoin, MSTR might not keep up with bitcoin's performance in the future. I think that IBIT is a better option for investors seeking bitcoin exposure through a listed stock because of its long-term superior structure being an ETF which is not subject to double taxation and IBIT having 100% underlying exposure to bitcoin versus MSTR's 30% exposure. Further, MSTR pays a 2% fee for ATM equity issuance, which is a significant cost versus IBIT paying nothing for newly created ETF shares. While a small part of the story, I estimate the software business is worth $7/share. I estimate the software business is worth 3x TTM sales of $480m divided by 210m shares for a total $7/share. Sales are declining, and the business does not generate free cash flow. The business operates in the highly competitive field of business intelligence. I think this valuation is probably on the high side of what it would sell for in a private market transaction. Case study in February 2021. On February 9th, 2021, MSTR closed at $127/share, compared to its NAV $40/share, approximately 3.2x NAV (today's price/NAV is also 3.2x price/NAV). Bitcoin closed that day at $47,336. Bitcoin continued on to reach a closing high of $63,410 on 4/15/21, up +34% while MSTR closed at $74/share, -42% over that two-month period. Underperforming bitcoin by 76% in just two months from the same 3.2x price/NAV starting point that we are at today. And more importantly, declining significantly while the bitcoin price continued to rise. Given the significant premium and disadvantaged tax structure of being a C Corp, investors in MSTR should be aware that MSTR could decline even if bitcoin prices rise. In summary, I estimate that MSTR may be worth around 1x NAV or $107/share, given the disadvantageous tax structure of being a C Corp, which results in double taxation. Given each dollar of MSTR only has $0.30 of bitcoin behind it, I think there is a risk that MSTR underperforms bitcoin. Investors seeking bitcoin exposure may be better off buying a low-cost bitcoin ETF such as IBIT. Catalysts: MSTR's use of the ATM program increases the float and could eventually put pressure on the NAV premium. As investors better understand the tax consequences of MSTR being a C Corporation, some investors might switch their bitcoin exposure from MSTR to IBIT could reduce the premium to NAV that MSTR currently trades at. Risks: Bitcoin's price could increase significantly. MSTR's premium to NAV could increase.",IBIT|MSTR,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-11-13 19:47:36

Based on current analysis, ADA could soar to 139% within three months. While the one-year prognosis forecasts an amazing 168% increase, the six-month view is even more hopeful, predicting a 159% rise. Expectations For A Major Rally Analysts are hopeful that ADA will hit $7.77, with some predictions calling for a 1,700% increase.

The crypto asset manager gained 29.11% in the last six trading sessions. The stock has gained more than 108% so far this year, compared to an over 25% rise in the broader S&P 500 Index. GBTC is up 36% over the past one month. The stock closed 2.90% higher, at $71.23 on Tuesday. Cryptocurrencies have been on fire since Donald Trump won the White House, amid investor expectations that the 47th President's administration will embrace the sector. Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, has rocketed since Trump's election win, and is now closing in on the long-speculated $100K mark. On Wednesday, bitcoin topped $93K, but has since retraced a bit to $92.5K. Trump embraced crypto as part of his election campaign - a marked departure from President Joe Biden's current government, which has cracked down on the sector. Seeking Alpha analysts are cautious regarding Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), and have rated it as HOLD. While Seeking Alpha’s Quant rating has an optimistic view, rating the stock a STRONG BUY , with a score of 4.80 out of 5. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) has received an A+ in terms of momentum and liquidity, and F on expenses, dividends, and risk. Despite the positive sentiment, Seeking Alpha analyst Noah Cox of Noah's Arc Capital Management argues that high management fees and significant tracking errors undermine GBTC's value proposition, making it less efficient for Bitcoin exposure. “Competing Bitcoin ETFs, like those from BlackRock, offer similar exposure at a fraction of GBTC's cost, making them more attractive to investors,” the analyst added.

Higher Montly Close Suggests 8,000% Run Is Possible",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-price-to-20-8000-run/,"The Dogecoin price is starting to reverse some of its gains it made last week. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is down by 9% in 24 hours, but it is in a good place to reverse these losses very soon. Particularly, Dogecoin is still on track to close the month at a very long bullish candle. Notably, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade highlighted this phenomenon for the Dogecoin price on social media platform X. As pointed out by the analyst, Dogecoin is on track to close November above the previous highest monthly close level. Dogecoin Price To Make Higher Monthly Close Breaking above its previous highest monthly close might seem like a routine move during bullish rallies for some cryptocurrencies, but for Dogecoin, it signals something far more significant. Historically, each time the Dogecoin price exhibits this phenomenon, it has always marked the beginning of a stronger rally. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Crashes 82% Despite Recovery, Can SHIB Price Still Make It To $0.00008 ATH? Interestingly, this occurrence has been rare in Dogecoin’s 11-year history, making it even more impactful when it does happen. What’s more interesting is that whenever it occurs, it has always gained more than 1,000% in just a few months. The last time the Dogecoin price closed above its highest monthly close was in 2021, which ultimately led to a surge of more than 8,000% in about four months. This surge was what led to the current Dogecoin all-time high of around $0.732. Prior to the 2021 rally, a similar breakout took place in 2017. This earlier instance triggered an impressive 1,000% rise over the course of eight months. What Does This Mean The DOGE? Given these historical patterns, we could as well look forward to a repeat of a powerful rally in the coming months. According to price data, the current highest Dogecoin price monthly close is $0.35 in August 2021. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: Analyst Sets $320,000 Target As Wave 5 Begins At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is well on track to make a new highest monthly close this November. If history were to repeat itself, we could see Dogecoin surging between 1,000% and 8,000% in the coming months. Such a trend would not only be significant for Dogecoin investors but could also have broader implications for other cryptocurrencies in the meme coin market. As pointed out by Trader Tardigrade, a repeat of the first 1,000% case would see Dogecoin reaching $3.6 by July 2025. On the other hand, a repeat of the extraordinary 8,000% case would see Dogecoin reaching $26.9 by March 2025. Even a price movement between these two scenarios would result in a substantial return. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.372. Although it has retraced about 9% in the past 24 hours, Dogecoin is still up by 140% since the beginning of November.

Despite a Q2 net loss, Canaan has improved operations, reducing operating expenses by 10.4% QoQ and increasing revenue to $71.9 million. Canaan's decreasing debt load and undervaluation compared to peers position it well to capitalize on Bitcoin's bullish momentum and hardware demand. Risks include Bitcoin's volatility and potential supply chain disruptions from U.S. policies, but Canaan's strong order backlog and market alignment offer upside potential. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining hardware manufacturers see increased backlogs around and after the Bitcoin halving event. If they are strategic and deliver upgraded products timely, this boosts their overall financials. Canaan Inc. ( CAN ) began the rollout and bulk delivery of the A14 series miner in Q2. The A14 series miners come in both air-cooled and liquid-cooled models. The A1466 delivers 150 TH/s at 21.5 J/T, and the A1466I achieves 170 TH/s at an improved efficiency of 19.5 J/T. Canaan has also recently begun shipping a more efficient A15 series miner. Data by YCharts I initiated coverage on Canaan in June with a “hold” rating. The stock was (and still is irrespective of the recent upward movement) one of the very few Bitcoin stocks that have fully leveraged the Bitcoin momentum since the start of this year. Though CAN showed potential for growth at the time, inventory management posed challenges for the company. Mining hardware manufacturers often face inventory challenges as hardware becomes inefficient for Bitcoin mining at different stages of the Bitcoin market cycle and the demand for hardware type and performance constantly changes. Canaan’s Q2: New Hardware Launch and Improved Operations Canaan showed improvements in its operations in Q2. And the introduction of the more efficient A14 series miners was a major highlight in Q2. Canaan was able to beat management Q2 revenue guidance of $70 million by $1.9 million, recording $71.9 in revenue. This has prompted a slight increase in Q3 guidance to $73, which was also initially $70 million. Canaan reported a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss of ~$30.6 million, a slight improvement from $31.9 million in the previous quarter, reflecting cost-cutting efforts and adjustments for impairments and fair value changes. Q2’s net loss remained worrisome at $41.9 million. Total OpEx (Canaan Inc.) Total operating expenses saw a decline of 10.4% QoQ. Q2 total OpEx was $27.5 million as against Q1 total OpEx of $30.7 million, showing Canaan’s cost-cutting measures, especially in SG&A spending, with a notable reduction in stock-based compensations. This contributed to the reduction in operating loss, which decreased to $12.4 million from $17.7 million in Q1 - a 30% improvement. Despite improvements in operations, the bottom line was influenced by unrealized losses due to a fair value change of $10 million on Bitcoin holdings due to the asset’s price decline at the time. ASIC price index (hashrateindex.com) Q2 could have been a much better fiscal quarter for Canaan. Revenue in Q2 could have been higher if the market-wide prices of mining rigs had improved. The chart above represents the price per terahash trend of Bitcoin miners. We can see that the current price per terahash is a far cry from where it was during the last bull market in 2021. Average computing power sold in Q2 (Canaan Inc.) Canaan’s average selling price (“ASP”) in Q2, which is the average revenue per terahash of mining power sold in the quarter, rose by 33% QoQ. And the company recorded a total of $6.2 million in total computing power sales for the quarter. The higher total computing sales showed an increase in demand. And the more important metric, which is the ASP, showed an increase in the price of hardware. We could be set to enter the stage of the market cycle where the increase in ASP will be sustainable for the coming months. The increase in ASP indicates that customers are willing to pay more per unit of mining power, which is linked to higher Bitcoin prices and positive sentiment in the Bitcoin market. The $6.2 million in total computing power sales further supports this notion of rising demand. Normalized weekly price, Bitcoin vs mining machines (Coin Metrics, Bitcoin Magazine) Mining hardware prices are dynamic and typically move in tandem with Bitcoin’s price momentum. This means that in Bitcoin bull markets, the price of mining hardware increases, while in bear markets it decreases. From the chart above, notice how the price peaks of mining hardware coincide with Bitcoin price peaks. The current price of hardware favors Bitcoin miners, but is unfavorable for hardware manufacturers. Just a little digression here: this is why at the current stage of the crypto market cycle one of the important qualitative factors to look out for if you own the stock of one of the Bitcoin mining companies is how the Bitcoin miner is taking advantage of the current low price of mining hardware and expanding its hashrate capacity with newer, more efficient hardware. Though Bitcoin mining hardware prices have generally remained low since the halving, I believe that the recent uptick in ASP will be sustainable in the coming months as Bitcoin moves into full bull trajectory, as the asset has recently broken and now trades way past the $70,000 psychological level and is bound to stay above that level since the post-election rally kicked in, fueled by Donald Trump's victory and his pro-crypto stance. Data by YCharts CAN is beginning to take off here with a 55% price surge this past week. Though it seems every Bitcoin-related stock has seen some surge in the past week because of Bitcoin's own surge, I believe there will be a ceiling for Bitcoin stocks with weak fundamentals, as they may struggle to capitalize only on Bitcoin's momentum for long. Among Bitcoin stocks, Canaan remains undervalued compared to its peer group (of Bitcoin mining companies and mining hardware manufacturers). I believe Canaan has the potential for a higher run, as Bitcoin maintains bullishness, because of the timing of Canaan’s latest hardware release. EV/Sales peer comparison (Seeking Alpha) Also, Canaan’s debt reduction efforts in recent quarters means that it has become less leveraged and now trades at 2.45x EV/Sales. Despite the recent price surge, CAN still trades at lower valuation multiples compared to its peer group. Ebang ( EBON ), a direct peer of CAN, currently trades at 14.78x Price/Sales while facing declining sales ; CAN, on the other hand, has a strong backlog building up for A15 miners and will see boost in sales in the coming quarters, and rightly positioned for the Bitcoin rally, but trades at a 2.05x P/S. Price/Sales peer comparison (Seeking Alpha) Moving forward, CAN’s upside potential hinges on the success of the new A15 series miners as well as Bitcoin's momentum. Orders for the A15 series miners are already strong. Hive Blockchain ordered 6500 A1566 miners from Canaan just last week, in addition to orders from CleanSpark earlier this month. The timing of the launch of the A15 miners (already shipping this quarter, Q4 2024) is well aligned with the current market demand for more efficient miners, and this potentially gives Canaan some market competitive advantage. Below is a table of a head-to-head comparison of Canaan’s latest A15 series miners with BITMAIN'S newly unveiled ANTMINER S21+ series miners. A head-to-head comparison shows that Canaan’s latest miner offering is within the efficiency and performance expectation of industry demand, following the fourth Bitcoin halving.

Risks Bitcoin's volatility remains a risk factor for Bitcoin stocks. In the wake of the U.S. elections and Donald Trump's victory, sentiment have been positive in both the stock and crypto markets - the S&P 500 and Dow have been in positive territory, while Bitcoin has surged over 30% since election night. Bitcoin’s higher surge is indicative of a higher volatility risk. Data by YCharts Another potential risk for companies like Canaan is also linked to the recent elections, where new policies and tariffs from the Trump administration, which historically have been critical of China, adds some uncertainty to the supply chain for China-based manufacturers like Canaan. Bottom Line Canaan is well strategically positioned with the release and timing of its latest A15 series miners, which align with the rising demand for more efficient mining hardware. With a decreasing debt load over the past few quarters, Canaan is now less leveraged and better positioned to capitalize on Bitcoin market opportunities. With a strong order backlog for the A15 miners and a product line that aligns with the current market demand for more efficient mining hardware, Canaan stands to benefit from Bitcoin's upward momentum.",BTC-USD|CAN,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|MINING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-11-13 22:01:15
