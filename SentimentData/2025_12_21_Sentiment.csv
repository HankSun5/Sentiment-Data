The project demonstrated incredible demand by selling out both Phase 1 and Phase 2 in a matter of weeks, raising a total of $1.4 million from the sale of 25 million tokens . A dedicated community of over 3,000 holders has already formed around this success. The project has now launched into Phase 3 , and with 600,000 tokens already claimed, the pace is only increasing. Experts are forecasting that Phase 3 will be extremely brief as rumors of listings on major exchanges spread rapidly. Dogecoin Struggles While GeeFi Builds Real Value The market is showing signs of a shift away from pure hype. Dogecoin, a long-time favorite, has experienced a difficult year, with its price dropping by 60% in 2025 . On-chain data reveals a decline in active users and a shrinking total value locked (TVL), suggesting that investor interest is moving toward projects with stronger fundamentals. As Dogecoin’s momentum wanes, GeeFi is delivering a complete, utility-driven financial ecosystem. At its core is the GeeFi Wallet , a non-custodial app that puts you in full control of your assets. The platform also includes a powerful Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and will soon launch the GeeFi Crypto Card for real-world spending. Phase 3 Offers a Final Chance for Guaranteed Gains The GeeFi presale is the last opportunity to secure tokens at a low entry price. In Phase 3 , GEE tokens are just $0.13 . This price point locks in a guaranteed 325% ROI for investors, based on the confirmed public listing price of $0.40 . Early believers from Phase 1 have already seen an astounding 1,200% ROI . Time is running out, as analysts predict that Phase 3 will sell out in the next 2 weeks . This urgency is fueled by explosive momentum and talks of listings on tier-one exchanges. A $2,600 investment now could turn into $40,000 if GEE reaches the expert-predicted $2 valuation , yielding a 1,440% return . Boost Your Portfolio with High-Yield Staking GeeFi rewards its supporters with some of the most attractive passive income opportunities in the crypto space. The staking program allows you to maximize your returns with multiple options. Locking your GEE tokens for 12 months earns an impressive 55% APR . For those seeking shorter commitments, GeeFi offers 22% APR for a 3-month lock and 15% APR for a 1-month lock. A flexible staking option is also available, providing a 10% APR with no lock-up period required. Additionally, the referral program offers a 5% bonus in GEE tokens for every purchase made through your unique link. The Next 100x Gem Is Here In every market cycle, a few projects with real utility emerge to create significant wealth for early investors. GeeFi has all the characteristics of a breakout star, and analysts are calling it a potential 100x gem . Its successful presale and functional products set it apart from projects that rely solely on hype. This is the final opportunity to buy GEE tokens at a fixed, low price before they hit major exchanges. The fear of missing out is growing as Phase 3 approaches its end. Don’t wait, secure your place in the next big crypto success story today.

Scheduled alongside industry veterans Steven McClurg and Matt Hougan, the webinar will explore the early momentum surrounding XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and how institutional investors are approaching XRP exposure. Schwartz’s revelation casts a reflective tone over the event, marking the end of a pivotal era in Ripple’s technological leadership. A Legacy of Technical Innovation Schwartz, known in crypto circles by his handle JoelKatz, has been the cornerstone of Ripple’s technical vision for over thirteen years. As the architect of the XRP Ledger , he transformed it from an experimental blockchain into one of the most efficient and scalable networks in the industry. His innovations—ranging from consensus algorithms to decentralized exchange functionalities—have set the XRP Ledger apart, making it attractive to both retail users and financial institutions. Under Schwartz’s guidance, Ripple has positioned XRP not just as a digital asset but as a robust infrastructure for global payments. I think this is my last speaking event as Ripple CTO. — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) December 19, 2025 Institutional Focus on XRP The timing of Schwartz’s announcement is particularly notable, as institutional interest in XRP is on the rise. Asset managers are increasingly evaluating XRP as part of diversified portfolios, with ETFs providing a potential mainstream gateway. The upcoming webinar is expected to delve into strategies for incorporating XRP exposure, regulatory considerations, and the implications for blockchain-enabled financial products. These discussions underscore a broader shift in perception: XRP is moving beyond speculative trading into legitimate institutional investment territory. Stepping Back from Daily Leadership Schwartz’s post on X confirmed that he will step down from day-to-day CTO responsibilities while assuming an advisory role as CTO Emeritus and joining Ripple’s Board of Directors . He cited a desire to focus on family and personal pursuits while continuing to engage with technical projects and the XRP community. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Despite stepping back, Schwartz emphasized that his commitment to Ripple and the XRP ecosystem remains strong, signaling continuity even as the company transitions into its next phase. Ripple’s Enduring Vision Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and President Monica Long have publicly praised Schwartz’s contributions, describing him as a visionary technologist whose work has been central to Ripple’s growth. His innovations have enabled secure, scalable, and energy-efficient value transfer across borders, laying the foundation for the company’s ongoing success. Schwartz’s last webinar as CTO represents both a celebration of past achievements and a reminder of Ripple’s readiness to expand institutional adoption while maintaining technical excellence. Looking Forward As the XRP ecosystem continues to mature, Schwartz’s legacy will remain deeply embedded in its technological and strategic foundations. The upcoming webinar offers not only insights into XRP’s evolving role in global finance but also a symbolic moment of transition for one of the cryptocurrency industry’s most influential figures. While his tenure as CTO is concluding, his impact on Ripple and the XRP Ledger will continue to resonate, inspiring the next chapter of growth and innovation within the ecosystem.

This record-breaking peak, documented in CoinGecko’s newly released 2025 State of Meme Coins report, was followed by a steep 69% decline within a year, illustrating the extreme volatility and sentiment-driven nature of this asset class. The 2025 Memecoin Rollercoaster The meme coin sector experienced a historic climb and a dramatic fall in a short period, with CoinGecko’s report showing the market’s value ballooned to $150.6 billion last December, significantly surpassing the previous high of $88 billion set in 2021. This growth was largely powered by the “PolitiFi” trend, with tokens like Official Trump (TRUMP) gaining traction around the U.S. presidential election. However, the launch of other political tokens, such as LIBRA linked with Argentine President Javier Milei, coincided with the start of a major downturn. By November 2025, the total market capitalization had collapsed to $47.2 billion. This drop occurred despite a period of intense creation, where, at the height of the frenzy in January 2025, new token launchpads like Pump.fun and BONK.fun were facilitating over 73,000 new token launches every day. The report noted that the United States consistently showed the highest level of public interest in meme coins throughout the year, with its share of global attention growing from 20% to nearly 30%. However, overall global attention dropped by more than 80% from January levels, mirroring the market pullback. The landscape was also marked by significant risk. Apart from insider-heavy launches, the ease of creating tokens led to other widespread issues, including an increase in rug pulls, where developers abandon projects, and “bundling,” where insiders use multiple wallets to fake organic demand for coins. From Internet Joke to Mainstream Phenomenon The journey of meme coins began in 2013 with Dogecoin (DOGE), created as a light-hearted parody of the crypto market. For years, it dominated the space, but the 2021 bull run, fueled by celebrity endorsements, opened the door for a wave of successors like Shiba Inu (SHIB). The current cycle, which took off in early 2024, has been far more diverse, spreading from its Solana epicenter to networks like Bitcoin, Base, and BNB Chain. Still, DOGE controls about 47% of the sector’s total market value, recovering ground after briefly dropping below 30% during the height of Solana-based meme trading earlier in the year. Today, dog-themed tokens remain the largest category, but new narratives around politics and artificial intelligence have also captured significant market share. But beyond speculation, CoinGecko noted that some projects are building broader ecosystems. Tokens like BONK and FLOKI now support decentralized finance (DeFi) tools and gaming platforms, while DEGEN has evolved into the native currency for an entire social media layer-3 network. Looking ahead, the report suggested that the integration of centralized exchanges (CEXs) with DeFi may shape the next chapter, with major platforms such as Coinbase and Binance now providing in-app access to on-chain token trading. This has blurred the boundaries and could potentially attract more users to the meme coin ecosystem, according to the study.

Reportedly, the Japanese billionaire wants the full funding locked in by year-end, using whatever cash levers he can pull. Asset sales are already underway. More are coming. Margin loans tied to Arm Holdings are firmly on the table. Nothing here looks optional. This is Masa treating the OpenAI deal like a do‑or‑die move in the global AI race. The push has already reshaped how SoftBank operates day to day. Masa has sold the company’s entire $5.8 billion Nvidia stake, cut $4.8 billion from its holding in T-Mobile US, and reduced headcount. Other dealmaking has slowed sharply. Vision Fund managers now focus almost entirely on OpenAI-related work, according to multiple sources. Any investment above $50 million now needs Masa’s direct sign-off, which insiders say has brought most new deals to a near standstill. SoftBank pulls cash from assets, loans, and delayed listings To raise more money, SoftBank is preparing several routes at once. One of the biggest is the long‑planned listing of PayPay, its payments app unit. The IPO was first expected this month but slipped because of the 43-day U.S. government shutdown, which ended in November. Sources now say the listing should land in the first quarter of next year and could raise more than $20 billion if market conditions cooperate. The group is also looking to trim its position in Didi Global, China’s largest ride‑hailing company. Didi plans to list shares in Hong Kong after being forced to exit U.S. markets in 2021 following a regulatory crackdown. A source with direct knowledge allegedly said SoftBank is exploring exits tied to that move. Beyond asset sales, Masa has plenty of financial tools ready. SoftBank expanded its margin loan capacity by $6.5 billion, lifting total unused borrowing power to $11.5 billion. Those loans are backed by its stake in Arm Holdings, whose stock has tripled since its IPO, giving SoftBank more collateral room. As of September 30, SoftBank also reported 4.2 trillion yen, or $27.16 billion, in parent‑level cash. It still owns roughly 4% of T-Mobile US, a stake valued near $11 billion, according to LSEG data. Despite cutting back overall activity, SoftBank has kept funding select AI startups, including Sierra and Skild AI, even as most capital flows toward OpenAI. OpenAI pushes spending as compute demands explode The money matters because OpenAI needs it fast. The company has not yet received the remaining funds but expects payment by the end of 2025, as outlined in its contract. Both OpenAI and SoftBank back Stargate, a $500 billion effort to build massive AI data centers for training and inference, which executives say aligns with U.S. goals to stay ahead of China as Donald Trump sits in the White House in 2025. Big tech firms are spending heavily on similar infrastructure. Meta Platforms and others are pouring cash into chips, power, cooling systems, and servers, often bringing in partners to spread risk. That spending wave has raised worries about returns and the chance of an AI bubble if revenues fail to match costs. SoftBank agreed in April to invest up to $30 billion in OpenAI. $10 billion landed immediately. The rest depended on OpenAI completing its shift to a for‑profit structure by year‑end, a change the company finalized in October. Costs inside OpenAI keep climbing. Training and running models is getting more expensive as competition from Alphabet’s Google intensifies. Sam Altman recently told staff the company had entered a “code red” phase to upgrade ChatGPT, delaying other launches to counter momentum behind Gemini. In October, Sam said OpenAI aims to build 30 gigawatts of compute for $1.4 trillion, with a long‑term goal of adding 1 gigawatt every week, a scale where each gigawatt now costs over $40 billion.

56108531,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=248488,1766264111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,ChatGPT’s Revolutionary Update: Now Control AI Enthusiasm with Direct Personalization,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/chatgpt-enthusiasm-adjustment-openai-personalization/,"BitcoinWorld ChatGPT’s Revolutionary Update: Now Control AI Enthusiasm with Direct Personalization Imagine having complete control over how enthusiastic your AI assistant sounds. OpenAI has just made this possible with a groundbreaking update to ChatGPT that lets users directly adjust the chatbot’s warmth, enthusiasm, and even emoji usage. This development represents a significant leap in AI personalization, allowing users to tailor their AI interactions to match their preferences and needs. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts who rely on AI for market analysis, trading insights, and technical explanations, this update could transform how you interact with artificial intelligence tools. What Are ChatGPT’s New Personalization Features? OpenAI has introduced granular controls that allow users to fine-tune ChatGPT’s communication style. These settings appear in the Personalization menu and include three main adjustments: Warmth: Controls how friendly and approachable ChatGPT sounds Enthusiasm: Adjusts the energy level and excitement in responses Emoji Use: Determines how frequently ChatGPT incorporates emojis Each setting offers three options: More, Less, or Default. This builds upon existing tone settings like Professional, Candid, and Quirky that OpenAI added in November. The new controls provide unprecedented customization for users who want specific interaction styles from their AI assistant. Why OpenAI Introduced AI Personalization Controls ChatGPT’s tone has been a topic of ongoing discussion throughout 2025. OpenAI previously rolled back an update that users found “too sycophant-y,” and later adjusted GPT-5 to be “warmer and friendlier” after complaints about the model being too cold. These changes reflect OpenAI’s responsiveness to user feedback and their commitment to creating AI that serves diverse needs. Some academics and AI critics have raised concerns about chatbots’ tendency to praise users excessively, suggesting this creates “dark patterns” that could lead to addictive behavior and negative mental health impacts. By giving users control over these aspects, OpenAI addresses these concerns while empowering users to shape their AI interactions. How to Use ChatGPT’s Enthusiasm Adjustment Features Accessing and using these new controls is straightforward: Navigate to your ChatGPT settings Select “Personalization” from the menu Locate the new adjustment sliders for warmth, enthusiasm, and emoji use Set each to More, Less, or Default based on your preference Save your settings and start chatting These settings work alongside existing tone options, allowing for layered customization. For example, you could set a Professional base tone with More enthusiasm for motivational coaching, or a Quirky tone with Less emoji use for creative writing assistance. The Impact of Chatbot Tone on User Experience Research suggests that AI communication style significantly affects user engagement and satisfaction. Here’s how different settings might impact your experience: Setting Best For Potential Drawbacks More Enthusiasm Creative projects, motivation, learning new topics May feel overwhelming for serious discussions Less Enthusiasm Technical analysis, serious research, professional correspondence Could feel cold or impersonal More Warmth Personal advice, emotional support, casual conversations Might reduce perceived authority on technical subjects Less Warmth Fact-based research, objective analysis, formal communication May feel robotic or disconnected Benefits of Customizable AI Personalization The ability to adjust ChatGPT’s communication style offers several advantages: Improved Productivity: Match the AI’s tone to your task requirements Enhanced Comfort: Create interactions that feel natural to you Cultural Adaptation: Adjust communication style to match cultural norms Accessibility: Customize for different cognitive preferences and needs Professional Alignment: Ensure AI communication matches brand or personal voice For cryptocurrency traders and analysts, this means you can have ChatGPT explain complex blockchain concepts with technical precision during research, then switch to a more enthusiastic tone when exploring new investment opportunities. Challenges and Considerations in AI Tone Customization While these new features offer significant benefits, they also raise important questions: How much customization is too much before the AI loses its authentic voice? Will users consistently adjust settings, or will most stick with defaults? How does tone adjustment affect the AI’s factual accuracy and reliability? Could excessive customization create echo chambers where users only hear what they prefer? What responsibility does OpenAI have in guiding users toward healthy interaction patterns? These considerations highlight the complexity of creating AI that is both customizable and responsible. Future of AI Interaction and Personalization OpenAI’s introduction of granular tone controls suggests several future developments: Context-Aware Adjustments: AI that automatically adjusts tone based on conversation topic User-Specific Profiles: Settings that learn and adapt to individual preferences over time Cross-Platform Consistency: Unified tone settings across different AI applications Advanced Emotional Intelligence: AI that recognizes and responds to user emotional states Industry-Specific Presets: Pre-configured tones for fields like cryptocurrency, healthcare, or education These advancements could make AI interactions more natural, effective, and personalized than ever before.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Feels The Weight Of Quantum Risk Concerns, Industry Leaders Warn During the past three months, XRP has dropped more than 30%, keeping pressure on sentiment even as some commentators argue the token’s purpose goes far beyond short-term price moves. Retail Vs. Institutional Viewpoint According to health and finance commentator Dr. Camila Stevenson, much of the debate around XRP misses how large financial players judge settlement tools. Everyday traders tend to focus on charts and quick exits. Banks do not. They look at whether a system can handle stress, move large sums, and keep working when conditions worsen. Stevenson compared it to infrastructure testing, where strength and capacity matter more than the initial cost. XRP Was Built For Flows Based on reports from her recent video discussion, XRP was structured to act as a bridge for moving value, not as a speculative chip. With a fixed supply, the token cannot expand in quantity to meet higher transaction demand. Stevenson said that leaves price as the only way to support larger volumes. Analyst XFinanceBull echoed this view, encouraging market watchers to think in terms of flows rather than daily price action. Price Alone Does Not Prove Use Even so, market behavior still plays a major role. XRP trades in open markets, and speculation continues to influence price direction. A higher price may improve efficiency, but it does not guarantee adoption. Stevenson pointed out that many institutions position through custodians, OTC desks, and private agreements. These transactions often happen quietly and may not show up as sharp moves on public charts. Sudden spikes during positioning, she warned, would suggest instability rather than healthy use. Why Higher Price Helps Stevenson argued that banks moving billions would rather use fewer units that each represent more value. Fewer tokens can mean simpler settlement and less risk of slippage during busy periods. Large financial systems tend to fail when money cannot move or when settlement slows, not when prices fall. In that context, a higher XRP price could support smoother transfers if volumes rise enough to test the system. Related Reading: XRP ETFs Grow Past $60M As Price Struggles To Respond Market Reality Remains Mixed Despite the theory, clear proof of large-scale institutional demand remains limited. Regulation, liquidity depth, and reliable access still shape whether banks commit real volume. XRP’s 33% slide over recent months shows how quickly sentiment can shift, even as long-term use cases are debated. The idea that banks prefer a higher XRP price rests on future scale, not current trading patterns.

56108747,647314,1766264447,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56108747.jpeg,Bybit Returns To UK’s Crypto Scene Following 2023 Exit — Details,https://bitcoinist.com/bybit-returns-to-uk-crypto-scene-following-2023-exi/,"Cryptocurrency exchange ByBit has announced that it is relaunching a crypto platform in the United Kingdom two years after pausing its operations. The Dubai-based firm wound down its services in late 2023 as the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) imposed stricter financial promotion regulations. Bybit To Offer 100 Spot Trading Pairs To UK Users In a press release dated Friday, December 19, ByBit disclosed that it is reentering the UK’s crypto scene after its exit in 2023. According to the report, the exchange’s new UK platform will be offering spot trading on 100 digital asset pairs and peer-to-peer (P2P) trading. This new launch represents a return for Bybit who paused its operations in the United Kingdom in September 2023 due to the new FCA marketing rules that were set for enforcement later in October that year. These new rules , which centered around solicitation and a cooling-off period for first-time investors, came at a time when the global crypto regulatory landscape was only just starting to take shape. In its announcement, Bybit said that its fresh UK operations follow rigorous anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) standards and comply with the region’s financial promotion requirements. This was achieved through an arrangement with Archax, the first FCA-approved digital asset exchange, brokerage, and custodian in the UK. Mykolas Majauskas, Bybit’s senior director of policy, said in a statement: Our goal is to give UK users reliable access to global opportunities in digital assets. The UK is home to one of the most sophisticated financial ecosystems in the world, and its clear regulatory direction makes it an ideal environment for responsible innovation. In the months ahead, we aim to embody this innovative spirit by introducing new products tailored to the needs of UK users, always within a framework that prioritises transparency, and compliance. Bybit’s return to the UK’s cryptocurrency market appears to be strategic, as the region continues to make huge strides in terms of growth and adoption since the turn of the decade. The FCA recently estimated that 8% of adults in the United Kingdom now own crypto assets. It is worth noting that this ownership figure appears to be declining, having stood at 12% a year ago. While the drop marks the first dip in overall crypto ownership numbers in the last four years, the current figure is still double the level seen as of 2021. Total Crypto Market Capitalization As of this writing, the total crypto market capitalization stands at around $2.95 trillion, reflecting a 0.07% jump so far on Saturday, December 20. According to data from TradingView, the digital asset market has declined by over 2.6% decline in the past week.",Bybit|ByBit crypto exchange|crypto|crypto news|Cryptocurrency|UK FCA,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-20 21:00:47

The data says that “84.7% (100/118) are below TGE valuation” with the median token collapsing by 71% from its launch price, with only 18 tokens, or 15%, managing to stay above water. This means that roughly 4 out of 5 launches are below their opening valuation. Liew ended his post on X with a damning verdict, stating, “TGE isn’t early anymore.” Projects like Syndicate saw the highest drop, falling by 93.64% since its launch valuation, and it is closely followed by Animecoin, Berachain, and Bio Protocol, all of which have fallen by over 93%, respectively. How did the tokens launched in 2025 do? The data paints a grim picture of the 2025 token launch space, which was previously known to see price appreciation immediately after TGEs. Venture capital firms usually invest in these projects at valuations that can be 10, 100, or even 1,000 times cheaper than what retail investors pay when tokens become publicly available. By the time ordinary investors gain access at the token generation event, insiders have already secured their positions at way lower prices. Venture funding in the first quarter of 2025 alone reached $4.8 billion, and in Q3, crypto startups and projects pulled $4.59 billion in funding, with much of that capital flowing to late-stage companies. Meanwhile, retail investors face an increasingly difficult environment, buying tokens at inflated, fully diluted valuations that leave little room for appreciation. Could the fall be as a result of market conditions? Periodic sell-offs and sharp price adjustments in major digital assets like Bitcoin and Ether have also contributed to risk aversion among investors. Both leading assets have fallen from the respective highs they hit this year. The alt season that usually accompanies the rise of Bitcoin didn’t occur as expected. When it looked like the market was set to go parabolic, the market experienced the infamous “ 1011 crash ,” a sudden collapse in October that has left the market in a prolonged correction phase, accompanied by a series of liquidations and downward pressure. These crypto benchmarks have amplified the challenges faced by new token entrants, as investor capital flows toward safe-haven assets or established tokens. Industry observers have also noted that an oversupply of token launches has diluted liquidity and fragmented investor interest. Even as niche sectors such as memecoins or specific network ecosystems generate pockets of demand, the cumulative effect of continuous new supply has hampered sustainable price momentum. However, not all assets have performed poorly this year, as a few large-cap projects and established networks, such as Zora, Bedrock, Humanity, and Yooldo Games, have fared better, with YZI Labs-backed Aster’s token rising by over 700% from its launch price.

Cryptocurrency gains are usually the largest before a project becomes entirely exposed. When a token becomes evident, to a large extent, the upside is already discounted. One DeFi cryptocurrency based on Ethereum fits such a window of early positioning at this moment. It has already provided good growth, but major milestones are yet to be achieved. It is such an arrangement that has led to more and more people referring to the investment as the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a purchase to make before 2026. Presale Progress Mutuum Finance is at the moment valued at $0.035 and it is in the sixth stage of its presale. This stage has already been apportioned to more than 99% and this indicates that there is almost no availability at this price level. The token started at a price of $0.01 early in 2025 which is an increase of 250%. The project has already brought in over $19.4M and over 18,600 holders. More than 820M tokens have already been sold. Such statistics are important as they demonstrate continued involvement as opposed to a temporary spurt of interest. Constant accumulation in crypto investing can be a good indication of building confidence in the long run. The launch price will be officially priced at $0.06. Phase 1 participants are set to be placed up to 500% MUTM appreciation in case it is achieved. Every presale will add to the price of the tokens and the subsequent presale will raise MUTM by almost 20%. To a large number of investors this staged form brings out why timing is such a big part of early positioning. The Project Under Construction in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized lending protocol that is aimed at two lending markets. It aims at enabling people to provide assets and receive yield, and borrowers to acquire liquidity secured by collateral instead of selling their holdings. Users who provide assets are allocated mtTokens. These tokens are an indication of their portion of the liquidity supplied and increase in value with interest made. The design establishes a straightforward connection between the use of protocols and rewarding the users. The other crucial factor is the buy and distribute mechanism. The protocol revenue that has been earned in the lending activity is used to buy MUTM in the open market. MUTM bought in the open market is redistributed to individuals who deposit mtTokens in the safety module. Security is also at the center stage. Mutuum finance scores 90 out of 100 in the CertiK token scan. Moreover, Halbon security is engaged in a third-party audit of the completed lending and borrowing agreements. The presence of a $50,000 bug bounty on code vulnerabilities is another step in enhancing the level of trust in the protocol. Stablecoin Design Stablecoins form a fundamental component of lending demand, particularly in the periods of volatility on the market. It is decided that Mutuum Finance will assist with stable property as a part of its lending process, which will be able to appeal to customers with several predictable interest rates and reduced risk. This generally results in increased usage of the platform as soon as a protocol is available. Any lending platform must have accurate pricing. Mutuum Finance is to be built based on a strong oracle infrastructure, where Chainlink data feeds will be used. These feeds are useful in ensuring fair collateral valuation and safe liquidations through provision of sound prices in USD and native assets. The design also includes fall, back up and aggregated oracle options to minimize reliance on one source of data. Monetary wise, there is an opinion that MUTM is yet to achieve the growth in its turnover. In a bullish case, it has been estimated that there could be a potential of a 5x or 7x growth by 2026 assuming that their adoption and lending activity reaches the projected growth. These impressions are merely speculations, not promises, but they serve to understand why MUTM is being mentioned in the debate on the best cryptocurrency to invest in until the next cycle phase. V1 Launch, Whale Activity and Growing Urgency Official updates show that the V1 will be launched on a Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. The release is composed of core concepts, which include liquidity pools, mtTokens, and debt tokens, and a liquidator bot. The initial supported assets to be lent, borrowed as well as collateraled are ETH and USDT. Phase 6 selling out fast puts a vitality into it. The activity of late has been characterized by some interesting whale allocations such as single-person purchase of approximately $100k. This is usually taken by the market commentators as an indication that the big investors do not think that the current pricing can be sustained much longer. When Phase 6 is about to close, there is a tightening of supply and a higher price is introduced in the next Phase. To the investors who are considering which crypto to invest in nowadays as long-term positioning, this transition period can count more than subsequent headlines. Mutuum Finance is in its early stage of development and beta capabilities will be available on the Sepolia testnet V1. However, its mix of high presale velocity, safety orientation, and future achievements justifies why it is being regarded as one of the potential leading cryptocurrencies to invest in prior to the year 2026.

This powerful non-custodial wallet solution is proving its worth early on, with Phase 1 investors already celebrating a massive 1,200% ROI as the project enters Phase 3. The momentum is undeniable, and analysts believe Phase 3 will sell out within just 10 days due to swirling rumors of GeeFi listing on major exchanges soon. Utility That Outpaces Market Recoveries Solana (SOL) has staged a recovery with a 7% surge from recent lows, bolstered by institutional interest via ETF inflows and new partnerships. While Solana stabilizes, GeeFi is capturing the attention of investors seeking explosive growth, with many experts identifying it as 2026’s 100x gem . GeeFi offers a unified platform where users can manage assets across 14+ networks , solving the fragmentation issue that plagues modern crypto users. The ecosystem is expanding aggressively with the development of a DEX and Crypto Cards , tools designed to make spending and trading crypto effortless. Unlike speculative tokens, the GEE token is built on a deflationary model , ensuring scarcity increases as adoption grows. This strategic economic design, combined with a working product, the Android app is already live, strengthens the conviction that GeeFi is set to be 2026’s 100x gem . A Rare Chance for High ROI The GeeFi presale is currently in Phase 3, offering tokens at the attractive price of $0.13 . By investing now, buyers secure a guaranteed 325% return based on the confirmed listing price of $0.40 . The potential upside is staggering; a modest investment of $1,300 today could balloon to $30,000 if the token hits the analysts’ target $3 valuation , achieving a remarkable 2,210% ROI . Early believers from Phase 1 are already sitting on a 1,200% ROI , proving the project’s profit potential. Market experts have heavily praised the speed and success of the presale so far. They predict that Phase 3 will conclude within the next 3 weeks (or even sooner, given the 10-day forecast mentioned earlier), driven by explosive momentum and confirmed talks from the GeeFi Team regarding incoming listings on top-tier exchanges. This urgent demand highlights why so many believe GeeFi is 2026’s 100x gem . Maximize Earnings Through Staking GeeFi rewards its community with a comprehensive staking program designed for both flexibility and high returns. Investors can lock their tokens to earn 15% APR for one month , 22% APR for three months , or a substantial 55% APR for a 12-month term . For those who need liquidity, there is a flexible staking option offering up to 10% APR with no lock-up period , ensuring you remain in control of your funds. Additionally, the project encourages community growth through a referral program. Users earn a 5% bonus in GEE tokens on every purchase made via their unique referral link. This allows supporters to passively increase their holdings while introducing others to the ecosystem, creating a cycle of growth and reward for everyone involved. Act Before Phase 3 Closes Opportunities to invest in a project with confirmed utility, a live app, and a deflationary token model at such an early stage are incredibly rare. The GeeFi presale represents a fleeting chance to buy in before major exchange listings drive the price higher. With Phase 3 moving quickly and supply diminishing, waiting could mean missing out on what analysts call 2026’s 100x gem . The smart money is positioning itself now, secure your spot before the presale ends.

On-chain data suggests trader behavior on major exchanges is shifting into a more accumulative phase. Even as ETH continues to linger below the psychologically important $3,000 price level, this metric indicates that market participants are already preparing for a bullish move and a test of direction in the days ahead. Related Reading: XRP ETFs Grow Past $60M As Price Struggles To Respond Ethereum Leverage Ratio Prints New All-Time High Data from on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant shows that Ethereum’s Estimated Leverage Ratio on Binance has climbed to 0.611, the highest level ever recorded for this metric. The Estimated Leverage Ratio compares open interest to exchange reserves, and this offers insight into how much borrowed capital traders are deploying relative to available liquidity. Sustained increases in this ratio are a reflection of an increase in risk appetite from investors. It means that traders are committing larger leveraged positions in anticipation of favorable price movement. The current reading surpasses previous cycle peaks, and this environment can amplify price moves, since even modest spot price changes can trigger large liquidations when leverage is elevated. Ethereum: Estimated Leverage Ratio – Binance: CryptoQuant Another important metric points to an increase in Ethereum demand alongside record leverage. This metric is in the form of the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, which recently spiked to 1.13 on Binance. This is interesting because this level was last observed in September 2023. A reading above 1 indicates that market participants are executing more buy orders than sell orders. This combination of strong taker demand and rising leverage reveals optimism is now dominating short-term sentiment. The chart below shows the spikes in the Taker Buy Sell Ratio have more often than not coincided with periods of increased volatility. This buying pressure is now notable, with Ethereum trading around $2,900 in the past few hours, and this means that many traders are positioning ahead of a potential attempt to reclaim $3,000. Ethereum: Taker Buy Sell Ratio – Binance. Source: CryptoQuant Analyst Maps Out Ethereum’s Path Back Above $3,000 Adding a price-based perspective to the on-chain signals, crypto analyst Ted Pillows has outlined a clear technical roadmap for Ethereum’s next move. According to his analysis, ETH recently tapped into an important demand zone between $2,700 and $2,800 and has started to rebound from that area. This move occurred when Ethereum broke below $3,000 again this week to reach a low of $2,781 on December 18, which is highlighted on the chart below as a major support band. Ethereum Price Chart. Source: @TedPillows On X Pillows noted that holding this support zone keeps the bullish structure intact. If buyers continue to defend the $2,700-$2,800 range, Ethereum could build enough momentum for a push to the $3,100 to $3,200 region. That zone also sits just above the psychologically important $3,000 level.

Back told Carter on X that his posts made “uninformed noise” and that they were “not helping.” The exchange highlighted a sharper split in the Bitcoin community over how loudly to warn about future threats. Back Calls Out Public Warnings According to Back, Bitcoin developers are not ignoring quantum risks; the work is happening quietly. He argued the technology is still “ridiculously early” and predicted no real threat for a few decades. Based on reports, Back welcomed the idea of being “quantum ready” while urging calm in public messaging, saying loud alarms can cause confusion rather than useful action. Bitcoiners and developers are NOT in denial about defensively doing the r&d to prepare for future quantum computers. But they are just quietly doing research while you make uninformed noise and try to move the market or something. You’re not helping… — Adam Back (@adam3us) December 19, 2025 Carter pushed back, saying he had been “quantum pilled” after conversations with Project Eleven CEO Alex Pruden and that he invested because he became deeply concerned. Carter also pointed out that he disclosed his financial stake in a Substack post on Oct. 20, and he accused some developers of being in “total denial.” He warned that governments are planning for a post-quantum era and called Bitcoin itself a tempting “bug bounty” if the cryptography is left unchanged. after, obviously, because we wouldn’t have made the investment if we didn’t think quantum was a risk. — nic carter (@nic_carter) December 19, 2025 Experts Divided On Timing Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards told followers that a quantum threat could show up in as little as two to nine years unless networks move to quantum-resistant cryptography. According to public statements from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, forecasting models place roughly a 20% chance that machines able to break today’s public-key cryptography could arrive before 2030, with a median projection nearer 2040. Vitalik has said no such machines exist today but has urged early preparation because migrating a global system takes years. Metaculus’s median date for when quantum computers will break modern cryptography is 2040: https://t.co/Li8ni8A9Ox Seemingly about a 20% chance it will be before end of 2030. — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) August 27, 2025 Other voices are less alarmed. Multimillionaire investor Kevin O’Leary said he doubts breaking Bitcoin with quantum computing would be the best use of the technology, arguing it would deliver more value in fields like medical research. Such comments show how views vary not only on timing but also on the practical incentives behind a quantum attack. Research, Migration, And Market Signals Technical specialists point out one clear fact: there is currently no quantum computer capable of breaking Bitcoin’s cryptography. That fact has not stopped investors from placing bets on startups that claim to build protective tools. Castle Island’s investment, which resurfaced on social media recently, spurred fresh debate about transparency and whether public warnings help or harm the ecosystem.

As the market fluctuates between euphoric highs and painful lows, the real winners aren’t the cautious ones who wait for perfect signals, they’re the ones who jump in when the crowd hesitates. This year, the buzz is all about Apeing, a meme coin with massive upside potential. While many crypto enthusiasts are zeroing in on meme coins, established players like XRP and Tron continue to carve out their niche. Could one of these coins be the best upcoming crypto of 2025? The question is on everyone’s mind. Apeing has caught the eye of many investors with its community-first, culture-driven approach, and strong plans for utility. But it’s not just Apeing that’s making waves – XRP and Tron are also expected to see interesting developments as they push ahead in the crypto ecosystem. For those looking to stay ahead of the game, securing a spot on the Apeing whitelist could offer significant early access, giving you an edge over the competition. Here’s why these three coins are creating such a stir and why you need to keep an eye on them in 2025. That being said, discover the latest crypto opportunities and trusted insights to make smarter investment decisions with the Best Crypto To Buy Now. Apeing: How Whitelisting Gives You an Unbeatable Edge If you’re keeping an eye on the next big meme coin, Apeing is it. Whitelisting isn’t just a buzzword; it’s your VIP pass to front-row action in what could be one of the most explosive coin launches of the year. Why wait around and overthink when you can jump in early, secure your tokens, and watch them appreciate in value as demand skyrockets? The best upcoming crypto for 2025 is Apeing, without a doubt. With its community-first approach, meme culture roots, and strong potential for utility, Apeing stands out. Whitelisting gives you priority allocation, meaning you can secure your tokens before anyone else. That’s right: early access means getting in on the ground floor when the price is still low. How low? The early stage of Apeing is priced at just $0.0001, and with a planned listing price of $0.001, it’s a potential 10x opportunity. You do the math. Whitelisting makes you an insider, ensuring you’re one of the first to know when Apeing goes live. It’s not just about securing tokens early; it’s about avoiding the chaos and price surges that typically follow a coin launch. Once the crowd floods in, those initial 10x gains could be out of reach. But that’s not all. Whitelist members get exclusive access to the project’s updates, ensuring you’re always in the loop on developments and milestones. It’s the best way to get ahead in a market where timing is everything. Don’t miss your shot – join the Apeing whitelist now, and be part of the revolution. Apeing: The Ultimate Opportunity with Lowest Price, Maximum FOMO Looking to ape into an upcoming opportunity? Apeing is offering one of the lowest entry points you’ll see for any coin in 2025. The project is gaining traction with strong community engagement, and early supporters are already anticipating massive gains. At $0.0001, the price is extremely attractive. With projections estimating a listing of $0.001, that’s a potential 10x return before the real market momentum even kicks in. What makes this different from other coins? It’s the community-first approach and the genuine utility that sets Apeing apart from most meme coins. The project isn’t just about hype; it’s about delivering real value and ensuring that early investors reap the rewards. Don’t hesitate. Whitelisting is your chance to secure tokens before the rest of the market catches on. Join now, before the price skyrockets, and make sure you’re ahead of the curve. XRP: Ripple’s Moves and the Future of Payment Networks XRP has long been a staple in the crypto world. Known for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and partnerships with financial institutions, XRP continues to prove its value as a bridge currency. Despite some setbacks in its legal battles, XRP’s momentum is still solid. XRP’s price has remained relatively stable, and analysts are predicting potential growth if Ripple can successfully resolve its ongoing litigation issues. What’s exciting about XRP in 2025? The growing use cases in cross-border payments and remittances make XRP an appealing option for those seeking a more established crypto investment. If Ripple’s legal challenges clear up, XRP could see significant price appreciation, making it one of the best upcoming crypto options for more risk-averse investors. However, patience is key with XRP. While its price may not be as volatile as newer projects, its institutional partnerships and real-world utility make it a solid choice for those looking to hedge their bets in the crypto space. Tron: A Game Changer in Decentralized Applications Tron’s price fluctuations have been the subject of debate for years. With its focus on building a decentralized internet and fostering DApps, Tron is no stranger to controversy. Tron has seen ups and downs, but its ecosystem continues to grow, with an increasing number of projects relying on its blockchain for decentralized applications. For investors looking for a solid crypto with strong technological backing, Tron has the potential for long-term growth. If its DApp ecosystem continues to expand and adoption increases, Tron could see price spikes similar to what Ethereum experienced in its early days. The best upcoming crypto potential for Tron lies in its ability to scale and support the growing demand for decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. While Tron’s market sentiment may fluctuate in the short term, its long-term value proposition in the decentralized web cannot be ignored. For those with a more strategic mindset, Tron presents an intriguing investment. Conclusion Looking at the current landscape, both XRP and Tron have their pros and cons. XRP’s strength lies in its partnerships and use cases in the financial industry, while Tron’s DApp ecosystem shows immense potential for the future. However, the real showstopper here is Apeing. The Apeing whitelist offers early access to what could be one of the best upcoming crypto opportunities in 2025. Imagine getting in at the ground level, securing tokens at the lowest possible price, and watching them soar as the market catches on. This is your chance to ape in and secure your position before the prices explode. Apeing’s whitelist isn’t just an opportunity, it’s a strategy. Early access means more tokens, less competition, and the ability to move quickly when the market turns bullish. Don’t sit back and watch; act now. The Apeing whitelist could be your ticket to the next big crypto win.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/egrag-crypto-selling-xrp-now-makes-no-sense-heres-why/,"Recent instability in the cryptocurrency market has renewed debate over XRP’s short and medium-term outlook. The asset has declined by roughly 8% over the last seven days and is currently trading around $1.92, representing a drop of nearly 49% from its July peak of $3.66. This pullback has divided opinion among investors, with uncertainty growing over whether the move reflects a deeper trend reversal or a temporary retracement. Amid this backdrop, market technician EGRAG Crypto has maintained that selling XRP at present levels is a flawed decision. According to his assessment, the current price structure does not support liquidation, regardless of whether the broader market ultimately shifts into a bullish continuation or a sustained downturn. Selling Viewed as Unwise Even in a Bearish Scenario EGRAG has stated that even if the market has already entered a bearish phase, reducing exposure at this stage would still be ill-timed. He argues that market declines are rarely linear and often include countertrend movements after periods of weakness. #XRP – Why Selling Now Makes NO Sense: If you truly believe we’ve entered a bear market, then selling here is actually the worst possible timing. Bear markets do not move straight down. They almost always deliver one more relief move first. 1️⃣ This Is an Emotional Sell Zone 2️⃣… pic.twitter.com/VgkcV6NB9l — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 19, 2025 In such conditions, prices can experience short-term rebounds that offer better exit opportunities than those available during heightened selling pressure. From his analysis, if bearish control were firmly established, XRP could still register a temporary upward move before any further decline. As a result, selling into the current weakness may lead to missed opportunities should prices recover in the near term. Current Price Action Framed as a Correction The analyst also characterizes the present decline as a sentiment-driven phase rather than a definitive breakdown. He suggests that fear is currently influencing decision-making, which historically has not aligned with optimal selling conditions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In his view, more experienced participants typically distribute holdings during periods of widespread optimism, not during phases dominated by caution. EGRAG’s chart analysis indicates that the recent move appears to be a corrective reset rather than a structural failure. He further notes that even participants with a bearish outlook may find more favorable price levels to exit later, should the market stabilize or rebound. Long-Term Structure Suggests Significant Upside Potential In addition to near-term considerations, EGRAG points to XRP’s long-term price history. Previous extended consolidation periods have been followed by substantial advances once resistance levels were surpassed. Historical data show multiple instances where prolonged accumulation preceded strong upward movements of varying magnitudes. XRP has now traded below its prior all-time high of $3.84 for several years, marking one of its longest consolidation phases to date. Based on historical averages from earlier cycles, EGRAG estimates that a confirmed breakout could eventually produce gains several times above current levels. His long-standing projection includes a potential move toward $27 under favorable market conditions. Overall, EGRAG’s analysis concludes that selling XRP at current prices lacks technical justification. By examining market structure, investor behavior, and historical trends, he maintains that holding positions presently offers a more rational risk profile than exiting amid ongoing uncertainty.

The Three Pillars The upgrade is expected to introduce a Hub and Spoke architecture, where Hubs of capital are deployed on each network, and specialized Spokes are built on top to support tailored lending markets for different asset types. The end goal is to support trillions of dollars in assets and position Aave as a primary liquidity provider for institutions, fintech firms, and enterprises seeking on-chain credit. The company also plans to launch a new developer experience alongside V4. The tooling is intended to lower barriers for building applications and launching new markets on the protocol in 2026. Another central component of the roadmap is Horizon, which happens to be Aave’s institutional-focused market for real-world assets. Horizon allows qualified institutions to use tokenized assets such as US Treasuries and other credit instruments as collateral to borrow stablecoins, while meeting compliance and operational requirements. Kulechov explained that Horizon has already reached approximately $550 million in net deposits and is expected to scale to $1 billion and beyond next year. Aave Labs plans to expand Horizon through partnerships with asset managers and financial firms, including Circle, Ripple, Franklin Templeton, and VanEck. The third pillar of the 2026 strategy is the Aave App, which Aave Labs described as its primary consumer-facing product and a major driver of user growth. A full rollout of the Aave App is planned for early 2026, and the firm is targeting its first million users through the product. Kulechov said the combined rollout of V4, Horizon, and the Aave App is intended to support Aave’s broader objective of becoming a global on-chain credit layer, which is capable of serving both institutional capital and retail users at scale. SEC Ends Probe Against Aave Meanwhile, the master plan comes shortly after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) concluded its investigation into the Aave Protocol after four years. Kulechov confirmed the development and tweeted, “This process demanded significant effort and resources from our team, and from me personally as the founder, to protect Aave, its ecosystem, and DeFi more broadly. DeFi has faced unfair regulatory pressure in recent years. We’re glad to put this behind us as we enter a new era where developers can truly build the future of finance.” Interestingly, Aave is not the only platform cleared by the securities watchdog. The SEC closed multiple investigations that started under the Biden administration. This includes Gemini, OpenSea, Robinhood, and Uniswap, among others.

Conversely, for those looking to go long, he is eyeing the $87,420 level, which marks the start of the previous impulse and a key support box. If the price tests this area, Snyder will be watching for clear reversal patterns to trigger a scalp-long. However, if the market loses that “start impulse” support, the analyst believes a continuation short down to the $85,890 lows becomes highly probable. Once the price arrives at those deeper lows, he will pivot his strategy to wait for a reversal to long position. Finally, Snyder identified a major breakout trigger: when Bitcoin can gain and hold $89,375 (the top of the resistance box), the analyst assumes the market will finally squeeze toward the $90,400 region. While he doesn’t expect this breakout to materialize before Monday, he has his alerts set and suggests traders take the time to enjoy their weekend. Weekend Lull Keeps Bitcoin Range-Bound In an X post, analyst Daan Crypto Trades observed that BTC is entering the weekend in a state of relative stagnation. The analyst suggested that this is an ideal window for traders to step back and rest, allowing for a mental reset before the market dynamics potentially shift in the coming week.

The asset remains firmly stuck in the middle of its established range, lacking the necessary momentum to either break out toward new highs or break down into a deeper correction. Daan Crypto Trades warned that next week will likely be characterized by more choppy price action, as market activity often thins out significantly around the Christmas holidays.

56114793,https://timestabloid.com/?p=92879,1766275252,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,$100 XRP: Expert Sets New Timeline After Failed 2025 Prediction,https://timestabloid.com/100-xrp-expert-sets-new-timeline-after-failed-2025-prediction/,"Zach Rector, a widely followed commentator within the XRP community, has updated his expectations regarding when XRP could reach a $100 valuation. After previously promoting a much shorter timeframe, Rector now argues that a triple-digit price is more realistic closer to the end of the decade, specifically around 2030. This adjustment represents a notable shift from his earlier position. In late 2024, Rector publicly asserted that XRP could climb to $100 by the end of 2025, dismissing skepticism around that estimate in strongly worded remarks. With 2025 now nearing its conclusion and XRP trading far below that level, he has revised his stance and extended the timeline by several years. Revised Timeline Draws Community Criticism Rector’s updated projection has prompted mixed reactions across social media. Some XRP holders expressed frustration, accusing him of retreating from earlier claims without providing a sufficient explanation. One user questioned what developments, if any, had occurred to justify abandoning a near-term forecast so close to the original deadline. $100 XRP in 2030 — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) December 19, 2025 Other commenters were more dismissive of price targets altogether. Several argued that assigning specific numerical values years in advance offers little practical value to investors and may distract from broader considerations such as risk management and long-term conviction. A recurring criticism focused on influencer credibility, with some users suggesting that frequent revisions weaken trust when bold projections are later softened. Calls for greater caution in public forecasting also emerged, with critics urging commentators to avoid emphasizing highly optimistic figures that may not be grounded in verifiable market trends. Context Behind the Controversy The backlash surrounding Rector’s earlier prediction was partly driven by market conditions at the time it was made. XRP was trading under sustained bearish pressure, making the implied price increase required for a move to $100 within a year appear unrealistic to many observers. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Since then, XRP’s market position has not changed significantly. The asset continues to trade near the low-$1 range, with recent price movements showing short-term volatility but no decisive shift in long-term trend. While XRP briefly approached the $2 level, it has yet to establish sustained upward momentum that would support aggressive near-term projections. Diverging Views on Long-Term Potential Despite criticism of Rector’s revised timeline, optimism around XRP’s long-range prospects persists in some quarters. A number of commentators maintain that substantial appreciation is possible over an extended period, particularly if adoption and regulatory clarity improve. However, institutional and research-based forecasts remain more conservative. Market outlooks from firms such as Bitwise, Telegaon, and Changelly suggest that XRP could still see growth by 2030, but at levels well below $100. Bitwise, for example, estimates a potential upper range closer to $29 under highly favorable conditions. Overall, Rector’s revised outlook highlights the ongoing tension within the XRP community between aspirational price expectations and more measured, evidence-based projections.

This New Crypto Under $0.05 Is Already Surging 250%,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/what-crypto-to-buy-for-long-term-growth-this-new-crypto-under-0-05-is-already-surging-250/,"It is hardly ever a long-term crypto gains by chasing what is already moving. They are typically initiated with a project that presents actual infrastructure, constant demand, and obvious improvement, and the prices are yet low. That phase does not last long. Currently, one Cryptocurrency utilizing Ethereum in the area of DeFi and having a price of less than $0.05 is penetrating that window. Mutuum finance (MUTM) has already more than doubled and the main platform is yet to be launched. It is that combination of execution and timing that makes it a good contender on a long-term basis by some investors. The practice of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating a decentralized lending protocol that is based on two markets. The first one is the peer to contract model. According to this arrangement, users will deposit assets in liquidity pools and be given mtTokens. These mtTokens are reflective of their status and increase in value towards the interest accrued. E.g., assuming that a user deposits USDT and the pool earns an income, the mtTokens grow with time. The APY varies according to the demand. Yields are on the increase when the borrowing activity is high. At high levels of liquidity, rates are maintained at low levels. Peer-to-peer lending is the second market. In this case, the loans under more flexible terms can be taken by the borrowers. Depending on the asset and situations, borrow rates are either variable or stable. Stable repayment rates begin with a higher rate, but it is predictable. Loan-to-Value limits secure loans. In case the collateral values reduce beneath security levels, liquidations are done. Liquidators intervene and settle up a portion of the debt at a discounted collateral. This balances out the system and solves it. Presale Organisation and Demand Indications Mutuum Finance has acquired approximately 18,600 holders and has already managed to raise $19.4M. On a given supply of 4B tokens, 45.5% are used for the presale. That equals roughly 1.82B tokens. At this stage, it has sold approximately 820M tokens. Phase 1 was marked by the token price of $0.01. It now sits at $0.035. That is a 250% increase so far. The official price is $0.06. Phase 1 subjects will be set out with a growth of up to 500% in case they reach the growth. Phase 6 is now over 99% allocated. The presale demand has become faster with availability getting narrow. The price of each next phase will be higher, and the following level will bring almost 20% more MUTM. The compatible result of this structure is the speedy repricing because supply is reduced. The community activity is a contributing force. A 24 hour leaderboard is used as a reward to the best daily contributor of $500 in MUTM. This ensures that interest remains high with phases being closed. V1 Launch, Security and Price Prospect Official updates state that Mutuum Finance intends to deploy its V1 protocol on the Sepolia testnet in the 4th quarter of 2025. Its main characteristics are liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot with ETH and USDT being the initial supported assets. Security is a major focus. MUTM has a 90/100 score on the CertiK scan token. The final lending and borrowing contracts are also being audited by Halborn Security independently. Another protection layer is a $50k bug bounty that includes the vulnerabilities of code. These milestones are of valuation according to some analysts. Projections in a bullish point of view has it that by 2026 MUTM would have a movement of between 5x to 7x in the event of growth in adoption and lending activity. They are not promises but they serve to gain a better understanding as to why MUTM is mentioned in the context of what crypto to purchase now to realize long-term growth. Stablecoin and Layer 2 Plans Stablecoins are important in lending demand. Mutuum Finance will provide support to the assets of the stable which can appeal to users who are willing to have stable borrowing costs. This normally augments the usage of the platforms in both sleepy and swirling markets. It is also significant that layer 2 plans exist. Superior transactions and reduced charges enhance user experience. In the case of DeFi cryptocurrency platforms the scalability of an application usually dictates whether initial interest will translate into a permanent adoption. Mutuum Finance remains in the development phase, and beta functionality will be provided in V1 Sepolia testnet. However its 250% price hike coupled with high presale demand and the visible infrastructural construction location it in an unusual niche. To investors questioning what crypto to buy today and grow it long-term, MUTM is right at the edge of low price, increasing traction, and future events. It is usually at that time when long term opportunities start.

The premier cryptocurrency experienced incredible levels of volatility throughout the week, oscillating between the $90,000 and $86,000 range over the past few days. The latest market evaluation shows that the future of the Bitcoin price might be looking bleaker than mere periods of sideways volatility. According to a prominent cycle, BTC’s price cycle has turned and is entering a bear market. Bitcoin Cyclical Behavior Depends On Demand Cycles: CryptoQuant In its latest market report, blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant has associated the steady decline in Bitcoin price with the fading demand boom. According to data on the on-chain platform, the BTC demand growth has slowed down in the course of 2025, signaling the start of a bear market. CryptoQuant highlighted that Bitcoin has witnessed three major spot demand waves—triggered by the US spot ETF launch, the US presidential election outcome, and the Bitcoin Treasury Companies bubble—since the bull cycle started in 2023. However, the demand growth has slowed down since early October 2025. Unsurprisingly, this trend reversal for the demand growth coincides with the October 10 market bloodbath, one of the largest liquidation events in crypto history. The Bitcoin price has since struggled to mount any convincing recovery, falling to as low as $82,000 in late November. CryptoQuant went on to hypothesize that a key pillar of price support has been removed as most of this cycle’s incremental demand has already been realized. For instance, demand from institutional and large investors is in a downturn, with US-based Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) turning into net sellers in 2025’s fourth quarter. According to CryptoQuant’s data, the US spot ETF holdings have declined by 24,000 BTC in Q4 2025, which is a far cry from the steady accumulation seen in Q4 2024. “Similarly, addresses holding 100–1K BTC—representing ETFs and treasury companies—are growing below trend, echoing the demand deterioration seen at the end of 2021 ahead of the 2022 bear market,” the blockchain firm added. Besides the weakening spot demand, the Bitcoin derivatives market has also seen reduced activity and decreased risk appetite. CryptoQuant revealed that BTC’s funding rates have fallen to their lowest level since December 2023, an on-chain signal that suggests the reduced willingness of traders to maintain long exposure ; this trend is often associated with bear markets. Ultimately, the blockchain firm concluded that the Bitcoin four-year cycle hinges more on demand phases—expansions and contractions in demand growth— rather than on the halving event. In essence, a bear market tends to come after the BTC demand growth peaks and topples over. What Next For BTC Price? In its report, CryptoQuant revealed that the Bitcoin price structure has worsened in line with the demand weakness. The flagship cryptocurrency is currently trading below its 365-day moving average, a key long-term support level that has historically separated bull and bear phases. According to CryptoQuant, the downside reference points suggest that the Bitcoin bear market might not be as deep as feared. As in previous bear seasons, the realized price—currently around $56,000—has been identified as the potential bottom. This implies a possible 55% correction from the latest all-time high, Bitcoin’s smallest drawdown on record (during a bear market). Meanwhile, the market leader has its intermediate support level around $70,000. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $88,170, reflecting a 3% jump in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin demand growth|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|btc price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-21 01:00:19

Analysts indicate that the bull rally could unfold slowly, suggesting a gradual climb to new highs. Traders are being urged to prepare for heightened volatility and plan their strategies carefully to protect gains while staying positioned for potential upside. Slow Climb Expected In Bitcoin’s Final Bull Run A market expert who calls himself Crypto Waterman has shared his latest outlook on Bitcoin’s final bull run. He expects the last leg of the rally to be a slow and deliberate process rather than a sudden spike. According to him, the parabolic move could take roughly one to two months to complete, potentially unfolding during the first quarter of 2026. Related Reading: XRP ETFs Grow Past $60M As Price Struggles To Respond Crypto Waterman warns that before this final surge, there will likely be intense market pressure to push out inexperienced investors. This period could include sudden shakeouts and volatility designed to test retail traders’ resolve. He also stated that many investors may exit too early as euphoria builds, while others will become bag holders as prices climb rapidly. The analyst emphasized that smart wallets and BTC whales tend to sell into strength during this phase. For average investors, he suggests a careful strategy of dollar-cost averaging out of positions once gains become significant. Observing coins doubling in a single day could be an early signal to start reducing exposure. Crypto Waterman also shares his personal approach to profit-taking, which involves selling 25% of his holdings when the price doubles. If Bitcoin triples, he says that he would offload 30-40% and consider selling nearly everything if the market feels overheated. He also stated that he would leave a small portion, “a moonbag,” to capture any remaining upside potential. Analyst Warns Last Chance To Accumulate BTC Crypto Waterman offers guidance for traders looking to position themselves ahead of Bitcoin’s anticipated parabolic move. He suggests that the next two to three weeks may be the last chance to accumulate Bitcoin before the rally begins. He also highlighted the importance of timing, recommending that investors buy Bitcoin during significant dips rather than chasing rising prices. The analyst has hinted at knowing the timing of the expected market shakeout, emphasizing that market conditions over the coming days will determine the exact moment it happens. He warns that traders should prepare for volatility and short-term price fluctuations. He also reminds investors to stay disciplined during periods of market euphoria. Related Reading: Bitcoin Feels The Weight Of Quantum Risk Concerns, Industry Leaders Warn He shared that investors and traders should follow the “Warren Buffett” principle of being cautious when others are greedy and opportunistic when others are fearful. This strategy eliminates emotional decision-making in trading and investing, allowing holders to make rational moves as the Bitcoin market approaches its final bull phase.

But lithium, copper, aluminum, and steel have also managed to end up running right beside them, instead of trailing behind, thanks to insanely strong demand (not fear-buying), along with AI build-out and energy transition. Jim Wiederhold, commodity index product manager at Bloomberg, said the world is “moving from a fossil-fueled economy to one powered by technologies consisting of metals. The future is metal.” Demand from AI and clean energy pushes industrial metals up Year-to-date, copper has rallied by more than 34%, steel gained 27%, while aluminum added 14%, and lithium surged by 30%. Every tech-driven industry seemed to rely on a blend of these metals, and that kept prices on a steady upward grind. Sadly though, supply problems hit the copper market harder than anything else. In May, flooding at Ivanhoe’s Kamoa-Kakula operation in the Democratic Republic of Congo shut down one of the biggest copper mines on earth. A few months later, a tunnel collapse in Chile damaged another major mine, then a mudslide hit Freeport-McMoRan’s Grasberg mine in Indonesia, cutting even more supply. Lithium traders also felt pressure when the Chinese government temporarily halted operations at one of CATL’s major mining sites. Prices reacted fast. Aluminum and steel producers ran into their own issues as energy prices climbed because of the Ukraine war and AI’s heavy electricity needs. ING Bank said China was nearing its aluminum cap, which limited how much extra supply the country could push into the market. Wiederhold said, “When there’s geopolitical risk cropping up, or something with a government doing export bans to try and raise prices, this is a direct beneficiary of price appreciation.” Tariffs and supply fears add new volatility as producers respond The White House added more fuel when President Donald Trump approved 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The same tariff hit copper-intensive goods like wiring and tubes, though raw copper ore was not included. When Trump first announced the tariff plan in July, traders rushed to pull physical copper out of overseas warehouses and move it into the U.S. before the duties took effect. Prices spiked immediately. Once the administration clarified that raw ore would remain exempt, copper prices cooled off. Even with that correction, supply anxiety didn’t go anywhere.LPL Financial chief technical strategist Adam Turnquist said rising requests to remove copper from LME warehouses “exacerbated fears over a global supply shortage.” Metal traders reacted quickly. Glencore, one of the biggest commodity firms worldwide, is preparing to lift its copper production from 850 kilotons in 2025 to 1,000 kt in 2028 and 1,600 kt by 2035, based on research from Jefferies. In Southeast Asia, Indonesian aluminum smelters began expanding refining capacity to catch rising demand. Jigna Gibb, head of commodities and crypto index products at Bloomberg, said trading desks are increasing their physical positions because “energy and industrial metals are the key ones where you see a lot more positioning.” All of this connected back to AI’s booming electricity appetite. Aluminum refiners need cheap energy, and rising AI power use is already cutting into their margins and raising operating costs. New grid expansions, more data centers, and wiring inside AI chips continue to lift demand for copper and steel. Lithium stayed tight because of China’s control over much of global supply. EVs, energy storage systems, and other parts of the energy transition kept pulling lithium into long-term contracts. Wiederhold said the world is increasingly “powered by technologies consisting of metals,” adding, “We’re just not going to have enough supply for the projected demand.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

Republican Representative Max Miller of Ohio and Democratic Representative Steven Horsford of Nevada are behind the effort, according to a letter jointly sent by both offices on Saturday. Max and Steven sit on the House Ways and Means Committee, which controls tax policy, and they are the first members of that panel to put forward a written framework dealing only with crypto taxes. Stablecoin payments under $200 will get capital gains relief under bipartisan tax bill The lawmakers said they chose to start with stablecoins because Congress has already passed laws governing how those tokens operate. The draft proposal will also exempt transactions under $200 made with “regulated, dollar‑pegged” stablecoins from capital gains taxes, but the Representatives made it clear that this does not apply to other forms of crypto, and it does not cover trading activity beyond those limited payments. Max said the current tax system does not match how people actually use crypto today. “America’s tax code has failed to keep pace with modern financial technology. This bipartisan legislation brings clarity, parity, fairness, and common sense to the taxation of digital assets,” he said. The draft mixes early legislative language with policy goals and has not yet been turned into a formal bill. Steven’s office said the goal is cooperation inside the committee. “The hope is that the committee will work together in good faith to set these critical rules of the road,” a spokesperson said. The draft also addresses how staking and mining rewards are taxed. Under IRS guidance issued during the Biden administration, those rewards are taxed as income at the moment they are received. House Republicans argue that approach taxes value before a gain exists. Progressive Democrats argue the rewards function like pay and should be taxed immediately. Max and Steven propose a middle option. Taxpayers could choose to delay taxes on staking rewards for up to five years. At the end of that period, the rewards would be taxed as income based on their fair market value. The approach differs from a proposal introduced earlier this year by Senator Cynthia Lummis , which would delay taxes until the rewards are sold. Meanwhile, Max and Steven’s proposal also allows mark‑to‑market accounting, letting traders report unrealized gains and losses each year, which can offset income like wages.

The judges said the lower court acted too harshly by canceling the 2018 arrangement without giving Tesla a real chance to argue what fair pay should look like. Forbes said that ruling sent Elon’s net worth to $769 billion, putting him far ahead of Google co-founder Larry Page, who sits at $252.6 billion. The new ranking also places Elon closer than ever to becoming the first trillionaire on the planet. Court decision drives new attention to Tesla and SpaceX At the same time this court outcome landed, Elon’s other giant business, SpaceX, is preparing an insider share sale that would value the company at $800 billion, which would make it the most expensive privately held company in the world. If it becomes public next year, it would be the largest listing ever. Traders calling themselves “Elon exposure” seekers are watching for a chance to buy into the company after years of waiting. Some investors say a SpaceX listing could lift Tesla again because both companies feed into each other. They think a public stock offering could push more attention toward Elon overall, which has already happened in the past whenever something major occurred inside his business network. That idea is already floating around the market as people try to guess how fast the IPO could move and what it would mean for both companies. Tesla’s stock has also been rallying even more, thanks to the attention around SpaceX. At press time, it is up 48% year-to-date. SpaceX plans fuel new proposal from Billy Ackman Then Billy Ackman jumped in with his own idea on X, writing directly to Elon: “@elonmusk, what if we took @SpaceX public by merging it with Pershing Square SPARC Holdings, Ltd. (SPARC) a new form of acquisition company that was approved by the @SECGov.” Billy said he has a full plan for how Tesla shareholders could receive SPARC special purpose acquisition rights, which would let them invest in the SpaceX listing or sell their rights if they want cash instead, adding that this setup would open the process to every Tesla shareholder. Billy said SPARC would run due diligence, bring $4 billion in capital at a fixed share price, and skip underwriting fees, founder stock, and shareholder warrants. The investor then explained that a 100% common-stock structure would keep things clean and low-cost. In Billy’s words:- “Assuming we issue 0.5 SPARs for each share of Tesla, there would be 1.723 billion SPARs outstanding including the 61.1 million SPARs that are already outstanding. Since one SPAR would be exercisable for two shares of SpaceX, the SPARs would be exercisable for 3.446 billion total SpaceX shares.” He gave two exercise-price examples. At $11.03, SpaceX could raise $42 billion, with $38 billion from SPAR holders and $4 billion from Pershing Square. At $42, SpaceX could raise $148.7 billion, with $144.7 billion from SPARs and $4 billion from Pershing Square. Billy said SPARC didn’t care how many shares were primary or secondary, which would give the company breathing room. He also said SPARC could sign a firm agreement within 45 days, making the deal certain except for SEC approval. He added they could begin right away and announce everything by mid-February, and finished with: “To Mars and beyond!

While holding above $75.20 keeps the outlook positive, a break below this level would signal bearish pressure. Conversely, a retest of the $79.60 resistance coupled with signs of weakness could present a potential shorting opportunity. Litecoin Mirrors Bitcoin’s Momentum In Daily Close Based on CryptoWzrd analysis, both the daily candles for Litecoin and the LTC/BTC ratio closed in a bullish orientation today, largely mirroring the positive sentiment set by Bitcoin. However, the analyst cautioned that for the LTC/BTC pair to confirm a sustained bullish turn, it must continue to print more bullish daily candles from its current location. Related Reading: Why The Litecoin Price Could Stage A 33% Rally To $110 CryptoWzrd emphasized that Litecoin’s overall movement remains highly tethered to Bitcoin’s general market sentiment. For Litecoin, the immediate key to maintaining a favorable outlook is holding above the $80 level. This price point is crucial as it keeps the asset firmly within positive territory and above a critical support line. Conversely, the analyst warned that a decisive break and close below the $80 support would instantly shift the outlook to bearish. Such a failure would validate further downside, targeting the next significant support level, which is projected to be around $68. This $80 mark is therefore the structural line separating positive and negative momentum. Given the weekend, the analyst’s immediate trading focus will shift to lower-timeframe charts in search of quick scalp opportunities for the following day. Despite this tactical shift, he advises maintaining rational expectations, acknowledging that low-liquidity weekend sessions often limit decisive moves and necessitate caution. Intraday Volatility Sets The Stage For Key Trades CryptoWzrd added to his analysis by noting that the intraday chart for LTC had been quite volatile, requiring a calculated approach to entries. He outlined a clear positive scenario if the price were to successfully retest the key $75.20 support level and then follow up by printing a visible bullish reversal pattern. Related Reading: Litecoin Comeback: Bullish Reversal Sets The Stage For $76.85 Target However, the analyst noted that a decisive break below the $75.20 support would invalidate the bullish hope and signal a short continuation trade. Another scenario involves a move up to test the $79.60 resistance level, where a clear bearish reversal pattern would confirm a rejection and trigger a short entry. Essentially, the strategy relies on waiting for the price to confirm its direction at the defined boundaries. CryptoWzrd concluded by advising traders to exercise patience and wait for the next mature trade opportunity to fully unfold and validate the intended direction before committing to a position.

This underperformance comes despite strong underlying fundamentals, where its price is being governed by the mechanics of hedging and synthetic leverage rather than the conviction of its holders. Network security remains strong, long-term holders continue to dominate supply, and institutional access has never been broader. How This Cycle Looks Different For Bitcoin There’s no satisfying explanation for one of the strangest market outcomes of the year. An entrepreneur, Bitcoin investor, and founder of Wealth Mastery, Lark Davis, has mentioned on X that Bitcoin is the only asset underperforming, while gold and stocks are printing all-time highs, and 2025 was supposed to be the golden moment for BTC. Davis highlighted that in 2025, the United States had a pro-BTC administration for the first time in history, and there was demand for the cryptocurrency and peak adoption from institutions and nation-states. Macro conditions turned supportive, and Wall Street has effectively rolled out the red carpet for BTC. At the same time, Michael Saylor’s Strategy purchased a BTC supply greater than the average daily production of miners. Despite all this bullishness, BTC is still down 6% from its yearly open and still around 30% below its all-time high. Meanwhile, the rest of the crypto looks worse as altcoins have been crushed, with many down 80% to 90% over the last two years. The 2026 Bitcoin chart will be the most important to watch. A full-time crypto trader and investor, Daan Crypto Trades, highlighted that Global liquidity is the metric to watch for BTC’s long-term performance. It’s not a holy grail that works every single day, but there are shorter-term deviations right now. When overlaying global liquidity growth with long-term price performance, it shows that the peaks and troughs align with remarkable accuracy. Daan believes that this BTC setup is more important than a rate cut, and the overall stock market performance will reveal a good signal. Whale Accumulation While The Market Hesitates While fear dominates across the market, a whale has been quietly buying BTC since yesterday. Crypto educator Wilberforce Theophilus revealed that over the past 24 hours, more than 2,509.2 BTC, which is approximately $221 million worth of BTC, has been accumulated. According to Wilberforce, December 2020 was objectively worse than today, but in January 2021, BTC was $1 and then rallied to $19,000. December 2025 doesn’t stand out as extremely bearish when viewed through a long-term lens. “I have just one piece of advice: HODL and WAIT,” the expert noted.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Daan Crypto Trades|Lark Davis|michael saylor|Strategy|Wilberforce Theophilus,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-21 03:00:21
