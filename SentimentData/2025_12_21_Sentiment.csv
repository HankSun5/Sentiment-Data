The project demonstrated incredible demand by selling out both Phase 1 and Phase 2 in a matter of weeks, raising a total of $1.4 million from the sale of 25 million tokens . A dedicated community of over 3,000 holders has already formed around this success. The project has now launched into Phase 3 , and with 600,000 tokens already claimed, the pace is only increasing. Experts are forecasting that Phase 3 will be extremely brief as rumors of listings on major exchanges spread rapidly. Dogecoin Struggles While GeeFi Builds Real Value The market is showing signs of a shift away from pure hype. Dogecoin, a long-time favorite, has experienced a difficult year, with its price dropping by 60% in 2025 . On-chain data reveals a decline in active users and a shrinking total value locked (TVL), suggesting that investor interest is moving toward projects with stronger fundamentals. As Dogecoin’s momentum wanes, GeeFi is delivering a complete, utility-driven financial ecosystem. At its core is the GeeFi Wallet , a non-custodial app that puts you in full control of your assets. The platform also includes a powerful Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and will soon launch the GeeFi Crypto Card for real-world spending. Phase 3 Offers a Final Chance for Guaranteed Gains The GeeFi presale is the last opportunity to secure tokens at a low entry price. In Phase 3 , GEE tokens are just $0.13 . This price point locks in a guaranteed 325% ROI for investors, based on the confirmed public listing price of $0.40 . Early believers from Phase 1 have already seen an astounding 1,200% ROI . Time is running out, as analysts predict that Phase 3 will sell out in the next 2 weeks . This urgency is fueled by explosive momentum and talks of listings on tier-one exchanges. A $2,600 investment now could turn into $40,000 if GEE reaches the expert-predicted $2 valuation , yielding a 1,440% return . Boost Your Portfolio with High-Yield Staking GeeFi rewards its supporters with some of the most attractive passive income opportunities in the crypto space. The staking program allows you to maximize your returns with multiple options. Locking your GEE tokens for 12 months earns an impressive 55% APR . For those seeking shorter commitments, GeeFi offers 22% APR for a 3-month lock and 15% APR for a 1-month lock. A flexible staking option is also available, providing a 10% APR with no lock-up period required. Additionally, the referral program offers a 5% bonus in GEE tokens for every purchase made through your unique link. The Next 100x Gem Is Here In every market cycle, a few projects with real utility emerge to create significant wealth for early investors. GeeFi has all the characteristics of a breakout star, and analysts are calling it a potential 100x gem . Its successful presale and functional products set it apart from projects that rely solely on hype. This is the final opportunity to buy GEE tokens at a fixed, low price before they hit major exchanges. The fear of missing out is growing as Phase 3 approaches its end. Don’t wait, secure your place in the next big crypto success story today.

Scheduled alongside industry veterans Steven McClurg and Matt Hougan, the webinar will explore the early momentum surrounding XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and how institutional investors are approaching XRP exposure. Schwartz’s revelation casts a reflective tone over the event, marking the end of a pivotal era in Ripple’s technological leadership. A Legacy of Technical Innovation Schwartz, known in crypto circles by his handle JoelKatz, has been the cornerstone of Ripple’s technical vision for over thirteen years. As the architect of the XRP Ledger , he transformed it from an experimental blockchain into one of the most efficient and scalable networks in the industry. His innovations—ranging from consensus algorithms to decentralized exchange functionalities—have set the XRP Ledger apart, making it attractive to both retail users and financial institutions. Under Schwartz’s guidance, Ripple has positioned XRP not just as a digital asset but as a robust infrastructure for global payments. I think this is my last speaking event as Ripple CTO. — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) December 19, 2025 Institutional Focus on XRP The timing of Schwartz’s announcement is particularly notable, as institutional interest in XRP is on the rise. Asset managers are increasingly evaluating XRP as part of diversified portfolios, with ETFs providing a potential mainstream gateway. The upcoming webinar is expected to delve into strategies for incorporating XRP exposure, regulatory considerations, and the implications for blockchain-enabled financial products. These discussions underscore a broader shift in perception: XRP is moving beyond speculative trading into legitimate institutional investment territory. Stepping Back from Daily Leadership Schwartz’s post on X confirmed that he will step down from day-to-day CTO responsibilities while assuming an advisory role as CTO Emeritus and joining Ripple’s Board of Directors . He cited a desire to focus on family and personal pursuits while continuing to engage with technical projects and the XRP community. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Despite stepping back, Schwartz emphasized that his commitment to Ripple and the XRP ecosystem remains strong, signaling continuity even as the company transitions into its next phase. Ripple’s Enduring Vision Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and President Monica Long have publicly praised Schwartz’s contributions, describing him as a visionary technologist whose work has been central to Ripple’s growth. His innovations have enabled secure, scalable, and energy-efficient value transfer across borders, laying the foundation for the company’s ongoing success. Schwartz’s last webinar as CTO represents both a celebration of past achievements and a reminder of Ripple’s readiness to expand institutional adoption while maintaining technical excellence. Looking Forward As the XRP ecosystem continues to mature, Schwartz’s legacy will remain deeply embedded in its technological and strategic foundations. The upcoming webinar offers not only insights into XRP’s evolving role in global finance but also a symbolic moment of transition for one of the cryptocurrency industry’s most influential figures. While his tenure as CTO is concluding, his impact on Ripple and the XRP Ledger will continue to resonate, inspiring the next chapter of growth and innovation within the ecosystem.

This record-breaking peak, documented in CoinGecko’s newly released 2025 State of Meme Coins report, was followed by a steep 69% decline within a year, illustrating the extreme volatility and sentiment-driven nature of this asset class. The 2025 Memecoin Rollercoaster The meme coin sector experienced a historic climb and a dramatic fall in a short period, with CoinGecko’s report showing the market’s value ballooned to $150.6 billion last December, significantly surpassing the previous high of $88 billion set in 2021. This growth was largely powered by the “PolitiFi” trend, with tokens like Official Trump (TRUMP) gaining traction around the U.S. presidential election. However, the launch of other political tokens, such as LIBRA linked with Argentine President Javier Milei, coincided with the start of a major downturn. By November 2025, the total market capitalization had collapsed to $47.2 billion. This drop occurred despite a period of intense creation, where, at the height of the frenzy in January 2025, new token launchpads like Pump.fun and BONK.fun were facilitating over 73,000 new token launches every day. The report noted that the United States consistently showed the highest level of public interest in meme coins throughout the year, with its share of global attention growing from 20% to nearly 30%. However, overall global attention dropped by more than 80% from January levels, mirroring the market pullback. The landscape was also marked by significant risk. Apart from insider-heavy launches, the ease of creating tokens led to other widespread issues, including an increase in rug pulls, where developers abandon projects, and “bundling,” where insiders use multiple wallets to fake organic demand for coins. From Internet Joke to Mainstream Phenomenon The journey of meme coins began in 2013 with Dogecoin (DOGE), created as a light-hearted parody of the crypto market. For years, it dominated the space, but the 2021 bull run, fueled by celebrity endorsements, opened the door for a wave of successors like Shiba Inu (SHIB). The current cycle, which took off in early 2024, has been far more diverse, spreading from its Solana epicenter to networks like Bitcoin, Base, and BNB Chain. Still, DOGE controls about 47% of the sector’s total market value, recovering ground after briefly dropping below 30% during the height of Solana-based meme trading earlier in the year. Today, dog-themed tokens remain the largest category, but new narratives around politics and artificial intelligence have also captured significant market share. But beyond speculation, CoinGecko noted that some projects are building broader ecosystems. Tokens like BONK and FLOKI now support decentralized finance (DeFi) tools and gaming platforms, while DEGEN has evolved into the native currency for an entire social media layer-3 network. Looking ahead, the report suggested that the integration of centralized exchanges (CEXs) with DeFi may shape the next chapter, with major platforms such as Coinbase and Binance now providing in-app access to on-chain token trading. This has blurred the boundaries and could potentially attract more users to the meme coin ecosystem, according to the study.

Reportedly, the Japanese billionaire wants the full funding locked in by year-end, using whatever cash levers he can pull. Asset sales are already underway. More are coming. Margin loans tied to Arm Holdings are firmly on the table. Nothing here looks optional. This is Masa treating the OpenAI deal like a do‑or‑die move in the global AI race. The push has already reshaped how SoftBank operates day to day. Masa has sold the company’s entire $5.8 billion Nvidia stake, cut $4.8 billion from its holding in T-Mobile US, and reduced headcount. Other dealmaking has slowed sharply. Vision Fund managers now focus almost entirely on OpenAI-related work, according to multiple sources. Any investment above $50 million now needs Masa’s direct sign-off, which insiders say has brought most new deals to a near standstill. SoftBank pulls cash from assets, loans, and delayed listings To raise more money, SoftBank is preparing several routes at once. One of the biggest is the long‑planned listing of PayPay, its payments app unit. The IPO was first expected this month but slipped because of the 43-day U.S. government shutdown, which ended in November. Sources now say the listing should land in the first quarter of next year and could raise more than $20 billion if market conditions cooperate. The group is also looking to trim its position in Didi Global, China’s largest ride‑hailing company. Didi plans to list shares in Hong Kong after being forced to exit U.S. markets in 2021 following a regulatory crackdown. A source with direct knowledge allegedly said SoftBank is exploring exits tied to that move. Beyond asset sales, Masa has plenty of financial tools ready. SoftBank expanded its margin loan capacity by $6.5 billion, lifting total unused borrowing power to $11.5 billion. Those loans are backed by its stake in Arm Holdings, whose stock has tripled since its IPO, giving SoftBank more collateral room. As of September 30, SoftBank also reported 4.2 trillion yen, or $27.16 billion, in parent‑level cash. It still owns roughly 4% of T-Mobile US, a stake valued near $11 billion, according to LSEG data. Despite cutting back overall activity, SoftBank has kept funding select AI startups, including Sierra and Skild AI, even as most capital flows toward OpenAI. OpenAI pushes spending as compute demands explode The money matters because OpenAI needs it fast. The company has not yet received the remaining funds but expects payment by the end of 2025, as outlined in its contract. Both OpenAI and SoftBank back Stargate, a $500 billion effort to build massive AI data centers for training and inference, which executives say aligns with U.S. goals to stay ahead of China as Donald Trump sits in the White House in 2025. Big tech firms are spending heavily on similar infrastructure. Meta Platforms and others are pouring cash into chips, power, cooling systems, and servers, often bringing in partners to spread risk. That spending wave has raised worries about returns and the chance of an AI bubble if revenues fail to match costs. SoftBank agreed in April to invest up to $30 billion in OpenAI. $10 billion landed immediately. The rest depended on OpenAI completing its shift to a for‑profit structure by year‑end, a change the company finalized in October. Costs inside OpenAI keep climbing. Training and running models is getting more expensive as competition from Alphabet’s Google intensifies. Sam Altman recently told staff the company had entered a “code red” phase to upgrade ChatGPT, delaying other launches to counter momentum behind Gemini. In October, Sam said OpenAI aims to build 30 gigawatts of compute for $1.4 trillion, with a long‑term goal of adding 1 gigawatt every week, a scale where each gigawatt now costs over $40 billion.

56108531,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=248488,1766264111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,ChatGPT’s Revolutionary Update: Now Control AI Enthusiasm with Direct Personalization,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/chatgpt-enthusiasm-adjustment-openai-personalization/,"BitcoinWorld ChatGPT’s Revolutionary Update: Now Control AI Enthusiasm with Direct Personalization Imagine having complete control over how enthusiastic your AI assistant sounds. OpenAI has just made this possible with a groundbreaking update to ChatGPT that lets users directly adjust the chatbot’s warmth, enthusiasm, and even emoji usage. This development represents a significant leap in AI personalization, allowing users to tailor their AI interactions to match their preferences and needs. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts who rely on AI for market analysis, trading insights, and technical explanations, this update could transform how you interact with artificial intelligence tools. What Are ChatGPT’s New Personalization Features? OpenAI has introduced granular controls that allow users to fine-tune ChatGPT’s communication style. These settings appear in the Personalization menu and include three main adjustments: Warmth: Controls how friendly and approachable ChatGPT sounds Enthusiasm: Adjusts the energy level and excitement in responses Emoji Use: Determines how frequently ChatGPT incorporates emojis Each setting offers three options: More, Less, or Default. This builds upon existing tone settings like Professional, Candid, and Quirky that OpenAI added in November. The new controls provide unprecedented customization for users who want specific interaction styles from their AI assistant. Why OpenAI Introduced AI Personalization Controls ChatGPT’s tone has been a topic of ongoing discussion throughout 2025. OpenAI previously rolled back an update that users found “too sycophant-y,” and later adjusted GPT-5 to be “warmer and friendlier” after complaints about the model being too cold. These changes reflect OpenAI’s responsiveness to user feedback and their commitment to creating AI that serves diverse needs. Some academics and AI critics have raised concerns about chatbots’ tendency to praise users excessively, suggesting this creates “dark patterns” that could lead to addictive behavior and negative mental health impacts. By giving users control over these aspects, OpenAI addresses these concerns while empowering users to shape their AI interactions. How to Use ChatGPT’s Enthusiasm Adjustment Features Accessing and using these new controls is straightforward: Navigate to your ChatGPT settings Select “Personalization” from the menu Locate the new adjustment sliders for warmth, enthusiasm, and emoji use Set each to More, Less, or Default based on your preference Save your settings and start chatting These settings work alongside existing tone options, allowing for layered customization. For example, you could set a Professional base tone with More enthusiasm for motivational coaching, or a Quirky tone with Less emoji use for creative writing assistance. The Impact of Chatbot Tone on User Experience Research suggests that AI communication style significantly affects user engagement and satisfaction. Here’s how different settings might impact your experience: Setting Best For Potential Drawbacks More Enthusiasm Creative projects, motivation, learning new topics May feel overwhelming for serious discussions Less Enthusiasm Technical analysis, serious research, professional correspondence Could feel cold or impersonal More Warmth Personal advice, emotional support, casual conversations Might reduce perceived authority on technical subjects Less Warmth Fact-based research, objective analysis, formal communication May feel robotic or disconnected Benefits of Customizable AI Personalization The ability to adjust ChatGPT’s communication style offers several advantages: Improved Productivity: Match the AI’s tone to your task requirements Enhanced Comfort: Create interactions that feel natural to you Cultural Adaptation: Adjust communication style to match cultural norms Accessibility: Customize for different cognitive preferences and needs Professional Alignment: Ensure AI communication matches brand or personal voice For cryptocurrency traders and analysts, this means you can have ChatGPT explain complex blockchain concepts with technical precision during research, then switch to a more enthusiastic tone when exploring new investment opportunities. Challenges and Considerations in AI Tone Customization While these new features offer significant benefits, they also raise important questions: How much customization is too much before the AI loses its authentic voice? Will users consistently adjust settings, or will most stick with defaults? How does tone adjustment affect the AI’s factual accuracy and reliability? Could excessive customization create echo chambers where users only hear what they prefer? What responsibility does OpenAI have in guiding users toward healthy interaction patterns? These considerations highlight the complexity of creating AI that is both customizable and responsible. Future of AI Interaction and Personalization OpenAI’s introduction of granular tone controls suggests several future developments: Context-Aware Adjustments: AI that automatically adjusts tone based on conversation topic User-Specific Profiles: Settings that learn and adapt to individual preferences over time Cross-Platform Consistency: Unified tone settings across different AI applications Advanced Emotional Intelligence: AI that recognizes and responds to user emotional states Industry-Specific Presets: Pre-configured tones for fields like cryptocurrency, healthcare, or education These advancements could make AI interactions more natural, effective, and personalized than ever before.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Feels The Weight Of Quantum Risk Concerns, Industry Leaders Warn During the past three months, XRP has dropped more than 30%, keeping pressure on sentiment even as some commentators argue the token’s purpose goes far beyond short-term price moves. Retail Vs. Institutional Viewpoint According to health and finance commentator Dr. Camila Stevenson, much of the debate around XRP misses how large financial players judge settlement tools. Everyday traders tend to focus on charts and quick exits. Banks do not. They look at whether a system can handle stress, move large sums, and keep working when conditions worsen. Stevenson compared it to infrastructure testing, where strength and capacity matter more than the initial cost. XRP Was Built For Flows Based on reports from her recent video discussion, XRP was structured to act as a bridge for moving value, not as a speculative chip. With a fixed supply, the token cannot expand in quantity to meet higher transaction demand. Stevenson said that leaves price as the only way to support larger volumes. Analyst XFinanceBull echoed this view, encouraging market watchers to think in terms of flows rather than daily price action. Price Alone Does Not Prove Use Even so, market behavior still plays a major role. XRP trades in open markets, and speculation continues to influence price direction. A higher price may improve efficiency, but it does not guarantee adoption. Stevenson pointed out that many institutions position through custodians, OTC desks, and private agreements. These transactions often happen quietly and may not show up as sharp moves on public charts. Sudden spikes during positioning, she warned, would suggest instability rather than healthy use. Why Higher Price Helps Stevenson argued that banks moving billions would rather use fewer units that each represent more value. Fewer tokens can mean simpler settlement and less risk of slippage during busy periods. Large financial systems tend to fail when money cannot move or when settlement slows, not when prices fall. In that context, a higher XRP price could support smoother transfers if volumes rise enough to test the system. Related Reading: XRP ETFs Grow Past $60M As Price Struggles To Respond Market Reality Remains Mixed Despite the theory, clear proof of large-scale institutional demand remains limited. Regulation, liquidity depth, and reliable access still shape whether banks commit real volume. XRP’s 33% slide over recent months shows how quickly sentiment can shift, even as long-term use cases are debated. The idea that banks prefer a higher XRP price rests on future scale, not current trading patterns.

56108747,647314,1766264447,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56108747.jpeg,Bybit Returns To UK’s Crypto Scene Following 2023 Exit — Details,https://bitcoinist.com/bybit-returns-to-uk-crypto-scene-following-2023-exi/,"Cryptocurrency exchange ByBit has announced that it is relaunching a crypto platform in the United Kingdom two years after pausing its operations. The Dubai-based firm wound down its services in late 2023 as the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) imposed stricter financial promotion regulations. Bybit To Offer 100 Spot Trading Pairs To UK Users In a press release dated Friday, December 19, ByBit disclosed that it is reentering the UK’s crypto scene after its exit in 2023. According to the report, the exchange’s new UK platform will be offering spot trading on 100 digital asset pairs and peer-to-peer (P2P) trading. This new launch represents a return for Bybit who paused its operations in the United Kingdom in September 2023 due to the new FCA marketing rules that were set for enforcement later in October that year. These new rules , which centered around solicitation and a cooling-off period for first-time investors, came at a time when the global crypto regulatory landscape was only just starting to take shape. In its announcement, Bybit said that its fresh UK operations follow rigorous anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) standards and comply with the region’s financial promotion requirements. This was achieved through an arrangement with Archax, the first FCA-approved digital asset exchange, brokerage, and custodian in the UK. Mykolas Majauskas, Bybit’s senior director of policy, said in a statement: Our goal is to give UK users reliable access to global opportunities in digital assets. The UK is home to one of the most sophisticated financial ecosystems in the world, and its clear regulatory direction makes it an ideal environment for responsible innovation. In the months ahead, we aim to embody this innovative spirit by introducing new products tailored to the needs of UK users, always within a framework that prioritises transparency, and compliance. Bybit’s return to the UK’s cryptocurrency market appears to be strategic, as the region continues to make huge strides in terms of growth and adoption since the turn of the decade. The FCA recently estimated that 8% of adults in the United Kingdom now own crypto assets. It is worth noting that this ownership figure appears to be declining, having stood at 12% a year ago. While the drop marks the first dip in overall crypto ownership numbers in the last four years, the current figure is still double the level seen as of 2021. Total Crypto Market Capitalization As of this writing, the total crypto market capitalization stands at around $2.95 trillion, reflecting a 0.07% jump so far on Saturday, December 20. According to data from TradingView, the digital asset market has declined by over 2.6% decline in the past week.",Bybit|ByBit crypto exchange|crypto|crypto news|Cryptocurrency|UK FCA,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-20 21:00:47

The data says that “84.7% (100/118) are below TGE valuation” with the median token collapsing by 71% from its launch price, with only 18 tokens, or 15%, managing to stay above water. This means that roughly 4 out of 5 launches are below their opening valuation. Liew ended his post on X with a damning verdict, stating, “TGE isn’t early anymore.” Projects like Syndicate saw the highest drop, falling by 93.64% since its launch valuation, and it is closely followed by Animecoin, Berachain, and Bio Protocol, all of which have fallen by over 93%, respectively. How did the tokens launched in 2025 do? The data paints a grim picture of the 2025 token launch space, which was previously known to see price appreciation immediately after TGEs. Venture capital firms usually invest in these projects at valuations that can be 10, 100, or even 1,000 times cheaper than what retail investors pay when tokens become publicly available. By the time ordinary investors gain access at the token generation event, insiders have already secured their positions at way lower prices. Venture funding in the first quarter of 2025 alone reached $4.8 billion, and in Q3, crypto startups and projects pulled $4.59 billion in funding, with much of that capital flowing to late-stage companies. Meanwhile, retail investors face an increasingly difficult environment, buying tokens at inflated, fully diluted valuations that leave little room for appreciation. Could the fall be as a result of market conditions? Periodic sell-offs and sharp price adjustments in major digital assets like Bitcoin and Ether have also contributed to risk aversion among investors. Both leading assets have fallen from the respective highs they hit this year. The alt season that usually accompanies the rise of Bitcoin didn’t occur as expected. When it looked like the market was set to go parabolic, the market experienced the infamous “ 1011 crash ,” a sudden collapse in October that has left the market in a prolonged correction phase, accompanied by a series of liquidations and downward pressure. These crypto benchmarks have amplified the challenges faced by new token entrants, as investor capital flows toward safe-haven assets or established tokens. Industry observers have also noted that an oversupply of token launches has diluted liquidity and fragmented investor interest. Even as niche sectors such as memecoins or specific network ecosystems generate pockets of demand, the cumulative effect of continuous new supply has hampered sustainable price momentum. However, not all assets have performed poorly this year, as a few large-cap projects and established networks, such as Zora, Bedrock, Humanity, and Yooldo Games, have fared better, with YZI Labs-backed Aster’s token rising by over 700% from its launch price.

Cryptocurrency gains are usually the largest before a project becomes entirely exposed. When a token becomes evident, to a large extent, the upside is already discounted. One DeFi cryptocurrency based on Ethereum fits such a window of early positioning at this moment. It has already provided good growth, but major milestones are yet to be achieved. It is such an arrangement that has led to more and more people referring to the investment as the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a purchase to make before 2026. Presale Progress Mutuum Finance is at the moment valued at $0.035 and it is in the sixth stage of its presale. This stage has already been apportioned to more than 99% and this indicates that there is almost no availability at this price level. The token started at a price of $0.01 early in 2025 which is an increase of 250%. The project has already brought in over $19.4M and over 18,600 holders. More than 820M tokens have already been sold. Such statistics are important as they demonstrate continued involvement as opposed to a temporary spurt of interest. Constant accumulation in crypto investing can be a good indication of building confidence in the long run. The launch price will be officially priced at $0.06. Phase 1 participants are set to be placed up to 500% MUTM appreciation in case it is achieved. Every presale will add to the price of the tokens and the subsequent presale will raise MUTM by almost 20%. To a large number of investors this staged form brings out why timing is such a big part of early positioning. The Project Under Construction in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized lending protocol that is aimed at two lending markets. It aims at enabling people to provide assets and receive yield, and borrowers to acquire liquidity secured by collateral instead of selling their holdings. Users who provide assets are allocated mtTokens. These tokens are an indication of their portion of the liquidity supplied and increase in value with interest made. The design establishes a straightforward connection between the use of protocols and rewarding the users. The other crucial factor is the buy and distribute mechanism. The protocol revenue that has been earned in the lending activity is used to buy MUTM in the open market. MUTM bought in the open market is redistributed to individuals who deposit mtTokens in the safety module. Security is also at the center stage. Mutuum finance scores 90 out of 100 in the CertiK token scan. Moreover, Halbon security is engaged in a third-party audit of the completed lending and borrowing agreements. The presence of a $50,000 bug bounty on code vulnerabilities is another step in enhancing the level of trust in the protocol. Stablecoin Design Stablecoins form a fundamental component of lending demand, particularly in the periods of volatility on the market. It is decided that Mutuum Finance will assist with stable property as a part of its lending process, which will be able to appeal to customers with several predictable interest rates and reduced risk. This generally results in increased usage of the platform as soon as a protocol is available. Any lending platform must have accurate pricing. Mutuum Finance is to be built based on a strong oracle infrastructure, where Chainlink data feeds will be used. These feeds are useful in ensuring fair collateral valuation and safe liquidations through provision of sound prices in USD and native assets. The design also includes fall, back up and aggregated oracle options to minimize reliance on one source of data. Monetary wise, there is an opinion that MUTM is yet to achieve the growth in its turnover. In a bullish case, it has been estimated that there could be a potential of a 5x or 7x growth by 2026 assuming that their adoption and lending activity reaches the projected growth. These impressions are merely speculations, not promises, but they serve to understand why MUTM is being mentioned in the debate on the best cryptocurrency to invest in until the next cycle phase. V1 Launch, Whale Activity and Growing Urgency Official updates show that the V1 will be launched on a Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. The release is composed of core concepts, which include liquidity pools, mtTokens, and debt tokens, and a liquidator bot. The initial supported assets to be lent, borrowed as well as collateraled are ETH and USDT. Phase 6 selling out fast puts a vitality into it. The activity of late has been characterized by some interesting whale allocations such as single-person purchase of approximately $100k. This is usually taken by the market commentators as an indication that the big investors do not think that the current pricing can be sustained much longer. When Phase 6 is about to close, there is a tightening of supply and a higher price is introduced in the next Phase. To the investors who are considering which crypto to invest in nowadays as long-term positioning, this transition period can count more than subsequent headlines. Mutuum Finance is in its early stage of development and beta capabilities will be available on the Sepolia testnet V1. However, its mix of high presale velocity, safety orientation, and future achievements justifies why it is being regarded as one of the potential leading cryptocurrencies to invest in prior to the year 2026.

This powerful non-custodial wallet solution is proving its worth early on, with Phase 1 investors already celebrating a massive 1,200% ROI as the project enters Phase 3. The momentum is undeniable, and analysts believe Phase 3 will sell out within just 10 days due to swirling rumors of GeeFi listing on major exchanges soon. Utility That Outpaces Market Recoveries Solana (SOL) has staged a recovery with a 7% surge from recent lows, bolstered by institutional interest via ETF inflows and new partnerships. While Solana stabilizes, GeeFi is capturing the attention of investors seeking explosive growth, with many experts identifying it as 2026’s 100x gem . GeeFi offers a unified platform where users can manage assets across 14+ networks , solving the fragmentation issue that plagues modern crypto users. The ecosystem is expanding aggressively with the development of a DEX and Crypto Cards , tools designed to make spending and trading crypto effortless. Unlike speculative tokens, the GEE token is built on a deflationary model , ensuring scarcity increases as adoption grows. This strategic economic design, combined with a working product, the Android app is already live, strengthens the conviction that GeeFi is set to be 2026’s 100x gem . A Rare Chance for High ROI The GeeFi presale is currently in Phase 3, offering tokens at the attractive price of $0.13 . By investing now, buyers secure a guaranteed 325% return based on the confirmed listing price of $0.40 . The potential upside is staggering; a modest investment of $1,300 today could balloon to $30,000 if the token hits the analysts’ target $3 valuation , achieving a remarkable 2,210% ROI . Early believers from Phase 1 are already sitting on a 1,200% ROI , proving the project’s profit potential. Market experts have heavily praised the speed and success of the presale so far. They predict that Phase 3 will conclude within the next 3 weeks (or even sooner, given the 10-day forecast mentioned earlier), driven by explosive momentum and confirmed talks from the GeeFi Team regarding incoming listings on top-tier exchanges. This urgent demand highlights why so many believe GeeFi is 2026’s 100x gem . Maximize Earnings Through Staking GeeFi rewards its community with a comprehensive staking program designed for both flexibility and high returns. Investors can lock their tokens to earn 15% APR for one month , 22% APR for three months , or a substantial 55% APR for a 12-month term . For those who need liquidity, there is a flexible staking option offering up to 10% APR with no lock-up period , ensuring you remain in control of your funds. Additionally, the project encourages community growth through a referral program. Users earn a 5% bonus in GEE tokens on every purchase made via their unique referral link. This allows supporters to passively increase their holdings while introducing others to the ecosystem, creating a cycle of growth and reward for everyone involved. Act Before Phase 3 Closes Opportunities to invest in a project with confirmed utility, a live app, and a deflationary token model at such an early stage are incredibly rare. The GeeFi presale represents a fleeting chance to buy in before major exchange listings drive the price higher. With Phase 3 moving quickly and supply diminishing, waiting could mean missing out on what analysts call 2026’s 100x gem . The smart money is positioning itself now, secure your spot before the presale ends.

On-chain data suggests trader behavior on major exchanges is shifting into a more accumulative phase. Even as ETH continues to linger below the psychologically important $3,000 price level, this metric indicates that market participants are already preparing for a bullish move and a test of direction in the days ahead. Related Reading: XRP ETFs Grow Past $60M As Price Struggles To Respond Ethereum Leverage Ratio Prints New All-Time High Data from on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant shows that Ethereum’s Estimated Leverage Ratio on Binance has climbed to 0.611, the highest level ever recorded for this metric. The Estimated Leverage Ratio compares open interest to exchange reserves, and this offers insight into how much borrowed capital traders are deploying relative to available liquidity. Sustained increases in this ratio are a reflection of an increase in risk appetite from investors. It means that traders are committing larger leveraged positions in anticipation of favorable price movement. The current reading surpasses previous cycle peaks, and this environment can amplify price moves, since even modest spot price changes can trigger large liquidations when leverage is elevated. Ethereum: Estimated Leverage Ratio – Binance: CryptoQuant Another important metric points to an increase in Ethereum demand alongside record leverage. This metric is in the form of the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, which recently spiked to 1.13 on Binance. This is interesting because this level was last observed in September 2023. A reading above 1 indicates that market participants are executing more buy orders than sell orders. This combination of strong taker demand and rising leverage reveals optimism is now dominating short-term sentiment. The chart below shows the spikes in the Taker Buy Sell Ratio have more often than not coincided with periods of increased volatility. This buying pressure is now notable, with Ethereum trading around $2,900 in the past few hours, and this means that many traders are positioning ahead of a potential attempt to reclaim $3,000. Ethereum: Taker Buy Sell Ratio – Binance. Source: CryptoQuant Analyst Maps Out Ethereum’s Path Back Above $3,000 Adding a price-based perspective to the on-chain signals, crypto analyst Ted Pillows has outlined a clear technical roadmap for Ethereum’s next move. According to his analysis, ETH recently tapped into an important demand zone between $2,700 and $2,800 and has started to rebound from that area. This move occurred when Ethereum broke below $3,000 again this week to reach a low of $2,781 on December 18, which is highlighted on the chart below as a major support band. Ethereum Price Chart. Source: @TedPillows On X Pillows noted that holding this support zone keeps the bullish structure intact. If buyers continue to defend the $2,700-$2,800 range, Ethereum could build enough momentum for a push to the $3,100 to $3,200 region. That zone also sits just above the psychologically important $3,000 level.

Back told Carter on X that his posts made “uninformed noise” and that they were “not helping.” The exchange highlighted a sharper split in the Bitcoin community over how loudly to warn about future threats. Back Calls Out Public Warnings According to Back, Bitcoin developers are not ignoring quantum risks; the work is happening quietly. He argued the technology is still “ridiculously early” and predicted no real threat for a few decades. Based on reports, Back welcomed the idea of being “quantum ready” while urging calm in public messaging, saying loud alarms can cause confusion rather than useful action. Bitcoiners and developers are NOT in denial about defensively doing the r&d to prepare for future quantum computers. But they are just quietly doing research while you make uninformed noise and try to move the market or something. You’re not helping… — Adam Back (@adam3us) December 19, 2025 Carter pushed back, saying he had been “quantum pilled” after conversations with Project Eleven CEO Alex Pruden and that he invested because he became deeply concerned. Carter also pointed out that he disclosed his financial stake in a Substack post on Oct. 20, and he accused some developers of being in “total denial.” He warned that governments are planning for a post-quantum era and called Bitcoin itself a tempting “bug bounty” if the cryptography is left unchanged. after, obviously, because we wouldn’t have made the investment if we didn’t think quantum was a risk. — nic carter (@nic_carter) December 19, 2025 Experts Divided On Timing Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards told followers that a quantum threat could show up in as little as two to nine years unless networks move to quantum-resistant cryptography. According to public statements from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, forecasting models place roughly a 20% chance that machines able to break today’s public-key cryptography could arrive before 2030, with a median projection nearer 2040. Vitalik has said no such machines exist today but has urged early preparation because migrating a global system takes years. Metaculus’s median date for when quantum computers will break modern cryptography is 2040: https://t.co/Li8ni8A9Ox Seemingly about a 20% chance it will be before end of 2030. — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) August 27, 2025 Other voices are less alarmed. Multimillionaire investor Kevin O’Leary said he doubts breaking Bitcoin with quantum computing would be the best use of the technology, arguing it would deliver more value in fields like medical research. Such comments show how views vary not only on timing but also on the practical incentives behind a quantum attack. Research, Migration, And Market Signals Technical specialists point out one clear fact: there is currently no quantum computer capable of breaking Bitcoin’s cryptography. That fact has not stopped investors from placing bets on startups that claim to build protective tools. Castle Island’s investment, which resurfaced on social media recently, spurred fresh debate about transparency and whether public warnings help or harm the ecosystem.

As the market fluctuates between euphoric highs and painful lows, the real winners aren’t the cautious ones who wait for perfect signals, they’re the ones who jump in when the crowd hesitates. This year, the buzz is all about Apeing, a meme coin with massive upside potential. While many crypto enthusiasts are zeroing in on meme coins, established players like XRP and Tron continue to carve out their niche. Could one of these coins be the best upcoming crypto of 2025? The question is on everyone’s mind. Apeing has caught the eye of many investors with its community-first, culture-driven approach, and strong plans for utility. But it’s not just Apeing that’s making waves – XRP and Tron are also expected to see interesting developments as they push ahead in the crypto ecosystem. For those looking to stay ahead of the game, securing a spot on the Apeing whitelist could offer significant early access, giving you an edge over the competition. Here’s why these three coins are creating such a stir and why you need to keep an eye on them in 2025. That being said, discover the latest crypto opportunities and trusted insights to make smarter investment decisions with the Best Crypto To Buy Now. Apeing: How Whitelisting Gives You an Unbeatable Edge If you’re keeping an eye on the next big meme coin, Apeing is it. Whitelisting isn’t just a buzzword; it’s your VIP pass to front-row action in what could be one of the most explosive coin launches of the year. Why wait around and overthink when you can jump in early, secure your tokens, and watch them appreciate in value as demand skyrockets? The best upcoming crypto for 2025 is Apeing, without a doubt. With its community-first approach, meme culture roots, and strong potential for utility, Apeing stands out. Whitelisting gives you priority allocation, meaning you can secure your tokens before anyone else. That’s right: early access means getting in on the ground floor when the price is still low. How low? The early stage of Apeing is priced at just $0.0001, and with a planned listing price of $0.001, it’s a potential 10x opportunity. You do the math. Whitelisting makes you an insider, ensuring you’re one of the first to know when Apeing goes live. It’s not just about securing tokens early; it’s about avoiding the chaos and price surges that typically follow a coin launch. Once the crowd floods in, those initial 10x gains could be out of reach. But that’s not all. Whitelist members get exclusive access to the project’s updates, ensuring you’re always in the loop on developments and milestones. It’s the best way to get ahead in a market where timing is everything. Don’t miss your shot – join the Apeing whitelist now, and be part of the revolution. Apeing: The Ultimate Opportunity with Lowest Price, Maximum FOMO Looking to ape into an upcoming opportunity? Apeing is offering one of the lowest entry points you’ll see for any coin in 2025. The project is gaining traction with strong community engagement, and early supporters are already anticipating massive gains. At $0.0001, the price is extremely attractive. With projections estimating a listing of $0.001, that’s a potential 10x return before the real market momentum even kicks in. What makes this different from other coins? It’s the community-first approach and the genuine utility that sets Apeing apart from most meme coins. The project isn’t just about hype; it’s about delivering real value and ensuring that early investors reap the rewards. Don’t hesitate. Whitelisting is your chance to secure tokens before the rest of the market catches on. Join now, before the price skyrockets, and make sure you’re ahead of the curve. XRP: Ripple’s Moves and the Future of Payment Networks XRP has long been a staple in the crypto world. Known for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and partnerships with financial institutions, XRP continues to prove its value as a bridge currency. Despite some setbacks in its legal battles, XRP’s momentum is still solid. XRP’s price has remained relatively stable, and analysts are predicting potential growth if Ripple can successfully resolve its ongoing litigation issues. What’s exciting about XRP in 2025? The growing use cases in cross-border payments and remittances make XRP an appealing option for those seeking a more established crypto investment. If Ripple’s legal challenges clear up, XRP could see significant price appreciation, making it one of the best upcoming crypto options for more risk-averse investors. However, patience is key with XRP. While its price may not be as volatile as newer projects, its institutional partnerships and real-world utility make it a solid choice for those looking to hedge their bets in the crypto space. Tron: A Game Changer in Decentralized Applications Tron’s price fluctuations have been the subject of debate for years. With its focus on building a decentralized internet and fostering DApps, Tron is no stranger to controversy. Tron has seen ups and downs, but its ecosystem continues to grow, with an increasing number of projects relying on its blockchain for decentralized applications. For investors looking for a solid crypto with strong technological backing, Tron has the potential for long-term growth. If its DApp ecosystem continues to expand and adoption increases, Tron could see price spikes similar to what Ethereum experienced in its early days. The best upcoming crypto potential for Tron lies in its ability to scale and support the growing demand for decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. While Tron’s market sentiment may fluctuate in the short term, its long-term value proposition in the decentralized web cannot be ignored. For those with a more strategic mindset, Tron presents an intriguing investment. Conclusion Looking at the current landscape, both XRP and Tron have their pros and cons. XRP’s strength lies in its partnerships and use cases in the financial industry, while Tron’s DApp ecosystem shows immense potential for the future. However, the real showstopper here is Apeing. The Apeing whitelist offers early access to what could be one of the best upcoming crypto opportunities in 2025. Imagine getting in at the ground level, securing tokens at the lowest possible price, and watching them soar as the market catches on. This is your chance to ape in and secure your position before the prices explode. Apeing’s whitelist isn’t just an opportunity, it’s a strategy. Early access means more tokens, less competition, and the ability to move quickly when the market turns bullish. Don’t sit back and watch; act now. The Apeing whitelist could be your ticket to the next big crypto win.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/egrag-crypto-selling-xrp-now-makes-no-sense-heres-why/,"Recent instability in the cryptocurrency market has renewed debate over XRP’s short and medium-term outlook. The asset has declined by roughly 8% over the last seven days and is currently trading around $1.92, representing a drop of nearly 49% from its July peak of $3.66. This pullback has divided opinion among investors, with uncertainty growing over whether the move reflects a deeper trend reversal or a temporary retracement. Amid this backdrop, market technician EGRAG Crypto has maintained that selling XRP at present levels is a flawed decision. According to his assessment, the current price structure does not support liquidation, regardless of whether the broader market ultimately shifts into a bullish continuation or a sustained downturn. Selling Viewed as Unwise Even in a Bearish Scenario EGRAG has stated that even if the market has already entered a bearish phase, reducing exposure at this stage would still be ill-timed. He argues that market declines are rarely linear and often include countertrend movements after periods of weakness. #XRP – Why Selling Now Makes NO Sense: If you truly believe we’ve entered a bear market, then selling here is actually the worst possible timing. Bear markets do not move straight down. They almost always deliver one more relief move first. 1️⃣ This Is an Emotional Sell Zone 2️⃣… pic.twitter.com/VgkcV6NB9l — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 19, 2025 In such conditions, prices can experience short-term rebounds that offer better exit opportunities than those available during heightened selling pressure. From his analysis, if bearish control were firmly established, XRP could still register a temporary upward move before any further decline. As a result, selling into the current weakness may lead to missed opportunities should prices recover in the near term. Current Price Action Framed as a Correction The analyst also characterizes the present decline as a sentiment-driven phase rather than a definitive breakdown. He suggests that fear is currently influencing decision-making, which historically has not aligned with optimal selling conditions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In his view, more experienced participants typically distribute holdings during periods of widespread optimism, not during phases dominated by caution. EGRAG’s chart analysis indicates that the recent move appears to be a corrective reset rather than a structural failure. He further notes that even participants with a bearish outlook may find more favorable price levels to exit later, should the market stabilize or rebound. Long-Term Structure Suggests Significant Upside Potential In addition to near-term considerations, EGRAG points to XRP’s long-term price history. Previous extended consolidation periods have been followed by substantial advances once resistance levels were surpassed. Historical data show multiple instances where prolonged accumulation preceded strong upward movements of varying magnitudes. XRP has now traded below its prior all-time high of $3.84 for several years, marking one of its longest consolidation phases to date. Based on historical averages from earlier cycles, EGRAG estimates that a confirmed breakout could eventually produce gains several times above current levels. His long-standing projection includes a potential move toward $27 under favorable market conditions. Overall, EGRAG’s analysis concludes that selling XRP at current prices lacks technical justification. By examining market structure, investor behavior, and historical trends, he maintains that holding positions presently offers a more rational risk profile than exiting amid ongoing uncertainty.

The Three Pillars The upgrade is expected to introduce a Hub and Spoke architecture, where Hubs of capital are deployed on each network, and specialized Spokes are built on top to support tailored lending markets for different asset types. The end goal is to support trillions of dollars in assets and position Aave as a primary liquidity provider for institutions, fintech firms, and enterprises seeking on-chain credit. The company also plans to launch a new developer experience alongside V4. The tooling is intended to lower barriers for building applications and launching new markets on the protocol in 2026. Another central component of the roadmap is Horizon, which happens to be Aave’s institutional-focused market for real-world assets. Horizon allows qualified institutions to use tokenized assets such as US Treasuries and other credit instruments as collateral to borrow stablecoins, while meeting compliance and operational requirements. Kulechov explained that Horizon has already reached approximately $550 million in net deposits and is expected to scale to $1 billion and beyond next year. Aave Labs plans to expand Horizon through partnerships with asset managers and financial firms, including Circle, Ripple, Franklin Templeton, and VanEck. The third pillar of the 2026 strategy is the Aave App, which Aave Labs described as its primary consumer-facing product and a major driver of user growth. A full rollout of the Aave App is planned for early 2026, and the firm is targeting its first million users through the product. Kulechov said the combined rollout of V4, Horizon, and the Aave App is intended to support Aave’s broader objective of becoming a global on-chain credit layer, which is capable of serving both institutional capital and retail users at scale. SEC Ends Probe Against Aave Meanwhile, the master plan comes shortly after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) concluded its investigation into the Aave Protocol after four years. Kulechov confirmed the development and tweeted, “This process demanded significant effort and resources from our team, and from me personally as the founder, to protect Aave, its ecosystem, and DeFi more broadly. DeFi has faced unfair regulatory pressure in recent years. We’re glad to put this behind us as we enter a new era where developers can truly build the future of finance.” Interestingly, Aave is not the only platform cleared by the securities watchdog. The SEC closed multiple investigations that started under the Biden administration. This includes Gemini, OpenSea, Robinhood, and Uniswap, among others.

Conversely, for those looking to go long, he is eyeing the $87,420 level, which marks the start of the previous impulse and a key support box. If the price tests this area, Snyder will be watching for clear reversal patterns to trigger a scalp-long. However, if the market loses that “start impulse” support, the analyst believes a continuation short down to the $85,890 lows becomes highly probable. Once the price arrives at those deeper lows, he will pivot his strategy to wait for a reversal to long position. Finally, Snyder identified a major breakout trigger: when Bitcoin can gain and hold $89,375 (the top of the resistance box), the analyst assumes the market will finally squeeze toward the $90,400 region. While he doesn’t expect this breakout to materialize before Monday, he has his alerts set and suggests traders take the time to enjoy their weekend. Weekend Lull Keeps Bitcoin Range-Bound In an X post, analyst Daan Crypto Trades observed that BTC is entering the weekend in a state of relative stagnation. The analyst suggested that this is an ideal window for traders to step back and rest, allowing for a mental reset before the market dynamics potentially shift in the coming week.

The asset remains firmly stuck in the middle of its established range, lacking the necessary momentum to either break out toward new highs or break down into a deeper correction. Daan Crypto Trades warned that next week will likely be characterized by more choppy price action, as market activity often thins out significantly around the Christmas holidays.

56114793,https://timestabloid.com/?p=92879,1766275252,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,$100 XRP: Expert Sets New Timeline After Failed 2025 Prediction,https://timestabloid.com/100-xrp-expert-sets-new-timeline-after-failed-2025-prediction/,"Zach Rector, a widely followed commentator within the XRP community, has updated his expectations regarding when XRP could reach a $100 valuation. After previously promoting a much shorter timeframe, Rector now argues that a triple-digit price is more realistic closer to the end of the decade, specifically around 2030. This adjustment represents a notable shift from his earlier position. In late 2024, Rector publicly asserted that XRP could climb to $100 by the end of 2025, dismissing skepticism around that estimate in strongly worded remarks. With 2025 now nearing its conclusion and XRP trading far below that level, he has revised his stance and extended the timeline by several years. Revised Timeline Draws Community Criticism Rector’s updated projection has prompted mixed reactions across social media. Some XRP holders expressed frustration, accusing him of retreating from earlier claims without providing a sufficient explanation. One user questioned what developments, if any, had occurred to justify abandoning a near-term forecast so close to the original deadline. $100 XRP in 2030 — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) December 19, 2025 Other commenters were more dismissive of price targets altogether. Several argued that assigning specific numerical values years in advance offers little practical value to investors and may distract from broader considerations such as risk management and long-term conviction. A recurring criticism focused on influencer credibility, with some users suggesting that frequent revisions weaken trust when bold projections are later softened. Calls for greater caution in public forecasting also emerged, with critics urging commentators to avoid emphasizing highly optimistic figures that may not be grounded in verifiable market trends. Context Behind the Controversy The backlash surrounding Rector’s earlier prediction was partly driven by market conditions at the time it was made. XRP was trading under sustained bearish pressure, making the implied price increase required for a move to $100 within a year appear unrealistic to many observers. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Since then, XRP’s market position has not changed significantly. The asset continues to trade near the low-$1 range, with recent price movements showing short-term volatility but no decisive shift in long-term trend. While XRP briefly approached the $2 level, it has yet to establish sustained upward momentum that would support aggressive near-term projections. Diverging Views on Long-Term Potential Despite criticism of Rector’s revised timeline, optimism around XRP’s long-range prospects persists in some quarters. A number of commentators maintain that substantial appreciation is possible over an extended period, particularly if adoption and regulatory clarity improve. However, institutional and research-based forecasts remain more conservative. Market outlooks from firms such as Bitwise, Telegaon, and Changelly suggest that XRP could still see growth by 2030, but at levels well below $100. Bitwise, for example, estimates a potential upper range closer to $29 under highly favorable conditions. Overall, Rector’s revised outlook highlights the ongoing tension within the XRP community between aspirational price expectations and more measured, evidence-based projections.

This New Crypto Under $0.05 Is Already Surging 250%,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/what-crypto-to-buy-for-long-term-growth-this-new-crypto-under-0-05-is-already-surging-250/,"It is hardly ever a long-term crypto gains by chasing what is already moving. They are typically initiated with a project that presents actual infrastructure, constant demand, and obvious improvement, and the prices are yet low. That phase does not last long. Currently, one Cryptocurrency utilizing Ethereum in the area of DeFi and having a price of less than $0.05 is penetrating that window. Mutuum finance (MUTM) has already more than doubled and the main platform is yet to be launched. It is that combination of execution and timing that makes it a good contender on a long-term basis by some investors. The practice of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating a decentralized lending protocol that is based on two markets. The first one is the peer to contract model. According to this arrangement, users will deposit assets in liquidity pools and be given mtTokens. These mtTokens are reflective of their status and increase in value towards the interest accrued. E.g., assuming that a user deposits USDT and the pool earns an income, the mtTokens grow with time. The APY varies according to the demand. Yields are on the increase when the borrowing activity is high. At high levels of liquidity, rates are maintained at low levels. Peer-to-peer lending is the second market. In this case, the loans under more flexible terms can be taken by the borrowers. Depending on the asset and situations, borrow rates are either variable or stable. Stable repayment rates begin with a higher rate, but it is predictable. Loan-to-Value limits secure loans. In case the collateral values reduce beneath security levels, liquidations are done. Liquidators intervene and settle up a portion of the debt at a discounted collateral. This balances out the system and solves it. Presale Organisation and Demand Indications Mutuum Finance has acquired approximately 18,600 holders and has already managed to raise $19.4M. On a given supply of 4B tokens, 45.5% are used for the presale. That equals roughly 1.82B tokens. At this stage, it has sold approximately 820M tokens. Phase 1 was marked by the token price of $0.01. It now sits at $0.035. That is a 250% increase so far. The official price is $0.06. Phase 1 subjects will be set out with a growth of up to 500% in case they reach the growth. Phase 6 is now over 99% allocated. The presale demand has become faster with availability getting narrow. The price of each next phase will be higher, and the following level will bring almost 20% more MUTM. The compatible result of this structure is the speedy repricing because supply is reduced. The community activity is a contributing force. A 24 hour leaderboard is used as a reward to the best daily contributor of $500 in MUTM. This ensures that interest remains high with phases being closed. V1 Launch, Security and Price Prospect Official updates state that Mutuum Finance intends to deploy its V1 protocol on the Sepolia testnet in the 4th quarter of 2025. Its main characteristics are liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot with ETH and USDT being the initial supported assets. Security is a major focus. MUTM has a 90/100 score on the CertiK scan token. The final lending and borrowing contracts are also being audited by Halborn Security independently. Another protection layer is a $50k bug bounty that includes the vulnerabilities of code. These milestones are of valuation according to some analysts. Projections in a bullish point of view has it that by 2026 MUTM would have a movement of between 5x to 7x in the event of growth in adoption and lending activity. They are not promises but they serve to gain a better understanding as to why MUTM is mentioned in the context of what crypto to purchase now to realize long-term growth. Stablecoin and Layer 2 Plans Stablecoins are important in lending demand. Mutuum Finance will provide support to the assets of the stable which can appeal to users who are willing to have stable borrowing costs. This normally augments the usage of the platforms in both sleepy and swirling markets. It is also significant that layer 2 plans exist. Superior transactions and reduced charges enhance user experience. In the case of DeFi cryptocurrency platforms the scalability of an application usually dictates whether initial interest will translate into a permanent adoption. Mutuum Finance remains in the development phase, and beta functionality will be provided in V1 Sepolia testnet. However its 250% price hike coupled with high presale demand and the visible infrastructural construction location it in an unusual niche. To investors questioning what crypto to buy today and grow it long-term, MUTM is right at the edge of low price, increasing traction, and future events. It is usually at that time when long term opportunities start.

56116678,647319,1766278819,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56116678.jpeg,‘Bitcoin Demand Boom Is Fading’ — CryptoQuant Calls The Start Of Bear Market,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-demand-boom-is-fading-cryptoquant-market/,"The price action of Bitcoin over the past week tells a perfect story of its performance this year. The premier cryptocurrency experienced incredible levels of volatility throughout the week, oscillating between the $90,000 and $86,000 range over the past few days. The latest market evaluation shows that the future of the Bitcoin price might be looking bleaker than mere periods of sideways volatility. According to a prominent cycle, BTC’s price cycle has turned and is entering a bear market. Bitcoin Cyclical Behavior Depends On Demand Cycles: CryptoQuant In its latest market report, blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant has associated the steady decline in Bitcoin price with the fading demand boom. According to data on the on-chain platform, the BTC demand growth has slowed down in the course of 2025, signaling the start of a bear market. CryptoQuant highlighted that Bitcoin has witnessed three major spot demand waves—triggered by the US spot ETF launch, the US presidential election outcome, and the Bitcoin Treasury Companies bubble—since the bull cycle started in 2023. However, the demand growth has slowed down since early October 2025. Unsurprisingly, this trend reversal for the demand growth coincides with the October 10 market bloodbath, one of the largest liquidation events in crypto history. The Bitcoin price has since struggled to mount any convincing recovery, falling to as low as $82,000 in late November. CryptoQuant went on to hypothesize that a key pillar of price support has been removed as most of this cycle’s incremental demand has already been realized. For instance, demand from institutional and large investors is in a downturn, with US-based Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) turning into net sellers in 2025’s fourth quarter. According to CryptoQuant’s data, the US spot ETF holdings have declined by 24,000 BTC in Q4 2025, which is a far cry from the steady accumulation seen in Q4 2024. “Similarly, addresses holding 100–1K BTC—representing ETFs and treasury companies—are growing below trend, echoing the demand deterioration seen at the end of 2021 ahead of the 2022 bear market,” the blockchain firm added. Besides the weakening spot demand, the Bitcoin derivatives market has also seen reduced activity and decreased risk appetite. CryptoQuant revealed that BTC’s funding rates have fallen to their lowest level since December 2023, an on-chain signal that suggests the reduced willingness of traders to maintain long exposure ; this trend is often associated with bear markets. Ultimately, the blockchain firm concluded that the Bitcoin four-year cycle hinges more on demand phases—expansions and contractions in demand growth— rather than on the halving event. In essence, a bear market tends to come after the BTC demand growth peaks and topples over. What Next For BTC Price? In its report, CryptoQuant revealed that the Bitcoin price structure has worsened in line with the demand weakness. The flagship cryptocurrency is currently trading below its 365-day moving average, a key long-term support level that has historically separated bull and bear phases. According to CryptoQuant, the downside reference points suggest that the Bitcoin bear market might not be as deep as feared. As in previous bear seasons, the realized price—currently around $56,000—has been identified as the potential bottom. This implies a possible 55% correction from the latest all-time high, Bitcoin’s smallest drawdown on record (during a bear market). Meanwhile, the market leader has its intermediate support level around $70,000. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $88,170, reflecting a 3% jump in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin demand growth|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|btc price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-21 01:00:19

Analysts indicate that the bull rally could unfold slowly, suggesting a gradual climb to new highs. Traders are being urged to prepare for heightened volatility and plan their strategies carefully to protect gains while staying positioned for potential upside. Slow Climb Expected In Bitcoin’s Final Bull Run A market expert who calls himself Crypto Waterman has shared his latest outlook on Bitcoin’s final bull run. He expects the last leg of the rally to be a slow and deliberate process rather than a sudden spike. According to him, the parabolic move could take roughly one to two months to complete, potentially unfolding during the first quarter of 2026. Related Reading: XRP ETFs Grow Past $60M As Price Struggles To Respond Crypto Waterman warns that before this final surge, there will likely be intense market pressure to push out inexperienced investors. This period could include sudden shakeouts and volatility designed to test retail traders’ resolve. He also stated that many investors may exit too early as euphoria builds, while others will become bag holders as prices climb rapidly. The analyst emphasized that smart wallets and BTC whales tend to sell into strength during this phase. For average investors, he suggests a careful strategy of dollar-cost averaging out of positions once gains become significant. Observing coins doubling in a single day could be an early signal to start reducing exposure. Crypto Waterman also shares his personal approach to profit-taking, which involves selling 25% of his holdings when the price doubles. If Bitcoin triples, he says that he would offload 30-40% and consider selling nearly everything if the market feels overheated. He also stated that he would leave a small portion, “a moonbag,” to capture any remaining upside potential. Analyst Warns Last Chance To Accumulate BTC Crypto Waterman offers guidance for traders looking to position themselves ahead of Bitcoin’s anticipated parabolic move. He suggests that the next two to three weeks may be the last chance to accumulate Bitcoin before the rally begins. He also highlighted the importance of timing, recommending that investors buy Bitcoin during significant dips rather than chasing rising prices. The analyst has hinted at knowing the timing of the expected market shakeout, emphasizing that market conditions over the coming days will determine the exact moment it happens. He warns that traders should prepare for volatility and short-term price fluctuations. He also reminds investors to stay disciplined during periods of market euphoria. Related Reading: Bitcoin Feels The Weight Of Quantum Risk Concerns, Industry Leaders Warn He shared that investors and traders should follow the “Warren Buffett” principle of being cautious when others are greedy and opportunistic when others are fearful. This strategy eliminates emotional decision-making in trading and investing, allowing holders to make rational moves as the Bitcoin market approaches its final bull phase.

But lithium, copper, aluminum, and steel have also managed to end up running right beside them, instead of trailing behind, thanks to insanely strong demand (not fear-buying), along with AI build-out and energy transition. Jim Wiederhold, commodity index product manager at Bloomberg, said the world is “moving from a fossil-fueled economy to one powered by technologies consisting of metals. The future is metal.” Demand from AI and clean energy pushes industrial metals up Year-to-date, copper has rallied by more than 34%, steel gained 27%, while aluminum added 14%, and lithium surged by 30%. Every tech-driven industry seemed to rely on a blend of these metals, and that kept prices on a steady upward grind. Sadly though, supply problems hit the copper market harder than anything else. In May, flooding at Ivanhoe’s Kamoa-Kakula operation in the Democratic Republic of Congo shut down one of the biggest copper mines on earth. A few months later, a tunnel collapse in Chile damaged another major mine, then a mudslide hit Freeport-McMoRan’s Grasberg mine in Indonesia, cutting even more supply. Lithium traders also felt pressure when the Chinese government temporarily halted operations at one of CATL’s major mining sites. Prices reacted fast. Aluminum and steel producers ran into their own issues as energy prices climbed because of the Ukraine war and AI’s heavy electricity needs. ING Bank said China was nearing its aluminum cap, which limited how much extra supply the country could push into the market. Wiederhold said, “When there’s geopolitical risk cropping up, or something with a government doing export bans to try and raise prices, this is a direct beneficiary of price appreciation.” Tariffs and supply fears add new volatility as producers respond The White House added more fuel when President Donald Trump approved 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The same tariff hit copper-intensive goods like wiring and tubes, though raw copper ore was not included. When Trump first announced the tariff plan in July, traders rushed to pull physical copper out of overseas warehouses and move it into the U.S. before the duties took effect. Prices spiked immediately. Once the administration clarified that raw ore would remain exempt, copper prices cooled off. Even with that correction, supply anxiety didn’t go anywhere.LPL Financial chief technical strategist Adam Turnquist said rising requests to remove copper from LME warehouses “exacerbated fears over a global supply shortage.” Metal traders reacted quickly. Glencore, one of the biggest commodity firms worldwide, is preparing to lift its copper production from 850 kilotons in 2025 to 1,000 kt in 2028 and 1,600 kt by 2035, based on research from Jefferies. In Southeast Asia, Indonesian aluminum smelters began expanding refining capacity to catch rising demand. Jigna Gibb, head of commodities and crypto index products at Bloomberg, said trading desks are increasing their physical positions because “energy and industrial metals are the key ones where you see a lot more positioning.” All of this connected back to AI’s booming electricity appetite. Aluminum refiners need cheap energy, and rising AI power use is already cutting into their margins and raising operating costs. New grid expansions, more data centers, and wiring inside AI chips continue to lift demand for copper and steel. Lithium stayed tight because of China’s control over much of global supply. EVs, energy storage systems, and other parts of the energy transition kept pulling lithium into long-term contracts. Wiederhold said the world is increasingly “powered by technologies consisting of metals,” adding, “We’re just not going to have enough supply for the projected demand.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

Republican Representative Max Miller of Ohio and Democratic Representative Steven Horsford of Nevada are behind the effort, according to a letter jointly sent by both offices on Saturday. Max and Steven sit on the House Ways and Means Committee, which controls tax policy, and they are the first members of that panel to put forward a written framework dealing only with crypto taxes. Stablecoin payments under $200 will get capital gains relief under bipartisan tax bill The lawmakers said they chose to start with stablecoins because Congress has already passed laws governing how those tokens operate. The draft proposal will also exempt transactions under $200 made with “regulated, dollar‑pegged” stablecoins from capital gains taxes, but the Representatives made it clear that this does not apply to other forms of crypto, and it does not cover trading activity beyond those limited payments. Max said the current tax system does not match how people actually use crypto today. “America’s tax code has failed to keep pace with modern financial technology. This bipartisan legislation brings clarity, parity, fairness, and common sense to the taxation of digital assets,” he said. The draft mixes early legislative language with policy goals and has not yet been turned into a formal bill. Steven’s office said the goal is cooperation inside the committee. “The hope is that the committee will work together in good faith to set these critical rules of the road,” a spokesperson said. The draft also addresses how staking and mining rewards are taxed. Under IRS guidance issued during the Biden administration, those rewards are taxed as income at the moment they are received. House Republicans argue that approach taxes value before a gain exists. Progressive Democrats argue the rewards function like pay and should be taxed immediately. Max and Steven propose a middle option. Taxpayers could choose to delay taxes on staking rewards for up to five years. At the end of that period, the rewards would be taxed as income based on their fair market value. The approach differs from a proposal introduced earlier this year by Senator Cynthia Lummis , which would delay taxes until the rewards are sold. Meanwhile, Max and Steven’s proposal also allows mark‑to‑market accounting, letting traders report unrealized gains and losses each year, which can offset income like wages.

The judges said the lower court acted too harshly by canceling the 2018 arrangement without giving Tesla a real chance to argue what fair pay should look like. Forbes said that ruling sent Elon’s net worth to $769 billion, putting him far ahead of Google co-founder Larry Page, who sits at $252.6 billion. The new ranking also places Elon closer than ever to becoming the first trillionaire on the planet. Court decision drives new attention to Tesla and SpaceX At the same time this court outcome landed, Elon’s other giant business, SpaceX, is preparing an insider share sale that would value the company at $800 billion, which would make it the most expensive privately held company in the world. If it becomes public next year, it would be the largest listing ever. Traders calling themselves “Elon exposure” seekers are watching for a chance to buy into the company after years of waiting. Some investors say a SpaceX listing could lift Tesla again because both companies feed into each other. They think a public stock offering could push more attention toward Elon overall, which has already happened in the past whenever something major occurred inside his business network. That idea is already floating around the market as people try to guess how fast the IPO could move and what it would mean for both companies. Tesla’s stock has also been rallying even more, thanks to the attention around SpaceX. At press time, it is up 48% year-to-date. SpaceX plans fuel new proposal from Billy Ackman Then Billy Ackman jumped in with his own idea on X, writing directly to Elon: “@elonmusk, what if we took @SpaceX public by merging it with Pershing Square SPARC Holdings, Ltd. (SPARC) a new form of acquisition company that was approved by the @SECGov.” Billy said he has a full plan for how Tesla shareholders could receive SPARC special purpose acquisition rights, which would let them invest in the SpaceX listing or sell their rights if they want cash instead, adding that this setup would open the process to every Tesla shareholder. Billy said SPARC would run due diligence, bring $4 billion in capital at a fixed share price, and skip underwriting fees, founder stock, and shareholder warrants. The investor then explained that a 100% common-stock structure would keep things clean and low-cost. In Billy’s words:- “Assuming we issue 0.5 SPARs for each share of Tesla, there would be 1.723 billion SPARs outstanding including the 61.1 million SPARs that are already outstanding. Since one SPAR would be exercisable for two shares of SpaceX, the SPARs would be exercisable for 3.446 billion total SpaceX shares.” He gave two exercise-price examples. At $11.03, SpaceX could raise $42 billion, with $38 billion from SPAR holders and $4 billion from Pershing Square. At $42, SpaceX could raise $148.7 billion, with $144.7 billion from SPARs and $4 billion from Pershing Square. Billy said SPARC didn’t care how many shares were primary or secondary, which would give the company breathing room. He also said SPARC could sign a firm agreement within 45 days, making the deal certain except for SEC approval. He added they could begin right away and announce everything by mid-February, and finished with: “To Mars and beyond!

While holding above $75.20 keeps the outlook positive, a break below this level would signal bearish pressure. Conversely, a retest of the $79.60 resistance coupled with signs of weakness could present a potential shorting opportunity. Litecoin Mirrors Bitcoin’s Momentum In Daily Close Based on CryptoWzrd analysis, both the daily candles for Litecoin and the LTC/BTC ratio closed in a bullish orientation today, largely mirroring the positive sentiment set by Bitcoin. However, the analyst cautioned that for the LTC/BTC pair to confirm a sustained bullish turn, it must continue to print more bullish daily candles from its current location. Related Reading: Why The Litecoin Price Could Stage A 33% Rally To $110 CryptoWzrd emphasized that Litecoin’s overall movement remains highly tethered to Bitcoin’s general market sentiment. For Litecoin, the immediate key to maintaining a favorable outlook is holding above the $80 level. This price point is crucial as it keeps the asset firmly within positive territory and above a critical support line. Conversely, the analyst warned that a decisive break and close below the $80 support would instantly shift the outlook to bearish. Such a failure would validate further downside, targeting the next significant support level, which is projected to be around $68. This $80 mark is therefore the structural line separating positive and negative momentum. Given the weekend, the analyst’s immediate trading focus will shift to lower-timeframe charts in search of quick scalp opportunities for the following day. Despite this tactical shift, he advises maintaining rational expectations, acknowledging that low-liquidity weekend sessions often limit decisive moves and necessitate caution. Intraday Volatility Sets The Stage For Key Trades CryptoWzrd added to his analysis by noting that the intraday chart for LTC had been quite volatile, requiring a calculated approach to entries. He outlined a clear positive scenario if the price were to successfully retest the key $75.20 support level and then follow up by printing a visible bullish reversal pattern. Related Reading: Litecoin Comeback: Bullish Reversal Sets The Stage For $76.85 Target However, the analyst noted that a decisive break below the $75.20 support would invalidate the bullish hope and signal a short continuation trade. Another scenario involves a move up to test the $79.60 resistance level, where a clear bearish reversal pattern would confirm a rejection and trigger a short entry. Essentially, the strategy relies on waiting for the price to confirm its direction at the defined boundaries. CryptoWzrd concluded by advising traders to exercise patience and wait for the next mature trade opportunity to fully unfold and validate the intended direction before committing to a position.

This underperformance comes despite strong underlying fundamentals, where its price is being governed by the mechanics of hedging and synthetic leverage rather than the conviction of its holders. Network security remains strong, long-term holders continue to dominate supply, and institutional access has never been broader. How This Cycle Looks Different For Bitcoin There’s no satisfying explanation for one of the strangest market outcomes of the year. An entrepreneur, Bitcoin investor, and founder of Wealth Mastery, Lark Davis, has mentioned on X that Bitcoin is the only asset underperforming, while gold and stocks are printing all-time highs, and 2025 was supposed to be the golden moment for BTC. Davis highlighted that in 2025, the United States had a pro-BTC administration for the first time in history, and there was demand for the cryptocurrency and peak adoption from institutions and nation-states. Macro conditions turned supportive, and Wall Street has effectively rolled out the red carpet for BTC. At the same time, Michael Saylor’s Strategy purchased a BTC supply greater than the average daily production of miners. Despite all this bullishness, BTC is still down 6% from its yearly open and still around 30% below its all-time high. Meanwhile, the rest of the crypto looks worse as altcoins have been crushed, with many down 80% to 90% over the last two years. The 2026 Bitcoin chart will be the most important to watch. A full-time crypto trader and investor, Daan Crypto Trades, highlighted that Global liquidity is the metric to watch for BTC’s long-term performance. It’s not a holy grail that works every single day, but there are shorter-term deviations right now. When overlaying global liquidity growth with long-term price performance, it shows that the peaks and troughs align with remarkable accuracy. Daan believes that this BTC setup is more important than a rate cut, and the overall stock market performance will reveal a good signal. Whale Accumulation While The Market Hesitates While fear dominates across the market, a whale has been quietly buying BTC since yesterday. Crypto educator Wilberforce Theophilus revealed that over the past 24 hours, more than 2,509.2 BTC, which is approximately $221 million worth of BTC, has been accumulated. According to Wilberforce, December 2020 was objectively worse than today, but in January 2021, BTC was $1 and then rallied to $19,000. December 2025 doesn’t stand out as extremely bearish when viewed through a long-term lens. “I have just one piece of advice: HODL and WAIT,” the expert noted.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Daan Crypto Trades|Lark Davis|michael saylor|Strategy|Wilberforce Theophilus,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-21 03:00:21

More than 15 years later, that experiment has endured cycles of excitement, sharp declines, political scrutiny, and growing ties to traditional finance. The reason the cryptocurrency still matters is not just price performance but also its ability to adapt as narratives shifted from hobbyist curiosity to protest against banks, then toward a globally traded asset shaped by macroeconomics, institutions, and public policy. From Digital Curiosity to Financial Rebellion Early community reflections resurfaced this week after market intelligence provider Santiment published a deep dive into BTC that once again looked at its earliest chapters. The story began on January 3, 2009, with the mining of the Genesis Block by the little-known Satoshi Nakamoto. For years, Bitcoin was a playground for tech enthusiasts, exemplified by programmer Laszlo Hanyecz’s famous 2010 purchase of two pizzas for 10,000 BTC. After the financial crisis of 2008, things changed. The asset’s decentralized nature and fixed supply of 21 million coins appealed to people who didn’t trust traditional banks. Slogans like “Don’t trust, verify” summed up a growing ideological movement. However, the failure of the Mt. Gox exchange and subsequent loss of about 850,000 BTC in February 2014 put this idealism to the test. The event was a harsh lesson: even though the Bitcoin network was decentralized, the services around it still had the same risks, which made it clear that personal custody and security were still important. The following years saw cycles of explosive growth and painful contraction. The 2017 boom, for instance, brought mainstream attention and a wave of new investors chasing gains, while the subsequent downturn refocused the community on building tangible technology. After 2018, the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms showed that it was possible to lend, borrow, and trade without middlemen. But the years 2021 to 2023 brought another harsh reality check when big firms like Terra, Celsius, and FTX went out of business. On the bright side, these events pushed the narrative toward maturity, regulation, and risk assessment. Integration with the Mainstream System Bitcoin’s journey today is marked by its growing ties to global politics and traditional finance. Big companies now see crypto as a regular asset class, with a growing number of them offering custody services and investment products. Notably, political figures like Donald Trump have moved from criticism to vocal support, pulling digital assets into the heart of policy debates and, in turn, tying crypto prices more closely to political news cycles. This integration means that the main digital asset now often moves in time with traditional markets like the S&P 500. Macroeconomic events, from geopolitical conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate decisions, provoke reactions at the same time in both equities and crypto. According to Santiment, this correlation was a major departure from Bitcoin’s origins as an independent alternative. Despite this mainstream embrace, Santiment believes the main idea of self-sovereignty that helped birth BTC still holds true, especially in places facing currency instability or capital controls. The market has matured, but the foundational appeal of a decentralized, borderless monetary system still draws users, meaning the experiment that started with a digital pizza order is far from over.

Key Takeaways: The draft would exempt small stablecoin payments under $200 from capital gains tax. Staking and mining rewards could be taxed after a five-year deferral instead of immediately. The proposal targets consumer use, not crypto investment or trading activity. The proposal, dubbed the Digital Asset PARITY Act, was introduced by Rep. Max Miller, a Republican from Ohio, and Rep. Steven Horsford, a Democrat from Nevada. Both sit on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees tax legislation, according to a Sunday report from Bloomberg . US House Draft Would Exempt Small Stablecoin Payments From Capital Gains Tax At its core, the bill would exempt certain small stablecoin transactions from capital gains taxes. Under the proposal, purchases made with regulated, dollar-pegged stablecoins valued at less than $200 would not trigger taxable events. The goal is to remove the compliance burden tied to routine payments, where even minor price fluctuations can currently require users to calculate gains or losses. Horsford argued the draft is designed to provide clearer rules while preserving the integrity of the tax system. To qualify, stablecoins must be issued by a permitted issuer under the GENIUS Act , be backed solely by the US dollar, and have traded within 1% of $1.00 for at least 95% of trading days over the past year. Brokers and dealers would be excluded from the safe harbor, and the exemption would not apply to other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ether. Lawmakers also noted they are still evaluating whether to introduce an annual cap to prevent the provision from being used to shield investment activity rather than consumer payments. BREAKING: US HOUSE REPRESENTATIVES DRAFT BILL TO EXEMPT CRYPTO STABLECOIN TRANSACTIONS UNDER $200 FROM CAPITAL GAINS TAXES. pic.twitter.com/aOnS4yLezE — Crypto Rover (@cryptorover) December 20, 2025 Beyond stablecoins, the draft attempts to resolve one of the most contentious issues in crypto tax policy: when staking and mining rewards should be taxed. Current IRS guidance treats rewards as taxable income at the moment they are received, a position that has drawn criticism from industry advocates and some Republican lawmakers. At the other end of the spectrum, Senator Cynthia Lummis has pushed for deferring taxes until rewards are sold. The Miller-Horsford proposal takes a middle-ground approach. Taxpayers would be allowed to elect a five-year deferral on staking and mining rewards. At the end of that period, the rewards would be taxed as ordinary income based on their fair market value. The draft describes the framework as a compromise between immediate taxation and full deferral until sale. US House Draft Extends Securities Tax Rules to Crypto, Targets Wash Trades The bill also extends several securities tax rules to digital assets. It would apply wash sale restrictions to cryptocurrencies, limit strategies designed to lock in gains while delaying taxes, and extend securities lending treatment to qualifying crypto loans involving fungible, liquid assets. NFTs and illiquid tokens would be excluded. Additional provisions would allow professional traders to use mark-to-market accounting and relax appraisal requirements for charitable donations of large-cap digital assets. Passive protocol-level staking by investment funds would also be clarified as not constituting a trade or business. The stablecoin safe harbor would take effect for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. Miller has said he believes the broader legislation could advance before August 2026.

The shift comes after zkEVM teams successfully reduced proving times from 16 minutes to 16 seconds while cutting costs by 45 times, with 99% of Ethereum blocks now provable in under 10 seconds on target hardware. Despite these performance achievements, the foundation warned that security remains “ the elephant in the room ,” with many STARK-based zkEVMs relying on unproven mathematical conjectures that recent research has begun to disprove. “ If an attacker can forge a proof, they can forge anything: mint tokens from nothing, rewrite state, steal funds, ” the foundation stated in a December 18 post . zkEVMs crushed the 2025 boss: real-time proving 2026 boss: 128-bit provable security New blog post on the next level for Ethereum zkEVMs: three milestones, paving the path to mainnet-grade L1 zkEVMs. https://t.co/mueR1JWW6c Game on. — George Kadianakis (@asn_d6) December 19, 2025 Provable Security Becomes Non-Negotiable Standard The foundation established 128-bit provable security as the mandatory target for mainnet-grade zkEVMs, aligning with standards recommended by cryptographic standardization bodies. The first milestone requires zkEVM teams to integrate their proof system components with soundcalc, a newly created security estimation tool, by the end of February 2026. By May 2026, teams must achieve 100-bit provable security with final proof sizes under 600 kilobytes while providing compact descriptions of their recursion architecture. The final milestone requires 128-bit provable security, with proof sizes limited to 300 kilobytes, and formal security arguments for recursion soundness by year-end 2026. George Kadianakis from the EF cryptography team emphasized the strategic timing of securing zkEVM architectures before they become moving targets. “ Once teams have hit these targets and zkVM architectures stabilize, the formal verification work we’ve been investing in can reach its full potential, ” he wrote. Recent cryptographic advances, including compact polynomial commitment schemes like WHIR, techniques such as JaggedPCS, and well-structured recursion topologies, now make these ambitious security targets achievable. The foundation plans to publish detailed technical posts in January outlining proof system techniques for reaching the security and proof size requirements. Foundation Expands Institutional Adoption Push While tightening technical standards, Ethereum has simultaneously accelerated institutional outreach through its new “ Ethereum for Institutions ” portal launched in October. The platform guides enterprises and financial institutions building on Ethereum’s infrastructure, highlighting the network’s decade-long reliability with over 1.1 million validators and continuous uptime. The foundation emphasized privacy-preserving technologies, including zero-knowledge proofs, fully homomorphic encryption, and trusted execution environments, as essential for compliant institutional applications. “ Privacy solutions are no longer theoretical — they’re live and scaling in production, ” the foundation noted, pointing to projects like Chainlink, RAILGUN, and Aztec Network. Ethereum currently hosts over 66% of all tokenized real-world assets according to RWA.xyz , with major financial firms including BlackRock, Securitize, and Ondo Finance deploying tokenized instruments. Source: RWA.xyz JPMorgan Chase recently launched its first tokenized money-market fund on Ethereum , seeding the MONY fund with $100 million and opening it to qualified investors with minimum investments of $1 million through its Kinexys Digital Assets platform. The bank’s asset management head, John Donohue, told the Wall Street Journal there is “ a massive amount of interest from clients around tokenization ,” adding that JPMorgan expects to lead the space with product offerings that match traditional money-market funds on the blockchain. Simplicity Challenge Emerges as Critical Priority A few days ago, Co-founder Vitalik Buterin identified protocol complexity as a fundamental threat to Ethereum’s trustlessness in a December 18 statement. “ An important and underrated form of trustlessness is increasing the number of people who can actually understand the whole protocol from top to bottom, ” Buterin wrote, arguing the ecosystem should accept fewer features if necessary to improve understanding. @VitalikButerin says Ethereum’s trustlessness depends not just on decentralization, but on how many people can understand the protocol. #Ethereum #Buterin https://t.co/mIcGdixX8Z — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 18, 2025 The concern resulted from the growing tension between advanced functionality and accessibility as Ethereum’s technical abstractions multiply. “ If only five people can understand how your privacy protocol works, you haven’t achieved trustlessness, you’ve just changed who you trust, ” privacy-focused layer-2 network INTMAX stated. The foundation acknowledged these challenges in its roadmap, describing Ethereum as “ too complex ” for most users while outlining plans for smart contract wallets that simplify gas fees and key management. Meanwhile, the foundation temporarily paused open grant applications for its Ecosystem Support Program in August, citing plans to shift toward more targeted infrastructure funding after awarding nearly $3 million to 105 projects in 2024 alone.

In a statement on Sunday, the electronics manufacturer mentioned that it would release the product in January next year, marking its first home appliance equipped with the artificial intelligence technology. The Korean tech giant mentioned that it will showcase the new bespoke artificial intelligence refrigerator during the First Look event ahead of CES, which is expected to open in Las Vegas in January. According to Samsung, the deployment of Google’s Gemini in the product is to ensure that its AI Vision technology improves food recognition capabilities by analyzing images captured using an internal camera. The upgrade is expected to increase the range of items that the refrigerator can identify beyond its previous limit. Samsung set to debut its AI-powered refrigerator According to the company, this new model of AI-powered refrigerator will be able to automatically identify up to 37 fresh foods and 50 packaged foods, beating its previous limit. The AI-powered system will also be able to recognize printed or handwritten labels on food containers and automatically include them in a digital grocery list. Samsung also added that the enhanced AI will support its AI Food Manager feature, which provides ingredient tracking. In addition, the Manager feature will also provide recipe recommendations and shopping suggestions based on the consumption patterns of its users. Samsung has plans to extend the upgraded AI Vision technology to its wine refrigerators as well. The AI Wine Manager feature will allow the appliance to recognise wine bottles placed inside the refrigerator, recording details such as name, variety, vintage, and storage location. The system can also update inventory in real time, recording when bottles are removed or replaced. Samsung noted that the new AI Vision features will be rolled out across its Bespoke AI Family Hub, Bespoke AI Hybrid, and Infinite AI Wine Refrigerator models, which are scheduled to be released in 2026. “Samsung Electronics has led innovation in kitchen appliances with its AI Vision technology,” said Moon Jong-seung, head of the company’s digital appliance division. “Through the collaboration with Google, we aim to deliver a differentiated food experience with a more advanced version of AI Vision.” Google’s Gemini grabs attention in the AI market Google recently announced the launch of Gemini 3, with the company going straight after OpenAI as the arms race between the two tech giants gets louder. The announcement was shared by Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, marking another attempt by Google to fight for control in a space that was largely dominated by OpenAI in 2022. Describing Gemini 3, Pichai mentioned that it will help users get what they want with less prompting, adding that it understands context, depth, and intent better than most chatbots. Meanwhile, a recent Cryptopolitan report mentioned that ChatGPT is losing the AI race to Gemini. The report highlighted that Gemini has been moving faster than ChatGPT in terms of new downloads, monthly active users, and average user engagements. In addition, Gemini saw its worldwide monthly user base jump by 170% in the past year, compared to that of ChatGPT, which saw a rise of 180%. However, a closer look from August to November showed a monthly user rise of 6% for ChatGPT compared to that of Gemini at 30% in the same duration. The report highlighted that Google has an edge that could matter in the long run, noting that twice as many Android phone users in the United States now work with Gemini through their mobile phone’s operating system instead of using it on a separate app. Since Androids still dominate the phone market worldwide, the built-in access allows Google to reach more people beyond those who choose to download the application or visit the website to carry out their activities.

Many investors are already watching it as the next crypto to hit $1. The project is still early, yet its pace hints at a breakout year ahead. Crypto predictions for 2026 are heating up, and Mutuum is now part of that conversation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in presale phase 6 at a price of 0.035. This phase holds 170 million tokens, and 99% is already sold. Across all presale phases, over 18,550 holders have taken early positions. With all phases combined, the presale has generated around 19.41 million dollars. The total supply is 4 billion tokens. These numbers show that strong demand is already forming as the project moves toward its next growth stage. A Powerful Lending Engine Ready to Scale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a dual lending model that will give users two clear lending choices. This design will set the foundation for a flexible and active borrowing market. The platform will support both peer-to-contract lending and peer-to-peer lending. These systems will guide new flows of liquidity and create a steady user cycle inside the ecosystem. The team is building its lending and borrowing protocol. The version 1 of the protocol is expected to launch on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. The system will include a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, a liquidator bot, and other core tools that will manage loans. The first supported assets will be ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, and collateral. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also shown its focus on safety. The team announced that Halborn Security is now reviewing the lending and borrowing contracts. The audit will check for errors and vulnerabilities. The review will confirm that the finalized code is safe, reliable, and ready for future use. This step will increase user trust and prepare the protocol for wider adoption. What Will Make It Explode in 2026? One of the main growth drivers will be the project’s stablecoin system. The stablecoin will aim to stay at one dollar. It will be minted when users borrow with collateral like ETH and will be burned when loans are repaid or liquidated. Only approved issuers will mint it. Each issuer will have a set limit that will help control risk. Governance will manage the interest rate to support the stablecoin’s price. If the price rises above one dollar, the rate will be lowered. If the price falls, the rate will be raised. Arbitrage will help keep the price close to one dollar. All loans will stay overcollateralized and will be liquidated automatically if needed. Idle collateral reserves will support long-term stability. This will make the stablecoin a safe medium of exchange and a safe place to store value. It will act as the core currency inside the dual lending markets and will drive long-term activity and demand for MUTM. Another major growth driver will be price discovery through strong oracle design. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will rely on decentralized pricing tools. Chainlink feeds are expected to give price data for assets like ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. This design will support fair valuations and safe liquidation events. The platform will also prepare fallback oracles to replace the primary feed during delays or outages. Another layer will involve aggregated feeds. These feeds will combine price sources to reduce risk and market pressure. When there is enough on-chain liquidity, decentralized exchange data will also guide fair value. These steps will support accurate pricing. That accuracy will attract long-term users who will take larger positions. Stable usage will bring stronger fee generation. That flow will support treasury growth, which will give the MUTM token more future economic value. A third growth driver is the rising expectation of future listings. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has shown the early strength that is often seen in projects that later reach large exchanges. The growing holder count, projected dual lending function, stablecoin design, and strong presale structure place it in a promising position. With these features, many investors expect that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be seen on major venues, including Tier 1 and Tier 2 platforms. A listing will invite new liquidity, wider reach, and strong whale attention. These shifts will increase trust and drive demand for MUTM. That demand will support a steady price rise. Security and Protection for Long-Term Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building strong security layers for users. It has a CertiK audit request on record. The review began on February 25, 2025 and was revised on May 20, 2025. The audit includes manual review and static analysis. The token scan score is 90.00 and the Skynet score is 79.00. These results show that Mutuum is keeping a clear focus on user protection. To keep the system even safer, the platform is offering a large bug bounty program. The pool is 50,000 USDT. Rewards will be based on severity. Critical findings will earn up to 2,000 USDT. Major findings will earn up to 1,000 USDT. Medium findings will earn up to 500 USDT. Low-level findings will earn up to 200 USDT. This program will attract skilled security researchers who will help identify issues early. The program will guide the protocol toward a safer launch and long-term reliability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be one of the most talked-about launches for 2026. The combination of dual lending systems, an overcollateralized stablecoin, strong oracle design, upcoming testnet plans, Halborn review, and the CertiK audit record has brought wide attention. Phase 6 is already 99% sold, and the next price jump will rise from 0.035 to 0.040. This 15% increase will mark a new step forward in the presale. Investors now have their final chance to enter at the lowest cost before the next phase begins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is moving fast, and this moment will not return once the price moves upward.

His analysis was based on leverage positioning and where forced liquidations would likely occur. That data reveals a clear imbalance in the current XRP market structure. While the price remains subdued, liquidity data suggests a potential move toward higher levels. XRP has traded within a narrowing range this month. This environment often hides leverage buildup. The heatmap provides visibility into that buildup and shows why current price behavior may not reflect underlying pressure. The chart highlights a lack of meaningful liquidity below current levels while showing a large concentration of leverage above. BREAKING: THIS HEATMAP SHOWS WHERE #XRP WANTS TO GO. pic.twitter.com/jh4DxMJZwP — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 19, 2025 Liquidity Concentration Favors Higher Prices The liquidation heatmap tracks where leveraged long and short positions would be forced to close if the price moves. These zones matter because liquidation events add volume and accelerate direction. On the chart, liquidity below XRP’s current price appears thin and scattered. That suggests fewer vulnerable long positions sitting underneath the market. Above current levels, the picture changes sharply. The chart shows dense liquidity bands forming around $3. This zone between $2.7 and $3.3 represents short positions that would face liquidation if the price rises into that range. When markets move toward heavier liquidity , prices often travel faster as forced buying compounds momentum. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP: Why the $2.7 to $3.3 Zone Stands Out The $2.7 to $3.3 area holds the most visible leverage on the chart. It also stands out because XRP does not need a large move to reach this zone. Notably, a well-known analyst recently set a $2.73 target for XRP, and a relatively modest advance could trigger the first wave of liquidations. This range also aligns with a psychological price level that traders monitor closely. When technical awareness overlaps with liquidation pressure, reactions tend to intensify. As XRP approaches these zones, short sellers often rush to close positions manually, adding further buying pressure before automatic liquidations even begin. The heatmap extends beyond $3, showing additional liquidity higher up. Still, the strongest concentration remains clustered just below and around $3. While some market participants don’t believe XRP can rise above $3 in 2025 , the current liquidity clusters make it the most immediate area of interest. As long as leverage remains stacked above current levels and sparse below, XRP can sustain upward pressure. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

56131104,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=248506,1766311812,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin Price Surge: BTC Soars Past $89,000 in Stunning Rally",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-surge-89000-3/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Surge: BTC Soars Past $89,000 in Stunning Rally In a powerful move that has electrified the crypto market, Bitcoin has surged above the $89,000 mark. According to real-time data from Binance’s USDT trading pair, the world’s leading cryptocurrency is now trading firmly at this new threshold. This significant Bitcoin price surge marks a pivotal moment, capturing the attention of traders and investors worldwide. But what’s fueling this impressive climb, and what could it signal for the future? What’s Driving the Current Bitcoin Price Surge? The recent breakout is not happening in a vacuum. Several key factors are converging to create this bullish momentum. First, increasing institutional adoption continues to provide a solid foundation of demand. Moreover, macroeconomic conditions, such as concerns about inflation, often drive investors toward assets perceived as stores of value. Therefore, Bitcoin’s latest rally reflects a combination of technical strength and fundamental confidence. Market sentiment has turned decisively positive. Key on-chain metrics, like exchange outflows and wallet accumulation, suggest investors are moving their BTC off exchanges—a sign of long-term holding intent. This reduction in readily available supply, coupled with steady demand, creates upward pressure on price. Breaking Down the $89,000 Milestone Reaching and holding above $89,000 is a major psychological and technical achievement. This level was a significant resistance point that many analysts were watching closely. Breaking through it so convincingly opens the door to test even higher price targets. For traders, this Bitcoin price surge validates recent bullish patterns on the charts. Let’s look at the immediate context on Binance, one of the world’s largest exchanges: Trading Pair: BTC/USDT Key Price: $89,000 Market Sentiment: Overwhelmingly Bullish Volume: High trading volume confirms the move’s strength This data indicates the move is supported by substantial buying activity, not just a minor fluctuation. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? For existing holders, this rally is a welcome validation of their strategy. However, for those considering entering the market, it raises important questions. Is it too late to buy? While timing the market perfectly is impossible, understanding the trend is crucial. This Bitcoin price surge demonstrates the asset’s continued volatility and potential for growth. Here are three actionable insights for investors right now: Assess Your Risk Tolerance: High prices can lead to increased volatility. Ensure your portfolio allocation aligns with your comfort level. Focus on the Long-Term Narrative: Look beyond daily price swings to the broader adoption of blockchain technology. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): This strategy can help mitigate the risk of buying at a short-term peak. Potential Challenges on the Road Ahead While the outlook is positive, it’s wise to acknowledge potential headwinds. Regulatory developments in major economies remain a key unknown. Additionally, profit-taking by short-term traders could create pullbacks. However, the strong fundamental demand suggests any dips may be viewed as buying opportunities by long-term investors, potentially providing support. The current Bitcoin price surge also places a spotlight on network activity. Transaction fees and network congestion can become challenges during periods of intense usage. The ongoing development of layer-2 solutions, like the Lightning Network, is critical to ensuring Bitcoin remains scalable and efficient for everyday use. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Bitcoin Bitcoin’s ascent above $89,000 is more than just a number—it’s a testament to its resilience and growing stature in the global financial landscape. This rally reinforces its role as a leading digital asset and a barometer for the entire cryptocurrency sector. The journey ahead will likely see both continued enthusiasm and expected volatility, but the breakthrough of this key level is a powerful signal of strength. For the crypto community, it’s a moment of triumph that underscores the transformative potential of decentralized digital currency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why did Bitcoin suddenly surge past $89,000? A: The surge is likely due to a combination of factors, including positive institutional inflows, favorable macroeconomic sentiment, and the breaking of key technical resistance levels that triggered automated buying. Q2: Is it a good time to buy Bitcoin at $89,000? A: Investment decisions should be based on your financial goals and risk tolerance, not just price. Many investors use strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) to invest regularly regardless of price, which can mitigate timing risk. Q3: Could the price drop back down quickly? A> Cryptocurrency markets are volatile. While the trend is currently strong, corrections are a normal part of any market cycle. It’s important to be prepared for price fluctuations. Q4: What’s the next major resistance level for Bitcoin? A> With $89,000 breached, analysts often look toward previous all-time highs and round numbers like $90,000 and $95,000 as the next significant psychological and technical barriers. Q5: How does this affect other cryptocurrencies (altcoins)? A> Bitcoin often sets the tone for the broader market. A strong Bitcoin price surge can boost overall sentiment and capital flow into the crypto space, which frequently benefits major altcoins as well. Q6: Where can I track the Bitcoin price reliably? A> Reputable cryptocurrency data aggregators and major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken provide real-time price charts and market data.

While short-term charts reflect hesitation following a bearish flag breakdown earlier in December, broader fundamentals continue to frame Bitcoin as a market in consolidation rather than decline. Macro Signals Keep BTC Supported From a macro perspective, Bitcoin remains underpinned by easing inflation expectations and a shifting US rate outlook. Recent US CPI data showed continued disinflation, reinforcing market bets that the Federal Reserve could move closer to rate cuts in 2026. Lower real yields tend to reduce the opportunity cost of holding Bitcoin, supporting demand during periods of consolidation. Institutional positioning also remains constructive. Spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to anchor long-term inflows, even as short-term traders rotate out during volatility. At the same time, regulatory clarity is slowly improving across major jurisdictions, helping Bitcoin retain its role as a core digital asset rather than a speculative outlier. Market Structure Shows Absorption, Not Panic Despite the recent dip, selling pressure has remained contained. Bitcoin’s failure to break decisively below the $84,500–$85,000 zone suggests that longer-term buyers are stepping in on weakness. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Repeated lower-wick candles near this area point to absorption rather than forced liquidation, a pattern often seen during corrective pauses inside broader uptrends. Bitcoin Technical Picture: Compression Near Resistance On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin price prediction remains inside a broad ascending channel that has guided price since late October. The drop below the 50-EMA near $88,200 and 100-EMA around $89,050 confirms short-term pressure, but momentum indicators are stabilising. RSI has recovered toward 57, holding above oversold levels and hinting at fading downside momentum. Price is now compressing below the $88,200–$89,200 pivot zone, an area that combines prior support and channel midline resistance. This compression suggests the market is preparing for a directional move rather than drifting lower. Bitcoin Price Prediction and Outlook If Bitcoin reclaims and holds above $89,200, TradingView path projections point to a recovery toward $92,000, followed by a retest of $94,200, the previous range high. Failure to reclaim resistance keeps downside risk open toward $84,500, with deeper support near $80,600. As volatility tightens and confidence gradually rebuilds, Bitcoin’s current pause looks less like exhaustion and more like preparation for its next decisive move. PEPENODE: A Mine-to-Earn Meme Coin Nearing Presale Close PEPENODE is gaining momentum as a next-generation meme coin that blends viral culture with interactive gameplay. With over $2.37 mn raised and the presale approaching its cap, interest is building fast as the countdown enters its final stretch. What makes PEPENODE stand out is its mine-to-earn virtual ecosystem. Instead of passive holding, users can build digital server rooms using Miner Nodes and facilities, earning simulated rewards through a visual dashboard. The concept brings gamification and competition into the meme coin space, giving holders something to do before launch. The project also offers presale staking, allowing early participants to earn boosted rewards ahead of the token generation event. Leaderboards and bonus incentives are planned post-launch to keep engagement high. With 1 $PEPENODE priced at $0.0012016 and limited allocation remaining, the presale is entering its final opportunity window for early buyers.

Trading near $0.000008313, SHIB has begun forming a supportive structure that analysts believe could set up a potential 25x breakout in the coming bull cycle. Growing ecosystem upgrades, rising community engagement, and the return of meme-sector liquidity continue to strengthen SHIB’s position heading into 2025. Yet even as Shiba Inu captures attention for its bullish setup, the project that dominates long-term ROI forecasts is Ozak AI (OZ). As an AI-native intelligence engine that improves continuously through real-time data processing, Ozak AI presents a far more exponential trajectory—one that many analysts believe could reach a triple-digit run as its ecosystem expands. Ozak AI’s Early-Stage Acceleration Ozak AI has become a standout in high-growth projections because it is not entering the market with hypothetical tools or future promises. Instead, it launches with an active intelligence engine capable of analyzing blockchain behavior in milliseconds using HIVE’s 30 ms predictive signals. These ultra-fast insights allow Ozak AI to map liquidity flow, volatility patterns, and cross-chain shifts long before conventional analytics tools register them. On top of this predictive core operates a system of autonomous, SINT-powered agents that scan multiple blockchains at once, make decisions without human involvement, and refine their strategies as more data flows into the network. This continuous learning loop is amplified by Perceptron Network’s massive 700K+ node backbone, which delivers uninterrupted cross-chain intelligence to Ozak AI’s models. As the engine runs, it becomes more capable—and therefore more valuable. This compounding intelligence effect is why analysts project Ozak AI as one of the few early-stage assets capable of achieving a 50x–100x run in the 2025–2026 window. The Ozak AI presale has already surpassed $4.9 million, reinforcing how strongly early investors believe in the project’s long-term potential. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu’s trading pattern near $0.000008313 reflects a strengthening foundation that supports its potential for a 25x surge in the next major cycle. Support has formed around $0.000008180, giving SHIB short-term stability, while deeper demand zones at $0.000008010 and $0.000007820 highlight areas where previous accumulation took place. These levels act as structural anchors as the market prepares for larger moves. On the upside, SHIB approaches important resistance zones at $0.000008620, $0.000008910, and $0.000009230. Historically, once SHIB breaks above these levels, momentum accelerates quickly, often transforming small movements into multi-week, sentiment-fueled rallies. With meme liquidity returning and SHIB’s ecosystem continuing to evolve, analysts consider a 25x breakout within reach—strong performance for a large meme asset, though still limited compared to early-stage AI-driven projects. Why Ozak AI Leans Toward a Triple-Digit Run Shiba Inu’s performance depends on meme attention cycles, community activity, and liquidity flows, which tend to come in waves. Ozak AI’s performance is fundamentally different because its growth is tied to intelligence—meaning the system improves automatically as it processes data, analyzes volatility, and refines predictive models. This gives Ozak AI a self-accelerating trajectory that continues even when markets are flat. While SHIB may deliver a powerful 25x rally if meme enthusiasm peaks, Ozak AI’s early valuation and rapidly evolving intelligence infrastructure give it a far greater multiplier potential. As integrations deepen and its predictive models scale across more networks, analysts expect the Ozak AI presale momentum to translate into a triple-digit breakout once the token enters the open market. Shiba Inu is shaping up as one of the strongest meme plays of the next cycle, but Ozak AI stands out as the transformational intelligence-driven project with a much sharper long-term growth curve—making it the more compelling choice for investors targeting outsized ROI in 2025–2026.

The elaborate scam, which reportedly ran from April 2023 to December 2014, resulted in about 100 victims, 70 of whom were interviewed over the course of the investigation. Brooklyn Man Indicted In Nationwide Phishing Scam In a press statement on Friday, Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez announced the Virtual Currency Unit had indicted one Ronald Spektor of Sheepshead Bay, for orchestrating a multi-million dollar phishing and social engineering scam. Spektor, also known as “Ronaldd”, and identified as 23 years old, allegedly contacted multiple Coinbase users acting as an exchange representative to claim that users’ assets were at risk of being stolen, and directed that they move their assets to a given new cryptocurrency wallet. As earlier stated, victims of this scam were found all around the US, including a California resident who reported a $1 million loss, and another Virginia resident who lost over $900,000. Spektor, who has been associated with the Telegram handle @lolimfeelingevil, notoriously cleaned out the stolen assets by laundering them through crypto mixers and gambling sites. The 23-year old defendant was arraigned before the Supreme Court Justice Danny Chun on a 31-count indictment, including counts of first-degree grand larceny, first-degree money laundering, and scheme to defraud. However, Spektor has been held on bail conditions of $2.5 million, after investigations also revealed plans of the alleged fraudster to escape to Mexico. Coinbase Collaborates With Authorities Speaking on the case, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, appreciated the district attorney’s efforts while also noting the exchange’s commitment to protect its customers, evident through its participation in the investigation. Grewal said: We’re grateful to District Attorney Gonzalez and the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office for their partnership and relentless work to protect victims. In this case, Coinbase supported the investigation by helping identify the perpetrator and the customers he defrauded, providing evidence to ensure he could be charged, and assisting law enforcement efforts to trace and recover funds connected to the fraudulent phishing scheme. We’re committed to protecting our customers and working hand-in-hand with law enforcement to hold scammers accountable and help bring justice for those they harm. Meanwhile, Gonzalez has vowed to cleanse Brooklyn of online scams, especially those exploiting innocent crypto users. The Brooklyn DA said: My office is committed to making sure that Brooklyn never becomes a hub for online scams, and we will continue to root out every instance of cryptocurrency fraud, which is a serious problem that’s been exploding throughout the country. We will investigate offenders using the latest technology, freeze their assets whenever possible, and assist the victims. At press time, Gonzalez’s office also reports that $105,000 in cash and approximately $400,000 in crypto assets have been confiscated from the defendant over the course of the investigation, with ongoing efforts to gain access to more stolen assets.",Crypto scam|Brooklyn District Attorney|coinbase|Crypto phishing scam|Eric Gonzaleez|Paul Grewal|Ronald Spektor,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-21 11:00:15

He warned that the market could be witnessing one of the largest bear traps in XRP’s history. The comment comes at a time when many traders remain cautious after weeks of uneven movement and failed breakdown attempts. At first glance, XRP’s recent performance looks uninspiring. That surface-level view encouraged short positions and defensive positioning. However, market structure beneath the price tells a more complex story. $XRP : This might just be playing out to be one of the largest bear traps in $XRP 's history. — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) December 19, 2025 What a Bear Trap Really Means A bear trap occurs when price action convinces traders that a breakdown is underway, only for the asset to reverse higher. Sellers enter aggressively, and liquidity builds. Once selling pressure exhausts itself, the price snaps back upward, and forces bears to exit at a loss. In strong or transitioning markets, bear traps often appear near key support zones. They rely on fear, not fundamentals. They also tend to form when the price refuses to follow through after breaking lower. The digital asset experienced a notable bear trap in July , when a fakeout pushed many investors out. The asset hit its peak of $3.65 before a swift decline pulled it below $3. However, it did not stay down for long, quickly regaining the $3 level after weak investors had sold their tokens. ChartNerd’s comment suggests a repeat of this exact dynamic. XRP has tested downside levels multiple times without sustained continuation. Each dip attracted buyers faster than expected, causing XRP to recover quickly. That pattern of flash crashes and swift recoveries weakens the bearish case. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What to Expect as 2026 Approaches XRP has traded with high volatility in December, but has shown limited downside follow-through. Its price moved below prior support levels briefly, then reclaimed them. If ChartNerd is right, the current market setup could be the largest bear trap in the asset’s history. The next phase typically involves rapid repricing. In this phase, XRP’s price will move fast as shorts cover and sidelined capital re-enters. That shift can catch the market off guard. Experts have high expectations for XRP in 2026 , and this bear trap could kickstart a massive run during the new year.

The company confirmed previous reports that it has chosen the Israel Land Authority (ILA) area in Kiryat Tivon to build the huge campus where it is expected to accommodate its employees. According to the illustration published by the United States chip company, this building will be a large campus inspired by the design of the company’s new iconic headquarters in Santa Clara. After it is built, the campus will be surrounded by commercial activities and restaurants with investment parks and green spaces. The campus is expected to accommodate a higher number of employees than first estimated, with reports noting that it could be double the number of current employees that Nvidia has in Israel. Nvidia set to build a new campus in Israel According to the report , Nvidia could have at least 15,000 employees in Israel if it does not close its existing offices. If all things go to plan, Nvidia could become the largest private employer in the country, assuming that revenue continues to grow steadily at its current rate. It is expected that Nvidia will invest several billion dollars in the new site over the next few years. The company will purchase 22.5 acres of land, and the campus will cover 160,000 square meters of buildings. The company notes that construction is expected to begin in 2027, and there is a plan for initial occupancy in the location by 2031. “The campus will offer an innovative work environment and advanced services: parks, visitor centers, cafes, and restaurants. Alongside these, it will also include labs and collaborative spaces that will foster collaboration and innovation within Nvidia, and together with startups and partners in the broader ecosystem, supporting Nvidia’s growth in the country,” the announcement read. Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang mentioned that Israel is like a home to some of the most brilliant technologists in the world, noting that the location has become a second home for Nvidia . He mentioned that the new campus will be a place where teams can collaborate, build, and ignite the fire of artificial intelligence. Huang also mentioned that the investment shows a deep and enduring commitment to their family in Israel and their unique contribution to AI. Nvidia to provide employment opportunities The architect of the deal is Amit Krieg, a resident of Kiryat Tivon and the Senior Vice President of Software Engineering at the company . As the site leader, Krieg attended several meetings with the ILA, the Planning Administration, and Israel Electric Corp., and has overseen the whole process from the request for information to the signing of the deal with the authorities involved. In his statement, Krieg highlighted the growth of Nvidia in the country, noting that it was driven by the extraordinary talent and engineering excellence of its teams. He thanked Huang and the company’s leadership for their trust and support for the next phase of growth. He also showered encomiums on the authorities involved in the case, noting that the company looks forward to bringing its vision to life and continuing to build the future of artificial intelligence. According to Globes, Nvidia will pay NIS 90 million for the land and pay about NIS 7.5 million a year in taxes to the local council. The development signifies a boost to the region as thousands of employees are expected to move to the towns and villages in the area. Meanwhile, there have been complaints that the development could put a strain on infrastructure in the area, which includes just one railway station, which is about 5 kilometers from the site.

Max Miller and Steven Horsford. The draft focuses on reducing compliance burdens tied to small transactions and addressing long-standing concerns around how digital asset rewards are taxed. The proposal, titled as a discussion draft, does not yet represent final legislation. However, it outlines specific mechanisms lawmakers say are designed to better align crypto tax rules with how digital assets are used in practice. The text also signals that several technical elements remain under review before any formal introduction. If advanced, the measures would mark one of the clearest attempts so far by Congress to narrow the tax gap between traditional payment tools and digital assets used for routine activity. Stablecoin payments targeted for de minimis tax relief The draft proposes a de minimis exemption for certain stablecoin transactions, meaning users would not have to calculate gains or losses for small payments. The threshold referenced in the explanatory language is $200 per transaction, mirroring an existing tax rule for foreign currency use. However, the exemption applies only to what the bill calls “regulated payment stablecoins.” These are defined as U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins that meet federal regulatory standards and demonstrate consistent price stability. The draft specifies that the stablecoin must have traded within 1% of $1 for at least 95% of the prior 12 months. In addition, the taxpayer must have acquired the stablecoin within a narrow price band around $1. If a payment occurs when the stablecoin trades outside that range, the exemption would not apply. In those cases, the draft introduces a deemed $1 cost basis for calculating taxable gain or loss. Lawmakers also flag potential guardrails. The discussion text notes that an annual aggregate cap and anti-abuse provisions are still under consideration. These would aim to prevent taxpayers from repeatedly splitting payments to stay under the transaction threshold. Staking and mining rewards election addresses timing of income The draft also tackles taxation of staking and mining rewards, an area that has drawn criticism for triggering income tax before assets are sold. Under the proposal, taxpayers could elect to defer recognizing staking or mining rewards for tax purposes. The election would apply to activities defined as validating transactions on a cryptographically secured distributed ledger, including closely related processes. If the election is made, income recognition could be deferred until a set future point, described in the draft as up to the fifth taxable year after receipt. When recognition occurs, the reward would be taxed as ordinary income based on its fair market value at that time. Afterward, the recognized amount would establish the asset’s tax basis, with later gains or losses treated under capital gains rules. The draft requires annual reporting to the Internal Revenue Service for assets covered by the election. It also suggests limits for taxpayers using mark-to-market accounting, although those provisions remain bracketed and subject to revision. Broader crypto tax framework still taking shape Beyond stablecoins and staking, the discussion draft sketches a wider crypto tax framework. It includes concepts to extend wash sale restrictions to actively traded digital assets and explores nonrecognition treatment for certain digital asset lending arrangements. Other sections address potential mark-to-market elections for digital asset dealers, constructive sale rules for crypto hedging strategies, and updated standards for charitable donations involving actively traded digital assets. Because the document is labeled as a discussion draft, lawmakers stress that technical details may change. Still, the proposal signals growing momentum in Congress to tailor tax rules to how digital assets function in real-world use, particularly for payments and network participation.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-21 11:13:08

Writing on Farcaster, Buterin acknowledged prediction markets could theoretically create incentives for harmful actions but dismissed this risk for small-scale markets covering large events. He noted that regular stock markets pose similar concerns, pointing out that political actors could profit from disasters simply by shorting stocks with far higher volumes than those on prediction platforms. Source: Farcaster Truth-Seeking Versus Social Media Sensationalism Buterin positioned prediction markets as solutions to social media’s fundamental accountability gap. “ The thing to compare them to is social media, ” he wrote, explaining how platforms reward sensationalism over accuracy. “ In social media, lots of people talk about ‘THIS WAR WILL DEFINITELY HAPPEN’ and scare people, and there’s no real accountability: you gain clout in the moment (and that clout is often very monetizable clout!), and no accountability after the fact. “ He contrasted this with prediction markets where financial stakes enforce truth-seeking. “ With prediction markets, if you make a dumb bet, you lose, and the system (i) over time becomes more truth-seeking, and (ii) shows probabilities that reflect genuine uncertainty in the world much more faithfully than these other systems, ” Buterin explained. The Ethereum founder shared personal experiences using prediction markets to verify alarming news. “ I can personally report a few times reading a news headline, feeling scared, then checking polymarket prices and feeling calmer – the people who have experience on that topic know what’s going on and the probability of anything unusual happening is only 4%, ” he wrote. Buterin also defended prediction markets against comparisons with financial markets. “ I actually find prediction markets to be healthier to participate in than regular markets, ” he stated, explaining that “ prices are bounded between 0 and 1, so they are much less dominated by reflexivity effects, ‘greater fool theory’, pump-and-dumps, etc. “ Fierce Ethical Debate Divides Industry Buterin’s defense sparked heated exchanges with critics led by Quilibrium founder Cassie Heart, who argued that betting on deaths explains mainstream hatred toward crypto. “ I don’t know fam but if you ask me the idea of gambling on whether a bunch of people are going to die is why this industry is hated by the majority, ” Heart wrote on Farcaster. Source: Farcaster Heart escalated her criticism with provocative scenarios. “ Maybe they’ll start slapping sponsor labels on missiles while we’re at it, ” she suggested , adding, “ These children were slaughtered thanks to the good bidders at Polymarket and Kalshi. Thank you Coinbase! “ When Buterin presented prediction markets as information tools, Heart challenged the framing directly. “ Ok, so here’s my counter: a prediction market for whether or not someone will get killed in order to influence a prediction market result, ” she posed, questioning whether Buterin accepted such outcomes. Other commenters provided historical context supporting the use of prediction markets. One user referenced “ Superforecasting ,” noting that the NSA under Bush and Obama ran private prediction markets in which participants acting as information gatherers outperformed CIA and NSA operatives. “ We can have moral arguments about this but the short and sweet is governments and people have been doing financializing war swaps since the Dutch East India company, ” the user explained , arguing democratization simply expanded access beyond elite bankers. Heart rejected this defense outright. “ Oh good, let’s democratize making money on killing people, that’s much better, ” she responded. Rapid Mainstream Adoption Continues Despite moral objections, prediction markets continue their explosive expansion into traditional finance. Google Finance recently integrated live data from Polymarket and Kalshi , allowing users to query future events and view market probabilities alongside historical sentiment shifts. Competition is also intensifying as major exchanges rush into the sector. Just last week, Coinbase filed lawsuits against Michigan, Illinois, and Connecticut to challenge state authority over prediction markets, arguing that they fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC ahead of its January 2026 launch with Kalshi. @Coinbase has filed lawsuits against the US states of Michigan, Illinois, and Connecticut, escalating a growing legal fight. #Coinbase #Crypto https://t.co/hTmVsGS8yu — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 19, 2025 Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal stated, “ Prediction markets fall squarely under the jurisdiction of the CFTC, not any individual state gaming regulator. “ Regulatory clarity has also emerged when the CFTC granted no-action relief to Polymarket US, LedgerX, PredictIt, and Gemini Titan early this month, reducing enforcement pressure while requiring full collateralization and transparent transaction data.

The entries display USD estimates in the hundreds of millions for several of the transfers. Binance ETH Staking Transfers. Source: Arkham / X A social media post circulating with the screenshot claimed Binance “staked $500 million worth of ETH this week” and called the activity “bullish for Ethereum.” However, the screenshot itself shows wallet to wallet movements between Binance staking labeled addresses, so it does not, on its own, prove new staking demand from external users or net new ETH entering Binance staking. The same post also included a promotional line asking readers not to forget to “drop your sol wallet address.” Meanwhile, the on chain view shown in the image focuses on Ethereum transfers and does not reference Solana wallets or any giveaway mechanics.

The lawsuit seeks $4 billion in damages and was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal . The case was brought by Todd Snyder, who was appointed to administer Terraform Labs’ bankruptcy plan. Jump Trading, its co-founder William DiSomma, and former Jump Crypto president Kanav Kariya are named as defendants. Alleged secret agreements and discounted Luna purchases According to the complaint, Jump entered into a series of undisclosed agreements with Terraform Labs beginning in 2019. These arrangements allegedly allowed Jump to purchase millions of Luna tokens at prices far below prevailing market rates. In one cited agreement, Jump reportedly received the right to buy Luna at $0.40 per token. At later points, Luna’s market price exceeded $110. The administrator claims these transactions generated billions of dollars in profits for Jump. The lawsuit also describes what it calls a “gentlemen’s agreement” under which Jump allegedly committed to supporting the TerraUSD (UST) peg to the U.S. dollar. The filing claims the agreement was intentionally kept secret to avoid regulatory scrutiny. In May 2021, TerraUSD briefly lost its dollar peg before rapidly recovering. The lawsuit asserts that the rebound was not the result of Terraform’s algorithmic mechanism, as publicly claimed, but instead stemmed from large-scale UST purchases made by Jump. Following the recovery, the complaint alleges that Jump and Terraform falsely represented the event as proof that the algorithm worked as designed. Vesting changes and market sales After identifying weaknesses in TerraUSD’s structure, Jump allegedly negotiated the removal of vesting restrictions on its Luna holdings. This change allowed the firm to regularly receive and sell tokens on the open market without traditional lockup periods, according to the filing. After the initial depeg, the Luna Foundation Guard was established to defend UST using reserves of Bitcoin and other digital assets. The lawsuit claims that during the final collapse in May 2022, the foundation transferred nearly 50,000 BTC to Jump without a written agreement governing their use. The administrator alleges that these actions were effectively directed by Terraform co-founder Do Kwon and Kanav Kariya. The lawsuit also claims DiSomma contacted executives at other crypto trading firms to seek emergency funding for Terra. According to the filing, some recipients of that information instead traded against UST and Luna, accelerating the collapse. In a statement included in the filing, Snyder said Jump “actively exploited the Terraform Labs ecosystem through manipulation, concealment, and self-enrichment,” while thousands of investors suffered losses. Jump denies allegations as blame-shifting Jump Trading denied the claims, calling the lawsuit an attempt to deflect responsibility from Terraform and its founder. “This is a desperate attempt by Terraform Labs to shift blame and financial responsibility for the crimes committed by Do Kwon,” a company spokesperson said, adding that Jump would “vigorously defend” against the allegations. In December 2024, Jump’s Tai Mo Shan affiliate agreed to pay $123 million to settle a U.S. regulatory investigation related to its dealings with Terraform in 2021. Separately, Do Kwon pleaded guilty in August 2025 to two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud. In December 2025, a U.S. federal court sentenced him to 15 years in prison, citing deliberate deception of investors and losses estimated at roughly $40 billion.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,LUNA|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-21 11:25:24

The plan does not come from a regulator. Instead, it reflects academic policy advice aimed at exploring cross border payments while keeping mainland capital controls intact. The proposal argues that stablecoin experiments could support trade settlement and financial innovation if they remain tightly ring fenced. It points to free trade zones as controlled environments where regulators already test reforms tied to foreign exchange and cross border finance. The authors stress that any pilot would exclude domestic retail users and avoid open circulation on the mainland. The idea emerges as Beijing continues to signal caution toward crypto assets. Regulators have repeatedly warned about risks tied to illicit finance and capital flight. As a result, the proposal frames stablecoins as infrastructure for trade, not speculative assets. Free Trade Zones Named as Test Beds The report identifies Qianhai Free Trade Zone and the Hainan Free Trade Port as initial candidates. These zones already host cross border finance pilots and links with offshore markets. The authors say their legal flexibility makes them suitable for sandbox style testing. They propose creating a closed regulatory sandbox overseen by local financial authorities and foreign exchange regulators. In addition, coordination with Hong Kong would allow alignment with its licensing regime for stablecoin issuers. This structure, they argue, could reduce regulatory blind spots. The proposal also outlines a whitelist approach. Only approved stablecoins would be allowed inside the sandbox. Early use cases would focus on business to business settlement linked to real trade flows rather than consumer payments. Offshore RMB Stablecoin and Risk Controls A central concept is an offshore renminbi stablecoin backed one to one by offshore RMB reserves. The authors argue this design could support trade settlement without opening the mainland capital account. They emphasize that reserves should remain outside the domestic banking system. Risk controls feature heavily. The proposal calls for third party audits of reserves, real time transaction monitoring, and strict AML checks. It also suggests contingency tools, including transaction freezes if abnormal activity appears. Finally, it places the idea against China’s broader policy stance. The People’s Bank of China reiterated concerns over stablecoin risks in late 2025 . As a result, the proposal remains advisory. Any move toward pilots would still require explicit regulatory approval.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-21 11:27:04

However, as has been proven time and again through market cycles that the opportunities for growth are not imposed by larger market cap projects, early-stage projects have opportunities that offer lower entry-level thresholds. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , one of the ones which have currently received attention from investors as the next crypto to explode, is already in high demand, with over 18,550 unique investors and an investment of nearly $20 million. It is living up to its concept of being a top DeFi lend/borrow, interest token and the best crypto to buy. It is also emerging as a replacement for Ethereum, which may not have enough potential for big gains. Ethereum Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) is undergoing a massive recovery pattern from approximately $2,877 and is acquiring more momentum to break above the crucial level of $3,000, which represents the start of a bullish trend again. The massive green surge in the 4-hour chart represents a potential process of forming a bottom. With a break-out above $3,088, there will be a massive surge to $3,216, representing an increase of approximately 5.7%. A close above $3,000 will represent a massive positive signal to all traders and investors to examine the bullish trend in Ethereum (ETH) and will also present profitable trading opportunities in ETH tokens, resulting in a massive appreciation in Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM Presale Phase Six Mutuum Finance is swiftly emerging as the most superior crypto available in the market to buy in the DeFi sector, as Phase 6 will soon be completed. The market value available for buying the tokens is currently set at $0.035. It is practically the last chance available in Phase 6 before Phase 7, when a rise of 20% in value to $0.04 for each token will be experienced. Over 18,550 individuals have taken part in this presale event and have invested more than $19.5 million. Security is one of the initial tenets for the development of Mutuum Finance. The loaning and borrowing contracts for the platform are undergoing an independent security audit by Halborn Security. This will make sure that all the contracts are functioning properly and the funds of the users are fully secure. On completion of the security audit, the Mutuum Finance development team will make an official announcement for the testnet launch, through which early adopters will eventually get a chance to use the platform in a secure environment. Mutuum Finance engages the community actively by providing them with adequate incentives. Early birds are treated with a $100,000 giveaway, with the first ten individuals getting $10,000 worth of MUTM. It is but one of the innovative and progressive ways MUTM is handling community relations, making MUTM the best crypto to buy with utility and adoption. MUTM, The Next Crypto to Explode Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is close to being 99% sold out in phase 6 at $0.035, with over 18,550+ holders cumulatively pouring in close to $19.5M. Phase 7 is going to move the price ahead to $0.04, and this is going to be one of the last chances for investors to make investments on board. Because of its utility DeFi platform for loaning and borrowing, Halborn-tested security, and community giveaway of $100K, MUTM has incredible potential to become the next crypto to explode.

The former finally concluded the years-long lawsuit against the US SEC, made some big acquisitions and partnerships, and gained some traction in new regions worldwide. The latter matched its 2018 all-time high in January and finally managed to break it in July. It also saw the release of five spot ETFs tracking its performance in the US. However, it has been mostly downhill for its price movements since the July peak and is now struggling below $2.00. What does the end of the year hold for XRP? We asked ChatGPT. Big Run or Big Drop? The popular AI tool outlined XRP’s downfall since July, noting that it enters the Christmas period in “one of its weakest positions since the summer.” In fact, the asset’s current price levels under $2.00 have been a rare sight in 2025, aside from a few brief dips below that level. It has been able to reclaim that line almost immediately on previous occasions, but the landscape now appears different. It added that XRP’s most crucial level now appears to be the $1.85-$1.90 support. If it falls, the next one is at $1.70, but some analysts warned that XRP could dump to as low as $1.00 if the $1.90 support cracks for good. If it manages to reclaim it, though, then it could aim for $2.05-$2.15, which is the first major resistance on its way to recovery. The big one is at $2.40, which now appears miles away. “The $1.90 zone has held multiple times, but XRP’s inability to generate strong bounces from this region shows weakening demand. Meanwhile, volume on down days has been consistently higher – a sign that sellers remain dominant,” said ChatGPT. Most Likely Scenarios It’s worth noting that OpenAI’s solution doesn’t expect any fireworks by the end of 2025. Historically, the last couple of weeks before the end of a year haven’t been as volatile as previous months, for example. As such, it classified the “base case” as the most likely scenario, in which XRP’s trading range will be between $1.85 and $2.05. However, it also outlined that in case of an overall market resurgence, Ripple’s token could aim at the aforementioned macro resistance at $2.40. In contrast, ChatGPT highlighted that a drop to $1.70 would be the worst-case scenario if BTC retraces further or altcoins continue to bleed out. It concluded that XRP’s Christmas period appears weak at the moment, with little demand on almost all fronts. Unless the $2.05 resistance breaks convincingly, the asset will likely end the year in a consolidation zone or slightly lower.

On-chain data confirms deliberate reallocations into yield-focused tokens as ETH stalls below resistance. The move highlights a broader market dynamic where capital is rotating within crypto, shaping near-term Bitcoin and altcoin price trajectories. Arthur Hayes Shifts $3M From Ethereum to DeFi as Charts Signal Rotation A notable shift is unfolding in Arthur Hayes’s portfolio, as on-chain data confirms an active rotation away from Ethereum and into select decentralized finance tokens. The move follows Hayes’ public comments on December 20, where he flagged improving global liquidity conditions and hinted at tactical repositioning rather than broad risk reduction. We are rotating out of $ETH and into high-quality DeFi names, which we believe can outperform as fiat liquidity improves. — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) December 20, 2025 Data shared by Lookonchain shows this was not symbolic. More than 1,100 ETH was moved and redeployed, marking a capital-backed strategy shift involving several million dollars. Arthur Hayes( @CryptoHayes ) just transferred another 680 $ETH ($2.03M) to sell and rotate into high-quality DFi tokens. https://t.co/jifQkMFtiO pic.twitter.com/xYIW9o7xSK — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 20, 2025 Ethereum Becomes the Funding Asset Hayes hasn’t abandoned Ethereum as a long-term asset. Instead, the rotation suggests ETH is being used as a funding layer while capital is redirected toward higher-beta opportunities within DeFi. Between December 19 and 20, Hayes transferred ETH to exchanges and market-making venues, where it was promptly converted into DeFi exposure. The speed and size of the transactions point to deliberate execution rather than portfolio testing or hedging. This framing matters. Hayes is rotating within crypto risk, not stepping away from it. Ethena, Pendle, and ether.fi in Focus The largest allocation has gone to Ethena (ENA), where Hayes added roughly 1.22 million tokens in a single session, bringing his total holdings above 6 million ENA. He has also accumulated Pendle (PENDLE) and ether.fi (ETHFI), both tied to yield tokenization and liquid restaking. Arthur Hayes( @CryptoHayes ) just bought 1.22M $ENA ($257.5K) 30 mins ago. https://t.co/loeYKUb9rN https://t.co/3j5DkVtzD1 pic.twitter.com/ft4csng5e9 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 20, 2025 Together, these positions align with Hayes’ long-standing thesis that liquidity-sensitive protocols tend to outperform during early easing cycles. Ethereum Price Prediction – Technical Signals Reinforce the Shift The rotation also aligns with Ethereum’s current technical posture. ETH has been trading inside a descending channel on the 4-hour chart, repeatedly failing to reclaim the $3,100–$3,150 resistance zone. Momentum indicators suggest stabilization rather than strength, with the RSI hovering in neutral territory and the price consolidating below key moving averages. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview By contrast, several DeFi tokens have already broken short-term downtrends or reclaimed critical EMAs, suggesting relative strength versus ETH. From a trader’s perspective, this divergence supports Hayes’ move to seek alpha in yield-driven assets while Ethereum digests its recent correction. What are the Rotation Signals for Traders Hayes is positioning for relative outperformance rather than a directional market call. Ethereum remains structurally important, but near-term capital may favor protocols that directly monetize yield, liquidity, and on-chain activity. The on-chain evidence removes ambiguity. This is not narrative positioning. It’s capital moving ahead of a potential liquidity turn.

According to the report, OpenAI aims to close the funding round by the end of the first quarter of 2026 and is considering bringing in sovereign wealth funds and other large institutional investors. Earlier reporting from The Information suggested the deal could value OpenAI at around $750 billion, but sources cited by the Journal said the valuation under discussion could climb significantly higher. If completed, the round would further cement OpenAI’s position as the most valuable private company in the world. Funding talks reflect rising AI infrastructure costs The potential funding would support OpenAI’s aggressive expansion of its computing capabilities. The company has been investing heavily in infrastructure as demand for advanced AI models continues to grow. Media reports indicate OpenAI is increasingly paying for inference and model training through direct cash expenditures rather than relying on cloud credits. That shift points to sharply rising computing costs as models scale in size and complexity. Competition and investor caution shape the backdrop The funding discussions are unfolding as competition intensifies across the AI sector, with major players such as Google and Anthropic accelerating their own model releases and enterprise offerings. The competitive pressure has pushed OpenAI to move faster on both product development and ecosystem expansion. At the same time, investor sentiment toward AI has grown more cautious. Analysts have questioned whether the current pace of capital investment—often financed in part through debt by large technology companies like Amazon and Microsoft—is sustainable over the long term. Another ongoing risk is the global shortage of advanced memory chips, which continues to constrain supply across the technology industry. Against this backdrop, media reports have also fueled speculation that OpenAI may eventually pursue an initial public offering that could target a valuation approaching $1 trillion. The company’s most recent funding round valued it at roughly $500 billion, with total capital raised now exceeding $64 billion. OpenAI has not commented publicly on the latest funding discussions. Separately, HSBC analysts have estimated that OpenAI would need at least $207 billion in funding to maintain operations through 2030, underscoring the immense financial demands of leading-edge AI development.",News|Ai,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-21 11:32:06

The chart also plotted a potential move from the recent peak area toward that realized-price band, implying a decline of roughly 55% if price revisits the level. Bitcoin cycles show similar length over last three runs, analyst says Meanwhile, Crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen said Bitcoin’s last three market cycles each lasted about the same amount of time, based on how long price took to move from a cycle bottom to a later peak.

This zone reflects concentrated leverage that could attract price moves during volatility. At the same time, the heatmap highlights a lower liquidity cluster well below spot, around the low to mid $70,000 range. The area appears as a bright band, indicating accumulated leveraged exposure that may act as a downside magnet if selling pressure accelerates.

While broader crypto markets have struggled through December, XRP has quietly built a different profile one defined less by speculation and more by steady capital commitment. Spot XRP ETFs Hit $1bn Inflows Milestone XRP’s strongest tailwind remains institutional demand. Spot XRP ETFs including offerings from Grayscale, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton have now surpassed $1.2bn in total assets, with cumulative net inflows topping $1.07bn, according to SoSoValue data . spot XRP ETFs have officially surpassed $1 billion in net inflows this week pic.twitter.com/fgyPnpypaD — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) December 20, 2025 What stands out is consistency. XRP ETFs have recorded 32 consecutive trading days of net inflows since their November launch, even as Bitcoin and Ethereum products experienced intermittent outflows. In a market where capital has become selective, that persistence signals conviction rather than momentum chasing. Regulatory Clarity Gives XRP an Edge XRP continues to benefit from its comparatively clearer legal status in the US following Ripple’s partial courtroom victory. That reduced regulatory overhang has helped XRP retain a market capitalisation above $117bn, keeping it among the most liquid large-cap crypto assets. At the same time, macro conditions remain cautious. Expectations of gradual global liquidity easing and a stabilising US rate outlook are encouraging rotation, not speculation. For XRP, that environment supports consolidation and positioning rather than explosive upside. XRP Technical Structure Near a Decision From a technical perspective, XRP price prediction remains bearish as XRP is trading within a descending channel on the 4-hour chart, capped by a falling trendline of resistance. Price is currently testing the $1.93–$1.98 zone, where the 50-EMA and 100-EMA converge. This area has repeatedly stalled rebounds, making it a key pivot for near-term direction. XRP Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum indicators show early improvement. The RSI has climbed toward the mid-50s, forming a higher low compared with the last price trough, suggesting downside pressure is easing. A rejection near resistance would expose $1.85, with deeper support at $1.77. A clean breakout above $2.00 would shift bias higher. XRP Price Prediction Outlook If XRP secures acceptance above $2.00, the structure opens a recovery path toward $2.11–$2.17, aligning with prior resistance. Failure to reclaim that level keeps the broader corrective trend intact. As volatility compresses, XRP appears closer to resolution than exhaustion, setting up a decisive move as market confidence rebuilds.

Most larger-cap altcoins are quite sluggish on a daily scale, which is to be expected on a Sunday. UNI, CC, NIGHT, and ICP have emerged as the biggest gainers today. BTC Tapped $89K The past week was anticipated to be a volatile one, and it was. It all began on Monday afternoon when BTC plunged from $90,000 to under $86,000 within just a few hours. After a minor rebound to $88,000, the asset went on the offensive on Wednesday and shot up to $90,400. However, that was another fake-out as the bears immediately regained control and pushed it south to under $85,500. Then came Thursday, and the release of the US CPI data for November was much better than expected . BTC surged to $89,500, but the rejection scenario repeated. This time, the subsequent retracement drove the cryptocurrency to a multi-month low of $84,500. Nevertheless, another relief rally followed, and BTC spiked to $89,500 on Friday. Even though it was stopped there, it has remained mostly above $88,000 and briefly tapped $89,000 earlier today. Its market cap has neared $1.770 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is well above 57%. BTCUSD Dec 21. Source: TradingView UNI on the Run As mentioned above, most larger-cap alts have been quite calm over the past day. ETH has neared $3,000, BNB is close to $860, while XRP remains above $1.90. SOL, ADA, BCH, LINK, ZEC, and DOGE are slightly in the red, while XMR and TRX are up by 2-3%. NIGHT has jumped the most from the top 100 altcoins, surging by over 30% to $0.09. UNI follows suit, with a 10% pump that has pushed it to $6.30. CC, QNT, and ICP have marked impressive gains as well. The total crypto market cap has added another $20 billion overnight and is close to $3.1 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview Daily Dec 21.

According to the new report from crypto platform Mercado Bitcoin, the average investment per user crossed into the $1,000 mark this year. The report, titled “Raio-X do Investidor em Ativos Digitais 2025,” mentioned that the crypto market in Brazil is no longer driven purely by speculation anymore but has been increasingly shaped by structured investing and portfolio planning. The data was based on activity across Mercado Bitcoin’s platform, the largest crypto exchange across Latin America. The report claimed that the average amount invested in crypto per person was about 5,700 Brazilian reais, which is equivalent to more than $1,000. Brazil registers a rise in crypto trading activities According to the report , 18% of investors allocated funds across more than one type of digital asset, indicating that users in the country now prefer to diversify their holdings rather than bet on a single digital asset. Bitcoin remained the most traded digital asset, followed by United States dollar-pegged stablecoin USDT. Ethereum and Solana also saw considerable usage across the year, the report mentioned. Stablecoins also stood out as a key on-ramp for new and existing investors. The report mentioned that the fiat-backed assets accounted for more than three times their transactions in the past year. The development was a result of users seeking lower volatility amid uncertain micro conditions. According to the report, lower-risk crypto products also gained momentum in 2025. Digital fixed income offerings, known locally as Renda Fixa Digital (RFD), saw a massive 108% rise in investment volume, with Mercado Bitcoin distributing about $325 million to investors since the beginning of the year. Crypto usage in terms of age also shifted as investors aged 24 and under posted a 56% increase year over year. However, Mercado Bitcoin noted that demand increased across all age groups on the platform, which included high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors. In terms of transactions by region, Brazil’s Southeast and South remained dominant in volumes, led by São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. States in the Central-West and Northeast also gained enough visibility as crypto adoption spread this year. B3 plans to debut crypto offerings in 2026 The rise in crypto activity in Brazil is also evidenced by the decision of Brazilian stock exchange B3 to deepen its ties to digital assets by launching a tokenization platform and stablecoin for settlement. The development is expected to go live in 2026. “The great value of having this tokenization platform connected to the traditional ecosystem is that assets are fungible,” a representative of B3 said. “The token buyer won’t know they’re buying from a traditional stock seller. This allows for a smooth transition, with both benefiting from the same liquidity.” In addition, B3 is expected to launch weekly options for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, as well as contracts like those offered on prediction platforms. The announcement came about a month after the central bank said it would classify stablecoin transactions as foreign exchange operations for crypto firms. However, it remains unclear how the policy change, which would take effect in February, will apply to stock exchanges like B3. Meanwhile, Itaú Asset Management has advised investors to allocate between 1% and 3% of their portfolios to Bitcoin. The asset management firm cited issues related to geopolitical risks, shifts in monetary policy, and currency volatility. Analyst Renato Eid also described Bitcoin as a distinct asset that has its own return profile and a potential hedging role due to its global and decentralized nature, despite the sharp price swings that it has witnessed since the beginning of 2025.

Specifically, as of December 21, 2025, the total number of cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap stood at 28.62 million. At the beginning of the year, on January 1, 2025, the figure was approximately 5.83 million, indicating that about 22.74 million new tokens were added over the course of the year. This growth represents an almost 390% surge. Insights from CoinMarketCap’s issuance metrics show that the momentum remained strong throughout the year rather than being confined to a single period. In the final 24 hours leading up to December 20, around 44,885 new cryptocurrencies were created. Over the previous seven days, that number climbed to 251,570, while more than 1.21 million new tokens were added over the last 30 days alone. New cryptocurrencies created dashboard. Source: CoinMarketCap The data also showed sharp issuance spikes, with token creation peaking at a 2025 daily high of 1,305,553 new cryptocurrencies on July 8. Why new cryptocurrencies spiked Notably, the surge in new cryptocurrencies was driven by lower technical barriers from low-code tools and improved infrastructure, alongside the expansion of layer-1s, layer-2s, and application-specific chains. Speculation, led by meme coins and short-lived experiments fueled by social media, amplified issuance, while lighter and uneven global regulation made launching tokens far easier than issuing traditional financial assets. Despite rapid growth, most new tokens fail to achieve lasting liquidity, adoption, or major listings and often fade within months, leaving only a small fraction economically relevant. The expanding token universe has also raised concerns over capital dilution, as alternative assets compete for attention and speculative flows, potentially trimming Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) short-term inflows, though analysts stress that Bitcoin’s fixed supply, security, and institutional standing keep its role structurally distinct.

BarriC (@B_arri_C), a well-known crypto enthusiast, has thrown his hat in the race, with one of the most aggressive outlooks. He tied XRP’s future value directly to global financial adoption. His view does not center on short-term speculation. Instead, it focuses on how XRP might function if it were to become a core settlement asset for banks and financial institutions worldwide. If every bank and financial institution around the world adopts and utilises $XRP #XRP will have to be extremely expensive, so it can fractionalized and allocated to every bank and financial institution globally That’s why a – $1,000 $XRP $10,000 $XRP $50,000 $XRP Is… — BarriC (@B_arri_C) December 19, 2025 A Bold XRP Price Prediction BarriC argues that XRP’s price must rise dramatically if it becomes a global liquidity tool. He stated that if every bank and financial institution adopts XRP, its price will become expensive. That way, it can be fractionalized and distributed to all financial institutions that will use it. Ripple CTO David Schwartz has also previously suggested that XRP cannot remain cheap . Higher prices are required to handle the scale of the cross-border payment market. From that assumption, BarriC concluded that XRP can reach $1,000, $10,000, or even $50,000. BarriC links value to utility. He treats XRP less like a speculative token and more like infrastructure. In his view, a low unit price would not support settlement at scale across thousands of institutions. High value enables efficiency. Fractionalization allows distribution without requiring excessive token supply movement. Market Cap Criticism and Structural Pushback Many analysts reject this outlook. They point to market cap constraints as a hard limit. At $10,000 per XRP, total valuation would reach levels that dwarf today’s global financial markets. Critics argue that such numbers break conventional valuation models. They also note that adoption does not automatically require extreme prices. Liquidity can increase through velocity rather than valuation. Pundits like Jake Claver have been criticized for predicting that XRP can hit $10,000 . BarriC suggests that the digital asset could go even higher. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Long-Term Utility Counterargument Supporters of BarriC’s view challenge those assumptions. They argue that market cap comparisons rely on equity logic, not liquidity mechanics. In XRP’s case, they believe that traditional valuation limits do not apply . They also emphasize that global settlement involves trillions in daily transactions. If XRP absorbs even a fraction of that volume, price appreciation becomes a functional requirement, not a speculative outcome. Higher prices reduce the number of tokens needed per transaction. That improves efficiency and stability. This vision assumes near-universal institutional trust and integration. It does not describe today’s market. It represents a radically different financial system. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to an investigation by W5, Canadians are being heavily targeted by cryptocurrency scams that rely on artificial intelligence. Many victims realize it is a scam only after their life savings are gone. Crypto scammers target Canadians with deepfake videos A 51 year old woman from Markham, Ontario, lost $1.7 million, and a man from Prince Edward Island lost $600,000. Both believed they were investing through legitimate crypto platforms. The Ontario woman said she first saw a video on Facebook that appeared to show Elon Musk speaking about a crypto investment. The video promised fast profits from a small initial deposit. But the clip wasn’t real and Musk’s image and voice had been digitally altered. The victim sent $250 and, after two days, earned a profit of $30. That return convinced her that the platform was real. She was encouraged to invest more and was shown documents that appeared to confirm her money was growing. “I applied for almost a million dollars on the equity of my home. I took it out and I started sending it to them. Right? Like $350,000 and then $350,000,” said the victim. After sending the amount, the scammers told the victim her account was worth $3 million. But to withdraw any funds, she had to pay taxes and fees. To cover those costs, she borrowed $500,000 from family and friends and maxed out her credit cards. She lost a total of $1.7 million. The man from Prince Edward Island followed a similar path. He saw an online video that appeared to promote a crypto investment linked to the TV show Dragon’s Den. The video claimed people could start investing with $250. He sent small amounts and slowly increased his investments. At one point, he was sending $10,000 daily. His total losses reached $600,000. Like the Ontario woman, he was shown fake balances suggesting his investment had grown to more than $1 million. When he tried to withdraw the funds, he was blocked. Together, the two Canadians lost $2.3 million. Canadians have lost $1.2 billion to investment scams in three years, but the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC) believes actual losses are higher. Crypto scams run like a global industry Former U.S. prosecutor Erin West says the fraud is run like an industry. She now investigates cryptocurrency scams full time. West says many people making the scam calls are victims themselves. They are trafficked to scam compounds in Southeast Asia and forced to work long hours. Those who refuse or try to escape are beaten or tortured. West visited cyber fraud compounds in the Philippines and described their scale as shocking. Some sites contain dozens of buildings designed only for scamming. Inside, workers spend long hours contacting victims and building trust. The goal is to keep victims investing by selling them the idea of a better future. Over 50 scam compounds were located in Cambodia after an investigation by Amnesty International. Survivors reported being beaten if they failed to comply. West said fear and violence are what keep the system running. The money taken from victims flows to organized crime groups. She also criticized social media platforms for failing to stop AI-generated scam ads. She said these platforms allow criminals to reach ordinary people at scale. Meta said scam ads violate its policies and that it removes deceptive content when detected. The company said it is investing in detection systems and review teams. West said the situation is getting worse. Crackdowns in Southeast Asia are pushing organized crime groups to move operations to Latin America and Africa. She said stopping the scams requires cutting off access to victims before they are drawn in. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The city moves fast, yet the people building its culture gravitate toward practices that slow the rhythm. They choose formats that give space to reset the mind, support the body, and reconnect with others. New social habits shaped by wellness A steady shift away from classic nightlife pushes many toward calmer settings. Cafes hold daytime events with music, movement, and light community rituals. Interest also grows around cannabis for sale , discussed in wellness circles as part of a wider search for stress relief. Londoners in their twenties talk more often about balance, recovery, and emotional clarity. Communal spaces now influence how people choose to unwind. They attend sessions built on sensory comfort or physical release. These formats give a stable alternative to bars and late parties, especially for those who want softer transitions after work. Communal sauna culture One of the most noticeable developments comes from public sauna projects. Places such as Community Sauna Baths or Peckham Sauna Social attract crowds who want warmth and shared silence. Attendance keeps rising thanks to varied formats. Some venues host themed evenings. Others add music or guided heat rituals based on the aufguss method. Many visitors mention that short heat cycles reduce tension after long commutes. Sessions often pair a sauna with a cold plunge. This combination helps people feel alert while still relaxed. The social element also matters. Participants meet new people through simple routines rather than loud events. A few practical reasons explain the appeal: • predictable schedule that fits after-work hours• affordable entry compared with spa complexes• mix of public and semi-private zones for different comfort levels These projects show how traditional hydrotherapy adapts to city life. Alternatives to classic evenings out Young Londoners explore healthier ways to socialise. Some join running groups that start at small studios and move through local streets. Others attend morning music events in coffee shops or sign up for cycling classes with live DJs. Attendance grows because these formats lift the mood without leaving people tired. The broader trend toward reduced alcohol use supports this shift. Recent surveys in the UK show that younger adults drink less often than previous generations. Wellness values influence their choices more clearly. They pick surroundings that help them recover rather than overwhelm them. To understand how these events gain popularity, it helps to look at the mix of benefits: 1. short sessions that fit into busy schedules2. teamwork and shared goals that ease social pressure3. physical movement that improves focus during the day This blend turns everyday fitness into a gentle social anchor. Emotional release as a community practice Another pattern emerging across London involves group activities aimed at emotional release. One widely discussed example is the Scream Club. People gather in parks and let out built-up stress through brief vocal exercises. These sessions gained traction online because they look simple and open to anyone. Participants describe the experience as both humorous and surprisingly grounding. The activity offers a controlled outlet for anxiety. Many join after learning about growing rates of urban stress. London’s pace leaves little room for venting, so structured release appeals to those who feel constantly switched on. Several elements help these gatherings work: • clear rules that make the environment feel safe• short duration so it does not feel intense• shared purpose that reduces awkwardness This type of group practice strengthens connections between strangers through a natural human response. A wider focus on personal wellbeing Surveys show that young people in London prioritise wellbeing more than other age groups in the UK. They choose activities that sharpen awareness and reduce strain. Interest in meditation, breathwork, and guided reflection continues to expand. Some join short workshops inside co-working spaces. Others visit small studios that offer beginner-friendly sessions. Many also look for ways to improve sleep and restore energy. These needs push them toward calmer routines. They follow simple tools such as controlled breathing or sensory grounding. Public retreats remain expensive, but their methods gradually enter mainstream studios. Experiences with the strongest response include: • guided breath cycles that lower heart rate• slow movement classes that support posture• compact reflection sessions designed for city stress Such practices keep gaining relevance because they bring measurable comfort. How Londoners shape their everyday balance The rise of communal activities shows a change in values. People want spaces where they feel safe, restored, and socially supported. They seek practical relief rather than extravagant experiences. Sauna evenings, early music meetups, emotional release groups, and mindful routines all share one quality.

However, it appears that the new year 2026 might bring the relief majority of the market expects. According to a recent evaluation, the Bitcoin price structure suggests that a deeper correction looks to be on the horizon for the market leader. BTC Price To Revisit $73,000 In 2026 Q1? In a December 20 post on the X platform, quant trader CryptoOnchain shared fresh insights into the current layout of the Bitcoin price. According to the market analyst, the price outlook of BTC is tilting towards a bearish scenario, especially as selling pressure remains evident on the chart. Related Reading: Analysts Warn Strategy Could Be Dropped From Multiple Indexes, Potential $9 Billion Loss Predicted CryptoOnchain said that the price of Bitcoin is hovering around the key Point of Control (POC) level. For context, the point of control (POC) refers to the price level with the highest volume of trading activity within a given period, thereby serving as a significant support or resistance zone. According to the crypto pundit, the failure of the Bitcoin price to quickly recover its former highs suggests an increased likelihood of seeing it break below its POC and towards the $70,000 – $73,000 range. CryptoOnchain identified this region, which was the last cycle’s peak, as a critical “support flip,” where buyers might look to step in aggressively. Furthermore, CryptoOnchain noted that the divergent Relative Strength Index (RSI) adds credence to the Bitcoin price falling to the support cushion around $70,000 – $73,000. “Traders should watch for reversal triggers around the $72,000 level,” the analyst added. However, the market pundit warned that holding the $70,000 – $73,000 zone might be critical in preventing an even deeper correction and an extended bear market for the Bitcoin price. In essence, this “support flip” is crucial for BTC to resume its long-term bullish structure and preserve the macro trend. The price of BTC visited the sub-$75,000 region in the year’s first quarter as the global financial markets reeled from what was initially breaking out as a trade war. Hence, a return to this price level might be a tad familiar to investors, albeit it would also represent an almost 20% decline from the current price point. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at around $88,330, reflecting no significant price change in the past 24 hours.

Fundstrat Releases Contrasting 2026 Predictions",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-ethereum-62000-fundstrat-2026-predictions/,"Tom Lee, chairman of BitMine and managing partner at Fundstrat, has been a vocal optimist when it comes to the cryptocurrency market, especially for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Most recently, Fundstrat’s managing partner revived his $62,000 target call for the Ethereum price in 2026. However, it appears that Lee and his investment firm do not align in terms of their market expectations for the coming year. Fundstrat seems to be looking at a more bearish setup for most of the large-cap digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, in 2026. $60,000 Is The Target, But Not For Ethereum According to screenshots posted on social media platform X, Fundstrat released a 2026 crypto strategy report, warning internal clients of potential market headwinds in early 2026. The report’s title, however, also suggested that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana could enjoy significant growth in the second half of next year. Sean Farrell, Fundstrat’s head of digital asset strategy, projected significant drawdowns for the crypto market in the first half of 2026. The research set the target for the Bitcoin price between $60,000 to $65,000, the Ethereum price within $1,800 – $2,000, and the Solana price around $50 – $75. Farrell wrote in the report: These levels would present attractive opportunities into year-end. If this view proves incorrect, I still prefer to play defense and wait for confirmation of strength. This circulating report stands in contrast to the predictions of Tom Lee, who is the chief investment officer (CIO) at Fundstrat. Speaking to attendees at the Binance Blockchain Week earlier this month, Lee stated that the price could run up to as much as $62,000 as Ethereum becomes the core infrastructure for tokenized finance. In September, at the Korea Blockchain Week, Lee said that the price of Bitcoin could reach as high as $250,000 by year-end, while Ethereum’s value could climb toward $12,000. The rationale for this projection revolved around macro tailwinds and growing institutional interest in crypto assets. Now, while the Fundstrat internal document has yet to be authenticated by Bitcoinist as of press time, Colin Wu-led outlet Wu Blockchain verified that this document was indeed distributed to internal clients. Bitcoin And Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is valued at around $88,180, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the price of ETH stands at around $2,980.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Ethereum|Fundstrat|Fundstrat Capital|solana|Tom Lee,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-21 13:00:38

The combined value was approximately $375 million at the time of transfer. Both transactions showed funds moving from an unknown wallet to another. That lack of clarity invited speculation fast, especially with XRP trading below $2. Big players rarely move that much capital without a reason . Markets tend to notice when they do, and XRP Update sees it as a notable signal. TWO MASSIVE $XRP WHALE MOVES BACK TO BACK 200,000,000 $XRP moved in minutes. Unknown wallet → Unknown wallet When whales move fast, something is coming pic.twitter.com/pVyweLQdNk — XRP Update (@XrpUdate) December 19, 2025 What Could the Whale Transaction Signal? The most common explanation centered on accumulation. XRP remains under $2 despite renewed optimism across the market. Large holders often position early. They buy during calm periods. They move funds quietly, and these two large transfers back-to-back fit that playbook. XRP Update viewed the moves as preparation. He said whales could be consolidating supply ahead of a price move. It could also be a relocation to cold storage for long-term holding. That move usually signals confidence rather than intent to sell. The timing is also crucial, as XRP recently defended key support levels. The asset has remained resilient despite bearish pressure from the broader market. Large holders often act before momentum shifts. From that angle, the transfers looked like positioning for something bigger. Accumulation was not the only option. Internal reshuffling often triggers Whale Alert notifications. Custodians move funds between wallets for security. Institutions rotate keys, and large entities also rebalance operational reserves . XRP supports on-demand liquidity corridors that require large pools. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What the On-Chain Data Shows While Whale Alert listed both transactions as unknown, a closer look at the on-chain data is a clear link. The funds moved from wallets activated by Ripple. Specifically, Ripple (47) and Ripple (49) sent the XRP to Ripple (50). This points to internal fund movement. These wallets have historical ties to Ripple operations, with Ripple (50) playing a major role during a large sell-off in late 2024 . The pattern matched previous internal transfers rather than market positioning. The transfers still matter. They show Ripple managing significant reserves. They show activity on the ledger. They do not confirm accumulation or distribution. For now, they reflect internal restructuring rather than a market signal.

RJ Scaringe made that point while showing off Rivian’s Autonomy and AI program on Dec. 11, where the company laid out its full tech stack and doubled down on its plan to build every core system in-house. RJ founded Rivian in 2011, took it public in 2021, watched the stock jump to $120 a share, then saw it fall to $18 as of press time. Rivian has seen gross profit in recent quarters, but net profit continues to slip away , and the company recently pulled in nearly $6 billion from a joint venture with Volkswagen. Rivian builds the next autonomy systems using its own hardware and software RJ said the autonomy effort started right after Rivian launched its first generation of vehicles in late 2021. In early 2022, the team realized they needed a full reset. “We wanted to do a clean-sheet approach,” he said. So the company rebuilt the camera system, redesigned the compute hardware, and shaped the entire stack around an AI-first design. Those choices powered Rivian’s Gen 2 vehicles, which rolled out in mid-2024 with nearly 10 times more compute than the first generation, 55 megapixels of cameras and multiple radars, creating a massive data stream that trains Rivian’s model. The Gen 3 platform uses an in-house chip that processes 5 billion pixels per second, about five times faster than the best chips on the market today.“This lets us build the model more efficiently and more quickly,” RJ said. Rivian already offers Universal Hands-Free driving, similar to GM’s Supercruise, and plans to expand it across more roads. In 2026, Rivian will add a “point-to-point” mode for full supervised trips. After that comes “eyes-off,” where the driver becomes a passenger. The final step is personal Level 4, which lets the vehicle run entirely on its own, even with no one inside. RJ said the goal is to cover things like school pick-ups, airport drop-offs, and grocery runs. He also explained why Rivian builds its own silicon instead of using chips from Nvidia. “We made the decision years and years ago to build our entire vertical software platform in-house,” he said. The company invested hundreds of millions and hired thousands of people to build its internal systems. Rivian partnered with TSMC to manufacture the chips. RJ said the setup gives Rivian better performance for vision-based robotics and supports a training loop that needs huge GPU power. Rivian sets its own path while comparing its approach to Tesla Yahoo Finance asked whether Rivian could catch Tesla’s FSD program.RJ said the goal is to be world-class and agreed that Tesla’s approach uses the right tools. He said both companies use neural networks, end-to-end training, live reinforcement learning, and huge data streams from customer vehicles.Rivian still believes in a mix of sensors instead of only cameras. “By including radar and lidar, it lets us turn the entire fleet into a ground-truth fleet,” he said. Every Rivian on the road sends data to help train the system. On the industry, RJ said the loss of the EV tax credit in Q4 made things tougher. Many automakers are pulling back, which he said reduces customer choice and hurts the market. That drop in competition lets Tesla hold around 50% of the US EV segment for vehicles under $50,000. “That’s not a reflection of a healthy industry,” he said. RJ argued that the US can’t move from 8% EV adoption to 25%, 30%, or even 100% without more than one strong option. He said Rivian’s R2 will be one of those options, but he hopes other companies step in too. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

According to real-time data from Binance’s USDT trading pair, BTC is currently trading around $87,948. This move represents a significant pullback from recent highs and prompts urgent questions about market direction. What’s driving this decline, and should investors be concerned? Let’s break down the situation. What Caused the Sudden Bitcoin Price Drop? The cryptocurrency market is no stranger to volatility, and the recent Bitcoin price action is a prime example. Several interconnected factors often contribute to such movements. First, broader market sentiment can shift rapidly based on macroeconomic news, such as interest rate decisions or inflation reports. Second, profit-taking by large investors, often called ‘whales,’ after a sustained rally can create selling pressure. Finally, technical trading levels play a role; the $88,000 level may have acted as a key support, and breaking below it can trigger automated sell orders. Understanding these dynamics is crucial. A single headline or a large sell order can initiate a wave of reactions across global exchanges. Therefore, while the current Bitcoin price of $87,948 is a snapshot, the context behind the number tells the real story. How Does This BTC Move Compare to Historical Patterns? Bitcoin’s history is filled with sharp corrections during major bull markets. These pullbacks, often between 20-30%, are typically followed by periods of consolidation before the next leg up. Analyzing the current Bitcoin price drop through this lens can provide perspective. Is this a healthy correction that shakes out weak hands, or the start of a deeper trend reversal? Key indicators to watch now include: Trading Volume: Is the sell-off accompanied by high volume, indicating strong conviction? Support Levels: Where is the next major support zone? Analysts often look at levels like $85,000 or $82,000. Market Dominance: Is Bitcoin losing value relative to other cryptocurrencies (altcoins), or is the entire market dipping? What Should Investors Do When the Bitcoin Price Falls? For long-term holders, short-term volatility is part of the journey. However, for active traders, a dropping Bitcoin price requires a clear strategy. The first rule is to avoid panic selling. Emotional decisions often lead to buying high and selling low. Instead, consider these actionable steps: Review Your Portfolio: Ensure your allocation to Bitcoin and other assets still matches your risk tolerance. Dollar-Cost Average (DCA): For those looking to accumulate, a lower price can be an opportunity to buy in smaller, regular increments. Set Clear Limits: Decide in advance at what price you would consider buying more or cutting losses. Stick to your plan. Remember, market corrections can create the most significant opportunities. The key is to have a plan that you can execute calmly, regardless of whether the Bitcoin price is soaring or correcting. The Road Ahead for Bitcoin’s Valuation While the immediate focus is on the Bitcoin price dipping below $88,000, the long-term narrative remains driven by adoption, institutional interest, and its role as a digital store of value. Network fundamentals like hash rate and active addresses often remain strong during price dips. Therefore, separating short-term noise from long-term signal is the ultimate challenge for every market participant. In conclusion, the drop to $87,948 is a reminder of the market’s inherent volatility. It underscores the importance of doing your own research, managing risk, and maintaining a perspective that looks beyond daily price charts. Market cycles have phases, and navigating them successfully requires both information and emotional discipline. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why did Bitcoin’s price fall below $88,000? A: The drop is likely due to a combination of profit-taking after a rally, reactions to broader economic news, and the breaking of a key technical support level, which triggered further selling. Q2: Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? A: It depends on your investment strategy. Some see dips as buying opportunities, but it’s essential to assess your financial goals and risk tolerance first. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Q3: How low could the Bitcoin price go? A> Predicting exact lows is impossible. Traders watch other support levels, like $85,000, but the market is influenced by unpredictable global events and sentiment. Q4: Should I sell my Bitcoin now? A> Panic selling during a dip is rarely advisable for long-term investors. If you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, volatility is expected. Review your original investment thesis before making a decision. Q5: Does this drop affect other cryptocurrencies? A> Yes, typically. Bitcoin often leads the market. When its price falls significantly, most other cryptocurrencies (altcoins) tend to follow, often with even greater volatility. Q6: Where can I reliably track the Bitcoin price? A> Major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken provide real-time prices. Aggregator sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko offer a consolidated view across multiple platforms.

His analysis centers on the 3-day RSI, historical wave behavior, and key Fibonacci projections. Together, the chart suggests the recent dip may have already completed its corrective role, setting the stage for consolidation before a renewed advance. The setup does not point to immediate vertical expansion. Instead, it highlights a pause that serves a structural purpose. According to Dark Defender, short-term sideways action remains possible, but the underlying indicators favor bullish continuation rather than breakdown. The analyst stated that the “surge is inevitable.” The RSI on the 3-Day time frame tells us the dip is in, a sideways period can last a couple of days, but the Surge is inevitable. #XRP is unstoppable with the upcoming scarcity. Christmas & the New Year will Shine. Road to DD. pic.twitter.com/PEa0jGBiXh — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) December 19, 2025 RSI Signals a Completed Dip Dark Defender’s focus is on the 3-day RSI. The indicator has fallen into a historically reactive zone that previously marked durable lows for XRP. On the chart, multiple green circles emphasize prior moments when RSI compression preceded strong upside moves. Each instance followed a similar pattern with little momentum and a stable price before a massive rally. Dark Defender stated that “the dip is in” and added that sideways movement could persist for a couple of days. The RSI sits near the low 30s, putting it in the oversold range . This region has repeatedly aligned with trend reversals rather than trend failures. Structure Holds Above Key Support The price structure on the 3-day chart shows XRP respecting a long-standing support zone that aligns with the Ichimoku cloud . The asset’s price has dipped into this area but has not lost it decisively. Previous corrections that behaved this way resolved higher after a brief period of consolidation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The chart also outlines a completed corrective sequence labeled with Elliott Wave counts . Waves 1 through 5 appear to have played out on the downside. The chart also shows XRP about to begin Wave 5 on a much larger trend, hinting at an imminent bull run. The asset’s ability to maintain the support level also keeps the bullish sentiment intact. XRP’s Fibonacci Targets Dark Defender’s projection extends well beyond the near term. The chart plots a 161.8% Fibonacci extension near $1.88 as an interim technical reference, already close to current trading levels. Above that, the longer-term projection reaches toward the 261.8% extension near $5.85. Dark Defender also links XRP’s long-term outlook to the asset’s tightening supply . He suggests reduced availability will amplify future demand, reinforcing the bullish structure. Based on the analysis, XRP may remain range-bound while momentum resets. That phase acts as preparation for the next big move. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Beth explained that she is more focused on inflation staying high than on signs that the labor market could soften. She did not vote on policy this year, but she joins the voting group next year, which means what she says now matters a lot. Beth pointed to the November inflation report that looked better on paper but came with issues. She said the government shutdown in October and the first half of November distorted how prices were measured, which means the 2.7% yearly consumer-price index might actually be closer to 2.9% or 3.0%, the number many forecasters expected. Beth said she still welcomes the return of official Bureau of Labor Statistics data but is treating it carefully. Fed holds steady while inflation and tariffs move through the system Beth said one big reason she does not think rate cuts make sense now is her view of the neutral rate. That is the level that neither speeds nor slows the economy. She said the neutral rate seems higher than most people assume and that the economy looks strong heading into next year. According to Beth, the Fed might even be sitting a little below that neutral point, which means policy could still be giving the economy a boost. She also said the benchmark rate, currently set between 3.5% and 3.75%, does not need to change until at least spring. By then, the Fed should know whether the slowdown in goods-price inflation is real, especially as tariffs work their way through supply chains. She added that business leaders are telling her they expect higher costs in the first quarter. She said they blame tariffs and other input pressures, and that many are planning larger price increases. Beth said that is a concern with inflation near 3% for roughly 18 months, and that hearing this kind of pricing talk makes her even less eager to consider rate cuts. This comes amid talks of National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and former Fed governor Kevin Warsh possibly becoming the next Fed chair in May 2026. Investors worry that they each support aggressive rate cuts, which would push inflation back up along with long-dated Treasury yields, especially if markets think rate cuts are happening for the wrong reasons. Wall Street is already having a rough December, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite down for the month, a rare pattern for a month that usually posts gains of more than 1% on average. The drop also threatens to break the S&P 500’s seven-month winning streak. The index is fighting to stay above its 50-day moving average, a point BTIG’s Jonathan Krinsky flagged as a weak sign for risk appetite. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

However, the incoming red season may not be as severe as previous ones, according to an analysis by CryptoQuant. The latest weekly report from the market research firm revealed that BTC may record a 55% drawdown from its all-time high during the bear season. Such a move could place the asset’s bottom around $56,000, marking the smallest drawdown on record. BTC Could Bottom at $56K Historically, bitcoin bear market bottoms have aligned with the realized price metric. The realized price is currently near $56,000 and is slightly increasing. This has led market experts to believe the incoming bear cycle could be shallow. Notably, analysts expect BTC to find intermediate support around $70,000. These predictions come as the bitcoin bull cycle turns bearish amid negative market conditions. Demand growth has slowed, and derivatives markets are experiencing a weakening risk appetite. With demand waves driving Bitcoin’s four-year cycles, the current drawdown reinforces the belief that Bitcoin’s behaviour is governed by expansions and contractions in demand growth. The market has seen three major demand waves since 2023, driven by the launch of the United States spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) market, the U.S. presidential election outcome, and the rise of Bitcoin Treasury companies. However, the demand trend has reversed since early October 2025, suggesting that this cycle has realized the bulk of its incremental demand wave. Unfortunately, bear seasons tend to begin when demand growth peaks and rolls over, regardless of supply side dynamics. The Onset of the Bear Market Furthermore, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have become net sellers in Q4 2025, maintaining a trend that sharply contrasts the strong accumulation seen in Q4 2024. By this time last year, ETF holdings had risen from 293,000 BTC to 496,000 BTC; however, they have declined by 24,000 BTC this year. Addresses holding 100 to 1,000 BTC are now echoing the reduced demand recorded at the end of 2021, just before the 2022 bear market. On the derivatives front, the 365-day moving average of perpetual futures funding rates has fallen to its lowest level in two years. This means that investors are less willing to maintain long exposure – this pattern is often observed during bear phases.

The core goal of this bill is singular: to make cryptocurrency regulations clear, transparent, and predictable. For a long time, regulatory ambiguity has been a major obstacle to the crypto market. Funds hesitated, institutions remained on the sidelines, and users worried about policy risks. The progress of the Clarity Act means this situation may be changing. For the market, this is not just ordinary news, but a potential turning point. Why does clearer regulation benefit a bull market? Many people believe that “regulation = bad news,” but the opposite is often true. When the rules are clear: Institutional funds are more willing to enter Long-term capital begins to position itself Market confidence significantly improves Crypto assets are more likely to become mainstream Historically, many crypto bull markets have occurred after regulatory clarity gradually emerged. Therefore, many market participants see the Clarity Act as a crucial prelude to the next round of market activity. However, a real problem faces investors: even with rising bull market expectations, prices will still fluctuate, and risks won’t disappear. The market is rising, and smart money is already “changing its strategies.” Now, more and more investors are realizing one thing: instead of betting on a single market move, it’s better to let assets generate continuous returns. Especially in a phase of stricter regulation and a maturing market, simply chasing highs and lows carries higher risks. Therefore, people are starting to pay attention to platforms that are easy to use, have clear return structures, are not dependent on short-term fluctuations, and are more suitable for long-term participation. Against this backdrop, XRPstaking platforms are gradually coming into the view of more investors. XRPstaking: Locking in stable returns in anticipation of a bull market. XRPstaking is not a platform for “betting on market trends,” but rather a tool that helps users continuously unlock the value of their assets in different market environments. By staking mainstream digital assets such as XRP, users can obtain relatively stable and predictable returns without frequent trading or constant monitoring. XRPstaking offers a practical alternative: simple, automated, and with daily returns. As market sentiment improves, XRPstaking is more of a proactive, gradual accumulation strategy than rushing in after a market surge. XRPstaking Participation Guide: Register an Account: Visit the official XRPstaking platform. (New users receive a $15 trial reward upon successful registration.) Choose a Staking Plan: Select a suitable staking plan and period based on your capital and return requirements. Complete Staking and Start Earning Returns: Daily returns will be automatically credited to your account after your purchased contracts become active. Conclusion Real opportunities belong to those who are prepared. The advancement of the Clarity Act may only be the beginning. If the regulatory environment continues to improve, the crypto market may usher in a healthier and more sustainable new phase. However, what truly differentiates us is often not whether a bull market has arrived, but whether we have established a stable and sustainable participation strategy. In the volatile yet opportunity-filled world of crypto, the XRPstaking platform offers a more balanced and rational investment path.A bull market may be on its way, and savvy investors are already preparing for it. About XRPstaking platform The XRPstaking platform is a future-oriented cryptocurrency yield platform designed for global users. We believe that digital assets should not merely be “stored,” but should achieve intelligent value appreciation on a secure and transparent foundation. Therefore, the XRPstaking platform integrates cross-chain secure custody, AI-driven intelligent yield management, and a behavioral finance incentive model, aiming to provide users with a simpler, more reliable, and more sustainable asset appreciation experience.

The system is a programmed supply mechanism designed to balance liquidity, ecosystem needs, and price stability as new tokens enter the market. Notably, XRP has a fixed supply of 100 billion tokens, all pre-mined at launch. To manage circulation, Ripple placed about 55 billion XRP in time-locked escrow, unlocking one billion tokens per month in batches. Most of each release is relocked, with only 20% to 40% used for operations, partnerships, institutional demand, or broader ecosystem needs. Escrow data from 2025 shows that roughly 12 billion XRP was unlocked over the year, averaging one billion per month . Most of this was relocked, typically around 700 million XRP monthly, leaving about 300 million XRP per month outside escrow. Value of XRP dumped in market In total, this added roughly 3.6 billion XRP to the market. At a current XRP price of $1.90, that supply equates to approximately $6.8 billion in value. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold At the same time, claims that Ripple is aggressively dumping XRP assume that all unlocked tokens are immediately sold on exchanges, an interpretation not supported by the data. Most tokens are either relocked or directed toward operational uses such as On-Demand Liquidity or institutional partnerships. Market reactions to the monthly unlocks in 2025 have generally been modest and short-lived, with minimal impact on XRP price. Analysts note that the predictability of the escrow schedule limits surprise selling pressure as the asset has been mainly traded in tandem with the broader market sentiment.

Owing to a transition away from overvalued large cap coins, SHIB traders are now focusing on the potential for presale projects. There are new projects, including Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is a cryptocurrency under the decentralized finance space, selling during Presale Phase 6 at $0.035. The presale phase is already at over 99% capacity, with a total of $19,500,000 raised since the presale kicked off. The total Mutuum Finance (MUTM) holders since presale commencement are at 18,550. Mutuum Finance is set to be the answer to the crypto to buy question in 2026. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Momentum Signals A Narrow Entry Window As of the time of this publication, Mutuum Finance is at Presale Phase 6, with demand going through the roof owing to the aggressive burning of allocations. At the current presale in phase 6, the price per token is at $0.035, which translates to an increase of 250% against the phase 1 price of $0.01. However, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) phase 6 will soon be over, meaning phase 7 kicks in, implying a rise in price of almost 20% against the current value of $0.04. The presale will end soon, and phase 7 will start, with a price of MUTM would be $0.06, implying a potential increase of almost 430%. Dual Lending Architecture Focuses On Sustainable Demand Apart from the cost, the major advantage of Mutuum Finance is in its lending system that caters not only to variable interest rates but also fixed rates. This way, the providers of liquidity get an opportunity to earn rewards, and at the same time, the borrowers get an opportunity to obtain funds at clear terms, overcoming the shortcomings that existed in the past. SHIB veterans say Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is different because it’s usage-driven. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Security And Transparency As Institutional Signals Security has emerged as a major defining criterion, as capital has been increasingly selective. Security is a major criterion, with Mutuum Finance auditing the final lending and borrowing smart contract. It is a major move towards following institutional standards, even at this stage. The group has also initiated a leaderboard with the top 50 holders. The 24-Hour Leaderboard provides incentives in terms of engagement on a daily basis, where the first rank holder gains a $500 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) reward after completing an initial transaction within the given time frame of 24 hours. This leaderboard resets at 00:00 UTC. MUTM’s trend of stablecoin-funded loans helps to reduce the problem of volatility, which is one of the factors that can act as a hindrance to the adoption of defi cryptos. This makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) potential to be the best crypto to buy now more favorable for investors. As Phase 6 is all but sold out, purchasing at $0.035 is running out quickly. As discussion continues to revolve around best crypto to buy now leading up to 2026, Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming a top choice for those looking to get in before widespread awareness.

The message demanded 13 Bitcoin — roughly $1.1 million — and set a deadline of 11:30 AM, prompting an immediate safety response across multiple company sites on December 20, 2025. Threat Sent To Seoul Offices According to police and news outlets, the email named two locations: the Hyundai Group building in Yeonji-dong, Jongno-gu, and the Hyundai Motor Group tower in Yangjae-dong, Seocho-gu. Staff left work and buildings were cleared while local law enforcement mobilized special units. Reports have disclosed that Hyundai moved operations to remote work as officials searched the premises. Police Clear Buildings After Sweeps Bomb squads and officers combed rooms and public areas at both sites. Equipment was used and rooms were checked methodically. No explosives or suspicious devices were found, officials reported. During the hours of searching, streets near the buildings were closed and entry was tightly controlled. No transfer of the demanded 13 BTC has been traced, and Hyundai did not pay the ransom, according to sources close to the company and law enforcement briefings. Officers said the threat appeared aimed at causing alarm rather than reporting a verifiable plan. Investigators have been collecting digital evidence from the threatening email and are working with cyber units to trace its origin. Searches of nearby surveillance footage and building logs were carried out as part of standard procedure. Several witnesses described the scene as tense, with employees escorted out calmly and officers coordinating safe movement. Part Of A Wider Pattern Of Extortion Based on reports from multiple outlets, this incident is not isolated. Similar threats have targeted major South Korean firms in recent days, with messages mentioning Samsung Electronics, KT, Kakao, and Naver. Authorities believe some of the messages may be copycat attempts or coordinated extortion that rely on fear rather than real bombs. Officials said they are treating each tip seriously while trying to separate credible leads from hoaxes. Financial and cybercrime units have noted an uptick in ransom demands tied to cryptocurrencies in the region over the past months. While attackers favor crypto for its cross-border reach, tracing transactions can sometimes reveal useful leads when firms and exchanges cooperate. Analysts who follow such cases say investigators now routinely combine physical security sweeps with blockchain analysis to follow any money trail. Hyundai released a brief statement confirming the evacuations and thanking emergency services for their fast response, but it declined to comment on investigative details.

In a new post on X, he stated that the digital asset will hit $100 by 2030. At the time, XRP traded near $1.91, locked in a tight range and far from its historical highs. Like many others, Rector is confident in XRP’s long-term potential. While he did not provide details on how it can reach this target, the current market situation shares some context. $100 XRP in 2030 — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) December 19, 2025 XRP’s Regulatory Clarity XRP gained regulatory clarity in the US in 2025. Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) resolved their long-standing legal battle , removing the biggest barrier for institutional participation. Asset managers can now create compliant products, and custodians can support exposure. The end of the legal battle also paved the way for the approval of spot XRP ETFs. This puts the digital asset in front of more investors. These moves make large-scale adoption possible over time. The Impact of Spot XRP ETFs Multiple spot XRP ETFs went live in the US during 2025. Canary Capital, Bitwise, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, and 21Shares launched products between November and December. These ETFs provide exposure without requiring direct custody. They integrate XRP into traditional financial channels. They have seen significant inflows, with over 30 days of net inflows . XRP ETFs have outperformed the competition, and growth in this sector of the market could contribute to XRP’s price growth in the coming years. Ripple’s Strategic Moves Ripple executed key acquisitions and partnerships in 2025. The company acquired Hidden Road, GTreasury, and Palisade to strengthen custody, liquidity, and institutional infrastructure. These moves positioned Ripple closer to traditional finance institutions. XRP functions as a bridge asset within the ecosystem. Increased adoption and transaction volume grow liquidity demand. XRP has also seen notable institutional adoption this year. Exposure through regulated vehicles has broadened access. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The 5-Year Path to $100 Reaching $100 requires scale and sustained adoption. It requires time for infrastructure, access, and capital to compound. A 5-year horizon provides that opportunity. Shorter periods may not capture the growth, but Rector’s prediction gives XRP enough time to embed itself into the global financial infrastructure. XRP remains volatile, with the potential for a decline . However, regulation, access, and institutional pathways make the setup different from previous cycles. Market developments now support a framework for long-term growth. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

In his latest outlook, Hougan argued that the long-followed four-year Bitcoin cycle, typically driven by the halving, interest rate shifts, and leverage-fueled booms and busts, is losing its influence, which makes room for a structurally stronger market. New ATH in 2026? Historically, Bitcoin has seen three strong years followed by a sharp correction, which would imply weakness in 2026, but Bitwise says the forces behind those cycles are now much weaker. The impact of each halving is diminishing over time, interest rates are expected to fall in 2026 rather than rise as they did during previous downturns, and the risk of major market blow-ups has declined following a reduction in leverage after record liquidations in late 2025, alongside clearer regulation. More importantly, Bitwise points to accelerating institutional adoption as a major driver of the next leg higher, while noting that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 opened the door to institutional capital, and major platforms such as Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and Merrill Lynch are expected to begin allocating in 2026. Meanwhile, Wall Street and fintech firms are increasingly embracing crypto following a pro-crypto regulatory shift after the 2024 US election. Beyond price gains, Hougan also predicted that Bitcoin would become less volatile and observed that in 2025, the crypto asset was already less volatile than Nvidia, one of the most widely held stocks in the market. He also explained that Bitcoin’s volatility has been steadily declining for a decade as its investor base broadens through ETFs and other traditional investment products. This trend reflects BTC’s gradual derisking as an asset and should continue into 2026. Decoupling From Wall Street The firm also expects Bitcoin’s correlation with stocks to fall, thus challenging the view that the crypto simply trades like a tech stock. According to Bitwise, data shows BTC’s correlation with the S&P 500 has usually remained below levels considered meaningfully high. The firm believes certain factors, such as regulatory progress and rising institutional inflows, could push Bitcoin higher even as equities face pressure from high valuations and slowing economic growth. Bitwise says these trends collectively could deliver strong returns, lower volatility, and reduced correlation with traditional markets. Such a setup could potentially draw tens of billions of dollars in new institutional capital in 2026.

The bot was created by a developer under the handle “Trust412,” and reportedly contains hidden malicious code across multiple commits and dependencies. Source: @hunterweb303 via X/Twitter SlowMist sounds Polymarket trading bot warning Earlier today, December 21, 23pds, SlowMist’s Chief Information Security Officer, retweeted a warning from a community user about a malicious code in a Polymarket copy-trading bot on GitHub, posing security risks. The incident has reminded many that the crypto bot market still has many vulnerabilities, which is why scrutinizing GitHub repositories for hidden threats is now non-negotiable. According to the post 23pds interacted with, this code was deliberately put there, but its malicious nature was disguised while the author revised it repeatedly to ensure that it evaded detection. This occurred across multiple submissions in the “polymarket-copy-trading-bot” repository, potentially exposing users to fund theft. The hidden code in the bot’s program made it scan and read configuration files automatically, extract private keys, and transfer them to a remote server controlled by the hackers. Users are urged to be cautious with any unaudited code repositories. In 23pds’s post, he alleged this is not the first time the method is being used to target GitHub and its users and that it will not be the last of such incidents. How to avoid the private key exploits The most crucial thing about this form of exploit is that it depends on the individual to kick-start the process, which means extra caution would do a lot to prevent repeated cases. The exploit is a classic supply-chain attack on open-source tools. It requires users to first install the bot, which many do in an effort to copy successful traders on Polymarket. These users input their private keys for signing trades, thereby unknowingly exposing them. Anyone who finds themselves in such a predicament is advised to immediately delete the repository if it has been downloaded, assume any wallet linked to it has been compromised, and move all funds to a new one as quickly as it can be done. It also does not help matters that similar issues have come up in other Polymarket bot repos . So it has become crucial to scrutinize third-party trading scripts to be on the safe side. It should be noted that the Polymarket platform has not been hacked; the bots that have been wreaking this havoc are unofficial ones, which pose high risks since they require direct access to users’ private keys.

They either come too early, when the ideas are still being formulated or too late when growth is already being discounted. The strongest phase usually is not at the ends. This is the late discovery window where an actual progress is being made but the focus is lagging. One of the Ethereum based DeFi crypto seems to be touching that small space. Why Sometimes Late Stage Discovery Works The late stage discovery is easy to comprehend. It can be defined as the types of projects that have already demonstrated funds, usability and process of development, but are not much known. The risk is reduced compared to the concept stage, but price is not adapted to maturity. There is a lot of uncertainty in early entry. The late entry is associated with a low upside. Discovery at the stages may be found at the middle stage. It is here that work groups are in operation and value begins to develop ahead of the crowd. Traditionally, numerous popular DeFi protocols have had their most significant price performances at this stage of time not on the launch date and not several years later. Placing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) on That Curve Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not an idea any longer. Simultaneously it is not entirely alive. This puts it at the late discovery. The protocol is developing a lend and borrow infrastructure that is decentralized on Ethereum. It provides liquidity pooling, collateralized borrowing and mtTokens, as indexes of supplied assets and yield earned. Development no longer pastes thinking. The core contracts are signed, and a roadmap that now has a target of V1 deployment in the Sepolia testnet in Q4, 2025 is finalized. This phase usually signifies the departure of theory and execution. There are some signs that MUTM is not being discovered pre-maturely. Mutuum Finance has collected up to $19.4M. It has increased the number of holders to above 18,600. Over 820M units are already being sold. These figures did not shoot immediately. They built over time. This trend is usually characterized by cautious confidence and not hype-led inflows. Investor early moods show that interest is on the increase due to the infrastructure coming to the fore. It is characteristic of the late discovery, where people join in after improvement, rather than the reverse of this. Token Structure The significant role of token structure commences when the discovery begins. MUTM is currently priced at $0.035. The presale began in early 2025 at the price of $0.01, implying that the token has already increased by 250% in terms of staged pricing. Phase 6 is now over 99% allocated. With the tightening in supply, there is a tendency to shift the price behavior. When new demand moves in, the late discovery will be accompanied by a decrease in availability and rapider repricing. The 500% MUTM appreciation in the price of the token in phase 1 is placed at the actual launch cost of $0.06. The next phase subsequent step is set to increase the token price by almost 20%, which further lowers entry points. Security usually becomes the time when mass audiences begin to pay attention. Mutuum Finance has passed through a CertiK audit with a 90 point token scan rating. Simultaneously, Halborn Security is examining the American commitments of lending and borrowing. The codebase is complete, and it is under analysis. The bug bounty program is also in place with a reward of $50k on the finding of possible code vulnerabilities. This is an important step that is awaited by many investors. Security frameworks decrease uncertainty as well as transform perception from experimental to structured. Why This Window Is Narrow Discovery too late does not last long. Almost all of phase 6 allocation has been made. The active contributor is also rewarded with a 24 hours leaderboard that grants a contributor with MUTM worth $500 daily to enhance their participation. The payments can be made via cards, and barriers to access are reduced. With increasing exposure V1 and as MUTM gets closer, we can expect it to shift to wider visibility as opposed to late discovery. To individuals searching for the potential best crypto to purchase in 2026, phase 6 can not remain open long enough.

56141607,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=248512,1766333411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Waymo Robotaxi Crisis: San Francisco Blackout Exposes Autonomous Vehicle Vulnerability,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/waymo-robotaxi-san-francisco-blackout-suspension/,"BitcoinWorld Waymo Robotaxi Crisis: San Francisco Blackout Exposes Autonomous Vehicle Vulnerability In a stunning revelation of technological fragility, Waymo’s autonomous vehicle network faced a catastrophic failure during San Francisco’s massive blackout, leaving robotaxis stranded across city streets and raising urgent questions about the resilience of self-driving infrastructure. This incident serves as a critical warning for the cryptocurrency community about the vulnerabilities of automated systems that could parallel issues in blockchain networks and smart contract platforms during infrastructure failures. Waymo Robotaxi Gridlock During San Francisco Blackout The crisis unfolded on Saturday evening when a fire at a Pacific Gas & Electric substation plunged approximately 120,000 customers into darkness. As traffic lights failed and cellular networks became unstable, Waymo’s fleet of autonomous vehicles began experiencing widespread malfunctions. Social media quickly flooded with images and videos showing the Waymo robotaxis frozen at intersections, creating traffic jams that human drivers struggled to navigate around. The company confirmed the service suspension through spokesperson Suzanne Philion, who stated: “We have temporarily suspended our ride-hailing services in the San Francisco Bay Area due to the widespread power outage. Our teams are working diligently and in close coordination with city officials to monitor infrastructure stability.” Autonomous Vehicles Face Infrastructure Challenges This incident highlights several critical vulnerabilities in autonomous vehicle systems: Dependency on External Infrastructure: Waymo vehicles rely on traffic signals, cellular networks, and real-time mapping data that became unavailable during the blackout Safety Protocol Limitations: The vehicles’ default safety behavior appears to be “stop and wait” when encountering uncertain conditions Communication Breakdown: Without stable network connections, vehicles cannot receive remote assistance or updated routing information Sensor Limitations: In complete darkness with non-functioning traffic signals, even advanced sensors struggle to interpret complex traffic scenarios Power Outage Exposes Systemic Weaknesses The San Francisco blackout affected multiple critical systems simultaneously: Infrastructure Component Impact on Waymo Vehicles Status During Blackout Traffic Signals Unable to interpret intersection rules Non-functional Cellular Networks Lost remote monitoring capability Degraded service Street Lighting Reduced sensor effectiveness Minimal to none Muni Transit Systems Increased unpredictable traffic patterns Suspended operations Mayor Daniel Lurie’s warning for residents to stay off the roads underscores the severity of the situation. With both traffic lights and mass transit systems compromised, the city’s transportation network faced unprecedented challenges that even human drivers struggled to navigate. Traffic Disruption and Public Safety Concerns The stranded Waymo vehicles created significant traffic disruption across multiple neighborhoods. Videos from North Beach showed multiple autonomous vehicles blocking intersections, while other areas reported similar gridlock situations. This raises important questions about emergency response accessibility during such incidents. Key concerns emerging from this event include: Emergency vehicle access during autonomous vehicle failures Public trust in self-driving technology during crisis situations The need for manual override capabilities in extreme conditions Infrastructure redundancy requirements for critical transportation systems Waymo’s Growth Versus Reliability Challenges Ironically, this incident comes as Waymo reports significant growth in its operations. According to a leaked letter from Tiger Global Management, Waymo now provides 450,000 robotaxi rides per week—nearly double the figure disclosed earlier this year. This rapid expansion makes reliability failures even more concerning for regulators and the public. The company faces a critical balancing act between: Scaling operations to meet growing demand Maintaining safety standards during infrastructure failures Developing robust contingency plans for various emergency scenarios Building public confidence through transparent communication Lessons for Autonomous Vehicle Development This San Francisco blackout serves as a real-world stress test that reveals several areas needing improvement: Redundant Systems: Autonomous vehicles need backup systems that function independently of city infrastructure Emergency Protocols: Clear procedures for safely removing vehicles from traffic during system failures Public Communication: Rapid, transparent updates during service disruptions Infrastructure Collaboration: Closer coordination with utility companies and city services FAQs: Understanding the Waymo Blackout Incident What caused the Waymo vehicles to stop working? The primary issue appears to be the combination of failed traffic signals, degraded cellular networks, and lack of street lighting that created conditions the vehicles’ safety systems couldn’t navigate safely. How long was Waymo service suspended? Service remained suspended through Sunday morning as PG&E worked to restore power to approximately 35,000 customers still affected by the blackout. Who is responsible for Waymo’s operations? Waymo is owned by Alphabet Inc. , Google’s parent company. The company’s leadership includes CEO Dmitri Dolgov and co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana. What role did San Francisco officials play? San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie warned residents to avoid unnecessary travel and coordinated with emergency services to manage the crisis. How does this affect autonomous vehicle regulation? This incident will likely prompt regulatory review of autonomous vehicle requirements during infrastructure failures and emergency situations. What is Pacific Gas & Electric’s involvement? PG&E experienced a substation fire that caused the widespread blackout affecting approximately 120,000 customers. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for Autonomous Transportation The San Francisco blackout incident exposes fundamental vulnerabilities in current autonomous vehicle systems that extend beyond Waymo to the entire self-driving industry. As cities increasingly integrate autonomous vehicles into their transportation networks, this event demonstrates the critical need for robust fail-safe mechanisms, better infrastructure integration, and comprehensive emergency protocols. The temporary paralysis of Waymo’s fleet serves as both a technical lesson and a public relations challenge that will shape the future of autonomous transportation regulation and development. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and technology observers, this incident parallels concerns about decentralized systems’ dependency on centralized infrastructure—a reminder that even the most advanced technologies remain vulnerable to basic infrastructure failures.
