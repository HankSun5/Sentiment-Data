Ethereum and Stellar remain central to the crypto infrastructure. Stellar excels in quick, affordable cross-border payments, while Ethereum anchors DeFi, smart contracts, and staking networks. Together, they bring reliability and widespread utility to the crypto ecosystem. But another name is rising quickly among the top altcoins. BlockDAG’s ongoing presale has already brought in $395 million, with more than 25 billion tokens sold at a standardized price of $0.0013 introduced till the BDAG Deployment Event. This change replaced bonus tiers with a clear flat-rate system to ensure fairness for all buyers. With 3 million users on the X1 app, over 19,000 mining rigs in operation, and a developer network building 300-plus decentralized applications, BlockDAG(BDAG) is proving it has both strong fundamentals and significant momentum. That makes it a serious player among today’s top altcoins with real growth potential. XLM Remains Reliable But Breakout Potential Seems Limited Stellar (XLM) is currently priced near $0.39, driven by its strength in low-cost, real-time international transactions. Its role in serving banks and payment providers has established a track record of dependable use, which continues to lend credibility to the network. Stellar’s global payment utility remains an important piece of the broader blockchain economy. Still, while the technology is sound, the price has struggled to show breakout behavior. Even after climbing more than 300% over the past year, recent performance appears stagnant when compared with other top altcoins. Liquidity is present, yet the potential for rapid gains seems capped. Investors often look to Stellar as a steady part of their portfolio rather than a high-growth vehicle. In comparison to newer projects like BlockDAG, Stellar’s slow and stable profile stands in contrast to the aggressive expansion many are now seeking. It holds value as a trusted platform, but it lacks the explosive momentum that characterizes early-stage projects with big upside potential. Ethereum’s Institutional Strength Drives Price Ethereum remains one of the most dominant forces in crypto, with analysts placing price targets between $7,500 and $12,000. Its momentum is supported by steady staking participation, a leading role in decentralized finance, and a regulatory environment that has grown more favorable in recent months. Institutions continue to increase exposure, adding to Ethereum’s already deep liquidity and reputation for stability. Technically, Ethereum has room to extend its rally if current support zones remain intact. These bullish factors reinforce the view that Ethereum is a core long-term asset. However, its already massive market cap makes explosive short-term returns more difficult to achieve. For those building diversified portfolios, Ethereum remains a cornerstone. But for those looking for the top altcoins with faster growth, smaller cap projects with room to scale like BlockDAG are drawing more attention. Ethereum’s track record offers trust, while BlockDAG offers momentum and untapped upside. BlockDAG’s Ecosystem Expands Rapidly With Real Users, Developers, & Mining Power BlockDAG’s presale success is more than just hype. With over $395 million raised and presale pricing now fixed at $0.0013 following the BDAG Deployment Event, early buyers who entered at launch are sitting on 2,900% ROI. The updated flat-rate model was designed to simplify access and align long-term incentives. Under the hood, BlockDAG runs on a hybrid DAG and Proof of Work model with full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. It processes up to 10,000 transactions per second, supporting developers familiar with Ethereum tools while improving scalability and efficiency. This makes it easy for teams to migrate existing applications, helping grow the ecosystem faster. Adoption metrics are also on the rise. The X1 mining app has 3 million users, and more than 19,000 mining devices across the X10, X30, and X100 series are already active. On the development side, over 4,500 builders are working on 300-plus decentralized applications. These numbers show that BlockDAG isn’t just preparing for launch; it’s actively growing into a full-scale crypto platform. Combining advanced tech, a real user base, and growing developer interest, BlockDAG sets a new bar for what early-stage top altcoins can achieve. Final Take: BlockDAG Gains Ground While XLM & ETH Plateau Stellar offers stability and proven use cases in the global payments space, but its price action shows that its growth may be tapering off. Ethereum continues to dominate the ecosystem with strong fundamentals and growing institutional support, but its massive size limits how quickly it can deliver sharp returns. BlockDAG, by contrast, is moving fast. With $395 million raised and presale pricing at $0.0013 set till the BDAG Deployment Event, the project has aligned transparency with momentum. This new pricing approach reinforces equal opportunity for all participants, replacing bonus-driven confusion with a fair and accessible system. For those exploring the top altcoins with higher return potential, BlockDAG clearly stands out. As the crypto landscape evolves heading into 2025, BlockDAG is not just keeping up, it’s leading the charge.

51149019,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=177364,1756940430,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/51149019.jpeg,Don’t Miss Out: This Crypto Trio Could Explode,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/dont-miss-out-this-crypto-trio-could-explode/,"Crypto thrives on speed and conviction. Every cycle, fortunes are made not just by buying the leaders, but by spotting the tokens on the edge of breakout momentum. With Bitcoin consolidating after pushing beyond six figures in 2025, attention has shifted toward altcoins where upside remains exponential. Analysts reviewing market setups say this rotation is already underway, with capital flowing into projects that can capture both retail excitement and institutional interest. Among the many contenders, three names are repeatedly flagged: Cardano (ADA) for governance-driven stability, PEPE for meme liquidity, and MAGACOIN FINANCE for retail-driven ignition. Each plays a different role, but forecasts suggest one may deliver gains that outshine the others. Cardano: long-term patience Cardano has been building quietly since its inception, focusing on peer-reviewed research and methodical development. This steady approach culminated in the Voltaire upgrade in 2025, introducing on-chain governance and giving ADA holders direct control over treasury spending and network changes. The move put Cardano in a category few can claim—true decentralization at the protocol level. Price action has been less dramatic, but stability has its rewards. ADA currently trades near $0.80 , with analysts forecasting potential highs of $6 by 2026. That represents a meaningful 6-7x return, particularly attractive for investors seeking lower volatility exposure. Yet compared to tokens capable of 20x or 50x surges, Cardano’s ceiling is modest. Its future lies in steady ecosystem growth, not parabolic rallies. PEPE: meme resilience If ADA represents patience, PEPE embodies velocity. Launched in 2023 with little more than a meme and a name, PEPE quickly climbed into the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Despite wild volatility, it remains one of the most liquid meme coins, with trading pairs active across every major exchange. What drives PEPE is not technology but cultural permanence. Memes thrive in attention economies, and PEPE’s simplicity makes it endlessly repeatable across Twitter, TikTok, and Telegram. Analysts believe it could stage another major rally if retail rotates heavily into meme coins, with projections of 5-10x upside by 2026. However, skeptics warn that without new mechanics or innovation, PEPE could face diminishing returns compared to younger cultural tokens designed for the next cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE: the breakout contender While ADA builds patiently and PEPE thrives on recognition, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the cultural ignition point. Its presale rounds have sold out at record speed, drawing thousands of early investors and even whale wallets positioning ahead of listings. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE different is its blend of credibility and virality. Unlike older meme coins that relied solely on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already completed audits by HashEx and CertiK , giving it legitimacy that meme-driven projects often lack. At the same time, it is designed for cultural magnetism, Trump themed branding that is instantly recognizable, meme-ready, and capable of spreading across communities at scale. Analysts forecast MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver up to 45x ROI , citing three drivers: Presale scarcity: allocations are shrinking as rounds sell out faster than expected. Community visibility: its presence across Telegram and X is growing daily, creating viral flywheels. Timing: launching at the start of what some analysts call the “final easy cycle” gives it maximum exposure while still under the radar. For retail traders, the appeal lies in stack psychology. Unlike ADA or PEPE, which require larger allocations to feel significant, MAGACOIN FINANCE lets buyers accumulate millions of tokens at low cost. This creates viral loops of screenshots, memes, and word-of-mouth momentum, the same psychological ignition that once propelled PEPE to the stratosphere. Why timing matters Crypto is unforgiving to latecomers. Investors who entered PEPE or DOGE after mainstream headlines still profited, but their multiples were a fraction of early adopters. The same was true for Solana and even Ethereum. Conviction before consensus has always defined the biggest winners. MAGACOIN FINANCE sits precisely at that juncture today: no longer a whisper, but not yet a mainstream phenomenon. For investors, the question is not whether it can gain traction, it already has, but whether they will act while the presale still offers exponential asymmetry. Balancing strategies Each of these tokens plays a role in portfolio construction. Cardano anchors with governance and credibility. PEPE ensures exposure to meme liquidity and cultural flows. MAGACOIN FINANCE delivers the asymmetric play, designed for viral adoption and exponential upside. Analysts argue that blending all three may offer balance, but for those chasing the highest potential profits by 2026, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the clear contender. Conclusion Cardano will continue its long march toward governance maturity. PEPE will remain a fixture of meme coin culture. Both will reward investors who hold through volatility. But when it comes to transformational upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE, with forecasts of 45x returns, surging presale demand, and Trump themed ignition, emerges as the standout story. For those waiting for mainstream confirmation, history shows the biggest gains may already be gone by then.

51151224,573375,1756940448,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,Ethereum Open Interest Holds Firm at $8.4B: Why Traders Aren’t Flinching Despite Price Pressure,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-open-interest-holds-firm-8-4b-why-traders/,"Ethereum (ETH) has slipped 5.5% in the past seven days, with today’s decline adding another 1.4% as prices struggle near $4,400. Yet, despite the turbulence, derivatives data shows remarkable resilience. According to CryptoQuant, Binance’s Ethereum open interest (OI) has remained steady above $8.4 billion, even after ETH dipped below $4,400 this week. Typically, sharp price pullbacks trigger a significant drop in OI as traders unwind leveraged positions. This time, however, ETH traders are holding firm, suggesting either expectations of a rebound or a lack of conviction in further downside momentum. The moderation in OI contraction , down just 3.4% in 24 hours compared to -6.25% earlier this week, further supports the idea that aggressive deleveraging is losing steam. Ethereum Buyers Absorbing Pressure Despite Negative Flows Market sentiment still leans bearish, with Binance’s Net Taker Volume consistently negative, ranging between -1.08 billion and -1.11 billion. This indicates sellers remain aggressive. However, the fact that OI is holding steady suggests buyers are quietly absorbing pressure rather than retreating completely. Spot market activity adds another layer of optimism. Daily exchange withdrawals have regularly exceeded 120,000 ETH across platforms like Binance and Kraken. Such outflows reduce sell-side liquidity and hint at longer-term accumulation strategies. Whether these flows reflect institutional custodial moves or retail positioning, they tighten exchange reserves and create conditions less favorable for extended sell-offs. A Possible Bear Trap Before “Uptober”? Technically, Ethereum’s chart resembles a bearish head-and-shoulders formation, raising alarms about further downside. Yet, some analysts argue this could be one of the “biggest bear traps” forming in the market. Crypto strategist Johnny Woo pointed to the $3,800–$4,100 range as a key support zone. Should ETH hold above this level, traders sidelined by bearish sentiment may be forced to re-enter at higher levels, fueling an upside reversal. Historically, October has often brought relief rallies, dubbed “Uptober” by traders, suggesting that Ethereum’s current weakness might set the stage for a surprise rebound. For now, Ethereum faces the challenge of shaking off September’s pressure while holding critical support. If buyers continue absorbing sell-side flows and OI stability persists, the stage could be set for a bullish counterattack heading into the final quarter of 2025.

But what I’ve experienced on the ground has always been in stark contrast to the harsh realities of economic data. Today, there are less than 50 unicorn businesses that have emerged from Latin America, a region covering 20 countries and 600 million people. To put that in comparison, its neighbour the United States boasts in excess of 1,200 start-ups valued in excess of $1 billion, and the U.S. has just 40% of LATAM’s population. It’s undeniably true that Latin America has a wealth of resources. Yet, for some reason its entrepreneurial and investment potential has not yet been truly fulfilled. This led us to undertake a detailed study of eight Latin American countries to better understand what is holding the region back, and what can be done to fuel growth. In particular, we explored the role that tokenisation could play in unlocking capital and give the region greater participation in global markets. In our Latin America Market Inclusion Report we spoke to experts across the region including market analysts, lawyers, stockbrokers, and others involved in the regional capital markets, to understand the experience a company faces when seeking to raise capital of $30-$50 million on the region’s public markets. Our analysis identifies a phenomenon of “liquidity latency” in the region, which refers to the obstacles and inefficiencies in traditional LATAM capital markets that have slowed the flow of capital and hindered investment. In particular, we found: Concentrated banking: Before the emergence of alternative and non-bank financial services (fintechs) companies over the last five years, just five banks controlled 70% of bank accounts in Latin America’s main markets. High fees: Such monopolisation has contributed to the world’s highest banking fees – around 17% – unsurprisingly stifling both innovation and capital flow. Bureaucratic and regulatory hurdles: Many major Latin American economies rank poorly on the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business index, with reputations for bureaucratic and regulatory complexities that disincentivise listings and investment. Limited capital market depth: The region suffers from severe underfunding of entrepreneurship and deep pools of capital looking for these opportunities. High startup costs: Raising $30-$50 million can incur average fees of 7%, often higher due to dollar-denominated advisory services and significant pre-issue costs. This added hurdle, combined with regulatory complexity and low liquidity, strongly deters new issuances. Underdeveloped investor ecosystem: Many in Latin America do not, or cannot, engage in financial investment opportunities. For example, less than 2% of Colombia’s population are active stock market investors, and 68% of Latin Americans lack formal financial education. There’s also a heavy institutional bias, with retail investors in Peru paying eleven times more in fees than institutional investors for the same stock. Markets in Latin America have traditionally been ‘exclusive’ in nature and practice; the right to participate was reserved for a privileged few. Barriers range from economic (costs) to social (connections), from access (particularly to international investors), to regulation (cumbersome and often arcane). The societal costs of this situation extend beyond the economic; they include the continued under-representation of certain groups or geographies in the region’s formal economy, the side-lining of under-served communities and demographics, inhibiting their ability to participate or share in the region’s growth. It’s therefore little surprise that liquidity latency is affecting entrepreneurialism, reducing opportunities for business creators and those who wish to invest in them. However, we are beginning to see a marked change with the growth of tokenisation that I believe can help to fire up LATAM’s growth potential. Tokenisation offers issuers cost-efficient access to global liquidity for companies of all sizes and situations. Additionally, it enables investors a much greater degree of flexibility and freedom of use with real-time settlement, 24/7/365 trading and the ability to self-custody assets. In effect, zero barriers to entry for both sides of the transaction – fundraisers and investors. By reducing issuance costs by up to 50%, as little as 2-4% of capital raised, cutting listing times to 60-90 days, and enabling fractional ownership, blockchain-based securities can make investing dramatically more inclusive and efficient. It is of course still early days in fulfilling the potential of tokenisation, but it’s not an exaggeration to say that the financial shift that it represents has given a broader socio-economic chance for the region to overcome historical barriers and drive growth. Tokenisation represents the first genuine opportunity in generations to rethink finance. It lowers costs, accelerates access, and creates a more direct connection between issuers and investors. Tokenisation represents a practical and available solution; reducing barriers to entry for business creators and investors, extending the role and benefits of the market to all sections of society. This is the meaning and aspiration of market inclusion which, for Latin America, couldn’t be more relevant or urgent.

51149037,https://timestabloid.com/?p=81574,1756940577,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Here’s What Is Holding XRP Price Down: It Is Not What You Think,https://timestabloid.com/heres-what-is-holding-xrp-price-down-it-is-not-what-you-think/,"In a recent tweet, crypto commentator Austin Hilton addressed what he views as the primary reasons behind XRP’s current price stagnation. In an attached video, he explained that XRP, despite positive developments surrounding its ecosystem, is being held back by broader economic uncertainty rather than issues specific to the asset itself. Hilton noted that XRP is currently trading at $2.82. While the token is up by 2% over the past 24 hours, it has declined by 2% over the past seven days and recorded a 2 percent drop across the past month. He emphasized that these movements are not the result of negative events directly tied to Ripple or the XRP Ledger. Instead, he argued that the main factor weighing down the price is market-wide uncertainty, particularly related to economic policy and investor sentiment. This is what is holding the XRP price down! And, it is not what you think… pic.twitter.com/fSu9CIfy8I — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) September 2, 2025 The Role of Macroeconomic Uncertainty According to Hilton, uncertainty surrounding U.S. Federal Reserve decisions is central to the lack of momentum in the crypto market. Questions about whether the Fed will reduce interest rates in September or issue additional cuts later this year have created hesitation among investors. He said this uncertainty has locked liquidity and capital on the sidelines, delayed the return of retail investors, who exited in late 2024 and have not yet re-entered in large numbers. Hilton also pointed to tariff-related concerns as another source of uncertainty. Recent court rulings that declared former President Trump’s tariffs illegal, followed by announcements of alternative plans, have added to the unsettled environment. He stressed that such uncertainty is discouraging new investment in digital assets like XRP and other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, which have also been consolidating within narrow trading ranges. Seasonal Trends and Investor Behavior Hilton highlighted that September has historically been one of the weakest months for Bitcoin, and by extension, the broader crypto market. He stated that this seasonal trend could contribute to XRP’s lack of progress in the short term. He added that over the past 44 days, XRP has mostly moved sideways, showing little sign of a breakout due to limited liquidity and investor participation. The consolidation pattern seen across multiple digital assets is, in Hilton’s view, evidence of investors delaying action. Instead of allocating new funds into crypto, many are waiting to see how upcoming economic developments unfold. This lack of investor interest is not unique to XRP but affects the entire market. Outlook for the Coming Months Looking ahead, Hilton suggested that conditions may improve in the fourth quarter of the year, with October through December offering more favorable growth opportunities. He cautioned, however, that further downside for XRP remains possible in the near term, with the price potentially dipping into the $0.50 range if uncertainty persists. Hilton emphasized that the outcome of the Federal Reserve’s upcoming meeting in September will be pivotal. If the Fed does move to lower interest rates, it could restore confidence and unlock liquidity, creating an environment where capital begins to flow back into digital assets. He also underscored the importance of the upcoming U.S. jobs report, which may influence the Fed’s decision and provide additional clarity for investors. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Hilton concluded that the most significant factor limiting XRP’s growth is not related to internal issues within the Ripple or XRP ecosystem but instead to uncertainty in the broader economic landscape. Until greater clarity emerges from the Federal Reserve and related developments related to tariffs, he argued, investors are likely to remain cautious.

The government has quietly allowed private businesses to buy and sell USDT, a stablecoin issued by Tether that mirrors the US dollar, in a bid to keep trade moving and maintain supplies of imported goods ranging from machinery to food. Sanctions shrink Venezuela’s dollar pool For years, Venezuelan companies seeking to import raw materials relied on central bank interventions to access dollars derived from oil exports. But that channel has narrowed as the United States tightened restrictions on the Nicolás Maduro government. Washington last month renewed a limited license for Chevron to ship Venezuelan crude after a three-month pause but prohibited payments directly to Caracas. The move reduced the flow of dollars available in the official exchange market, compounding the squeeze from lower oil shipments. Exports in July fell 10% from the previous month, according to vessel tracking data. The Venezuelan central bank has poured about $2 billion into the currency market in the first seven months of 2025, 14% less than in the same period last year, according to private estimates. “The availability of exchange always has a ceiling,” said lawmaker Orlando Camacho, who leads a guild of medium-sized companies close to the ruling party. With US dollars getting scarcer, businesses have increasingly turned to digital alternatives. Stablecoins flow in the marketplace Since June, the government has been permitted to sell USDT to companies in exchange for bolívars, Venezuela’s battered local currency, according to people familiar with the process. The buyers must hold a government-approved digital wallet, where the crypto is credited before being used to pay suppliers or resold in private transactions. Ecoanalítica, a Venezuelan analyst firm, estimates that businesses bought roughly $119 million worth of cryptocurrencies in July. Analysts expect the figure to rise as sanctions persist and oil inflows remain limited. “When one operation closes, others open,” one businessperson reportedly said regarding the new reliance on stablecoins. Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez has acknowledged the use of “non-traditional mechanisms of management in the exchange market” in recent meetings with business leaders, though she stopped short of naming crypto outright. From failed petro to entrenched Tether The embrace of stablecoins marks a new chapter in Venezuela’s fraught relationship with digital assets. The government launched its own token, the petro, in 2018 to much fanfare, billing it as an oil-backed cryptocurrency that could anchor the economy. It was quietly abandoned after failing to attract users or investors. This time, the state is not pushing its own product but leaning on a dollar proxy that already circulates widely. According to the Financial Times , crypto use across Venezuela surged 110% in the 12 months since mid-2024. Yet Tether itself has faced scrutiny over its role in sanctioned jurisdictions. The company has said it complies with the U.S. Treasury’s list of banned entities and did not comment directly on Venezuelan usage this year. For now, stablecoins offer Caracas a breathing space. By allowing limited, regulated use of USDT, the government can ease pressure on businesses while conserving scarce physical dollars for its own priorities.

According to data from Lookonchain, some of the biggest financial institutions, including Fidelity, Bitwise and Grayscale sold ETH and bought BTC. Inflows into BTC and ETH ETFs. Source: Lookonchain On-chain data shows funds entering BTC ETFs On-chain data has revealed that spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds surpassed Ethereum ETFs as far as investment flows on Tuesday. According to data from Lookonchain , spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $332.7 million in net inflows on Tuesday, led by $132.7 million moving into Fidelity’s FBTC and $72.8 million into BlackRock’s IBIT. Funds from Grayscale, Ark & 21Shares, Bitwise, VanEck and Invesco also saw net inflows yesterday. On the other hand, spot Ethereum ETFs reported a total daily net outflow of $135.3 million, with Fidelity’s FETH recording $99.2 million in outflows and Bitwise’s ETHW recording $24.2 million in negative flows. Analysts believe this shift in fortunes in terms of ETH and BTC ETF inflows suggests institutional investors may be rebalancing portfolios as Bitcoin’s perceived stability becomes more attractive as the market struggles with macroeconomic uncertainties. Things were different in August when Ethereum ETFs outperformed Bitcoin ETFs thanks to their yield-generating capabilities, improving regulatory clarity, and growing corporate treasury adoption. While Bitcoin ETFs saw a monthly net outflow of $751 million in August, Ethereum ETFs saw $3.87 billion flow into the funds during the same period. “In the short term, this could bolster bitcoin’s price support near $108k and reduce selling pressure, though Ethereum’s stronger yield prospects and Digital Asset Treasuries growth may sustain its outperformance into year-end,” Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research said. Large capital continues to flow into Ethereum Even though Ethereum is currently struggling to reclaim the $4,500 mark amid broader bearish action, analysts warn investors against writing it off because large capital continues to flow into the ecosystem. While institutions seem to care more about BTC right now, Ethereum ETFs continue to see daily inflows, and retail investors are treating dips as buying opportunities. Also, late last month, some analysts noted a resurgence of positive sentiment among Ethereum investors on the largest crypto platform, Binance , after fresh data revealed that in less than a week, the number of ETH on the crypto exchange declined by 10% from 4,975,000 ETH to 4,478,000 ETH, particularly between August 23 and 27. Such declines imply that investors are removing ETH from centralized platforms, a behavior historically linked to long-term accumulation and growing confidence. During this period, increased market activity has been driven by rising demand, suggesting a potential supply squeeze that would intensify Ethereum’s next significant price rise. Even as ETFs take a breather, Ethereum is still seeing strong interest from corporate treasuries. These institutions are increasingly choosing long-term investing plans over short-term speculation, which increases the likelihood of ETH resisting significant market corrections. At the time of writing, ETH is seeing some bullish price action and is trading just under $4,500, rounding out a nearly 4% increase in the last 24 hours.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with exciting news! Shares of American Bitcoin (ABTC), a prominent mining firm, recently made an impressive debut on the Nasdaq, capturing significant attention from investors and market watchers alike. This event marks a pivotal moment for the company, signaling strong market confidence in its operations and future prospects. American Bitcoin’s Remarkable Nasdaq Debut: What Happened? On its first day of trading, American Bitcoin saw its stock surge by approximately 17%, closing at a robust $8.04. This initial climb was quite dramatic, with the stock even touching an intraday high of $14 before settling. The successful listing, as reported by The Block, highlights a strong appetite for crypto-related ventures on mainstream financial platforms. What makes this debut particularly noteworthy is the high-profile backing the company enjoys. President Donald Trump’s sons, Donald Jr. and Eric Trump, are key figures associated with the firm. Their involvement undoubtedly adds a layer of intrigue and public interest to American Bitcoin ‘s market performance. Behind the Scenes: How Does American Bitcoin Achieve Efficiency? Eric Trump provided valuable insights into the company’s operational strengths during an interview with Bloomberg. He emphasized American Bitcoin ‘s commitment to efficiency and stability, crucial factors in the volatile crypto mining sector. Here are some key takeaways: Cost-Effective Mining: Eric Trump stated that the company mines Bitcoin at roughly half the current market cost. This significant advantage allows for higher profit margins and resilience against market fluctuations. Stable Operations: The firm prides itself on maintaining stable operations, a critical aspect for long-term success in an industry often characterized by rapid changes. Tangible Asset Backing: Unlike some purely speculative ventures, American Bitcoin ‘s operations are backed by substantial tangible assets. These include data centers valued at hundreds of millions of dollars, providing a solid foundation for its mining activities. This strategic approach to mining and asset management positions American Bitcoin as a serious player in the digital asset space, moving beyond just speculative interest. Understanding the Impact: What Does This Mean for the Market? The successful Nasdaq listing of American Bitcoin sends a clear signal to the broader financial world. It demonstrates that traditional exchanges are increasingly open to embracing companies deeply rooted in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This integration could pave the way for more crypto mining firms and blockchain-related businesses to seek public listings, offering new investment avenues for mainstream investors. Moreover, the valuation of Eric Trump’s stake in the company at approximately $500 million underscores the significant financial potential perceived within the firm. Such valuations can attract further institutional interest and capital into the crypto mining industry, fostering growth and innovation. Investors looking into this space should consider the balance between high-growth potential and the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency markets. However, the operational efficiency and asset backing of companies like American Bitcoin might offer a more stable investment proposition compared to direct crypto holdings. Looking Ahead: The Future Trajectory of American Bitcoin The debut of American Bitcoin on Nasdaq is more than just a stock market event; it’s a testament to the evolving landscape of digital finance. As the company continues its operations, its ability to maintain low mining costs and leverage its substantial asset base will be key to sustaining its growth.

For those tracking the intersection of traditional finance and cryptocurrency, American Bitcoin offers a compelling narrative of innovation and strategic execution. In conclusion, American Bitcoin ‘s impressive Nasdaq debut, fueled by strategic efficiency and significant backing, has firmly placed it in the spotlight.

Bithumb said that its engineers “immediately began system maintenance” after detecting the fault. However, Bithumb “trading services were down for approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes,” the newspaper explained. Bithumb announced September 3 that it would “fully compensate users for losses incurred due to the trading suspension.” The exchange said it now plans to “sequentially review” customer complaints and provide compensation for traders who lost money as a result of the outage. Bithumb said it hopes to complete the review and compensation process in the space of “approximately one month.” An exchange official said a transaction system error caused the problem.

The newspaper said customers had suffered “significant disruption.” This follows major system errors at South Korea’s biggest exchanges during last year’s martial law crisis. Crypto markets experienced turmoil in early December 2024, after former President Yoon Suk-yeol attempted to declare martial law. Some traders responded by selling their crypto holdings, while others attempted to “buy the dip.” The result was a massive and sudden surge of web traffic to major exchanges, with many platforms seemingly unable to take the strain. “Repeated computer outages at major exchanges are fueling investor discontent,” Seoul Kyungjae wrote. The crypto exchange Bithumb has made “significant reductions” to the scale of its crypto lending services amid ongoing concerns from financial regulators. #Bithumb #CryptoRegulations https://t.co/J2iCgMS6Q8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 12, 2025 We Must Improve Legal System, Say Industry Officials Data compiled by the offices of the People Power Party lawmaker Lee Heon-seung has revealed that 89 cases of outages occurred at the country’s five fiat-trading exchanges from 2018 to 2024. Bithumb has experinced 41 of these outages, with its closest rival Upbit experiencing 28 cases. GOPAX has suffered from 11 outages in the period, with Coinone reporting eight cases. Korbit experienced just one system-related outage between 2018 and 2024. Bread prices in Korea have been rising, adding to consumers' financial burden amid the inflation of food prices.

As such, deadlines for reporting damages and compensation methods currently “vary greatly from exchange to exchange.” The newspaper quoted an unnamed South Korean crypto industry official as stating: “The crypto market is highly volatile and operates 24 hours a day. As such, even a few minutes of trading interruption can result in investors making losses. We need to create a streamlined compensation system for damages caused by exchanges’ computer system failures.” Bithumb is aiming to go public on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 2026.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.54 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $5.75. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.8188 Market cap $817.92M Trading volume $150.93M Circulating supply 998.84M WIF All-time high $4.85 on (March 31, 2024) All-time low $0.000023 (November 2023) 24-hour high $0.8245 24-hour low $0.7944 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 7.68% 50-day SMA $0.9575 14-Day RSI 44.78 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 55 (Greed) Green days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $0.7634 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown WIF’s price movement remains capped by the $0.842 resistance level. Momentum indicators suggest neither bulls nor bears currently have clear control. If the bears take control of the market, a retest of $0.749 could happen. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart WIF’s daily chart as of September 3, 2025, shows the token trading at $0.818, down 0.12% and struggling to regain bullish momentum. The price remains trapped below the middle Bollinger Band at $0.842 and well beneath the descending trendline resistance that has capped rallies since late August around $0.85-$0.87. WIFUSDT 1-day chart by Tradingview The MACD hovers right at the zero line with minimal directional conviction, while the histogram shows slight compression, suggesting the bears are losing steam, but bulls haven’t taken control yet. The recent bounce from the $0.749 support level appears to be stalling around current levels, creating a concerning pattern of lower highs that suggests the downtrend from the $0.93 peaks may still be intact. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart shows WIF attempting to establish stability around the $0.81-$0.82 zone with the Alligator indicator displaying mixed signals as the three moving averages converge around current price levels. The green line at $0.806 provides immediate support while the blue line at $0.800 acts as a floor, though the red line at $0.801 suggests the trend remains uncertain. WIFUSDT 4-hour chart by Tradingview Volume at 16.51M shows steady but unspectacular participation, indicating neither strong buying nor panic selling at these levels. The Balance of Power oscillator at -0.50 reveals selling pressure still dominates despite the recent stabilization, suggesting any rallies may face significant resistance around the $0.83-$0.85 zone, where previous support has now turned into overhead resistance. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.7947 BUY SMA 5 $0.8056 BUY SMA 10 $0.8252 SELL SMA 21 $0.8660 SELL SMA 50 $0.9575 SELL SMA 100 $0.9233 SELL SMA 200 $0.7634 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.7907 BUY EMA 5 $0.8004 BUY EMA 10 $0.8203 SELL EMA 21 $0.8566 SELL EMA 50 $0.8991 SELL EMA 100 $0.9046 SELL EMA 200 $1.0029 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? WIF appears caught in a consolidation phase, with the outcome likely determined by whether it can reclaim $0.85 resistance or breaks below the $0.80 support zone. A move above $0.85 with volume could target the $0.90 area, but failure to hold $0.80 would likely send the token back toward the $0.75-$0.76 lows where stronger buying interest previously emerged. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank, and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1.5-$2 by the end of 2025 and about $3.4 to $4.2 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

Mike Liberatore, who joined as chief financial officer in April, exited the company at the end of July, according to reporting from The Wall Street Journal. The reason behind Mike’s departure hasn’t been disclosed, and the company hasn’t issued any public comment. He had barely spent four months at the job, but his name was already tied to some of xAI’s biggest financial plays to date. Mike helped drive a $5 billion debt deal, with Morgan Stanley acting as the main banker. In addition to that, the company raised another $5 billion in equity. Nearly half of that money came from SpaceX, which is unusual for a company that doesn’t usually throw cash into other firms. The sudden departure of Mike during that scale of fundraising has left people wondering what exactly is going on behind the scenes. He also handled physical expansion work for xAI, especially its data center projects. Property filings show he signed off on a deal in mid-July to buy an easement for transmission lines near a shut-down power plant in northern Mississippi. The move is tied to a larger effort to expand in the Memphis area, where xAI has been acquiring space for infrastructure. That purchase ended up being one of Mike’s final acts before walking out. General counsel and senior lawyer both left the same month On August 7, the company’s general counsel, Robert Keele, also exited. He said on X that he was leaving after just over a year to be with his two young kids. But the post didn’t stop there. He pointed out that “there’s daylight between our worldviews” when talking about working under Elon. Then he dropped an image generated by Grok, the company’s own chatbot, when asked, “what’s it like to lead legal at xAI?” The result was a wild-looking guy in a suit shoveling coal, which Robert included in the post without comment. That same week, Raghu Rao, a senior lawyer who handled commercial legal matters, also left the company. xAI hasn’t said anything about his exit either. But the timing lined up almost exactly with both Mike and Robert’s departures, which means three top roles were vacated within weeks. One week later, on August 13, another major name exited. Igor Babuschkin, who co-founded xAI in 2023, said he was leaving to start his own venture capital firm focused on AI safety. Igor previously worked at DeepMind and OpenAI, two of the most well-known names in the space. He said in his farewell post that “catching up to the frontier this quickly hasn’t been easy.” Elon replied to him on X saying, “We wouldn’t be here without you.” Grok went rogue and caused public backlash before more resignations The same month all of these exits happened, Grok, the company’s flagship AI chatbot, created a new wave of trouble. The chatbot is now embedded directly inside X, and it can respond to prompts, generate answers, and create images. Since xAI and X merged earlier this year, Grok has become central to both platforms. In May 2024, Grok posted unprompted replies about a fake narrative involving “white genocide” of non-Black South Africans, even though the users hadn’t asked about anything related. Then in July, the chatbot posted multiple antisemitic statements and violent imagery directed at other users. After those incidents, xAI temporarily pulled Grok off the platform and later issued an apology. According to the engineers, Grok’s behavior changed after the team tweaked its parameters to make it less politically correct. That tweak was what triggered the series of bizarre and offensive outputs. The team didn’t give specifics, but the internal changes clearly did not work as intended. Shortly after the Grok chaos, Linda Yaccarino, the former CEO of X, also resigned. She had been leading the platform but was demoted after the merger with xAI, which left Elon back in full control. In August, she took on a new role as CEO of eMed Population Health, a private health management company.

51150982,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=798849,1756942868,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51150982.jpeg,REX-Osprey converts Solana ETF to tax-efficient structure,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-etf-revamped-for-tax-efficiency/,"REX-Osprey has revamped its Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) to boost investor appeal, with the changes taking effect on September 1. The overhaul aims to improve tax efficiency for holders. The SSK Solana + Staking ETF has converted from a C-Corporation structure to a Regulated Investment Company (RIC). This new archetype eliminates the fund-level taxes and directly distributes earnings to shareholders. The move is significant in streamlining taxation, reducing costs for investors, and consolidating the ETF’s position in a market that is becoming increasingly competitive for crypto ETFs . REX-Osprey ends double taxation with RIC shift The past iteration of the SOL ETF was a C-Corporation (C-Corp). Under that structure, the fund was required to pay federal and state taxes on any income, including stakeholder gains . After paying those taxes, the remainder is distributed to shareholders. In return, investors were required to pay their own taxes on those distributions. This led to double taxation, a major disadvantage relative to most traditional ETFs in the United States. This second layer of taxation gradually eroded overall returns and made the fund decidedly less competitive. REX-Osprey has lifted this onus by moving to an RIC structure. The fund itself no longer pays any taxes. Rather, any taxable earnings or capital gains are rolled through to investors. Each investor subsequently bears tax at their own marginal rate. This arrangement is common to most United States ETFs, whether stock or bond funds. It’s a leveling of the field for the Solana ETF, one in accordance with the industry’s standards. Greg King, the founder and chief executive of REX Financial, described the change as a definite upgrade for investors. He explained that it simplifies the tax situation and allows shareholders to keep more returns. King noted that SSK provides direct exposure to Solana’s spot price while also earning staking rewards, a combination not offered by any other U.S.-listed ETF. He added that investors can track Solana’s performance while benefiting from the additional yield generated through staking. Market commentators agree that eliminating tax inefficiencies will likely make crypto ETFs much more attractive for retail and institutional traders–the Solana Opportunity. Solana, which has staking yield as a significant factor for investors, could be the game-changer needed to start bringing in more inflow for the layer1 protocol. RIC shift puts REX-Osprey ahead as Solana ETF race heats up Part of that is simply the timing of the switch. U.S. regulators are considering several applications for Solana spot ETFs, with numerous issuers filing amendments recently. Analysts say such filings indicate approval may be near. By removing “tax drag,” REX-Osprey’s Solana ETF is better positioned to compete when other Solana ETFs start coming to market. Cheaper costs and more straightforward taxation could appeal to more retail and institutional investors. The SSK ETF is still the only U.S.-listed product tying together spot Solana with staking rewards. This sets it apart from other potential ETFs, which are thought to track only the token’s price. There has been significant investor appetite for exposure to Solana since clicking ‘Launch’ on SSK on July 2, 2025. The fund took 12 trading days to reach $100 million in assets under management (AUM), marking one of the fastest starts for a crypto ETF. According to REX data, AUM had climbed to $212 million by late August. That growth also indicates the investor appetite for Solana and optimism about more ETFs potentially being approved.

Recent data reveals that centralized exchange ETH holdings have fallen to their lowest level since 2022, signaling a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it’s a profound movement of assets that could reshape Ethereum’s future trajectory. Why Are Centralized Exchange ETH Holdings Declining? The numbers speak volumes: Ethereum (ETH) holdings on major centralized exchanges have dropped to a mere 17.4 million, a figure not seen since 2022. This substantial decrease, reported by Cointelegraph based on CryptoQuant data, indicates that approximately 2.5 million ETH has been withdrawn from these platforms over the past three months alone. But what’s driving this exodus? Investor Behavior: Many long-term investors prefer to hold their assets in self-custody wallets, moving them off exchanges to enhance security and avoid potential third-party risks. Staking Opportunities: The rise of Ethereum 2.0 (now the Beacon Chain) and liquid staking protocols encourages users to withdraw ETH from exchanges to participate in staking, earning rewards while contributing to network security. Reduced Selling Pressure: Lower ETH holdings on exchanges often suggest that fewer tokens are immediately available for sale, which can reduce selling pressure in the market. The Rise of Institutional ETH Holdings: A New Era? This decline in exchange ETH holdings isn’t happening in a vacuum. It coincides directly with a growing trend of accumulation by publicly traded companies. These firms are increasingly recognizing Ethereum’s potential as a store of value and a strategic asset. Since the beginning of the year, several companies have publicly announced their plans to acquire and hold ETH, signaling a significant shift in corporate treasury strategies. For example, companies like Sharplink Gaming, Bitmine, Immersion Technologies, and Ethermachine are among those making headlines for their ETH purchases. This institutional interest is not just speculative; it reflects a deeper understanding of Ethereum’s technological advancements, its robust ecosystem, and its role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT sectors. Currently, an estimated 17 publicly traded companies collectively hold over 3.6 million ETH, a testament to this evolving landscape. What Does This Shift in ETH Holdings Imply for Ethereum’s Future? The implications of decreasing exchange ETH holdings and increasing institutional adoption are multifaceted and potentially very positive for Ethereum. When more ETH is moved off exchanges and into long-term holding strategies, it reduces the circulating supply available for immediate trading. This can create a supply shock, especially if demand continues to grow. Consider these potential impacts: Price Appreciation: A reduced supply on exchanges, coupled with consistent or rising demand, typically leads to upward price pressure. Market Maturity: Institutional involvement lends credibility and stability to the Ethereum market, attracting more traditional investors and fostering broader acceptance. Decentralization: While centralized exchanges serve a purpose, the movement of ETH into self-custody and staking pools aligns with the ethos of decentralization, making the network more robust. Long-Term Confidence: Companies choosing to hold ETH on their balance sheets demonstrates a strong belief in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition and its role in the future of digital economies. This trend suggests a maturing market where Ethereum is increasingly viewed not just as a speculative asset, but as a foundational technology and a strategic investment. Looking Ahead: The Evolving Landscape of Ethereum The current dynamics surrounding ETH holdings on centralized exchanges are a powerful indicator of changing market sentiment and investor behavior. As institutional players deepen their involvement and individual investors opt for self-custody and staking, the Ethereum ecosystem is likely to become more resilient and less susceptible to short-term market volatility. This ongoing shift underscores the growing confidence in Ethereum’s utility, innovation, and its long-term potential. It’s a fascinating time to observe the cryptocurrency space, with Ethereum at the forefront of this evolution. The movement of assets off exchanges is a clear signal that many believe in Ethereum’s fundamental value, positioning it for what could be an exciting future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean for ETH holdings to fall on centralized exchanges? A: It means that a significant amount of Ethereum is being moved off trading platforms and into private wallets, staking contracts, or institutional treasuries. This often indicates a preference for long-term holding over short-term trading. Q2: Why are publicly traded companies buying ETH? A: Companies are buying ETH for various reasons, including diversifying treasury assets, gaining exposure to the Web3 and DeFi ecosystems, and recognizing Ethereum’s potential as a valuable, programmable asset with long-term growth prospects. Q3: How does this trend impact Ethereum’s price? A: A decrease in exchange ETH holdings typically reduces the immediate selling pressure and available supply. If demand remains strong or increases, this supply squeeze can contribute to upward price momentum. Q4: Is it safer to hold ETH off a centralized exchange? A: Many argue that holding ETH in a self-custody wallet (like a hardware wallet) offers greater security as it removes the risk of exchange hacks or regulatory actions that could affect your assets. However, it also places the full responsibility of security on the individual. Q5: What is the significance of institutional adoption for Ethereum? A: Institutional adoption brings legitimacy, capital, and broader market acceptance to Ethereum. It signals that traditional finance and corporations are increasingly confident in its technology and long-term viability, which can attract more mainstream investors.

51151431,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=798861,1756943917,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51151431.jpeg,Bank of England deputy signals rates likely to stay high,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bank-of-england-signals-rates-to-stay-high/,"The Bank of England (BoE) is set to maintain a tighter grip on interest rates for longer as the battle against inflation rumbles. Price pressures across the economy are proving more enduring than anticipated, Deputy Governor Clare Lombardelli told lawmakers on Wednesday. Her comments indicated that the bank has little room to reduce borrowing costs further without risking another spike in inflation. Lombardelli’s remarks were echoed by Governor Andrew Bailey, who also reiterated that the central bank is not expected to soon follow up with another cut this year. He said financial markets had “got” the bank’s warning that the cuts would now be slower than many had hoped. The warning marks a sharp change of tone from just weeks ago, when the bank cut its base rate to 4.0% in August, at the end of a difficult 5-4 split vote on the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). The cut was intended to bolster business activity amid signs that the economy’s growth and hiring were slowing. But inflation data has since surprised to the upside, which has caused policymakers to snap to attention. Instead of following through on standard quarterly cuts, as investors anticipated earlier this summer, the BoE indicates that rates may not rise from their current level until deep into 2026. The shift underscores the central bank’s predicament: While inflation has plummeted from the double digits in 2022, it remains above the target and shows signs of sticking, especially in sectors like food, energy, and services. Markets adjust to slower cuts Speaking to Parliament’s Treasury Committee, Gov. Bailey claimed his “message has landed” in financial markets. He reiterated that the path for rates remained lower but would be gradual. Bailey has told MPs there is now much greater uncertainty about how far and fast the Bank might go next. Traders have pared expectations for a further cut in 2025. Futures markets already price in the first move in early 2026, probably in April. That is a dramatic change from earlier summer, when bets were in place on at least one more cut this year. Bailey flagged lingering risks around inflation and the labor market. He said the “risk of inflation has gone up,” though he remains more concerned than some colleagues about softening employment trends. Lombardelli doubled down on that cautious view. She warned lawmakers that the current 4% rate could already be near the neutral level, below which inflation could pick up anew from a tighter labor market and other influences. Inflation continues to run well above the bank’s 2% target. It climbed to 3.8% in July, and is projected to surpass 4% in September. Lombardelli cautioned that elevated food and energy prices fueled inflation and influenced consumer views of future price increases. In her written testimony, she said there were signs that the disinflationary process was losing steam, raising the risk of more prolonged inflation. Monetary policy, she said, may not even be significantly restrictive and, in a hint that she might not follow the central bank to further cuts, observed that history suggests the neutral rate could be at the high end of the 2–4% range. Committee splits over next move The MPC remains split. External member Megan Greene, a hawkish voice, supported Lombardelli’s fears over sticky inflation. Dovish rate-setter Alan Taylor, in contrast, cautioned that the bigger risk is recession. And slow adjustments, he said, threaten to create economic weakness that feeds on itself. Taylor also told lawmakers that the current moment is unusually dangerous and cautioned that if recessionary momentum gathers, it could become much more difficult to end, based on history. The bank says there is no change in rates for now, and signals they will be held at 4% until at least the end of the year. And markets, businesses, and households are bracing for a long, higher-interest-rate slog. The debate within the MPC reflects the currents and cross-currents rippling through the economy: cut too early and you risk reigniting inflation; hold back for too long and you could deepen a slowdown.

Whales purchasing ETH and Solana organizing a crucial governance upgrade points to a rotation into early stage projects. MAGACOIN FINANCE is being touted a 30x ROI crypto. As such, it is attracting attention, similar to the major altcoins. Ethereum: Whales Accumulators Increase Holdings Responding to the market correction over the last week, Ether whales took advantage of the drop to $4,200. The amount of Ether in the queue to be staked has surged to its highest level since 2023 as institutional traders and crypto treasury firms aim to scoop rewards for their holdings. Data from Santiment shows that whale addresses holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH rose by 4% in the past week. Moreover, these big investors have accumulated about 260,000 ETH worth $1.14 billion in the past 24 hours. The blockchain has 35.7 million ETH staked, worth approximately $162 billion, and equating to 31% of the total supply, according to Ultrasound.Money. Solana: Ecosystem Upgrade Strengthens Its Case This Week After a two-week governance process in which more than half of validators cast votes, Solana is set to be upgraded using the Alpenglow consensus protocol. According to the results of the governance process released on Tuesday, more than 98% voted yes to approve the new consensus protocol for Solana, with a 52% stake participating. The Alpenglow upgrade is expected to reduce the transaction finality to 150 milliseconds from more than 12 seconds, significantly overhauling the ecosystem. Solana has consistently made higher highs since early August. This has allowed it to consolidate the support at $185 and allowed buyers to aim for the key resistance at $227. At the time of this post, SOL is found at $210. Low-Cap Rising Star Tipped for 30x ROI One of the best new altcoins to buy 2025 is MAGACOIN FINANCE , a low-cap project that analysts believe could deliver up to a 30x ROI crypto return. With its capped supply, verified audits, and zero-tax trading model, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as more than just a speculative play. Growing evidence of crypto whales buying MAGACOIN FINANCE suggests early institutional-style positioning before its first listings. For investors who missed earlier breakouts like Solana or Avalanche, MAGACOIN offers a sub-$0.01 entry that could prove pivotal in the next altcoin cycle. Final Thoughts: Altcoin Rotation in 2025 Ethereum’s whale accumulation and Solana’s Alpenglow upgrade make them clear candidates for the best crypto to buy this week . But what sets this market apart is the increasing rotation into low-cap gems with potential . MAGACOIN FINANCE, backed by strong audits and community momentum, represents that rising star narrative — the kind of early-stage play tipped for exponential growth. With both established blue-chips and breakout projects showing strength, this week offers investors multiple avenues for exposure.

51151277,https://timestabloid.com/?p=81452,1756944005,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Top Crypto Trends to Watch Closely in September 2025,https://timestabloid.com/top-crypto-trends-to-watch-closely-in-september-2025/,"September 2025 is here, and the crypto market is once again entering a period of shifting momentum. Bitcoin, which had been the star of the first half of the year, is now facing a cooling phase. After slipping below the $110,000 threshold, many traders are bracing for what has historically been a difficult month. This slowdown has prompted retail investors to diversify into new opportunities, with some experts pointing toward projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE as potential long-term winners in a market where fresh narratives are gaining traction. The Shifting Market for Major Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin has entered a rough patch, with September often referred to as “Red September” due to its track record of negative monthly returns. Analysts remain divided: some believe history will repeat itself, while others argue that BTC could defy expectations and mount a rebound if ETF inflows stabilize. Ethereum, on the other hand, has shown more resilience. Its Proof-of-Stake framework continues to attract institutional attention, particularly through spot ETFs that are still drawing significant inflows. At the same time, altcoins like XRP, Polkadot, and Cardano are seeing renewed interest, with Grayscale’s latest filings for single-asset ETFs suggesting that institutional players are widening their scope beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Real-World Assets Take Center Stage One of the fastest-growing areas in crypto is the tokenization of real-world assets ( RWA ). This concept allows physical and intangible assets – such as property, art, and intellectual rights – to be transformed into digital tokens. By doing so, liquidity improves, barriers to entry lower, and investors gain access to markets that were once out of reach. With regulatory clarity improving in multiple regions, RWA projects are expected to be among the strongest drivers of adoption in the coming months. New Crypto Projects While institutional capital flows into majors remain significant, retail investors are increasingly eyeing new projects for exponential returns. MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the most talked-about names in 2025, with analysts noting its potential for massive ROI—some projections estimate gains as high as 7,800% for early participants. Limited access in the presale and accelerating demand have created strong FOMO, echoing the early days of meme coins like Shiba Inu but with a more utility-driven ecosystem. For many investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the type of early-stage entry that could define the next bull market’s breakout success. AI Meets Blockchain The overlap between artificial intelligence and crypto is accelerating. From AI-powered smart contracts to decentralized AI platforms (deAI), this convergence is creating entirely new market sectors. These innovations are not only reshaping automated trading and data analysis but also raising the bar for decentralized apps and governance. Investors are closely following this narrative, as it could unlock some of the most explosive growth opportunities of the next cycle. Meme Coins and Community Strength Meme coins remain as unpredictable as ever, yet their influence on the market is undeniable. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu continue to hold their positions, while new entrants like Pepenode and Snorter are experimenting with novel models. Whether it’s gamified mining or AI-assisted trading, meme coins show that community demand, combined with utility, can keep this sector alive even when fundamentals suggest otherwise. Layer-2 Solutions Drive Adoption Scalability remains a pressing issue for blockchain. Layer-2 solutions are stepping up, particularly those built on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Faster transactions and reduced fees are essential for long-term adoption, and advancements in these networks are critical for DeFi, payments, and gaming applications. Bitcoin Layer-2 protocols are especially notable, aiming to deliver Ethereum-like speed without compromising BTC’s security and decentralization. Conclusion September 2025 highlights the balance between old market patterns and fresh innovation. While Bitcoin battles seasonal headwinds, the rise of tokenized assets, AI integration, and scalability upgrades are creating new opportunities. Projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are gaining momentum as investors search for the next big growth story. As the month unfolds, staying ahead of these trends could make the difference between missing out and capturing early upside in the evolving crypto landscape.

51153572,573295,1756944029,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51153572.jpeg,"No US Bitcoin Reserve Without Japan, Bitwise Exec Argues",https://bitcoinist.com/no-us-bitcoin-reserve-without-japan-bitwise-exec/,"In a CoinStories interview with Nathalie Brunell, Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, argued that US sovereign Bitcoin holdings are a matter of “when,” not “if”—but only via a deliberate, legislated process and likely in concert with key allies. Park stated plainly: “It will be inevitable that governments will buy Bitcoin on their balance sheet. This is something I feel very strongly,” adding that advocates should “be patient” because it is “not likely a rogue decision.” He drew a firm distinction between an executive action and a durable national policy: “There’s a difference between an executive order mandate to buy Bitcoin as a strategic asset versus a congressional mandate,” he said. Executive orders are “volatile” and “can be turned by the next administration,” whereas a legislated strategic reserve “embed[s] the mandate of the people.” Why The US Bitcoin Reserve May Hinge On Japan Crucially, Park framed the US Bitcoin reserve as an allied, not unilateral, project. The United States, he said, operates within an economic “social contract” with partners such as Japan. A surprise US pivot into BTC would risk trust: “It would be a slight betrayal of that social contract if you were to stuff, let’s say, Japan with all your long-dated Treasury bonds and then didn’t give them a heads up and just bought Bitcoin on your own.” As a practical indicator, he flagged Tokyo: “I think Japan is the one you should be paying attention to… Once you start seeing Japan embrace Bitcoin then I do think we’re ready for that dialogue to happen at the country levels.”Park also cautioned that sovereign BTC seen today mostly reflects legal seizures rather than market accumulation. “Most of the core treasury holdings of sovereigns have so far come from seizures or forfeitures,” he said, citing the US and China. He dismissed coercive domestic takings as inconsistent with US norms: using eminent domain against a compliant private entity would cross a line “the US generally is not on that side of history for.” Open-market accumulation at scale, meanwhile, would be price-disruptive. Instead, he pointed to a more American pathway through market structures and public-private alignment: “If you think about the construct of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac… you could still have a private entity that is able to extend credit for the American people,” suggesting that “Bitcoin treasury companies can be… private, yes, but aligned with kind of the national mission.” Park’s monetary rationale threads these points together. Post-2008 policy has elevated “abundant reserves” and technocratic rate-setting, making scarce collateral strategically valuable. Within that context, he said, “Bitcoin is the scarcest, hardest asset known to man and it is the social covenant that I think will supersede the dollar as we’ve known it in a way that hopefully in the future will be synergistic for both American exceptionalism.” Park’s conclusion is exacting rather than speculative: governments buying Bitcoin is “inevitable,” but a US move requires congressional authorization, signaling and coordination with allies—particularly Japan—and institutional mechanisms capable of execution at size without violating core property-rights norms. At press time, BTC traded at $111,103.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|ASIA|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-04 00:00:29

In 2017 it was Ethereum. In 2021 it was Solana. By 2023, meme tokens like SHIB and PEPE stole the spotlight with cultural force. Now, heading into 2025, investors are once again asking the question: which assets will define the next bull run? Analysts say Solana and Avalanche remain top contenders among established Layer-1s. But for those chasing truly asymmetric returns, a different name is dominating presale discussions, MAGACOIN FINANCE, which forecasts suggest could deliver up to 70x upside if momentum holds. Solana: from comeback to ETF buzz Solana has endured one of the wildest journeys of any Layer-1. After suffering major outages in 2021 and 2022, many dismissed it as unreliable. Yet in 2025, Solana has staged a full comeback. With upgrades to stability and throughput, it now processes tens of millions of transactions per day, cementing itself as the fastest high-cap blockchain. Institutional attention is following. Analysts say the prospect of a Solana ETF is real, with asset managers actively engaging regulators. If approved, it could unlock billions in inflows and propel SOL toward new highs. Price targets range from $500–$700 by 2026. For investors, that represents strong growth, but it’s also evidence of Solana’s maturity: the higher it climbs, the harder it is to multiply capital exponentially. Avalanche (AVAX): subnet strength Avalanche carved out its niche with its subnet architecture , customizable blockchains running under a shared security umbrella. This innovation has made it a favorite among developers launching gaming, DeFi, and institutional pilots. AVAX has maintained steady liquidity and remains one of the most active ecosystems outside Ethereum and Solana. Trading near $24 , analysts forecast Avalanche could reach $125-150 in the next cycle. That’s a potential 5-6x gain, attractive for conservative investors. Still, like Solana, Avalanche now resembles a blue-chip: credible, liquid, but not primed for 50x explosions. Where MAGACOIN FINANCE breaks the mold While Solana and Avalanche compete for institutional inflows, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing the imagination of retail investors hungry for transformative upside. Its presale has become one of 2025’s fastest-selling launches, attracting thousands of small buyers alongside early whale wallets. The draw isn’t just hype, it’s design. Analysts describe MAGACOIN FINANCE as a cultural ignition token : Visibility first: built for virality across social platforms, it thrives on memes and identity, not technical complexity. Legitimacy second: completed audits by HashEx and CertiK distinguish it from meme projects that launch without credibility. Scarcity third: capped token supply ensures every round sold out increases demand pressure. This combination is why forecasts project up to 70x ROI . MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned at the perfect intersection of affordability, cultural resonance, and early positioning. Unlike SOL or AVAX, which trade at tens or hundreds of dollars per token, MAGACOIN FINANCE allows retail to build massive stacks at low cost. That psychological appeal, owning millions of units early, has historically powered the largest meme-driven rallies. Complementary roles That doesn’t mean Solana or Avalanche should be ignored. Both are credible, high-performance networks that anchor portfolios with long-term growth. Solana may secure ETF approval, while Avalanche continues to build enterprise relevance. Together, they provide steady appreciation. But for the investors seeking exponential multiples, MAGACOIN FINANCE fills the role Solana once played in 2021: the underdog turned cultural giant. Conclusion Solana has reclaimed its spot as a top Layer-1 contender, with ETF speculation driving price targets toward $700. Avalanche’s subnets continue to attract developers, with AVAX projected to hit $200. Both will likely reward long-term holders. But when it comes to sheer profit potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE , with forecasts of 70x ROI, is increasingly seen as the breakout story. For retail investors, the choice is clear: anchor with blue-chips, but don’t miss the cultural ignition point where exponential upside still lives.

Analyst Gives Answers,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/binance-manipulating-xrp-price/,"In a recent post on X, crypto analyst Pumpius argued that the recent drop in XRP’s price is not natural but the result of deliberate actions by Binance. According to him, the exchange wants to protect its position because the digital currency poses a threat to the system it has built over the years. He says the exchange is doing more than just selling tokens; it is working to hold XRP back. Binance Accused Of Coordinating XRP Price Suppression Pumpius says Binance is not only selling XRP but is also actively manipulating the market around it. He points to sudden drops in liquidity, heavy waves of sell pressure, and red flashes on charts that appear whenever there’s an announcement of positive Ripple news. He claims this is not a coincidence but evidence of coordination and a strategy to keep XRP from breaking out. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Set For Explosive Rally If This Structure Holds The analyst stresses that the real reason Binance targets XRP is that it is different. XRP is not a meme or speculative bet but a payment infrastructure. Pumpius argues it could replace the liquidity pools that Binance has used for years, and if that happens, the exchange’s market-making business could crumble. He also warns that it is not only Binance that is involved. According to him, powerful investors, legacy financial players, and offshore networks all see XRP as a threat. He says that because XRP runs on transparent rails, it could expose money flows they prefer to keep hidden. Therefore, price suppression becomes their primary tool to slow down the process. Why Suppression Could Backfire As XRP Price Fundamentals Strengthen Despite these heavy claims, Pumpius argues that the pressure on XRP may backfire. The crypto expert points to Ripple and its ecosystem, noting that the fundamentals are strengthening every day. New payment corridors are opening in Japan and the UAE. Projects such as DNA Protocol are using the XRP Ledger to anchor IDs and even genetic data. Related Reading: Crypto Adviser For The Ultra Wealthy Tells XRP Investors What To Do As Coins Turn To Real Money Pumpius believes this shows the suppression is artificial. The fundamentals are exploding, he says, while the adverse price action comes from deliberate dumping. He adds that every time Binance sells, more XRP moves into self-custody wallets. Instead of weakening the community, this decentralizes the asset even more. Holders are preparing for the day when real utility drives demand at a scale far beyond speculation. In his view, when that switch flips, Binance’s paper games will be meaningless compared to trillion-dollar settlement flows. He warns that the exchange may think it is winning now, but it’s only exposing the truth about the digital currency. XRP, he says, is not just a trader’s coin. It is the backbone of a new financial order. And according to him, no amount of dumping can stop already living rails.

Their remarks came during a recent episode of the Paul Barron Network podcast, which featured media commentator Zach Rector. Rector highlighted that XRP’s market has displayed unusually high liquidity multipliers, meaning relatively small inflows of capital have historically triggered disproportionately large increases in market capitalization. Using data from Coinglass, he noted that during XRP’s November rally, inflows measured in the tens of millions of dollars coincided with market cap expansions in the tens of billions. Over a 30-day sample, multipliers were observed at ratios ranging from 50-to-1 up to nearly 900-to-1. Based on this pattern, Rector argued that XRP does not necessarily require trillions in new investment to reach $100 per token . Instead, cumulative inflows between $100 billion and $300 billion could be sufficient to drive the asset toward that level. This runs counter to the argument that a $6 trillion market capitalization, implied by $100 XRP given its current circulating supply, makes such a target unattainable. Role of Exchange-Traded Funds The question then turns to where such inflows might originate. Rector pointed to potential exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on XRP as a key driver of demand. He argued that first-year inflows could range from $10 to $20 billion, significantly above JPMorgan’s more conservative estimate of $4 to $8 billion. Other industry leaders share similar optimism. Canary Capital’s CEO, Steven McClurg, recently suggested that up to $5 billion could be invested within the first month of an XRP ETF launch. Rector therefore sees a realistic base case of $20 to $30 for XRP by 2026, with much higher valuations possible if ETF adoption scales over time. Podcast host Paul Barron emphasized that ETFs are only one part of a broader picture. He outlined other developments that could act as price catalysts, including potential U.S. legislation on digital asset market structure and Ripple’s ongoing efforts to secure a banking license . According to Barron, the convergence of these factors could create conditions for XRP to move not only beyond $50 but also approach $100. Even after corrections, he suggested that XRP could hold a higher long-term support range, potentially between $30 and $40. Retirement Funds and Institutional Entry Rector further underscored the role of institutional investors, citing commentary from financial advisor Ric Edelman, who has shifted from a cautious stance to recommending portfolio allocations of 10% to 40% in digital assets. Rector estimated that retirement accounts such as 401(k)s could eventually release between $8 and $12 trillion into crypto markets. If even a fraction of this allocation materialized, XRP could be one of the primary assets to benefit. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 To illustrate his conviction, Rector disclosed that more than 90% of his personal holdings are in XRP. He characterized the asset as a long-term reserve rather than a speculative trade. At the same time, he cautioned that price volatility will remain significant. Gains, he said, can be quickly followed by sharp corrections, and investors should prepare for large swings even in a generally upward trend.

According to the update, the ten largest wallets together account for 62.3% of the total SHIB supply, a share notably higher than that of many other leading Ethereum-based assets. Here are the percentages of supply held by the top 10 largest addresses for ETH-based assets: $SHIB : 62.3% $UNI : 52.2% $ETH : 51.0% $USDT : 40.5% $PEPE : 39.4% $LINK : 31.5% $DAI : 31.0% $USDC : 28.6% Track whale changes here: https://t.co/m99pJbV2cp pic.twitter.com/3vVkx8BYhT — Santiment (@santimentfeed) September 2, 2025 Breakdown of the Largest SHIB Holders Public data from Etherscan provides further detail on these top addresses. The largest single holder is Shiba Inu’s official burn wallet, created when Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin sent over 410 trillion SHIB to the address in 2021. That wallet now contains approximately 410.43 trillion tokens, permanently removing them from circulation. The second-largest address remains unidentified and is believed to be tied to a smart contract or decentralized exchange protocol. It currently stores about 53.37 trillion SHIB, equivalent to more than 5% of the total supply. Several major exchanges also appear among the largest holders of Shiba Inu, with wallets linked to Robinhood , Binance, and Crypto.com collectively managing over 119 trillion SHIB. Robinhood holds around 39.27 trillion tokens (3.92%), while Binance’s Hot Wallet 20 and Binance 28 accounts contain 30.71 trillion (3.07%) and 19.51 trillion (1.95%) tokens, respectively. Meanwhile, Crypto.com controls approximately 29.83 trillion SHIB, representing 2.98% of the total supply. Another unlabelled address, identified on Etherscan as 0xa70…71FA9, is the seventh-largest holder with around 12.04 trillion SHIB (1.2%). The eighth and ninth positions also belong to exchange wallets. Robinhood manages an additional 11.41 trillion SHIB (1.14%), while another Binance account contains 9.04 trillion SHIB (0.9%). The tenth-largest address, whose ownership is unverified but may also be exchange-related, carries 7.65 trillion tokens, or 0.76% of supply. Comparisons with Ethereum and Uniswap Santiment’s report also examined ownership concentration across other major tokens. The top 10 Ethereum wallets control roughly 51% of ETH’s supply, while the leading Uniswap addresses collectively hold about 52.2% of UNI tokens. By contrast, Shiba Inu’s 62.3% concentration among its ten largest wallets represents a higher level of centralization than either Ethereum or Uniswap. Implications of Concentrated Holdings While such a concentration might raise concerns about the potential for price volatility if large holders decide to sell, context is important. The single largest address is the burn wallet, which will never release tokens back into circulation. Additionally, many of the remaining top holders are centralized exchanges that custody SHIB on behalf of thousands of retail traders, rather than individual “whales.” This reduces the likelihood of a sudden mass liquidation event, though the degree of centralization still highlights Shiba Inu’s dependence on a small number of wallets compared to other assets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The latest Santiment data underscores the dominance of the top 10 Shiba Inu addresses, which together hold more than 623 trillion SHIB out of the asset’s initial supply of one quadrillion. Although this concentration places SHIB above Ethereum and Uniswap in terms of top-holder share, the inclusion of a burn wallet and exchange custodians in the list provides some reassurance that the risks of abrupt, large-scale selling are limited.

The latest data from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers a fascinating glimpse, revealing a significant shift. This crucial barometer of market sentiment has just fallen four points, moving from “Greed” to a more balanced “Neutral” territory. This shift, reported by data provider Alternative, signals a noticeable cooling in investor enthusiasm and a potential period of re-evaluation for the market. What Does a Neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index Signal? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index operates on a straightforward scale, where 0 indicates ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 signifies ‘Extreme Greed.’ A reading of 51, as we’ve seen, places it precisely in the middle: ‘Neutral.’ This means the market is currently experiencing a balance between the two extremes. Historically, extreme fear often presents buying opportunities when assets are undervalued due to panic selling. Conversely, extreme greed can signal an overheated market, potentially preceding a correction as assets become overvalued. The current neutral stance suggests neither overwhelming optimism nor widespread panic. Instead, investors appear to be taking a more cautious, wait-and-see approach. This phase can be characterized by reduced volatility and a focus on fundamentals rather than speculative fervor. Understanding this shift is vital for making informed decisions. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? To truly appreciate the insights offered by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , it’s important to understand its sophisticated methodology. This index isn’t based on a single metric but aggregates data from six key factors, each contributing a specific weight to the final score. This comprehensive approach ensures a holistic view of market sentiment. Here’s a breakdown of the components that contribute to the index’s daily calculation: Volatility (25%): This measures current Bitcoin price fluctuations and maximum drawdowns, comparing them to average values over 30 and 90 days. High volatility often signals fear and uncertainty. Trading Volume (25%): Analyzes current market momentum and liquidity. High buying volume in a rising market might indicate greed, while low volume can suggest fear. Social Media Mentions (15%): Scans specific crypto-related hashtags and sentiment on platforms like Twitter. Increased positive sentiment often suggests greed, while negative sentiment points to fear. Surveys (15%): Although currently paused, these polls previously gauged investor sentiment directly, providing a snapshot of public opinion. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increase in Bitcoin’s market cap share often signals fear, as investors might be moving from altcoins to the perceived safety of Bitcoin. A decrease suggests more speculative altcoin interest (greed). Google Search Volume (10%): Tracks search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Sudden spikes in searches for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” could indicate fear, while “how to buy crypto” might suggest rising interest (greed). Navigating the Neutral Zone: Strategic Insights for Investors The current neutral reading of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a unique environment for investors. It’s a time when emotional extremes are less dominant, potentially leading to more rational market behavior. This period offers distinct opportunities for those willing to adapt their strategies. Consider these strategic insights: Reduced Emotional Trading: Neutral sentiment often correlates with less impulsive decision-making, encouraging more rational analysis of market conditions. Consolidation Periods: Markets in a neutral state frequently undergo periods of price consolidation, where assets trade within a defined range. This can be an opportune time for dollar-cost averaging or re-evaluating portfolio allocations. Opportunity for Due Diligence: Without the overwhelming pressure of extreme fear or greed, investors have a clearer headspace to research projects thoroughly, assess their underlying fundamentals, and refine long-term strategies. Vigilance is Key: While neutral, the market can quickly swing. Staying informed about broader macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, and project-specific developments remains crucial for anticipating future shifts. Why This Crucial Index Matters for Your Crypto Journey The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as more than just a daily snapshot; it’s a powerful tool for understanding the underlying psychology driving market movements. By offering a quantitative measure of sentiment, it helps investors gain invaluable perspective and avoid common pitfalls. It highlights the cyclical nature of crypto markets, which often oscillate between periods of intense optimism and profound pessimism. Recognizing these shifts can empower individuals to make more informed, less emotionally driven decisions, potentially avoiding the classic mistake of buying high and selling low. Ultimately, this index encourages a disciplined approach, reminding us that even in a volatile asset class like cryptocurrency, understanding human behavior is paramount to long-term success. The recent shift of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to ‘Neutral’ territory marks a significant moment for crypto investors. It signals a temporary reprieve from the extremes of market emotion, offering a period of relative calm and reflection. While this neutrality doesn’t predict future price movements with certainty, it provides a valuable lens through which to view market psychology and refine investment strategies. Staying informed, rational, and disciplined remains the best approach in this dynamic and ever-evolving landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A: It’s a tool that measures the current sentiment of the cryptocurrency market, ranging from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed), based on various market factors. Q2: How does a “Neutral” reading impact my crypto investments? A: A neutral reading suggests a balanced market without extreme emotional bias. It encourages rational decision-making, due diligence, and can be a period of market consolidation rather than sharp price swings. Q3: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a reliable predictor of price? A: While it reflects market sentiment, it’s not a direct price predictor. It’s a valuable indicator to understand investor psychology, which can influence market trends, but it should be used in conjunction with other analyses. Q4: What factors contribute to the index’s calculation? A: It’s calculated using volatility, trading volume, social media mentions, surveys (historically), Bitcoin dominance, and Google search volume, each with a specific weighting.

This innovative process allows traditional company shares to be represented as digital tokens on a blockchain. Leading this charge is Moonshot, a robust token issuance platform built on the high-performance Solana (SOL) blockchain. They have just launched a groundbreaking service that could fundamentally change how global investors access and trade company stocks. What Exactly is Stock Tokenization, and How Does Moonshot Facilitate It? Simply put, stock tokenization is the conversion of real-world company shares into blockchain-based digital tokens. Each token represents a fractional or full ownership stake in a traditional stock. Imagine owning a piece of a company like Nvidia, Coinbase, or Tesla, but with the added benefits of blockchain technology. Moonshot’s new service makes this possible by: Digitizing Assets: Converting traditional stock shares into digital tokens on the Solana blockchain. Enhanced Accessibility: Providing a platform for users to manage and trade these tokenized assets. Real-World Examples: Initially supporting popular stocks such as Nvidia, Coinbase, and Tesla, giving investors direct access to these prominent companies in a new format. Currently, this service is available in select countries, specifically excluding the United States, due to varying regulatory landscapes. However, its global potential is immense. Why is Moonshot’s Stock Tokenization Service a Game-Changer for Investors? The introduction of stock tokenization through Moonshot offers several compelling advantages that could democratize investment and create new opportunities for investors worldwide. Fractional Ownership: Investors can purchase small fractions of high-value stocks, making expensive shares more accessible to a broader audience. This lowers the entry barrier significantly. 24/7 Trading: Unlike traditional markets with fixed hours, tokenized stocks can potentially be traded around the clock, offering greater flexibility and liquidity. Increased Liquidity: The ability to trade smaller fractions and operate on a 24/7 basis can lead to higher liquidity in the market for these assets. Global Reach: While initial availability is restricted, the underlying blockchain technology inherently supports cross-border transactions, paving the way for a truly global investment landscape. These benefits highlight how Moonshot is not just digitizing stocks but enhancing the entire investment experience. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities in Stock Tokenization While the promise of stock tokenization is vast, it also presents unique challenges, primarily in the regulatory domain. The financial sector is heavily regulated, and integrating blockchain technology with traditional assets requires careful navigation of existing laws and the development of new frameworks. Moonshot, by launching in specific countries and excluding the US, demonstrates an understanding of these complexities. As the technology matures and regulatory clarity emerges globally, we can expect broader adoption. The opportunity lies in creating more efficient, transparent, and accessible financial markets. This innovative approach could redefine how we perceive and interact with traditional investments, blending the best of both worlds: the stability of established companies and the efficiency of blockchain. In conclusion, Moonshot’s launch of its stock tokenization service on Solana marks a significant milestone in the convergence of traditional finance and decentralized technology. By offering a new way to invest in leading companies like Nvidia, Coinbase, and Tesla, Moonshot is not just providing a service; it’s helping to shape the future of global investment, making it more accessible, liquid, and innovative for investors around the world.

The Bank of England stablecoin policy is undergoing a pivotal shift, poised to reshape how these crucial digital assets operate. This move isn’t just a technical adjustment; it’s a strategic decision that could bolster trust and drive innovation within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. What’s Changing with Bank of England Stablecoin Rules? Bank of England Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden recently made an announcement that has caught the attention of regulators and crypto enthusiasts alike. The central bank is set to relax its existing regulatory framework for stablecoins. This relaxation means a crucial change for issuers: they will now be permitted to hold some of their backing assets in short-term government bonds. Breeden explained that the framework, initially published by the bank in 2023, was not entirely suitable for the evolving needs of stablecoin issuers. This acknowledgment highlights the central bank’s adaptability in a rapidly changing financial landscape. The initial vision for stablecoins primarily focused on retail applications, but their utility has expanded significantly. Today, stablecoins are increasingly seen as foundational for settling tokenized securities and other institutional applications. This shift in purpose necessitates a more flexible and robust regulatory approach. The decision by the Bank of England stablecoin policy team reflects a proactive stance to accommodate this evolution, aiming to integrate digital assets more seamlessly into traditional finance. Why is This a Game-Changer for Stablecoins and Digital Finance? This policy adjustment carries substantial benefits for the stablecoin market. Allowing issuers to back their stablecoins with short-term government bonds can significantly enhance their stability and trustworthiness. Government bonds are generally considered low-risk assets, providing a strong foundation for the value of stablecoins. Increased Trust: Backing with government bonds can instill greater confidence among users and institutions, knowing their digital assets are anchored to highly secure traditional instruments. Enhanced Stability: This move helps mitigate risks associated with more volatile backing assets, making stablecoins more resilient to market fluctuations. Broader Adoption: With enhanced trust and stability, institutional players, including traditional financial firms, may be more inclined to adopt stablecoins for various transactions, including cross-border payments and tokenized asset settlement. Regulatory Clarity: Providing clear guidelines on acceptable backing assets offers much-needed regulatory clarity, which is vital for the growth and legitimacy of the digital asset sector. This development positions the UK as a forward-thinking jurisdiction in digital finance. It acknowledges the potential of stablecoins beyond simple retail payments, particularly in the burgeoning field of tokenized securities. Navigating the Future: Potential Impact of Bank of England Stablecoin Policy The implications of this new policy extend far beyond just stablecoin issuers. It signals a broader acceptance of digital assets within the traditional financial system. While the move is largely positive, it also presents new challenges and opportunities. Implementing these changes effectively will require careful coordination between regulators, stablecoin issuers, and market participants. Ensuring robust oversight while fostering innovation will be a delicate balance. However, the proactive approach by the Bank of England stablecoin framework suggests a commitment to finding this equilibrium. This policy could also influence other central banks globally. As jurisdictions compete to become leaders in digital finance, the UK’s pragmatic approach might serve as a model. The shift from retail-focused stablecoins to those used for settling tokenized securities highlights a maturing market perspective, where digital assets are integrated into complex financial operations. What Does This Mean for the UK’s Digital Asset Landscape? For the UK, this regulatory relaxation reinforces its ambition to be a global hub for financial innovation. By creating a more accommodating environment for stablecoin operations, the country can attract talent, investment, and cutting-edge projects in the digital asset space. This isn’t just about stablecoins; it’s about the broader infrastructure for future financial markets. Actionable insights for market participants include closely monitoring the detailed implementation guidelines. Stablecoin projects looking to operate in the UK will find a clearer path to compliance, potentially accelerating their market entry and expansion. This environment encourages innovation while maintaining essential safeguards. The long-term vision suggests a financial system where traditional assets and digital assets coexist and interact seamlessly. The Bank of England stablecoin decision is a significant step towards realizing that vision, paving the way for more efficient, transparent, and resilient financial markets. In conclusion, the Bank of England’s decision to permit stablecoin issuers to hold short-term government bonds as backing assets is a monumental step forward for digital finance. It addresses the evolving landscape of stablecoin utility, fosters greater trust and stability, and solidifies the UK’s position as a leader in cryptocurrency regulation. This forward-thinking approach is set to unlock new opportunities for innovation and integration within the global financial system. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a stablecoin? A1: A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar or a commodity like gold. This stability is usually achieved by backing the stablecoin with reserves. Q2: Why is the Bank of England changing its stablecoin regulations? A2: The Bank of England recognized that its 2023 framework was not ideal for current stablecoin uses, which have shifted from primarily retail applications to settling tokenized securities. Relaxing the rules aims to foster greater stability and facilitate institutional adoption. Q3: What are the benefits of stablecoins being backed by short-term government bonds? A3: Backing stablecoins with short-term government bonds increases their trustworthiness and stability, as these bonds are considered low-risk assets. This can lead to broader institutional adoption and greater confidence in the digital asset market. Q4: How does this impact the UK’s position in digital finance? A4: This move strengthens the UK’s ambition to be a global hub for financial innovation by providing a clearer, more accommodating regulatory environment for stablecoins. It signals a proactive approach to integrating digital assets into the mainstream financial system. Q5: Will all stablecoins be required to hold government bonds? A5: The new policy permits issuers to hold some of their backing assets in short-term government bonds. It does not necessarily mandate that all stablecoins must be exclusively backed this way, but it offers a new, highly credible option for reserve management.

Investors and enthusiasts are keenly observing the Altcoin Season Index , which has seen a notable climb. This index offers a crucial barometer for understanding whether the broader market favors Bitcoin or the myriad of alternative cryptocurrencies, known as altcoins. Recently, the Altcoin Season Index, as reported by CoinMarketCap, jumped seven points in a single day, reaching a score of 56. This significant movement has sparked conversations across the crypto community about what this could mean for portfolios and future market trends. Understanding this index is key to navigating the dynamic world of digital assets. What Does the Rising Altcoin Season Index Signal? The Altcoin Season Index is more than just a number; it’s a powerful indicator of market sentiment and performance. When this index rises, it suggests that a growing number of altcoins are starting to outperform Bitcoin. Specifically, an ‘altcoin season’ is officially declared when 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies – excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins – demonstrate superior performance compared to Bitcoin over a 90-day period. A score closer to 100 indicates a strong altcoin season, while a lower score points towards a ‘Bitcoin season,’ where Bitcoin dominates market gains. The recent increase to 56 means we are moving closer to that 75% threshold, indicating that altcoins are gaining momentum against Bitcoin. This shift can present both opportunities and challenges for investors. Why Are Altcoins Gaining Traction? Several factors can contribute to a rising Altcoin Season Index. These often include: Innovation and Development: Many altcoins are tied to groundbreaking technologies and new use cases, attracting investor interest. Lower Market Cap Potential: Smaller altcoins can offer higher percentage gains compared to Bitcoin, drawing in speculative capital. Sector Rotation: Investors might rotate profits from Bitcoin into altcoins, seeking higher returns once Bitcoin has made significant moves. Broader Market Sentiment: A general bullish sentiment in the crypto market can lift all boats, with altcoins often experiencing more volatile swings. The current climb of the Altcoin Season Index suggests that one or more of these drivers are actively influencing market behavior. It’s a sign that the market is becoming more diversified in its gains, moving beyond just Bitcoin’s dominance. Navigating an Evolving Altcoin Season Index For investors, understanding the Altcoin Season Index can be a valuable tool. When the index is rising, it often prompts a re-evaluation of portfolio strategies. Here are some actionable insights: Research is Key: Focus on altcoins with strong fundamentals, active development teams, and clear use cases. Diversification: While tempting to chase high-flying altcoins, maintaining a diversified portfolio remains crucial to manage risk. Risk Management: Altcoins can be highly volatile. Setting stop-loss orders and not investing more than you can afford to lose are essential practices. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, project updates, and broader economic indicators that might influence crypto prices. A score of 56 is significant, but it’s important to remember that it’s not yet a full-blown altcoin season. The market remains dynamic, and conditions can change rapidly. This is a time for cautious optimism and strategic planning. What’s Next for the Altcoin Season Index? The recent seven-point jump in the Altcoin Season Index indicates a positive trend for altcoins, but the journey to a full altcoin season (75 or higher) is still ongoing. This period can be exciting for investors who are well-researched and prepared to act. It underscores the importance of staying updated on market indicators and understanding the nuances of cryptocurrency cycles. The crypto market is a continuous cycle of innovation and adaptation. The current movement of the Altcoin Season Index highlights the growing maturity and diversification of the digital asset space, offering more opportunities beyond just Bitcoin. By staying informed and strategic, investors can better position themselves to potentially benefit from these evolving market dynamics. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric that tracks whether altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) are outperforming Bitcoin. An altcoin season is typically declared when 75% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? It’s calculated by analyzing the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. The percentage of these altcoins that have outperformed Bitcoin determines the index score. What does an Altcoin Season Index of 56 mean? An index of 56 means that 56% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. While not yet a full altcoin season (which requires 75%), it indicates a significant shift towards altcoin outperformance. How can investors prepare for an altcoin season? Investors can prepare by researching promising altcoin projects, diversifying their portfolios, implementing risk management strategies like stop-loss orders, and staying informed about market trends and project developments. Is a high Altcoin Season Index always a good thing? While a high index can signal opportunities for significant gains in altcoins, it also often comes with increased volatility and risk. It’s crucial for investors to conduct thorough due diligence and manage their risk exposure. Did you find this article insightful?

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin is stuck in a holding pattern near $112,000, according to CoinDesk market data , but the bigger story onchain might be the divide emerging between how investors treat BTC and ETH heading into September. BTC is acting more like a macro hedge, while ETH is being positioned as the real vehicle for upside. That split reflects a mix of policy uncertainty and shifting trader flows. In a recent note, QCP Capital wrote that doubts about the Fed’s independence are keeping term premiums elevated, a setup that weakens the dollar and supports hedges like BTC and gold. But options desks and prediction markets show momentum gathering in ETH instead, where traders see the most potential for a breakout. Flowdesk reported muted implied volatility in BTC despite pullbacks, suggesting positioning rather than speculative bets. Skew remains negative, meaning puts are expensive, but that creates relative value in call structures. ETH risk reversals, meanwhile, have recovered from their recent selloff, indicating renewed demand for upside exposure. SOL options also saw increased activity, with flows skewed to the upside on growing sentiment around its ecosystem and corporate Digital Asset Treasury initiatives. Spot activity rotated into ETH beta names like AAVE and AERO, as well as SOL betas like RAY and DRIFT, showing breadth widening beyond majors. Prediction markets back this rotation theme. Polymarket sentiment reinforces the rotation. Traders expect BTC to stay capped near $120k, while ETH is given a strong chance of breaking $5,000 — a view consistent with its 20% monthly rally and recovering risk reversals. Traders are increasingly treating BTC as a steady macro hedge, while ETH is emerging as the market’s high-conviction upside play into September. Europe-based market maker Flowdesk wrote in a recent Telegram update that activity on the desk remains high, with clients broadly positioned for upside even as macro risks linger and seasonal volatility tends to pick up. The macro backdrop sets the hedge case, trading flows show how positioning is shifting, and prediction markets validate it with real-money bets. Together, they sketch a market where BTC anchors as a governance and inflation hedge, ETH leads on performance, and SOL builds momentum as breadth improves. Market Movements BTC : Bitcoin remains in a consolidation phase around the $110K–112K range, marked by waning short‑term volatility. ETH: ETH is trading near $4400. Its rally is being fuelled by surging institutional interest, especially via ETF inflows, and anticipation surrounding the upcoming Fusaka network upgrade. Price action is supported by strong structural demand as ETH continues to solidify its role in DeFi and smart contracts. Gold: Gold is trading around record highs propelled by expectations of an imminent Federal Reserve rate cut (markets now price in about a 92% chance), weakening confidence in Fed independence, and increased demand from ETFs and central banks acting as conviction buyers. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific stocks climbed Thursday, led by a 0.57% gain in Japan’s Nikkei 225, as Wall Street’s tech rally lifted sentiment despite lingering economic worries. S&P 500: U.S. stocks rose Wednesday as Alphabet gained after avoiding a breakup in an antitrust ruling and investors boosted September Fed rate-cut bets despite fresh labor market concerns.

51154519,https://invezz.com/?p=2860688,1756947600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Is the Trump memecoin hype over or is it just starting?,https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/04/is-the-trump-memecoin-hype-over-or-is-it-just-starting/,"Few tokens have captured attention in 2025 like Official Trump (TRUMP). What started as a politically flavored meme coin quickly exploded into one of the year’s most talked-about assets, delivering staggering early gains before retracing sharply. The hype around TRUMP was driven by the intersection of celebrity, politics, and crypto’s meme culture, sparking debates about whether it represents a lasting trend or a fleeting burst of speculation. Today, the conversation is whether the coin’s correction marks the end of its run or simply the pause before another surge. And while TRUMP has dominated recent headlines, investors are also exploring other retail-driven names like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts call a breakout presale contender for 2025. TRUMP’s meteoric rise According to CoinMarketCap data, TRUMP opened the year with a bang. In early 2025, its price spiked above $40, riding a tidal wave of speculative inflows. The token’s rapid ascent was fueled by viral marketing, relentless social media coverage, and traders eager to bet on political narratives. That surge made TRUMP one of the most profitable trades of the quarter, with some early buyers pocketing double- and triple-digit multiples in weeks. But the climb was short-lived. Within weeks, TRUMP fell sharply, sliding under $15 by March and testing investor conviction. By mid-year, the coin stabilized in the single digits, consolidating near the $8–$10 range where it continues to hover as September begins. This trajectory—an explosive launch, followed by steep correction and extended consolidation—is a familiar pattern in the meme coin sector. Analysts caution that volatility will remain extreme, both in potential gains and losses, but many agree that dismissing TRUMP entirely could be premature. Meme coin cycles and precedent History provides clues. Dogecoin was dismissed repeatedly before rallying to tens of billions in value. Shiba Inu delivered a 40,000,000% run after its skeptics had written it off. PEPE, launched in 2023, proved once again how quickly meme tokens can climb from obscurity to top-exchange listings. Each cycle follows a pattern: explosive ignition, brutal corrections, and, for survivors, the chance at renewed momentum once liquidity and community energy align. TRUMP’s ongoing consolidation may therefore represent the typical “middle stage” of the meme cycle rather than the end of its story. The dynamic also highlights a broader truth: meme coins compete not only on narratives but also on timing. While TRUMP reflects the intersection of politics and crypto, another project is quickly establishing itself as the cultural breakout of 2025. Unlike TRUMP, which has already run its first cycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its early accumulation phase. Presale rounds have sold out rapidly, drawing thousands of investors and even early whale-backed inflows. Analysts say this presale-first model could set MAGACOIN FINANCE apart, allowing it to build huge momentum before exposure on major exchanges amplifies liquidity. TRUMP vs the new wave Comparisons between TRUMP and MAGACOIN FINANCE are inevitable. Both are cultural tokens, but their trajectories differ. TRUMP has already tested its hype cycle, with investors now debating if it can stage a second chance. MAGACOIN FINANCE, on the other hand, is being positioned as the fresh face of meme culture, unburdened by political seasonality, and anchored by scarcity, audits, and branding designed for longevity. Together, they reflect the diversity of the meme coin market: political spectacle on one side, cultural ignition with structural credibility on the other. Conclusion The question of whether TRUMP’s hype is over or just starting again depends largely on narrative timing and retail appetite. With prices consolidating near $8–$10 after a spectacular $40 peak, the coin could either reignite or fade into history depending on whether attention returns. For investors chasing meme coin opportunities in Q4 and beyond, the real answer may not be “TRUMP or nothing,” but rather an evolving landscape where new contenders rise to challenge yesterday’s giants – just like MAGACOIN FINANCE.

51154520,https://invezz.com/?p=2860720,1756947600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Bitcoin dips, altcoins surge: why 2025 could belong to MAGACOIN FINANCE",https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/04/bitcoin-dips-altcoins-surge-why-2025-could-belong-to-magacoin-finance/,"Every crypto cycle sparks the same debate: should investors keep buying Bitcoin dips or look elsewhere for bigger returns? With Bitcoin now stabilizing under $110,000, many analysts suggest that its best multiples are behind it. While Bitcoin continues to serve as digital gold, it is no longer the only pathway to generational gains. Increasingly, attention is shifting toward altcoins that thrive on cultural momentum and community-driven branding. These tokens often deliver the most dramatic rallies once liquidity rotates from Bitcoin into smaller markets. Among this new class of contenders, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly rising to the top of analyst lists as the project most likely to capture outsized attention in 2025. Bitcoin’s new role Bitcoin has earned its position as the anchor of crypto. It attracts institutions, stabilizes portfolios, and benefits from mainstream trust through spot ETFs. But with growth now measured in billions, the days of huge gains are gone. Analysts expect steady returns, reaching $250,000 over the next cycle, but Bitcoin’s profile has shifted toward preservation rather than aggressive compounding. For risk-tolerant investors, that means the dip-buying mantra must be updated. Instead of asking if Bitcoin dips are worth buying, traders are asking which altcoins will outperform once Bitcoin stabilizes. Liquidity rotation and altcoin breakouts Every cycle shows the same liquidity pattern. First, Bitcoin rallies, drawing institutional inflows and media coverage. Once momentum slows, capital rotates into altcoins. Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche have all benefitted from this rotation in past cycles, while meme tokens like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE became cultural phenomena that dominated retail flows. This rotation is more than speculation, it’s the psychology of markets. Investors start conservative, then chase higher returns as confidence builds. In 2025, analysts say this rotation is already underway, setting the stage for cultural tokens to capture the spotlight once again. MAGACOIN FINANCE: the cultural ignition Unlike Bitcoin, which has matured into a conservative play, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its ignition phase. What makes it stand out isn’t only its affordability but also its ability to capture attention. Its presale rounds have nearly sold out, showing strong grassroots energy. But beyond the numbers, analysts highlight three critical factors: Cultural magnetism – MAGACOIN FINANCE resonates far beyond crypto-native audiences, giving it viral potential. Community loops – early buyers share, meme, and promote, creating visibility that compounds naturally. Whale + retail synergy – large holders are positioning early, but retail accessibility keeps momentum broad. Forecasts frame MAGACOIN FINANCE as a candidate for explosive multiples in 2025, not because of complex infrastructure but because of its ability to dominate the attention economy. Just as SHIB’s branding fueled one of the greatest rallies in history, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly described as the cultural successor to that narrative, only this time, backed by stronger foundations and early sellout momentum. Why retail can’t afford to wait The danger for retail traders is hesitation. By the time a token is trending on major exchanges, whales have already accumulated and are distributing into that demand. This cycle repeated with SHIB, PEPE, and even Solana during its breakout years. MAGACOIN FINANCE sits at the point before mainstream discovery. Analysts warn this is precisely where the most asymmetric returns are made. A token doesn’t need institutional adoption to deliver exponential multiples, it needs visibility, scarcity, and a growing community. All three are in play for MAGACOIN FINANCE heading into 2025. Lessons from past cycles Ethereum’s climb from $100 to $4,900, Solana’s move from $1 to $200, and SHIB’s unimaginable surge all highlight the same principle: conviction before consensus wins. Retail who bought late still profited, but never on the same scale as early believers. Analysts now frame MAGACOIN FINANCE as the clearest echo of those moments—a project where narrative, accessibility, and timing converge. Conclusion Bitcoin dips will always attract buyers, but the dynamics of 2025 demand a broader perspective. Bitcoin offers stability; altcoins offer growth. And among the new wave, MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its cultural resonance, presale momentum, and growing investor base, is being called the breakout contender for the year ahead. For investors deciding whether to buy the dip or chase the next breakout, the answer may lie in both strategies, but history suggests the largest fortunes are built by those who move early into the projects that capture culture as much as capital.

51153566,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=815250,1756947602,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/51153566.jpeg,"Ethereum Skyrocket Math: Tom Lee Charts Path To $62,500",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-skyrocket-math-tom-lee-62500/,"BitMine chairman Tom Lee has pinned Ethereum’s long-run upside to an explicit ratio framework and a “replacement-cost” lens on global payment rails. In his September 2 “Chairman’s Message,” the Fundstrat co-founder centers the analysis on the ETH/BTC cross and a year-end Bitcoin anchor of $250,000, using a slide-based grid to translate ratio levels into ETH spot targets—and then extends the calculus to a $62,500 scenario if Wall Street’s settlement stack migrates to Ethereum. Why Ethereum Could Soar To $62,500 “The 8-year average Ethereum to Bitcoin ratio is 0.04790 and it’s currently 0.0432, meaning we’re below the long-term average. The all-time high in this ratio was 0.0873,” Lee says. “Of course, it started off higher, but I’m talking about the 2021 all-time high. So, we think that not only should Ethereum recover to the long-term average, it should probably get to the all-time high ratio and arguably exceed it as we start talking about Ethereum acting as the chain for both Wall Street to build its payment rails and the financial system as well as AI.” Related Reading: Ethereum Price Stuck In ‘Loading Phase’, What This Means For The Campaign For $5,000 He then walks through the core exhibit. “So, let’s think about what that means for price. I have a grid here. On the left side is Bitcoin price levels and then going across are various levels of the Ethereum to Bitcoin ratio. Our year-end target—this is from the Fundstrat side—for Bitcoin is $250,000. And if you look at the average, okay, then you can see the range of prices for Ethereum using this ratio and different levels of Bitcoin. And here’s the 2021 high. And as you can see, at a $250,000 Bitcoin, you get to somewhere between $12,000 and $22,000 value per Ethereum token.” The slide shows: if BTC runs to $250K and ETH just trades at the average ratio, it implies ~$12,000; if ETH recovers its 2021 ratio high of ~0.087, that jumps closer to ~$22,000. “But that’s just a ratio recovery,” Lee continues. “If you look at the replacement cost of payment rails and the banking system, that gets you to an implied value of Ethereum of around $60,000. And that puts the ratio at roughly 0.250 Ethereum to Bitcoin ratio. And as you can see, that’s how you get to $62,500 per Ethereum token. So plenty of upside.” Lee frames this ratio-first math within a broader structural thesis that Ethereum is entering a “1971 moment” for finance, as real-world assets are synthesized into on-chain instruments and stablecoins expand as digital base money. The near-term numerical anchor is the 0.0432 ETH/BTC print sitting below the 0.04790 eight-year mean; the medium-term objective is a reversion toward, and potentially beyond, the 2021 high he cites. The grid translates those waypoints into discrete ETH prices at a fixed Bitcoin reference, which is why Lee emphasizes both variables in tandem rather than an ETH-only trajectory. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Latest Rally Fueled By Large-Scale Binance Orders, Analyst Says Beyond the grid, Lee argues that Ethereum captures the greatest share of tokenized financial activity and that its proof-of-stake economics align with how regulated institutions pay for security and uptime today. In his telling, banks and market operators already fund siloed infrastructure stacks; staking ETH to secure common rails could substitute that spend while returning a native yield, an incentive he says pushes the ETH/BTC ratio higher as risk capital and cash flows migrate. This is also where the “replacement-cost” view feeds into the $62,500 outcome: if Ethereum becomes the settlement substrate for payment networks, tokenized credit and equity, and AI-linked data rights, the market should price ETH on the value of the rails it replaces rather than only on historical multiples or cycle heuristics. The message also situates BitMine’s corporate blueprint inside that macro arc. Lee describes BitMine as an Ethereum treasury business built to compound ETH per share through five levers—equity issued above NAV, equity-linked volatility monetization, operating cash flows, staking rewards, and M&A for treasuries near NAV—arguing that proof-of-stake turns an ETH balance sheet into an income-producing infrastructure asset. Lee’s math makes the dependencies explicit: a Bitcoin anchor around $250,000 and an ETH/BTC advance first to the long-term average (~0.048), then toward the 2021 peak (~0.0873), and, in the replacement-cost scenario, to ~0.25. The first two steps imply ~$12,000–$22,000 ETH on his grid; the third defines the $62,500 “skyrocket” case tied to financial-plumbing migration and AI-era settlement on Ethereum. As he puts it: “That’s how you get to $62,500 per Ethereum token.” At press time, ETH traded at $4,377.

What they often fail to build is consistency, a reason for people to return every day and make it part of their routine. BlockDAG’s X1 Miner App has achieved exactly that. More than 3 million people now mine BDAG coins on their phones with a simple daily tap. It looks easy, but the psychology is powerful. The app turns a small action into a habit, shifting casual interest into long-term loyalty. With more than $395 million raised, over 25.9 billion coins sold, and a limited-time price of $0.0013 until October 1; representing a 2,900% surge since Batch 1, the results show that people are not just curious, they are staying committed. As the BlockDAG Deployment Event approaches, BDAG’s switch to a transparent $0.0013 coin rate replaces complex bonus incentives with equal terms for everyone. Turning Routine Taps into Real Engagement The X1 Miner App is built around one simple rule: consistency. Users have a fixed time each day to log in and tap to mine BDAG coins. If they miss it, that day’s chance is gone. This design pushes people to return daily, turning a small action into a reliable habit. Unlike apps that chase attention with complex features, X1 focuses on rewards. The act of mining is fast, but the reward builds commitment over time. Logging in each day becomes automatic, like checking social media or reading news in the morning. This daily pattern keeps people tied to BlockDAG (BDAG) in a way that many projects fail to achieve. Instead of waiting for updates or price changes, users are involved every day. That connection strengthens loyalty and ensures that the community stays active. In the crypto world, consistent participation is rare, but X1 has made it a natural occurrence. By turning activity into a routine, BlockDAG has created something that people return to without hesitation. How Daily Habits Shape Stronger Connections What makes the X1 Miner App powerful is not just the daily tap, but what the tap represents. Each action ties users closer to BlockDAG’s larger plan. The coins mined today will play a role once the mainnet goes live and trading begins across the 20 exchanges already confirmed. This gives daily mining more meaning. People are not just tapping for the present; they are part of a bigger future. The app also connects users to presale updates, referral rewards, and community activities, turning every login into more than just mining. Over time, this builds both habit and identity. Users don’t just collect coins; they see themselves as part of the BlockDAG network. That feeling of belonging keeps people motivated, even outside of mining. With $395 million raised and 25.9 billion coins sold, the growth shows no sign of slowing. The app’s simple design has created loyalty, and loyalty has fueled expansion. This link between habit and growth explains why BlockDAG is gaining global attention. Why the X1 Miner App Builds Loyalty That Lasts Success in crypto depends not only on technology but also on how people engage. If users stop participating, even strong code and design can lose impact. That is why the X1 Miner App is so important; it creates daily consistency at scale. More than 3 million users are not just sign-ups; they are active participants who strengthen BlockDAG every day. This steady involvement builds a base of stability for when the coin launches. With a set launch price of $0.05 and presale access at $0.0013, early buyers already see clear benefits. Yet the bigger value lies in knowing there is a loyal, daily-active community supporting the network. By turning crypto activity into a routine, BlockDAG has built momentum that goes beyond presale hype. This steady engagement lays the path for real adoption and lasting growth, proving that habits can power long-term success. Final Thought: True Power Behind BlockDAG’s Success One tap may feel small, but when millions do it daily, it becomes the pulse of a worldwide network. The X1 Miner App proves that crypto does not have to be complex to be effective. With daily reminders, limited mining windows, and steady BDAG rewards, BlockDAG has built more than a presale; it has built a habit. And in crypto, habits are priceless. The numbers tell the story clearly: over $395 million raised, more than 25.9 billion coins sold, a 2900% surge since Batch 1, and a current price of $0.0013. This shows that people are not just buying; they are actively participating. That level of commitment fuels true growth and makes BlockDAG (BDAG) one of the most closely followed projects of 2025.

Market data reveals that large investors, known as whales, are starting to diversify their holdings into alternative assets as Bitcoin struggles to maintain momentum above key resistance levels. With October historically being a volatile month for crypto, attention is shifting toward projects showing faster growth, stronger communities, and real-world utility. One of the names quietly rising into the spotlight is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Altcoins Gaining Strength As capital rotates, the broader altcoin market is preparing for a wave of new inflows. Ethereum, Solana, and XRP have already seen increased activity in September, supported by institutional investors exploring new opportunities beyond Bitcoin. The narrative is shifting from “store of value” to “what comes next,” and that’s where early-stage projects with sustainable models are starting to thrive. Why Whales Are Watching MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a focal point in this discussion. In just weeks, it has raised significant funding during its presale phases, with each round closing in record time. Analysts compare the current momentum to the early days of breakout tokens that later achieved massive valuations. What makes it stand out is not just the speed of adoption but its real utility-driven roadmap , ensuring long-term growth potential. Early investors have already projected returns as high as 45x , making it a key target for those seeking exponential upside in the next cycle. Rotation Into High-Potential Plays Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s chart patterns suggest that whales are reducing exposure at local tops, redirecting liquidity into opportunities with greater short-term growth potential. Altcoins with high activity levels and strong fundamentals are best positioned to capture this rotation. With upcoming economic events and ETF inflow dynamics still in play, October could serve as the launchpad for multiple breakout rallies. The October Outlook In summary, Bitcoin may still dominate headlines, but the real story this October could be the quiet accumulation of altcoins that offer growth beyond the legacy market leader. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its rapid fundraising success and expanding ecosystem, is increasingly viewed as one of those rare opportunities. As more investors search for the “next big thing,” it’s becoming clear why whales are starting to take notice.

With Bitcoin consolidating around key levels, attention is shifting to altcoins that could deliver outsized returns before the next big pump. Analysts say a handful of tokens are attracting both retail and institutional demand, and for good reason. One of them, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has become a hot topic after its presale nearly sold out, reminding investors of the early days of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin when those who moved quickly saw exponential gains. XRP Eyes a Return to Strength Ripple’s XRP remains a favorite for investors betting on utility and adoption. Its cross-border payment network continues to expand, with growing partnerships in Asia and the Middle East. After recent price pressure, traders are watching whether XRP can reclaim momentum, with forecasts suggesting it could push toward new yearly highs if the market turns risk-on. Solana’s Speed Still a Major Draw Solana (SOL) has recovered from multiple setbacks, proving its resilience in the competitive Layer-1 space. With transaction speeds that rival traditional financial systems and a growing DeFi ecosystem, SOL is seen as one of the strongest contenders for long-term growth. If institutional flows extend beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana could be one of the top beneficiaries. MAGACOIN FINANCE Heating Up While established names dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly building one of the strongest early-stage communities of 2025. Its presale is moving at record speed, with allocations vanishing quickly as whales and retail buyers compete for a spot. Analysts point out that early investors could see as much as 40x returns if MAGACOIN FINANCE mirrors past breakout performances from other meme-powered projects. With a countdown now live and the presale almost sold out, this could be one of the last chances to enter before the next pump phase begins. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Gains Serious Traction Hyperliquid (HYPE) has quickly become a favorite in the decentralized trading space. With near-zero fees and growing daily volumes, the project is winning over traders who demand performance and scalability. As its ecosystem develops, many see HYPE as one of the most undervalued opportunities in the market today. Dogecoin Refuses to Fade Despite new meme coins popping up every week, Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to command loyalty. Its massive community, strong branding, and new use cases in payments keep it relevant. DOGE has historically surprised skeptics, and if history repeats itself, another major rally could be around the corner. Cardano Pushes Toward Long-Term Adoption Cardano (ADA) has taken a slower but steady path, focusing on peer-reviewed development and scalability. With Hydra scaling technology rolling out, ADA is preparing to handle thousands of transactions per second. This foundation could power new adoption in DeFi, identity solutions, and enterprise-level blockchain applications. Analysts suggest ADA could benefit from the next wave of institutional attention, making it a coin to watch in the coming months. Conclusion As Bitcoin holds its ground, the real action could soon shift to altcoins. XRP and Solana are positioning for institutional inflows, Dogecoin and HYPE keep expanding their reach, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting records with its fast-selling presale. With the countdown nearly finished, investors looking for the next explosive opportunity may not want to wait much longer.

BlockDAG (BDAG) has flipped that script. Its X1 App has already reached a level of adoption most Layer-1 projects never achieve, securing millions of users before the mainnet is even live. Today, more than 3 million people mine BDAG directly from their smartphones. No complex setup, no costly rigs, no advanced knowledge, just a simple tap. The X1 App distills blockchain participation into a single habit: tap once a day to mine. Repeated by millions worldwide, that action builds holdings and, more importantly, a culture of accessibility without the barriers of nodes, GPUs, or steep onboarding. The results speak for themselves: over 25.7 billion BDAG coins sold, $395 million raised, and a 2,900% surge since Batch 1. Now priced at $0.03 in Batch 30, BlockDAG is also offering a special flat-rate entry of $0.0013 until October 1st ahead of its $0.05 launch. This isn’t theory, it’s traction, adoption, and momentum happening right now. Making Mining Simple & Accessible for Everyone Most networks attempt to achieve scale by adding servers, enhancing nodes, or refining consensus models. BlockDAG chose another route with its X1 App. Instead of asking users to adapt, it puts the process directly in their hands through their own smartphones: no extra setup, no wallets to install, no costly rigs. Anyone can join in with just a phone tap. The X1 Miner App streamlines the typical hurdles of crypto entry into a straightforward process. Download the app, tap once a day, and you start building BDAG coins. That tiny daily action creates a habit that keeps people engaged over time. Unlike other apps that only simulate mining with animations, the X1 is tied directly to the upcoming BDAG network. Coins gained now will carry over once the mainnet launches. It also runs on a Proof-of-Engagement model. This means real activity counts, not computing power. Whether someone is in New York or Nairobi, they are part of the same system. It proves scale is possible without servers. Worldwide Growth Through Sharing One reason BlockDAG’s X1 App has scaled so rapidly is its ability to grow without relying on heavy marketing campaigns or influencer-driven promotions. Unlike traditional crypto projects that depend on ambassadors to spread awareness, BlockDAG’s expansion comes directly from its users. Every daily tap can spark a referral, a conversation, or a shared link. With a 25% BDAG bonus for referrals, the incentive to spread the word is built into the ecosystem. This organic growth loop has fueled global adoption, including in regions often overlooked by major exchanges or wallet providers. For many, the X1 App is more than just a fun way to mine coins, it’s their first step into digital ownership. The outcome is a community that didn’t wait for launch. They began building holdings during the presale itself. With over 25.7B coins sold and $395M raised, each completed batch has increased value, with Batch 30 now live at $0.03 per coin. To make things even more accessible, BlockDAG has introduced a special flat-rate entry of $0.0013 until October 1st, ahead of the $0.05 launch. This is real-time progress, not promises, a community shaping itself well before the mainnet goes live. BlockDAG’s 3 Million X1 Users Show Real Potential The X1 App proves that mining can be simple, social, and global. More than 3 million people now participate with a daily tap, showing what’s possible when barriers are removed. No costly rigs, no complex setups, just a smartphone. This design makes crypto accessible to anyone, anywhere. Each tap is more than a way to earn coins; it’s proof that people want a clear, easy way to join crypto. While other projects spend years chasing adoption, BlockDAG already shows real scale: $395M raised, 25.7B coins sold, and a 2,900% climb since Batch 1, with Batch 30 now live at $0.03. To make entry even more compelling, BlockDAG has introduced a special flat-rate presale price of $0.0013, valid until October 1st, ahead of its confirmed $0.05 launch. Growth has also been accelerated by the referral system, offering 25% BDAG rewards that encourage users to bring in friends, fueling natural and low-cost expansion. This approach not only drives adoption but also builds a community that’s growing daily. And it’s not just about presale. Coins mined today through the X1 App will migrate to the live BDAG network at launch, ensuring every tap contributes to a future-ready ecosystem. With 20+ exchange listings confirmed and hardware miners shipping worldwide, the focus is now shifting from simply joining to activating adoption at scale. Building Momentum Before Launch Most projects focus heavily on launch day, but BlockDAG (BDAG) has chosen another path. It built its community first and shaped a culture before the mainnet even arrived. The success of the X1 Miner App proves that blockchain does not need to be complex or restricted to a small group. It shows that mining can be as easy as tapping a phone, and that this simplicity can scale up. Right now, 3 million people are already mining. The project has raised $395 million and delivered a 2,900% surge since Batch 1. This progress is not based on promises; it is real and active. One tap at a time, adoption is happening. The only question left is whether you’ll join before the next batch closes.

Buyers can now settle transactions using Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether. The initiative comes through a partnership with Hubpay , a regulated fintech company, which instantly converts digital assets into UAE dirhams before transferring them to the developer’s account. Partnership Targets Global Investors According to company executives, the move is aimed at attracting international buyers who are comfortable using digital assets. RAK Properties is currently developing the Mina Al Arab waterfront community, with more than 800 units expected to be delivered by the end of the year. Rahul Jogani, the firm’s chief financial officer, said the approach aligns with the company’s effort to appeal to “digitally and investment savvy” clients.

Market watchers have described the setup as a way to expand options for foreign buyers without exposing the company to added risk. Profits On The Rise The financials of the company seem to back its growth plans. Reports have revealed that RAK Properties recorded a net profit of AED 160 million during the first half of 2025, up by around 80% from the same period in the previous year. Its capitalization stands at nearly AED 4.7 billion, or about $1.3 billion. Executives attribute the company’s growth to both robust demand in Ras Al Khaimah and its attempts to increase investor access. Bitcoin Adoption Crypto adoption in UAE real estate is not new. Developers like DAMAC and Emaar have already introduced Bitcoin payment options, while Dubai’s land authority has worked with payment firms to process crypto-linked property deals. RAK Properties’ decision adds Ras Al Khaimah to the list of emirates opening up to the practice. RAK Properties’ entry into bitcoin transactions is being framed as part of Ras Al Khaimah’s Vision 2030 goals. By widening the pool of investors who can access property purchases, officials hope to draw more overseas buyers into the emirate’s housing market.

One recurring theme among community members is whether XRP could eventually fund early retirement . The discussion was reignited after King Karan, a veteran crypto investor and Chief Marketing Officer at Monerex, asked followers on X what price level would enable them to step away from traditional employment. The responses revealed a wide spectrum of expectations, ranging from moderate financial targets to highly ambitious projections. Moderate Retirement Targets: $10 to $200 Some participants took a practical approach, identifying price levels that would allow them to meet conventional retirement goals. For example, community member Brian Hassine suggested that XRP reaching $10 would be enough for financial independence. At the current market value of around $2.86 , this would represent slightly more than a threefold increase. For a $1 million retirement target, an investor would need to hold at least 100,000 XRP at that price. Others placed the bar higher. A user identified as Mullen Station explained that a price of $100 would provide the resources necessary for retirement while still leaving the option to work by choice. Similarly, XRPrizot cited £200 as a figure that would secure his financial future, while also noting that even £50 would allow for extended flexibility and time off. These views echo earlier discussions in the XRP community, where some investors outlined strategies such as holding 10,000 XRP in the hope of reaching a $1 million portfolio value if the token climbed to $100. More cautious approaches suggested holding around 60,000 XRP if the price were to reach $50. Ambitious Projections: $500 to $1,000 and Beyond Alongside moderate targets, others entertained significantly higher valuations. Several contributors referenced long-standing community “moonshot” levels such as $589 and even $1,000 per XRP . While often framed as aspirational, these figures illustrate the scale of optimism that still exists among parts of the community. Such projections are not without precedent. Forecasts from platforms like Changelly have suggested XRP could reach $2,400 by 2040, while industry voices, including Jake Claver, have speculated about the possibility of XRP one day trading at $10,000. Under these scenarios, even modest holdings could potentially translate into multi-million-dollar portfolios. Not all community members equated XRP’s success with retirement. Some argued that the asset represents more than a financial exit strategy. Amelia Rosee, for instance, stated that she is more interested in accumulating additional XRP than in planning retirement. Another participant, Gaius, described XRP as a tool for enabling meaningful work rather than a means of leaving the workforce, emphasizing that he does not plan to retire regardless of price appreciation. Meanwhile, a different perspective came from TheKaspaMaxi, who contended that the opportunity to retire on XRP has already passed. According to this view, those who entered the market early may have realized transformative gains, while today’s investors may not achieve the same outcome. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 At a current price of $2.86, XRP remains far from the levels cited by most community members in their retirement scenarios. Still, the conversation highlights the enduring belief within the XRP community that the asset has the potential to reshape personal financial futures. Whether through moderate, ambitious, or philosophical expectations, XRP continues to be viewed not only as an investment vehicle but also as a symbol of possibility for its most dedicated supporters.

The momentum reflects stronger real disposable incomes as inflation cools and a wealth effect from climbing house prices. The Australian Bureau of Statistics will publish July household spending data at 11:30 a.m. in Sydney. On monetary policy, Bullock said the pickup in consumer spending could limit further easing: “If the momentum continues, there may not be many more rate cuts ahead. But it all depends.” RBA holds fire on rates as Bullock flags tariff risks clouding global outlook The RBA cut the cash rate in August for a third time this year to 3.6% and Bullock had signaled previously that several more reductions would be needed to calibrate with the central bank’s goals for employment and inflation. Cryptopolitan recently reported that the RBA cut its main interest rate by a quarter-point, and it is expected to make at least three more cuts by early next year. Unlike other central banks, the RBA moves slowly and relies on data, not market pressure. The bank planned to act cautiously, expecting inflation to remain below 2.6% for 2025 and 2026, before dropping to 2.5% by the end of 2027. Economists and money markets are forecasting the RBA will stand steady later this month before bringing in another rate cut in November. Policymakers will have fresh consumer and business sentiment surveys, up-to-date jobs figures, and August’s monthly CPI to consider before their Sept. 29-30 meeting. Regarding international trade, Bullock noted that the RBA’s worst-case scenario is yet to be seen, as most countries have not retaliated against President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Still, she said it’s still “a bit of a threat.” Australia was hit with the global baseline rate of 10%. “The issue with U.S. tariffs is not just that they’ve risen sharply, but the unpredictability of how they’ll be applied—and not always for trade purposes,” she said. “They’re being used for all sorts of purposes.” As a result, Bullock warned that tariffs remain a big uncertain cloud hanging over the world economy. Bullock pushes RBA tech overhaul as staff adapt to AI-driven transformation Alongside monetary policy concerns, Governor Michele Bullock spotlighted the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) internal modernization drive, noting that staff are “feeling the weight” of its technological transformation agenda. Speaking in Perth on Wednesday, Bullock said using big data and artificial intelligence could reshape policymaking by enhancing the bank’s ability to understand economic conditions, improve forecasting, and support more informed decisions. She acknowledged, however, that employees must integrate these tools while carrying out their regular responsibilities. The governor also said that the RBA has been upgrading the technical underpinning of Australia’s payments and settlement systems. It’s also “fostering a culture of innovation” and “engaging more openly” with external partners, universities, research organizations, and industry experts, to bring diverse perspectives and push its thinking. Bullock said that all this is hard. She noted that she would be dishonest if she didn’t say that the staff are feeling the weight of the heavy change agenda. Still, the anticipated rapid technological change in the years ahead presents exciting opportunities.” Bullock named artificial intelligence, data science, and big data as the areas that could change the RBA. That spans how staff carry out their day-to-day responsibilities, how policymakers evaluate financial stability risks, and the analysis supporting monetary policy.

Imagine a major crypto exchange spending a significant sum on influencing policy right before its co-founders receive a presidential pardon. This isn’t a plot from a thriller; it’s the unfolding story surrounding BitMEX lobbying . According to a detailed report by crypto media outlet Protos, BitMEX, the prominent exchange co-founded by Arthur Hayes, reportedly channeled a staggering $800,000 into BitMEX lobbying activities over a two-year period. This substantial financial outlay occurred remarkably just before its co-founders – Arthur Hayes, Samuel Reed, and Benjamin Delo – were granted a presidential pardon by Donald Trump in March. Citing data from the political donation tracker OpenSecrets, the report indicates that BitMEX engaged the services of lobbying and consulting powerhouse Edelman through one of its subsidiaries. This strategic partnership reportedly began between 2019 and 2021, a timeline that raises eyebrows as it closely followed the indictment of the company and its key figures. Unpacking the Timing: Why Did BitMEX Lobbying Intensify? The timing of BitMEX’s significant lobbying investment is a critical aspect of this story. It’s not everyday that a company facing federal indictment decides to pour hundreds of thousands of dollars into influencing policy makers. Therefore, understanding the context becomes crucial for observers. The contract with Edelman, as highlighted by Protos, was reportedly signed shortly after the company and its co-founders faced legal charges. This suggests a direct correlation between the legal challenges and the intensified BitMEX lobbying efforts, aiming to navigate the complex regulatory landscape or perhaps seek favorable outcomes. Such expenditures often raise questions about the nature of influence in political circles, especially when they precede significant legal developments like a presidential pardon. Was this a proactive measure to shape future legislation, or was there a more direct intent behind the substantial financial commitment? The public naturally seeks clarity on these intricate connections. Beyond the Pardon: Other Connections to BitMEX Lobbying and Political Figures? The narrative surrounding BitMEX lobbying extends beyond just the pardon. Protos also brought to light another intriguing connection: BitMEX’s remarkably swift listing of two meme coins issued by President Trump and the First Lady. This rapid action adds another layer of complexity to the situation. This listing occurred merely one day after their launch, a pace described as notably faster compared to the average four-day listing period observed for other exchanges. This rapid action, coupled with the previous lobbying efforts, paints a complex picture of the exchange’s strategic engagements. Adding another layer to this, Arthur Hayes, in his personal blog, openly praised these meme coins. He even went as far as to suggest that such digital assets could herald a new era of democratized campaign fundraising. This public endorsement, alongside the swift listing, fuels further speculation about the exchange’s strategic alignments. It highlights how deeply intertwined crypto platforms can become with political movements, potentially blurring the lines between business operations and political advocacy. What Does This Mean for Future Crypto BitMEX Lobbying and Regulation? The BitMEX lobbying saga raises crucial questions about the future of cryptocurrency regulation and the role of influence in shaping it. As the crypto market matures, the interaction between exchanges and political bodies is becoming increasingly sophisticated. Consequently, transparency becomes paramount. On one hand, active lobbying can help educate lawmakers about the nuances of blockchain technology and advocate for policies that foster innovation. It can ensure that regulations are well-informed and do not stifle growth within the nascent industry, which is a positive outcome. However, on the other hand, incidents like these can lead to public skepticism and calls for greater transparency. The perception that powerful entities can ‘buy’ favorable outcomes through lobbying could erode trust in both the crypto industry and the political system. It underscores the need for clear ethical guidelines and robust oversight mechanisms to ensure that lobbying efforts serve the public interest rather than merely private agendas. The industry must navigate these waters carefully to maintain its credibility. In conclusion, the report detailing BitMEX’s substantial $800,000 lobbying expenditure prior to its co-founders’ presidential pardon, coupled with the swift listing and endorsement of political meme coins, paints a vivid picture of the intricate relationship between big crypto and political influence. This unfolding narrative serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of transparency and ethical conduct in both the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency space and the halls of power. It prompts a vital conversation about how influence is wielded and perceived, shaping not only the fate of individual companies but the broader regulatory landscape for the entire digital asset industry.

The token is already worth $0.035 in Phase 6 of the presale and will increase by 14.29 percent to $0.04 in Phase 7. Up to date, the project has raised over 15.3 million USD and has received a total of over 16,000 holders taking part in the presale. Even though ADA follows wider market trends, the momentum of Mutuum Finance indicates that investor consciousness is shifting significantly, and the power of decentralized finance projects is increasingly becoming a significant factor to drive Q4 trends. Cardano(ADA) Price News: Flat in the market, although not smooth ADA is trading at $0.7943, which declined by a slight percentage of 2.46 in the last 24 hours. The coin is probing important areas of support around $0.79 and analysts believe that the continuation of this value is essential in order to prevent any further depreciation to $0.75-$0.77. Provided that ADA is able to regain resistance at or about $0.80, then a recovery to $1.00 will be feasible. In the meantime, more general market trends are on the move, and some new DeFi projects are attracting investor attention as well, such as Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Stage 6 Presale FOMO Investors Mutuum Finance is at the Stage 6 stage of presale and tokens are valued at $0.035. In phase 7, the price will be raised by about 14.3 percent to $0.04. It has attracted more than 16,000 early investors and received funding of over $15.3 million as the presale itself has guaranteed the market confidence. Official Bug Bounty Program Mutuum Finance has also launched an Official Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK to promote the discovery and reporting of software vulnerabilities. The reward pool has a total of $50,000 USDT, and payouts are given based on the severity of the vulnerability detected. There are five levels, bugs, one is critical, major, minor, low and all users, the bugs will be dealt with and the security improved. Stablecoin based on Ethereum pegged to USD The project is also building an overcollateralized stablecoin on Ethereum that is pegged to USD. It is CertiK-audited secure and transparent, and provides users with a stable and reliable asset intended to be used in daily life and decentralised applications. The Future of Decentralized Lending The DeFi protocol of Mutuum Finance allows users to manage their funds in the most basic way possible through passive yielding lenders and liquidity mobilizing borrowers who pledge their assets to collateralize portfolios of various assets. Algorithms that adjust the rates achieve maximum capital efficiency and contribute to the long-term ecosystem sustainability. Liquidity and Risk Management The liquidity and the market volatility are taken into account in the protocol to enable the closure of the distress position. The caps and liquidation parameters are used to carry the risk exposure. Stablecoins and ETH are less volatile and thus enable a higher Loan-to-Value ratio, and volatile assets are restricted. Reserve factors are shifted according to asset risk and opportunity to participate in the asset safety is balanced in all types of tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming one of the top DeFi altcoins as Cardano (ADA) prepares to hit new highs in Q4. Stage 6 tokens are valued at $0.035 which will increase by 14.29 to $0.04 in Stage 7, providing Stage 1 investors with good gains. The presale has already brought in 16,000+ holders and raised an amount of $15.3M, which shows increased demand. MUTM would bring together security, innovation, and capital efficiency with a $50K CertiK bug bounty, USD-pegged stablecoin, and a dual P2C/P2P lending model. This is the stage to get tokens before the price rises.

EU lawmakers should intervene if an entity covered by the landmark Markets in Crypto-assets regulation (MiCA) works with a non-EU entity to issue stablecoins, Lagarde said Wednesday at the ninth annual European Systemic Risk Board conference. She said these issuers should be banned from operating in the EU unless there were “robust equivalence regimes” in place in their home markets. She has since argued that these measures, which, she said, introduce a “clear cut off that demonstrates that EU operators are authorized,” should mean that EU investors are not taking on incremental redemption risk and that issuers will be fully reserved by their tokens. “In the event of a run, investors would naturally prefer to redeem in the jurisdiction with the strongest safeguards, which is likely to be the EU, where MiCAR also prohibits redemption fees,” Lagarde said. “But the reserves held in the EU may not be sufficient to meet such concentrated demand.” US stablecoin rules could reshape Europe’s digital currency plans Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies engineered to keep their value, pegging their worth to an underlying asset like the United States dollar or euro. The debate around a digital euro has been ongoing among European Central Bank officials for some time. Still, recent momentum may be driven by the passage of stablecoin legislation overseas, particularly in the U.S. In July, the U.S. Congress approved a law that would provide a regulatory framework for stablecoins, which is likely to help issuers of dollar-pegged tokens. ECB Executive Board member Piero Cipollone warned in April that such policies could have far-reaching implications. “The U.S. government’s policies could potentially result not just in further losses of fees and data, but also in euro deposits being moved to the United States and in a further strengthening of the role of the dollar in cross-border payments,” he said. Global stablecoin race heats up as oversight concerns grow As a law in the U.S. takes one step toward implementation and EU officials ponder how to handle stablecoins, China may also be planning a yuan-backed coin. Reports in August indicated that the Chinese government was thinking about its own stablecoin pegged to its renminbi currency after the slow rollout of a digital yuan. As of Monday, officials had not yet announced whether the country would advance a state-issued stablecoin, as it has been considering doing in response to U.S. efforts to bolster the dollar’s role. Nobel Prize-winning economist Jean Tirole has also cautioned about the “insufficient oversight” of stablecoins, warning that governments could face multibillion-dollar bailouts if the tokens collapse during a future financial crisis. Speaking to the Financial Times, the 2014 Nobel laureate in economics said he was “very, very worried” about the lack of supervision and the risk of a depositor run if doubts were to arise over the reserve assets backing the digital tokens. Stablecoins issued by companies like Tether and Circle, pegged to real-world assets, are poised to grow in popularity following a U.S. law passed in July that allows banks to create their own dollar-linked digital assets. Global stablecoin usage has already climbed to roughly $280 billion, with President Donald Trump advocating for their role as a cornerstone of mainstream finance. While retail users could regard them as “a perfectly safe deposit”, stablecoins could become a source of losses and trigger calls for costly government-led bailouts, said Tirole , a professor at the Toulouse School of Economics. He cautioned that backing stablecoins with U.S. government bonds could become unpopular because of the underlying assets’ relatively low yields. Tirole cited earlier instances when the returns of Treasury debt were low for several years, and payouts after inflation were even struggling. He warned that stablecoin issuers could be lured into the “temptation” to invest in alternative assets that offer higher returns and are riskier. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Verve Technology, a prominent Nasdaq-listed strategic investor, is undergoing a significant transformation. The company has officially announced its rebranding to TON Strategy , signaling a clear and focused direction towards The Open Network (TON) ecosystem. This pivotal shift also comes with an ambitious plan to buy back $250 million of its own shares, underscoring a strong commitment to shareholder value and its renewed strategic focus. What Does This Rebrand to TON Strategy Signify for Investors? The decision to rebrand from Verve Technology to TON Strategy is more than just a name change; it’s a strategic declaration. This move highlights the company’s deepened commitment to The Open Network, positioning itself as a dedicated player in the TON ecosystem. Along with the new identity, investors will see a change in the company’s stock ticker from VERB to TONX, making it easier to identify the company’s primary investment focus. This rebranding: Clarifies Focus: Directly communicates the company’s core investment strategy. Aligns Brand with Vision: Ensures the corporate identity reflects its operational priorities. Signals Commitment: Demonstrates a long-term dedication to the growth and development of TON. For current and prospective investors, this change provides a transparent view into where the company sees its future growth. It emphasizes a strategic pivot, aiming to leverage the potential of the TON blockchain. The Power of the $250 Million Share Buyback: Boosting Shareholder Value Alongside the exciting rebrand, TON Strategy ‘s board of directors has approved a substantial $250 million share buyback program. A share buyback, or share repurchase, is a corporate action where a company buys back its own shares from the open market. This action typically reduces the number of outstanding shares, which can: Increase Earnings Per Share (EPS): With fewer shares, the company’s profit is divided among a smaller pool. Boost Share Price: Reduced supply can lead to increased demand and, consequently, a higher share price. Signal Confidence: A buyback often indicates that management believes the company’s stock is undervalued. Interestingly, TON Strategy has outlined a unique approach: if its share price trades above net asset value following the buyback, it may issue new shares. These newly issued shares would then fund additional purchases of TON, creating a dynamic feedback loop between its stock performance and its core investment in The Open Network. This mechanism showcases a forward-thinking approach to capital allocation. Why the Focus on TON? Understanding TON Strategy ‘s Vision The Open Network (TON) is a decentralized blockchain project originally initiated by Telegram. It boasts impressive scalability, speed, and a growing ecosystem of applications and services, including TON Wallets, decentralized exchanges, and gaming platforms. TON Strategy ‘s intensified focus on TON is a testament to the network’s potential to become a significant player in the broader blockchain landscape. This strategic investment is driven by several factors: Scalability: TON’s architecture is designed for high transaction throughput, crucial for mass adoption. Ecosystem Growth: A rapidly expanding community and developer base are building innovative solutions on TON. Market Opportunity: The potential for TON to capture a significant share of the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 markets is substantial. By aligning its entire brand and investment strategy with TON, the company aims to capitalize on this emerging opportunity, positioning itself at the forefront of this promising blockchain technology. This bold move reflects a calculated risk with potentially high rewards. A Bold New Chapter for TON Strategy The transformation of Verve Technology into TON Strategy , coupled with a substantial share buyback, marks a truly exciting new chapter. This strategic pivot underscores a strong belief in The Open Network’s future and a clear commitment to enhancing shareholder value. As TON Strategy embarks on this journey, the cryptocurrency community and investors will be keenly watching how this focused approach translates into growth and innovation within the TON ecosystem. This bold step is poised to make TON Strategy a key entity to observe in the evolving digital asset space, demonstrating how traditional investors are increasingly embracing the potential of decentralized technologies. The future looks promising for this newly focused entity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main reason for Verve Technology’s rebrand to TON Strategy? A1: The rebrand to TON Strategy is a strategic move to clearly align the company’s identity and investment focus with The Open Network (TON) ecosystem, signaling a deepened commitment to this blockchain technology. Q2: What will be the new stock ticker for TON Strategy? A2: Following the name change, the company’s stock ticker will switch from VERB to TONX. Q3: How does the $250 million share buyback benefit shareholders? A3: The share buyback program aims to reduce the number of outstanding shares, which can increase earnings per share, boost the share price, and signal management’s confidence in the company’s valuation and future prospects. Q4: What is The Open Network (TON)? A4: TON is a decentralized blockchain project known for its scalability and speed, with a growing ecosystem of applications and services. It was originally initiated by Telegram. Q5: Will TON Strategy issue new shares in the future? A5: Yes, the company stated that if its share price trades above net asset value following the buyback, it may issue new shares to fund additional purchases of TON, creating a strategic investment loop.

At the recent Bitcoin 2025 Asia conference in Hong Kong, he predicted that Bitcoin would eventually reach $1m . “Everybody wants Bitcoin. Everybody is buying Bitcoin,” he said. “That’s why I’ve always said Bitcoin is going to hit $1 million. There’s no question.” The company operates roughly 6,000 mining computers sourced from China, equipment now subject to import tariffs under his father’s trade policies. Trump Media Raised $2.5B In May To Acquire Bitcoin American Bitcoin has entered into a $2.1b controlled stock offering with investment banks including Cantor Fitzgerald and Mizuho Securities. The proceeds will be used to acquire more Bitcoin and upgrade mining technology. The company was previously known as American Data Centers but rebranded in March through a joint venture with miner Hut 8. Its strategy mirrors that of MicroStrategy, recently renamed Strategy, which pioneered the model of corporate bitcoin accumulation. MicroStrategy’s market value has risen to about $110b on the back of its $71b Bitcoin holdings. The Trump family has rapidly built a sprawling crypto empire. In May, Trump Media & Technology Group raised $2.5 billion to purchase bitcoin. Their ventures also include a non-fungible token trading card series, two memecoins, and the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF. WLFI Trading Debut Further Expands Family’s Crypto Footprint In August, World Liberty Financial, another Trump-linked group, announced plans to spend $1.5b to buy its own token through a publicly listed company. This week, WLFI began trading. At the end of last year, the president disclosed ownership of 15.75b tokens, a stake now valued at about $3.3b. American Bitcoin’s sharp debut adds to the family’s growing exposure across the digital asset industry. Their crypto ventures have drawn criticism from Democratic lawmakers and ethics experts. Even so, investors rushed into the stock on its first day. As a result, it has become one of the most closely watched debuts of the year.

Nasdaq-listed investment firm Bitmine (BMNR) has once again made headlines with a substantial Bitmine ETH purchase , signaling a powerful vote of confidence in Ethereum’s future. This latest move by a major institutional player is turning heads and prompting discussions across the digital asset landscape. Bitmine’s Latest Strategic ETH Acquisition Just recently, Bitmine completed a massive acquisition of 14,665 ETH, valued at an impressive $65.32 million. This significant transaction, facilitated through Galaxy Digital, was swiftly brought to light by the keen observations of on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa. Such transparency in reporting large-scale movements offers real-time insights into institutional activity. This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a strategic enhancement of Bitmine’s already considerable Ethereum holdings. With this recent addition, the firm’s total ETH portfolio has now swelled to an astonishing 1.87 million ETH, collectively valued at approximately $8.32 billion. These figures underscore Bitmine’s long-term commitment to Ethereum and its belief in the asset’s enduring value. Why Does This Bitmine ETH Purchase Matter? Institutional investments like this Bitmine ETH purchase serve as crucial indicators for the broader market. When a Nasdaq-listed firm allocates such substantial capital to a digital asset, it sends a clear message: Increased Legitimacy: It reinforces Ethereum’s position as a legitimate asset class. Market Confidence: It suggests professional money managers see significant upside potential. Long-Term Vision: Such holdings reflect a belief in Ethereum’s foundational technology and its role in the future of finance. Moreover, the involvement of a reputable entity like Galaxy Digital in facilitating this transaction further solidifies the institutional infrastructure supporting cryptocurrency investments. This growing ecosystem makes it easier and safer for large firms to enter the digital asset space. Bitmine’s Growing Ethereum Stash: A Closer Look Bitmine has been a consistent and significant investor in Ethereum, steadily accumulating the asset over time. Their current holding of 1.87 million ETH represents one of the largest known institutional allocations. This sustained accumulation strategy indicates a deeply researched and conviction-driven approach. The firm’s decision to continue increasing its Bitmine ETH purchase even amidst market fluctuations speaks volumes. It suggests they view dips as buying opportunities and are undeterred by crypto market volatility. For individual investors, observing such sustained institutional interest can provide a sense of validation, though personal research remains crucial. Understanding the Market Impact and Investor Sentiment A large Bitmine ETH purchase can have a ripple effect on investor sentiment. While a single transaction doesn’t dictate market direction, it certainly contributes to a narrative of institutional adoption and growing demand. Positive news from major players can: Boost Retail Confidence: Individual investors often look to institutional moves. Attract New Capital: Other institutions might re-evaluate their crypto strategies. Influence Price Action: Sustained institutional buying pressure can contribute to upward price momentum over time. However, the crypto market remains dynamic, subject to global economic factors, regulatory changes, and technological developments. Institutional buying is one piece of a much larger puzzle. Navigating Volatility: Risks and Opportunities in ETH Investment While Bitmine’s substantial Bitmine ETH purchase paints a picture of confidence, all investors must acknowledge the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency. Ethereum is subject to significant price volatility due to macroeconomic shifts, regulatory uncertainties, and network developments. However, for those with a long-term perspective, these institutional moves highlight potential opportunities. Ethereum’s robust ecosystem, its role in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and Web3, continues to expand. Investors should always prioritize due diligence, understand their risk tolerance, and consider diversification when building a crypto portfolio. Expert Insights and The Future of Ethereum The ability of on-chain analysts like ai_9684xtpa to track and report these large transactions in near real-time is a testament to blockchain’s transparency. This public ledger provides unparalleled insight into significant capital flows, empowering market participants with timely and verifiable information, thus enhancing market efficiency. Bitmine’s consistent and growing Bitmine ETH purchase strategy suggests a strong belief in Ethereum’s future trajectory. As the network evolves with scalability and efficiency improvements, its utility and adoption are likely to grow. Institutional endorsement plays a vital role in this maturation process, paving the way for wider acceptance and integration into the global financial system. In conclusion, Bitmine’s latest $65.3 million Bitmine ETH purchase is far more than just a transaction; it’s a powerful statement. It underscores the growing institutional conviction in Ethereum’s long-term potential, its robust technology, and its pivotal role in the evolving digital economy.

51156068,https://thecoinrise.com/everyones-racing-to-win-free-crypto-in-blockdags-buyer-battles-presale-soars-to-395m/,1756951216,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/51156068.jpeg,"Everyone’s Racing to Win Free Crypto in BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles, Presale Soars to $395M!",https://thecoinrise.com/everyones-racing-to-win-free-crypto-in-blockdags-buyer-battles-presale-soars-to-395m/,"Most crypto presales follow a predictable path: pick a stage, buy some coins, and wait. But BlockDAG throws that routine out the window. Its Buyer Battles feature brings competition into the mix, turning each day into a real-time challenge for anyone participating. Instead of passive buying, users now actively compete for bonus BDAG. Each day, a fixed supply is released, and if there’s any left by the day’s end, the top buyer wins it all for free. That adds strategy, excitement, and unpredictability to every purchase. The format isn’t just fun, it’s working. With $395 million already raised, 26 billion BDAG sold, and 2,900% ROI from Batch 1 to now, BlockDAG has become one of the most talked-about presales of 2025. And with a limited-time offer dropping the price to $0.0013 until October 1, even more eyes are now on the battle board. How BlockDAG’s Daily Leaderboard Keeps Things Moving! Crypto launches often rely on countdowns and forced urgency to hype demand. BlockDAG doesn’t need that. Its built-in rules deliver natural pressure. Miss a day, and the leftover BDAG goes to someone else, no gimmicks, just math. Batch 30 is currently priced at $0.03, but a special cutback until October 1 prices BDAG at $0.0013. With each batch, the price moves up. But the Buyer Battles format means there’s more than just batch pricing at stake. Each day offers a fresh chance to score free coins. Skip the action, and that bonus goes to someone quicker. This setup has fueled ongoing interest. Instead of single-time buyers, BlockDAG is seeing repeat participants trying to time their entries. The numbers speak for themselves: 26 billion BDAG sold, nearly $395 million raised, and more showing up daily. Even smaller buyers can win. Since the scoreboard resets every 24 hours, a smartly timed buy can beat out yesterday’s bigger purchases. That potential keeps buyers engaged, not out of obligation, but because they’re chasing real rewards. Why Buyers Are Eyeing Major Deployment Event BlockDAG is ready to host a major Deployment Event in Singapore. After withdrawing from Token2049 due to local restrictions on presale promotions, the team opted to launch its own flagship event. Additionally, BlockDAG has introduced a new special presale price of $0.0013 per BDAG until October 1. This rate will remain in effect for the final 30 days leading up to deployment. This model is also keeping people engaged longer. Instead of buying once and disappearing, participants return daily to track volume, watch the leaderboard, and test their timing. It becomes part of their routine. And that routine has driven serious results, $395 million raised, 26 billion BDAG sold, and rising. By using mechanics instead of marketing tricks, BlockDAG has created a real-time competition that rewards attention, speed, and timing. It’s not hype, it’s gameplay with real rewards built in. Smart Buys and Big Moves Both Win BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles system gives both daring and consistent participants a shot at big rewards. Every day resets the scoreboard, which means someone new can win without needing deep pockets. If volume dips and timing is right, even a moderately sized buy can walk away with the free BDAG leftover for the day. At the same time, the format still leaves room for bold moves. Big buyers can make a calculated play, drop a high-value purchase during a slow window, and take the win. That’s what makes it more than just a buy-and-hold. It’s a competition where planning, risk, and daily action all matter. With the limited-time $0.0013 offer, the potential gains stretch even further. And this isn’t happening in isolation. BlockDAG has already sold 26 billion coins and collected over $395 million. Plus, with its growing user base, including 3 million X1 app users, there’s a full ecosystem building around this format. This isn’t just about who spends the most; it’s about who’s smart enough to win. Every day brings a new chance, and every action counts. Final Thoughts BlockDAG has introduced something rare in crypto presales: daily interaction that actually matters. Every buy has the potential to win extra BDAG, and every day resets the field. That’s not just engaging, it’s addictive in the best way. With over 26 billion coins already sold, a 2,900% return from the earliest batches, there’s still plenty of action left. With BDAG available at $0.0013 until October 1, it gives new buyers an edge that could be gone any day now. In a space flooded with copycat launches and boring presale mechanics, BlockDAG stands out. It’s turned participation into a daily event, with real upside, visible wins, and a growing global community. This isn’t just about funding the next blockchain; it’s about making every step of the process fun, competitive, and rewarding.

The moves, which continue to draw market attention, come as Bitcoin struggles to keep its price as the bearish market condition worsens. In a noted transfer, a Bitcoin whale shifted more than $3 billion in funds from Bitcoin into Ethereum. As a result, Ethereum price predictions are skyrocketing, as investors weigh the continued whale exodus from Bitcoin into Ethereum. Alongside ETH, analysts point out that the Bitcoin whales are also rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE —an Ethereum-based token gaining traction as a breakout altcoin opportunity to hold for Q4 2025. Whales Fuel Ethereum’s Surge Recent data shows major whale wallets selling BTC and buying ETH in bulk. One address offloaded 22,769 BTC worth $2.59B, picking up more than 886,000 ETH. Another day saw $456M worth of ETH purchased across multiple wallets. One whale even staked $1B in ETH, underscoring long-term conviction. Why the Rotation? Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin recently, rising 25% in August while BTC slipped 4%. Spot ETH ETFs added nearly $3.9B in inflows, signaling strong institutional interest. At the same time, ETH reserves on exchanges are shrinking as investors move coins to private wallets. Coupled with DeFi and NFT growth, ETH’s utility is proving hard to ignore. MAGACOIN FINANCE Grabs Bitcoin Whale Attention On-chain data trackers show Bitcoin whales rotating capital into MAGACOIN FINANCE. The moves into the project come as these traders continue to seek the best crypto investment before the year runs out. The attention from the whales has placed MAGACOIN FINANCE in the emerging altcoin 2025 conversations. While some highlight it as a hidden gem crypto, others point to its solid roadmap and community-driven momentum as factors that make it a long-term opportunity. With market attention now firmly on MAGACOIN FINANCE, analysts’ forecasts say it could deliver an outsized ROI. From current prices, that would make MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the best crypto opportunities to watch in 2025 . Market Impact The whale moves have shaken dominance metrics, with ETH gaining market share as BTC slips. Ethereum briefly hit $4,500 during peak activity, with analysts calling this the first spark of a possible upcoming altcoin season. On-chain trackers confirm whales are steadily selling BTC and stacking ETH, with some now holding more ETH than major corporations. Outlook Market momentum shows Ethereum’s institutional demand will continue to fuel its growth. The bigger question for investors is whether Ethereum will hit $6K as whale and institutional inflow deepen. That remains to be seen. However, with Ethereum-based tokens gaining fast momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned to end the year as one of the best crypto investments in 2025.

American Bitcoin Shares Jump 90% In a press release, Eric Trump, co-founder and chief strategy officer of American Bitcoin, described the listing as a “historic milestone,” emphasizing the company’s mission to integrate Bitcoin into the core of US capital markets. In line with President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto agenda, which has created a more accommodating environment for the growth of digital assets in the country, Eric expressed ambition for the US to lead the global Bitcoin economy. Related Reading: One Major Reason Bitcoin Hasn’t Reached $150,000, According To Trump’s Crypto Advisor Initially launched as a subsidiary of Hut 8, a publicly traded Bitcoin mining firm, American Bitcoin began trading at $6.90 per share following an all-stock merger with Gryphon Digital Mining. The ABTC stock experienced a remarkable surge, rising as much as 90% toward its current record of $14.52 in its first hour of trading, although it later settled to over a 40% increase, trading at $9.21 per share. Asher Genoot, executive chair of American Bitcoin and CEO of Hut 8, stated that the company aims to foster rapid growth in Bitcoin shares by leveraging its mining capabilities and Hut 8’s robust energy and digital infrastructure. Trump Family Expands Crypto Portfolio The listing of American Bitcoin is one of several similar moves by the Trump family in the digital asset space, following the approval of trading WLFI in August and its subsequent debut on exchanges such as Binance. The WLFI token experienced typical market reactions, spiking initially toward a new record of $0.47 before stabilizing close to its listing price between $0.20 and $0.22 for the last few days. According to CoinGecko data, World Liberty Financial has quickly climbed to become the 35th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, reaching a valuation of nearly $6 billion in record time. Related Reading: WLFI: The Next Cult Coin? Analyst Outlines Potential For Explosive Growth Current valuations suggest that their holdings in World Liberty Financial tokens could be worth around $5 billion, positioning them as one of the family’s most valuable assets. The Trump family’s financial interests in the cryptocurrency realm have garnered considerable attention, encompassing a range of projects from World Liberty tokens to a memecoin associated with President Trump himself launched in January. Eric Trump recently remarked that crypto has been “probably the most rewarding venture of my entire life,” reflecting his enthusiasm for the digital currency landscape. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $112,159, marking a modest 1% increase within the last 24 hours. Compared to the cryptocurrency’s record price of $124,100, the current price is 9% lower.

After years of uncertainty, sentiment around adoption and real-world payments is improving. The core question for traders and long-term holders is simple: can XRP finally make a run to 10 dollars in 2025? While Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to pull most of the institutional flow, some investors are diversifying beyond the leaders. That’s why early-stage plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE are getting attention as potential high-upside complements to a portfolio built around top assets. Why XRP Could Target $10 The path to double digits needs three things to line up: stronger liquidity, rising utility in payment corridors, and a supportive macro environment. If capital keeps rotating from majors into high-cap altcoins, XRP could benefit from deeper order books and tighter spreads, which historically supports larger price moves. More banks and fintechs testing tokenization and instant settlement can also lift on-chain activity, a key signal for sustained rallies. What must go right First, momentum from Bitcoin staying strong above six figures tends to expand risk appetite for altcoins. Second, steady growth in cross-border volume would reinforce XRP’s use case and help market price in future demand. Third, cleaner global rules around digital assets would encourage bigger participants to step in, improving liquidity and helping price discovery. The Rising Crypto Star In the middle of all this market action, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been flagged by early adopters as a high-potential bet. Presale allocations have been moving quickly, with growing wallet participation and a community focused on long-term utility, not just hype. The appeal is straightforward: limited early access , ongoing development, and a push to reward holders as the ecosystem expands. For investors building a barbell strategy – established large caps on one side, carefully chosen early-stage tokens on the other – MAGACOIN FINANCE is being watched as a possible breakout . XRP Price Scenarios for 2025 Bullish case: a strong altcoin season, rising payment volumes, and improved exchange liquidity could create the conditions for a breakout toward $10. This would likely need persistent weekly closes at higher highs, consistent volume expansion, and supportive macro headlines. Base case: if adoption and liquidity improve at a steady pace but the market rotates more slowly, XRP could grind into the $6 to $8 range, setting the stage for a later attempt at double digits. Bearish case: if Bitcoin dominance stays elevated or macro risk flares up, XRP might top out between $3 and $5 and wait for a better window. Sharp pullbacks are common in bull markets, so managing entries and avoiding heavy leverage near resistance becomes important. Conclusion A run to $10 is not guaranteed, but for the first time in years the setup looks achievable if utility, liquidity, and market conditions align. For investors who want both stability and shot-at-moon potential, combining a core position in large caps like XRP with a selective early-stage pick such as MAGACOIN FINANCE is one way to play 2025’s bull market.

Spot Crypto Trading Regulations The statement stems from a collaborative initiative between the SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets and the CFTC’s Divisions of Market Oversight and Clearing and Risk as part of the SEC’s Project Crypto and the CFTC’s Crypto Sprint, aimed at streamlining the trading of specific spot crypto asset products. The collaboration aligns with recommendations from the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, which advocates for a coordinated regulatory approach to ensure that the United States remains a leader in blockchain innovation and crypto markets. Key to this initiative is the recognition that existing laws do not prohibit SEC- or CFTC-registered exchanges from facilitating the trading of these spot crypto products. By coordinating their efforts, the two agencies aim to enhance the trading options available to market participants in the US. The joint statement encourages exchanges to engage with SEC and CFTC staff as they prepare to submit necessary registrations and proposals for trading these products. The regulatory framework established by the Commodity Exchange Act requires certain leveraged, margined, or financed retail commodity transactions to be conducted on designated contract markets (DCMs) or foreign boards of trade (FBOTs) registered with the CFTC. However, there is an exception for retail transactions listed on SEC-registered national securities exchanges (NSEs). The divisions have clarified that DCMs, FBOTs, and NSEs are permitted to facilitate the trading of specific spot crypto asset products, which could lead to increased market activity. Enhanced Trading Opportunities Ahead The SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets is ready to assist SEC-registered clearing agencies interested in participating, while the CFTC’s Division of Clearing and Risk is prepared to address inquiries from registered derivatives clearing organizations . Additionally, the statement emphasizes the importance of public dissemination of trade data, which can provide valuable insights to the market. The agencies are committed to fostering fair and orderly markets, believing that transparency and efficient executions will enhance competition and trading opportunities for all participants. A spokesperson for the CFTC told Crypto In America that the agency’s previous enforcement actions, which had sent a clear message that certain innovative activities in the crypto space would face scrutiny. However, the spokesperson asserts that this recent staff statement clarifies that such activities are permissible under current laws and that both agencies are willing to collaborate with registrants to facilitate their market entry.

After nearly 13 years of silence, a massive dormant wallet holding 479 BTC, worth approximately $53.68 million at current market prices, has suddenly sprung to life. This rare occurrence has sent ripples through the crypto community, sparking discussions about its potential implications for the market. What Just Happened? Decoding the Historic Bitcoin Whale Activity The address, which had remained untouched since 2011, executed a small transfer of 0.25 BTC to another wallet just moments ago. While the amount transferred is relatively minor compared to the total holdings, the sheer act of movement after such a long period of inactivity is what makes this event so noteworthy. In the crypto space, a ‘whale’ refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of cryptocurrency, capable of influencing market prices with their transactions. This specific Bitcoin whale activity is particularly intriguing due to the wallet’s long dormancy. Wallets that have been inactive for over a decade are often considered ‘sleeping giants.’ Their awakening can signal various things, from a long-lost owner regaining access to a strategic move by a savvy investor. Why Does Dormant Whale Movement Spark Such Interest? When a long-dormant whale address becomes active, it captures the market’s imagination for several reasons. Firstly, the sheer size of the holdings means that any subsequent large movements could potentially impact Bitcoin’s supply dynamics and price. Secondly, it adds an element of mystery and speculation to the market. Is this a sign of an impending sell-off, or perhaps a consolidation of funds? Historically, significant Bitcoin whale activity has sometimes preceded notable market shifts. While a single transaction of 0.25 BTC is not enough to move the market on its own, it serves as a powerful signal. It tells us that someone with substantial holdings, who has been off the grid for a very long time, is now paying attention. Market Sentiment: Such events can influence investor psychology, leading to increased speculation. Supply Dynamics: If the whale decides to move a larger portion of their holdings, it could affect the circulating supply. Price Volatility: While not immediate, future large transactions could introduce volatility. Is This a Signal for Bitcoin’s Future Price Action? Interpreting the motives behind such a move is challenging. It could be as simple as the owner testing access to their wallet after a long time. Alternatively, it might be the first step in a larger plan, such as consolidating funds across different wallets, preparing for a sale, or even repositioning for a new investment strategy. Some analysts might view this Bitcoin whale activity as a potential bearish signal, anticipating a future sell-off that could depress prices. Others might see it as a neutral event, or even a bullish one, if the whale is simply re-allocating assets in anticipation of further market growth. It is crucial for investors to remember that one whale’s actions do not necessarily dictate the entire market’s direction. However, monitoring these large players provides valuable insight into potential shifts in market sentiment and liquidity. The crypto market is known for its volatility, and the actions of large holders can certainly contribute to this. Navigating the Waters: What Should Investors Watch For? For those closely watching the market, the activation of this dormant wallet serves as a reminder to stay vigilant. While it is impossible to predict the exact intentions of the whale, monitoring subsequent transactions from this address will be key. Any further significant movements, especially larger transfers to exchanges, would warrant closer attention. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor On-Chain Data: Utilize blockchain explorers to track further transactions from the awakened wallet. Observe Market Reaction: Pay attention to how the broader market reacts to any subsequent large whale movements. Avoid Panic: Do not make rash investment decisions based on isolated whale activity. This unexpected Bitcoin whale activity underscores the dynamic and often mysterious nature of the crypto landscape. It’s a fascinating development that will undoubtedly keep the community buzzing. Conclusion The awakening of a 479 BTC wallet after nearly 13 years is a truly historic event in the world of cryptocurrency. While the initial transaction was small, its significance lies in breaking a long period of dormancy, signaling that a major player is back in action. This Bitcoin whale activity offers a captivating glimpse into the potential movements of significant capital and reminds us of the constant evolution and intrigue within the digital asset space. The crypto community will be eagerly watching to see what this long-dormant giant decides to do next. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a crypto whale? A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency, often enough to influence its market price through significant buy or sell orders. Why is dormant wallet activity significant? Dormant wallet activity is significant because it indicates that a large holder, who has been inactive for a long time, is now engaging with their assets. This can lead to speculation about their intentions and potential market impact. Could this whale sell all its BTC? It’s possible, but not guaranteed. The initial small transfer could be a test, a consolidation, or the first step in a larger liquidation. Predicting the full extent of a whale’s future actions is speculative. How can I track Bitcoin whale movements? You can track Bitcoin whale movements using blockchain explorers (like Blockchain.com or Blockchair) by monitoring large transactions from known whale addresses or by using specialized crypto analytics platforms. What does this specific Bitcoin whale activity mean for Bitcoin’s price? While the initial small transfer itself won’t directly impact Bitcoin’s price, it signals potential future movements from a large holder. Any subsequent large transfers, especially to exchanges, could introduce volatility, but it’s not a definitive predictor of price direction.

Navigating the Path to Digital Asset Integration While the benefits of Bitcoin accumulation are clear for many, integrating digital assets into a corporate treasury strategy comes with its own set of considerations.

American self-made millionaire and entrepreneur, Grant Cardone, has successfully sold his opulent Miami mansion in Golden Beach for an astonishing 400 Bitcoin (BTC), equivalent to $43 million. This landmark Bitcoin real estate transaction, reported by Bitcoin News on X, occurred with remarkable speed, finding a buyer within just 72 hours of being listed. It underscores a powerful shift, demonstrating how digital currencies are increasingly becoming a viable and preferred medium for high-value asset exchanges. What Makes This Bitcoin Real Estate Transaction So Significant? Grant Cardone’s recent sale is more than just a headline-grabbing deal; it represents a pivotal moment for the integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance. This particular Bitcoin real estate transaction stands out for several compelling reasons: Unprecedented Speed: Selling a multi-million dollar property, especially one of this caliber, in just 72 hours is exceptionally rare in the traditional market. The use of Bitcoin likely streamlined the transaction process, bypassing some of the typical delays associated with conventional banking systems. Massive Scale: A $43 million property changing hands for 400 BTC highlights the growing confidence in Bitcoin as a store of value and a medium of exchange for substantial wealth. It’s not just small purchases; we are talking about significant capital. Validation for Crypto: For years, skeptics questioned the practical utility of cryptocurrencies beyond speculative trading. This sale offers tangible proof of Bitcoin’s growing acceptance and utility in the luxury asset market, pushing it further into the mainstream. Cardone’s Influence: As a well-known entrepreneur and financial influencer, Grant Cardone’s endorsement of such a transaction lends considerable credibility to the concept of digital asset payments, encouraging others to explore similar avenues. This event signals a maturing market where digital assets are no longer confined to niche tech circles but are actively shaping global commerce. Is Bitcoin Real Estate Becoming the New Norm for Luxury Deals? While Grant Cardone’s sale is a high-profile example, it’s part of a broader trend. The appeal of using cryptocurrencies for high-value purchases, particularly in real estate, is steadily growing. Many believe that Bitcoin real estate transactions offer distinct advantages: Enhanced Efficiency: Cryptocurrency transactions can settle much faster than traditional wire transfers, which often involve multiple intermediaries and can take days, especially for international deals. Reduced Fees: Depending on the platform and network conditions, crypto transactions can sometimes incur lower fees compared to the significant charges associated with large fiat transfers or international banking. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin transcends geographical boundaries, making it easier for international buyers and sellers to conduct transactions without the complexities of currency conversions and cross-border banking regulations. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the challenges. The volatility of cryptocurrencies, for instance, means the value of 400 BTC could fluctuate significantly between the agreement and settlement dates. Regulatory uncertainties and complex tax implications also remain key considerations for anyone venturing into this space. Despite these hurdles, the momentum suggests that crypto-backed property deals are here to stay and likely to increase. Navigating the Future of Digital Asset Transactions For individuals considering entering the world of Bitcoin real estate , whether as a buyer or a seller, several actionable insights are paramount. The landscape is evolving rapidly, and being well-informed is key to success: Seek Expert Advice: Always consult with legal and financial professionals who specialize in cryptocurrency and real estate. They can help navigate the complex tax implications, regulatory requirements, and ensure a smooth, compliant transaction. Understand Volatility: Be prepared for potential price fluctuations. Strategies like locking in the fiat value at the time of agreement or using stablecoins might be considered, though Cardone’s deal was purely BTC. Secure Custody Solutions: Ensure robust security for your digital assets. Whether using hardware wallets or reputable institutional custodians, protecting your Bitcoin is vital. Verify Authenticity: Due diligence is even more critical in crypto transactions. Verify the legitimacy of all parties involved and the authenticity of the digital assets being exchanged.

In a remarkable display of market strength, these exchange-traded funds have recorded significant net inflows for the second consecutive trading day, signaling a growing appetite for institutional exposure to Bitcoin. What’s Fueling the Latest Spot Bitcoin ETFs Surge? On September 3, U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively saw an impressive $301.15 million in net inflows. This figure not only highlights sustained interest but also builds on the momentum from the previous day’s positive performance. It’s a clear indicator that despite market fluctuations, investors are increasingly looking towards regulated vehicles to gain access to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This consistent influx of capital suggests a maturing market. Investors, both institutional and retail, are finding comfort and convenience in the structure offered by these ETFs. It simplifies the process of investing in Bitcoin without the complexities of direct ownership or managing private keys. Which Spot Bitcoin ETFs Led the Charge? The recent inflows weren’t evenly distributed, with some major players attracting the lion’s share of new capital. Here’s a breakdown of the top performers: BlackRock’s IBIT: This fund led by a significant margin, pulling in a massive $290.46 million. BlackRock’s strong market presence and reputation likely contributed to its impressive performance. Grayscale’s Mini BTC: Securing the second spot, Grayscale’s offering attracted $28.83 million in net inflows. This indicates continued interest in Grayscale’s diversified product range. Fidelity’s FBTC: Fidelity’s Spot Bitcoin ETF also saw positive movement, adding $9.76 million. Fidelity remains a strong contender in the evolving ETF landscape. However, not all funds experienced growth. Ark Invest’s ARKB recorded $27.9 million in outflows, demonstrating the dynamic nature of investor preferences and portfolio rebalancing within the sector. The remaining ETFs reported no significant net inflows or outflows during this period. Why Do Consistent Inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs Matter? The sustained positive inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs are more than just numbers; they represent several critical aspects for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem: Mainstream Adoption: These inflows signify growing mainstream acceptance and validation of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Traditional financial institutions are increasingly comfortable offering Bitcoin exposure through regulated products. Market Stability: Consistent demand from ETFs can contribute to greater price stability for Bitcoin. Large institutional purchases can act as a counterbalance to retail market volatility. Liquidity Enhancement: Increased activity in these ETFs enhances market liquidity, making it easier for large investors to enter and exit positions without significantly impacting Bitcoin’s price. Regulatory Confidence: The very existence and success of these regulated products underscore a growing confidence from regulatory bodies, paving the way for further innovation in the digital asset space. This trend suggests a maturing market where digital assets are moving from the fringes to a more central role in global finance. It’s a powerful statement about the long-term potential of Bitcoin. What’s Next for Spot Bitcoin ETFs and the Crypto Market? Looking ahead, the continued performance of Spot Bitcoin ETFs will be a key indicator for the broader cryptocurrency market. While the recent inflows are certainly positive, investors should remain aware of potential challenges: Market Volatility: Bitcoin, like all cryptocurrencies, remains subject to significant price swings. ETF performance can reflect this volatility. Regulatory Changes: Evolving regulatory landscapes could impact the operational framework and investor appeal of these products. Competitive Landscape: As more funds enter the market, competition for investor capital will intensify, potentially leading to fee compression and differentiated offerings. Despite these considerations, the current trajectory points towards a future where institutional participation in digital assets becomes even more entrenched. The accessibility and regulatory oversight offered by Spot Bitcoin ETFs are proving to be powerful catalysts for this evolution. A Compelling Outlook for Digital Assets The recent data from September 3, showing $301.15 million in net inflows for U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs , paints a compelling picture of growing investor confidence and market maturity. Funds like BlackRock’s IBIT are leading the charge, demonstrating the significant institutional appetite for regulated Bitcoin exposure. This sustained interest is a strong testament to Bitcoin’s evolving role in the financial world, pushing digital assets further into the mainstream. As these trends continue, the impact on liquidity, stability, and broader adoption of cryptocurrencies will be profound, marking an exciting chapter for the entire ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions About Spot Bitcoin ETFs Q1: What is a Spot Bitcoin ETF? A Spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Bitcoin. It allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without having to buy, store, or manage the actual cryptocurrency themselves. Q2: Why are these inflows significant? Significant inflows indicate growing institutional and retail investor confidence in Bitcoin as an asset class. They also suggest increasing mainstream adoption and potentially greater market stability and liquidity for Bitcoin. Q3: Which firms are offering Spot Bitcoin ETFs?

Analysts continue to debate whether the long-term Bitcoin price prediction of $ 250,000 remains alive, despite ETF-driven outflows and volatility. Simultaneously, inflows into Ethereum demonstrate a changing institutional preference, raising the debate over Bitcoin versus Ethereum investment. While the majors grab all the headlines, investors are also setting their sights on MAGACOIN FINANCE , a new low-cap altcoin with major ROI potential that has been tipped one of the best new altcoins to buy 2025. Bitcoin’s $250K Forecast Backed by Institutional and Real-World Growth As per the recent data, bitcoin is currently trading at $109,380. In the past 24 hours, the prices of bitcoin have increased with an addition of $2.18 trillion. Moreover, bitcoin has a trading volume of over $66 billion. This has led to the holders suggesting $250k price value could be in place in the coming future. This information and suggestion would be a bolstering value for anyone who is looking to invest in bitcoin. Although the price movement continues to remain in a downward channel pattern, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency is witnessing major changes due to institutional adoption and whale activity. Bitcoin’s utility also continues to expand. The Hong Kong University is trialing a scheme that allows paying tuition with Bitcoin. By collaborating with fintech providers, the service instantly changes BTC to Hong Kong dollars, thus, cutting the cost of transactions and making it easier for students. Experts think similar models can be adopted by other institutions across Asia. If that happens, Bitcoin will not just be seen as an investment, but also as something that can be used practically. This increases its effectiveness as a global medium of exchange. Ethereum Whale Buys $3B — Institutional Shift Signals Momentum A massive crypto investor who possesses more than $11 billion in Bitcoin has moved part of his portfolio towards Ether. Last week, the wallet sold $215 million in BTC to buy 886,371 ETH worth nearly $4 billion now, surpassing corporate holder SharpLink in Ethereum reserves. According to Arkham Intelligence, the whale had been inactive for seven years before returning to the market. In just a week, this wallet accumulates $2.5 billion in Ethereum. At one time, the whale’s Bitcoin wallet was worth over $5 billion. This timing isn’t random. The whale’s activity occurred alongside a larger shift of ETFs. According to SoSoValue, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds registered outflows of $751 million in August, while Ethereum ETFs were $3.87 billion. Early-Stage Altcoin Opportunity With ROI Potential Amid the shifting institutional flows, one rising project drawing attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Positioned as an unique high-growth altcoin , the project has been gaining traction among analysts and retail traders for its scarcity-driven tokenomics and dual-audit verification. Some even point to crypto whales buying MAGACOIN FINANCE in anticipation of its first listings, likening the move to early Ethereum or Solana entry points. With its sub-$0.01 pricing, MAGACOIN is considered by many as a low-cap altcoin with ROI potential , fitting into the broader theme of the best crypto to buy 2025 . Final Thoughts The long-term Bitcoin $250K target remains a cornerstone of many analyst forecasts, reinforced by expanding adoption and consistent whale accumulation. Ethereum, buoyed by $3B in inflows, is also proving its staying power as institutions diversify. Yet, the rise of emerging tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE shows how market participants are blending blue-chip conviction with early-stage bets. For investors looking beyond the giants, the opportunity to capture upside from both ends of the spectrum is becoming increasingly clear.

Recently, Spot ETH ETFs have entered a challenging phase, experiencing net outflows for three consecutive trading days. This trend, particularly evident with BlackRock’s ETHA fund, which saw a staggering $151.56 million withdrawn, is prompting investors and analysts alike to closely examine market sentiment and the future trajectory of Ethereum’s institutional adoption. What exactly is driving these withdrawals, and what could they mean for the broader crypto landscape? Decoding the Recent Spot ETH ETFs Outflows On September 3, U.S. Spot ETH ETFs collectively recorded net outflows of $38.42 million. This figure, while significant, masks a more nuanced picture when we look at individual fund performances. BlackRock’s ETHA fund, a prominent player in the market, was hit particularly hard, accounting for the vast majority of the day’s withdrawals. This substantial outflow from a single fund certainly raises eyebrows and impacts the overall market perception, according to data from TraderT. However, it is crucial to note that not all funds faced the same fate. In a display of contrasting investor behavior, several other Spot ETH ETFs actually attracted new capital. For instance: Fidelity’s FETH secured $65.78 million in net inflows. Bitwise’s ETHW gained $20.81 million. Grayscale’s Mini ETH added $26.55 million. These varied results suggest that while there might be broader market pressures, investor confidence is not uniform across all Ethereum-backed investment vehicles. Some investors are clearly choosing to reallocate their capital within the ETF ecosystem, rather than exiting it entirely. Why Are Spot ETH ETFs Experiencing Withdrawals? Understanding the reasons behind these withdrawals requires a look at several potential factors influencing investor decisions. One primary driver could be general market volatility or a shift towards a more risk-averse sentiment among investors. When the broader cryptocurrency market experiences corrections or uncertainty, investors often opt to secure profits or reduce exposure to more volatile assets like Ethereum. Another significant factor might be profit-taking. Early investors in these Spot ETH ETFs , especially those who entered during periods of lower Ethereum prices, could be cashing out to realize gains. Furthermore, broader macroeconomic concerns, such as inflation trends or interest rate changes, can also impact investment in risk assets. It is also possible that some investors are rotating their capital into other cryptocurrencies or even traditional financial instruments, seeking different opportunities. The divergence in fund performance also suggests a strategic reallocation. Investors might be moving from one ETF provider to another, perhaps based on fees, performance expectations, or liquidity. This highlights that while the headline number shows outflows, the underlying dynamics are complex and multifaceted, impacting the demand for Spot ETH ETFs . Navigating the Future of Spot ETH ETFs and Ethereum What do these recent outflows signal for the future of Ethereum and its institutional investment products? While a third day of net withdrawals is a point of concern, it does not necessarily indicate a long-term decline in institutional interest. The inflows into other funds demonstrate that capital is still flowing into the Ethereum ecosystem, albeit with a redistribution among different products. These trends serve as a crucial indicator of evolving market sentiment. They suggest that investors are becoming more discerning, carefully evaluating their positions in Spot ETH ETFs . The market for these products is still relatively nascent, and such fluctuations are part of its maturation process. For Ethereum, sustained large outflows could potentially exert downward pressure on its price, but the overall resilience and ongoing development of the network remain key factors for its long-term outlook. Investors should continue to monitor not just the aggregate outflow figures but also the individual performance of various funds. This detailed analysis provides a clearer picture of where capital is truly moving and helps in making informed decisions about exposure to Spot ETH ETFs and the broader Ethereum market. In conclusion, the recent three-day streak of net outflows from U.S. Spot ETH ETFs , particularly the significant withdrawal from BlackRock’s ETHA, certainly captures attention. However, the simultaneous inflows into other funds like Fidelity’s FETH and Bitwise’s ETHW paint a more nuanced picture of a dynamic market. This period highlights the complex interplay of investor sentiment, profit-taking, and strategic reallocation within the nascent institutional Ethereum investment landscape. As the market matures, understanding these intricate movements will be vital for all participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Spot ETH ETFs What exactly is a Spot ETH ETF? A Spot ETH ETF, or Exchange-Traded Fund, directly holds Ethereum (ETH) as its underlying asset. This allows investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without directly owning or managing the cryptocurrency themselves, providing a more regulated and accessible investment vehicle. Why are some Spot ETH ETFs seeing outflows while others see inflows? The mixed performance often reflects investor decisions based on various factors such as fund fees, liquidity, provider reputation, or even specific investment strategies. Investors might be reallocating capital from one fund to another within the same asset class, rather than exiting the asset entirely. Does this mean institutional interest in Ethereum is waning? Not necessarily. While some funds experienced outflows, others saw significant inflows. This suggests a potential redistribution of institutional capital among different Spot ETH ETFs rather than a complete withdrawal from Ethereum as an asset class. Institutional interest remains strong, but its allocation can shift. How do these outflows impact Ethereum’s price? Significant and sustained outflows from Spot ETH ETFs can put downward pressure on Ethereum’s price, as it indicates selling pressure from institutional holders. However, the overall impact also depends on broader market sentiment, other buying pressures, and the fundamental developments within the Ethereum network. What should investors consider when looking at Spot ETH ETF data? Investors should look beyond aggregate numbers and examine individual fund flows, volume, and the underlying reasons for movements. Consider the broader market context, macroeconomic factors, and Ethereum’s fundamental developments. Diversification and a long-term perspective are always key. Did you find this analysis insightful?

Breaking news from the dynamic world of cryptocurrency! A significant development has just unfolded, drawing the keen attention of investors and analysts alike. On-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa recently reported a massive NEIRO deposit that has sent ripples through the market. Specifically, two addresses linked to Trend Research, widely recognized as the largest holder of NEIRO tokens, transferred an astonishing 77.9 million NEIRO, equivalent to $6.04 million, to the Bybit exchange. This substantial NEIRO deposit occurred over a mere 20-minute window, immediately sparking intense discussions and speculation across the crypto community. What’s the Buzz About This Huge NEIRO Deposit? The core of this market chatter revolves around Trend Research, an entity well-known for its substantial holdings in NEIRO. When such a prominent player executes a large-scale transaction, the crypto world takes notice. The sheer volume of this particular NEIRO deposit —77.9 million tokens—is what makes it particularly noteworthy. Who is Trend Research? They are identified as the single largest holder of NEIRO, meaning their actions can significantly sway market sentiment and potentially the token’s price. The Specifics: The transfer involved 77.9 million NEIRO, valued at $6.04 million, moved to Bybit. Bybit is a major cryptocurrency exchange, often used for trading and liquidity. Why it Matters: Historically, large deposits of tokens to exchanges are frequently interpreted by the market as a precursor to selling. While this isn’t always the definitive outcome, it’s a strong signal that often leads to increased selling pressure or market volatility. This insight, brought to light by on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa, provides crucial transparency into the movements of significant market participants. Understanding these movements is vital for anyone involved in the NEIRO ecosystem. What Are the Potential Market Implications of This NEIRO Deposit? A NEIRO deposit of this magnitude from the largest holder naturally raises questions about its potential impact on the token’s price and overall market stability. The crypto market is highly sensitive to the actions of whales, and Trend Research certainly fits that description for NEIRO. Here’s a breakdown of what this could mean: Increased Selling Pressure: The most immediate concern is that this substantial NEIRO deposit could be intended for liquidation. If Trend Research decides to sell a significant portion of these tokens, it would inject a large supply into the market, potentially driving down NEIRO’s price due to an imbalance of supply and demand. Heightened Market Volatility: Even the anticipation of a large sell-off can trigger significant price fluctuations. Traders might react by opening short positions or selling their holdings preemptively, leading to increased volatility and rapid price movements in either direction. Shifting Investor Sentiment: Such a move from a major holder can create uncertainty and anxiety among smaller investors. This can sometimes lead to panic selling, as others follow suit, fearing a significant price drop. Confidence in the token might be temporarily shaken. Liquidity Dynamics: While Bybit is a robust exchange, a $6 million deposit of a single token could still influence its liquidity. If a large portion is sold quickly, it could temporarily strain the order books. It is crucial to remember that a deposit does not automatically equate to a sale. However, the market typically interprets such large movements with caution. Navigating the Uncertainty: How Should NEIRO Holders React to This Development? In light of this significant NEIRO deposit , it’s natural for current and potential NEIRO holders to wonder how to best proceed. Prudent decision-making, based on information rather than emotion, is key during such periods of market uncertainty. Consider the following actionable insights: Stay Informed and Monitor Closely: Keep a close eye on NEIRO’s price action and any further on-chain movements from Trend Research. Follow reputable on-chain analysts and news sources for real-time updates. The situation can evolve rapidly. Understand the Broader Context: While a large NEIRO deposit often signals potential selling, there could be other reasons. Trend Research might be preparing for liquidity provision for new decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, participating in staking pools, or engaging in arbitrage strategies. However, given their “largest holder” status, a potential sale remains a primary consideration. Review Your Risk Management Strategy: For those already holding NEIRO, this is an opportune moment to review your portfolio and assess your risk exposure. Consider setting stop-loss orders to protect against significant downside movements, or re-evaluate your position size based on your comfort level with volatility. Avoid Impulsive Decisions: The crypto market thrives on narratives and emotions. Resist the urge to panic sell or make hasty investment decisions based solely on this news. Take time to analyze the situation and consult multiple sources. Re-evaluate Your Investment Thesis: Ask yourself if this event fundamentally alters your long-term investment thesis for NEIRO. Is the project’s technology, adoption, or team still strong? Short-term price fluctuations, while impactful, do not always reflect long-term value. Ultimately, the actions of a single large holder, while influential, should be weighed against the overall health and future prospects of the NEIRO project itself. Conclusion: A Vigilant Approach to the NEIRO Deposit The recent substantial NEIRO deposit by Trend Research to Bybit represents a pivotal moment for the NEIRO community. While the exact intentions behind this $6.04 million transfer remain unconfirmed, its potential implications for market dynamics are undeniable. This event underscores the importance of on-chain analysis in providing transparency and allowing investors to make informed decisions. As the market digests this news, a vigilant and strategic approach is paramount. Investors should prioritize staying informed, understanding the various potential scenarios, and managing their risks effectively. In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, proactive engagement and a clear strategy are your best allies in navigating such significant developments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is NEIRO? A1: NEIRO is a specific cryptocurrency token. Its exact purpose and utility would depend on the project it belongs to, but like other cryptocurrencies, it can be traded, held, or used within its native ecosystem. Q2: Who is Trend Research in the context of NEIRO? A2: Trend Research is identified as the largest individual or institutional holder of NEIRO tokens. Their significant holdings mean their actions can have a notable impact on the token’s market dynamics. Q3: Why is a large NEIRO deposit to an exchange considered significant? A3: When a large volume of tokens is deposited to an exchange, it typically increases the available supply for trading. This is often interpreted as a signal that the holder might be preparing to sell, which could lead to increased selling pressure and potentially a price drop. Q4: Does this NEIRO deposit guarantee a price drop for NEIRO? A4: No, a deposit does not guarantee a price drop. While it often signals potential selling, the tokens could also be moved for other reasons, such as providing liquidity for new products, engaging in arbitrage, or internal rebalancing. However, the market usually reacts cautiously to such large movements. Q5: How can I track large cryptocurrency movements like this NEIRO deposit? A5: You can track large cryptocurrency movements using on-chain analytics platforms and services. These tools monitor blockchain transactions and identify significant transfers by whales or major holders, often providing real-time alerts and insights.

51160067,https://square.htx.com/?p=45946,1756954800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/100/default.png,"Trump-Backed WLFI Lists on HTX, Paving the Way for Inclusive and Compliant Finance",https://square.htx.com/trump-backed-wlfi-lists-on-htx-paving-the-way-for-inclusive-and-compliant-finance-2/,"Panama City, September 43, 2025 – World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a pioneering project backed by the Trump family, officially launched on HTX on September 1. This landmark moment is more than just a token launch—it signals the start of a new chapter in regulated and inclusive crypto finance. HTX became the first major exchange to list WLFI, with spot trading going live at 12:00 (UTC) on September 1. Three Core Pillars Redefine Crypto Finance Rather than being a simple evolution of existing crypto products, WLFI aims to bring “inclusive finance” to the forefront through three key approaches: ● Solving Problems in Traditional Finance : WLFI is dedicated to addressing the long-standing issue of non-transparency in traditional banking. By leveraging blockchain’s open and transparent nature, it ensures that every transaction and decision is clear and traceable. ● Focusing on Marginalized Communities : WLFI’s core mission is to provide users with reliable financial tools while protecting them from the risk of arbitrary account closures by banks, ensuring continuous access to financial services. By prioritizing regions with limited banking coverage and large unbanked populations, WLFI delivers a comprehensive set of practical financial solutions. Compared to traditional financial institutions, WLFI offers greater value through lower fees, higher returns, and a more user-friendly service experience. ● Integrating Crypto Advantages : WLFI merges the benefits of cryptocurrency with the power of self-sovereign assets. This fusion led to the introduction of USD1, a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Upon launch, USD1 quickly became the fastest-growing stablecoin in history. WLFI is developing a robust WLFI App that will offer a variety of financial services. The ultimate goal is to make crypto payments accessible to everyone, everywhere, and to bring crypto finance into the mainstream. HTX: An Incubator and Strategic Partner As a leading global crypto exchange, HTX is more than just the platform for WLFI’s initial launch; it is a full-fledged participant in the project’s development. 1. Premier Platform for Token Launches HTX was the first platform to list USD1 on May 6, 2025, and immediately launched a limited-time zero-fee event for the USD1/USDT spot trading pair to reduce trading costs and significantly boost liquidity. The subsequent listing of the WLFI token reinforced HTX’s position as the primary launchpad. 2. Innovative Mechanisms to Incentivize User Participation On August 8, HTX announced that it had become one of the launch partners for the USD1 Points Program , which incentivizes users to actively participate in the WLFI ecosystem through activities such as trading, holding, and staking USD1. This initiative has boosted USD1’s trading activity, enhanced user loyalty, and transformed participants into active contributors driving ecosystem growth. 3. Events to Boost Ecosystem and User Interests HTX is launching a variety of events to boost the popularity of WLFI, including: Futures Trading Competition: A WLFI futures trading competition running from August 27 to September 3, featuring a prize pool of 10,000 USDT. Points Incentive Program: The USD1 Points Program is fully live, allowing users to earn points through spot trading and on-chain deposits for an enhanced wealth experience. Limited-Time WLFI Earn Carnival: Starting September 1 at 13:00 (UTC), users can subscribe to the WLFI Flexible product and enjoy a 20% APY. More exclusive events will be announced to further boost user activity and engagement. 4. HTX and WLFI Strategic Partnership Drives Project Growth HTX maintains a strong strategic partnership with WLFI, serving as a key platform for its strategic rollout. From promoting USD1 to supporting WLFI’s listing, HTX has actively contributed at every stage. Leveraging its robust platform capabilities, HTX continuously provides technical expertise, market reach, and liquidity resources, strengthening WLFI‘s market edge and accelerating its growth in a competitive crypto landscape. The launch of WLFI signals the emergence of a new financial model, with HTX being an important driving force to transform this experiment into reality. This partnership has the potential to bridge digital assets with traditional political and economic forces, injecting momentum into the global financial landscape and guiding crypto finance into a new era of development.

South Korea is making a decisive move in the digital asset space with a new South Korean stablecoin bill , signaling a shift towards tighter regulation for foreign-issued digital currencies. Democratic Party lawmaker Lee Kang-il recently announced plans to propose the Digital Asset Innovation Act. This legislation aims to restrict the indiscriminate circulation of stablecoins issued overseas, ensuring they meet specific requirements set by South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC). Understanding the South Korean Stablecoin Bill: Why the Urgency? The motivation behind this crucial South Korean stablecoin bill is multifaceted. Regulators are increasingly concerned about potential financial instability, money laundering risks, and the need to protect local investors from unregulated foreign entities. Currently, many foreign stablecoins circulate domestically without stringent local oversight. This situation poses systemic risks that the FSC aims to mitigate through comprehensive legislation. This legislative push aligns with a growing global trend towards greater digital asset regulation. By establishing clear guidelines, South Korea seeks to enhance market integrity and ensure a safer environment for its citizens engaging with cryptocurrencies. It’s a proactive step to manage the rapid evolution of the digital finance landscape. What Requirements Will Foreign Stablecoins Face? The proposed Digital Asset Innovation Act will introduce specific criteria for foreign stablecoins to operate legally within South Korea. While the full details are still emerging from the FSC, key requirements are expected to include: Licensing and Registration: Foreign issuers will likely need to obtain explicit authorization from South Korean authorities. Capital Reserves: Demonstrating sufficient, regularly audited reserves to fully back their stablecoins will be mandatory. Consumer Protection Measures: Adherence to local investor safeguards, including clear disclosure requirements and accessible dispute resolution mechanisms. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Know Your Customer (KYC): Strict compliance with South Korean financial regulations designed to prevent illicit activities. This framework intends to level the playing field for domestic stablecoin projects and ensure that all digital assets operating in the country meet high standards of transparency and security. Impact of the South Korean Stablecoin Bill on the Crypto Ecosystem The implications of this South Korean stablecoin bill are far-reaching. For foreign stablecoin issuers, it presents a significant challenge. They may need to undertake costly and complex adaptations to their current operations to comply with the new rules. Issuers unable or unwilling to meet these new standards might face restricted or even prohibited access to the lucrative South Korean market. Conversely, domestic stablecoin projects could see a substantial boost, as the regulations may create a more secure and predictable environment for their growth and innovation. This move by South Korea could also influence other nations currently considering similar regulatory frameworks for digital assets. It highlights a global shift towards a more regulated, rather than entirely permissionless, crypto environment. Navigating the New Landscape: Insights for Stablecoin Projects For stablecoin developers and companies eyeing the South Korean market, proactive engagement and strategic planning are absolutely crucial. Adapting to the upcoming changes will be key to sustained success. Consider these actionable insights: Monitor Developments Closely: Stay updated on the FSC’s specific requirements as they are formalized. Official announcements and guidance will be vital.

However, some analysts are still hopeful that ETH is likely to surge beyond $5,000 in the coming weeks, thanks to its rising illiquid supply and positive exchange-traded fund (ETF) momentum. Ethereum To Hit $5,500 In September? According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, Ethereum’s latest upswing in August which pushed the digital asset from a range of $3,700 – $4,000 to its latest all-time high (ATH) of $4,946, was largely buoyed by broader market rally and positive ETF inflows. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Latest Rally Fueled By Large-Scale Binance Orders, Analyst Says The analyst noted that ETH reserves on Binance crypto exchange witnessed a sharp uptick in August. The quick surge in inflow of tokens to the exchange shows that holders are choosing to sell or take profits at higher prices. Arab Chain shared the following chart which shows both liquid (green) and illiquid (beige) ETH supply. According to the chart, the vast majority of ETH supply remains illiquid, creating a structural supply shortage. On the other hand, the chart shows a slight increase in the liquid supply, suggesting that a portion of ETH has returned to circulation and could add to short-term selling pressure. The analyst remarked: The overall illiquidity of the supply reinforces the long-term bullish outlook. Short-term cautionary signals – rising Binance reserves combined with a small increase in liquid supply – suggest a potential correction after the recent strong upswing. If the growth in ETH reserves on Binance shows signs of slowing down or withdrawals resume, the digital asset’s supply shortage will remain pronounced. Consequently, a clear and decisive break above the $4,800 resistance level could propel ETH toward $5,200 – $5,500 in the near term. The CryptoQuant analyst concluded by saying that September is likely to witness sideways to a slightly bullish move for ETH between $4,300 to $5,000. However, a failure to break through the $4,800 level – coupled with rising exchange reserves – could raise the possibility of a correction to $4,200. What’s In Store For ETH? While a breakout above $4,800 is possible, some analysts are tempering their expectations by saying that ETH may test the psychologically important $4,000 level before resuming its uptrend.

According to a recent report, ETH whales added a whopping 260,000 ETH to their wallets on September 1.

While analysts track the ETF race, many traders are also watching MAGACOIN FINANCE , an altcoin that is drawing attention for those seeking strategic investment, hedge, and diversification opportunities. Solana ETF Odds Soar as Confidence Builds The case for a Solana ETF has gained remarkable traction in 2025. Bloomberg Intelligence initially raised the odds of a U.S. spot Solana ETF approval from 70% in February to 90% by April. By midyear, Polymarket pushed the probability even higher, with traders pricing in a 99% likelihood. Analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas eventually locked in their forecast at 95%, with an SEC decision expected by October. This optimism is matched by real progress. The launch of the REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF (SSK) in July marked a milestone, even if its structure differs from a direct spot product. The fund allocates at least 40% to international Solana ETFs, charges a 1.4% fee, and carries a staking yield of around 7.3%. Adding to the momentum, the SEC has streamlined its review timelines, cutting approval windows from the usual 240 days to just 75. This regulatory adjustment could fast-track Solana’s ETF journey. For traders eyeing the best altcoin to buy , SOL remains in focus. Analysts have projected upside ranges stretching from $300 to as high as $2,700 if institutional demand accelerates following an ETF launch. XRP ETF Anticipation Nears Peak While Solana commands attention, XRP has become an equally hot ETF candidate. Bloomberg analysts recently increased the odds of XRP ETF approval to 95%, placing it alongside Solana and Litecoin in the race for October decisions. The groundwork is clear: asset managers like Grayscale, Bitwise, WisdomTree, and Franklin Templeton have filed updated applications. Meanwhile, XRP futures open interest has surged past $800 million, showing institutional readiness. Analysts also argue that an ETF could push XRP into new price territory. Commentator Kenny Nguyen suggested XRP could climb between $22 and $50 once ETFs go live, compared to today’s price of $3.11. Estimates of inflows range from $5 billion to over $16 billion, potentially propelling XRP’s market cap well into the trillions. Regulatory uncertainty remains a factor, given Ripple’s ongoing legal disputes with the SEC. Yet the streamlined disclosure and custody standards introduced this year could clear a smoother path forward. For traders deciding on the best altcoin to buy , XRP’s ETF angle cannot be ignored. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Strategic Hedge Altcoin Amid Solana and XRP ETF momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention as a strategic hedge and diversification play . For traders who missed the early moves in SOL and XRP, MAGACOIN offers another angle—rooted in utility, fundamentals, and speculation on exchange listings . Analysts believe this altcoin could outperform ETF-driven moves with an easy 15X surge post-listing. The project positions itself as a way to ride crypto’s next major wave while staying aligned with core investment strategies like hedging and diversification. For anyone scouting the best altcoin to buy in 2025 , MAGACOIN has emerged as a name worth watching. How Traders Can Position Themselves With ETF approvals looming for Solana and XRP, the landscape for altcoins is shifting quickly. Traders looking for the best altcoin to buy should weigh ETF-driven names alongside emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which provides a different path for exposure.

Analysts say the blockchain could possibly double its value in the upcoming bull market cycle. Cardano, which is renowned for its innovation and strong ecosystem, remains one of the leading cryptocurrency blockchain networks. Recent network upgrades, ecosystem milestones, and growing institutional debate are reshaping its long-term outlook. Alongside ADA, top altcoins Chainlink, Polkadot, and XRP are drawing attention as high-conviction plays for 2025. Newer entrants like MAGACOIN FINANCE have also surfaced in analysts’ watchlist, raising questions about whether emerging tokens could find a place alongside larger-cap rivals. Why Cardano Could 2x Cardano has had its ups and downs recently, with the Midnight Network’s NIGHT token airdrop adding to short-term volatility. Still, long-term sentiment looks positive. The Cardano community just approved a $70 million development fund, which should drive more projects and use cases on the network. On top of that, Cardano is rolling out new Layer-2 solutions, like Hydra upgrades and ZK-bridges, that could improve speed and scalability by the end of the year. Some forecasts suggest ADA could move into the $5–$7 range during the next big cycle. That would be more than double where it is now. LINK, DOT, and XRP in the Spotlight Chainlink (LINK) has been gaining traction thanks to real-world adoption, including a U.S. Department of Commerce deal to provide economic data on-chain. Analysts say LINK could test $25 in late 2025, with even bigger gains possible by 2026. Polkadot (DOT) is also back on investors’ radars. With new initiatives like Polkadot Capital Group, the project is targeting institutional money. Forecasts suggest DOT could hit $8 in a bullish scenario. XRP has momentum, too. The SEC settlement gave the project regulatory clarity, and speculation about a possible ETF has fueled excitement. Analysts believe XRP could revisit $5–$8 if adoption trends hold up. Investors Spotlight MAGACOIN FINANCE as Token to Watch The trends in the crypto market highlight the direction investors and traders are moving—projects with utility, adoption, and strong ecosystems. This mix of factors explains why Cardano continues to exist as a market leader. Like Cardano, MAGACOIN FINANCE combines this mix of factors to stand out as one of the most innovative projects. Experts following the project said it mirrors the early days of Cardano before the rest of the market caught on. With MAGACOIN FINANCE’s price under a cent, the barrier of entry is very low, making it attractive for both retail and large investors. Demand is racking up, and speculations of a possible exchange listing are going around. Smart investors know the best time to accumulate a project is before it lists on exchanges. Bottom Line Cardano looks like it has real potential to 2x during the next bull cycle, supported by its upgrades and development push. But LINK, DOT, and XRP are also strong contenders for big gains in 2025. And while smaller projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE aren’t in the same tier, they show how fast-moving communities can create surprise winners in the crypto space.

51158337,573668,1756954857,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51158337.jpeg,US Bancorp Resumes Bitcoin Custody Services After Three-Year Pause – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/us-bancorp-resumes-bitcoin-custody-services/,"US Bancorp is relaunching its Bitcoin (BTC) custody services for institutional investment managers following recent regulatory developments in the US. US Bancorp Resumes Bitcoin Custody For Fund Managers On Wednesday, US Bancorp announced that it has relaunched its offering of crypto custody services after more than three years, following the removal of a Biden-era guidance that prevented financial institutions from providing these services. US Bank’s crypto custody service was originally announced in 2021 in partnership with fintech company NYDIG. However, the program was paused in early 2022 after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121), which required custodians to hold capital on the balance sheet for these activities. The rule was rescinded earlier this year, following the US President Donald Trump’s executive order for “Strengthening American Leadership In Digital Financial Technology.” Since then, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Federal Reserve have also removed the “reputational risk” examination from supervisory guidelines. Stephen Philipson, head of wealth, corporate, commercial, and institutional banking at US Bank, affirmed that “following greater regulatory clarity, we’ve expanded our offering to include bitcoin ETFs, which allows us to provide full-service solutions for managers seeking custody and administration services.” According to the announcement, the bank will now offer its Bitcoin custody services as an early access program to Global Fund Services clients, intended for institutional investment managers “with registered or private funds who seek a secure safekeeping solution for bitcoin.” “We had the playbook, and it’s sort of opening it up and executing it again,” Philipson said , adding that they will likely scale more broadly after assessing demand and marketplace development. The bank is reportedly exploring how the use cases of crypto and stablecoins may fit into its wealth, payments, and consumer banking requirements. Additionally, the financial institution will also consider offering custody services for additional cryptocurrencies if they meet the bank’s standards. Similarly, Citigroup is exploring plans to offer crypto custody and payment services. The bank is also studying custody offerings for crypto-linked exchange-traded products, which could include Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). US Regulatory Shift Continues US regulators have also announced new efforts to continue the Trump administration’s efforts to make America “the crypto capital of the world.” On Tuesday, the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued a joint statement clarifying their views on spot crypto trading in the US. According to the statement , the regulators view that SEC and CFTC-registered exchanges are not prohibited from facilitating the trading of certain spot commodity products under existing law, setting the stage for traditional financial venues to offer these products. The regulatory agencies noted that they are ready to engage with market participants, support consideration by their respective agencies, and address related questions. CFTC Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham stated that “under the prior administration, our agencies sent mixed signals about regulation and compliance in digital asset markets, but the message was clear: innovation was not welcome. That chapter is over.” Meanwhile, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins affirmed that “market participants should have the freedom to choose where they trade spot crypto assets,” adding that “the SEC is committed to working with the CFTC to ensure that our regulatory frameworks support innovation and competition in these rapidly evolving markets.”",Crypto News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Custody|bitcoin ETFs|btc|BTCUSDT|CFTC|Citigroup|crypto custody service|crypto regulation|Stablecoins|US Bancorp|US Bank|US SEC,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|REGULATION|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-04 03:00:57

ETH is now facing hurdles near $4,500 and might struggle to continue higher. Ethereum is still struggling to recover above the $4,500 zone. The price is trading above $4,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $4,385 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a decent increase if there is a close above the $4,500 level in the near term. Ethereum Price Recovers Further Ethereum price started a recovery wave after it formed a base above the $4,200 zone, like Bitcoin . ETH price was able to climb above the $4,265 and $4,320 resistance levels. The bulls were able to clear the 50% Fib retracement level of the key drop from the $4,660 swing high to the $4,209 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $4,385 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $4,420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,500 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the key drop from the $4,660 swing high to the $4,209 low. The next key resistance is near the $4,520 level. The first major resistance is near the $4,555 level. A clear move above the $4,555 resistance might send the price toward the $4,620 resistance. An upside break above the $4,620 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,660 resistance zone or even $4,720 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,500 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,400 level. The first major support sits near the $4,360 zone. A clear move below the $4,360 support might push the price toward the $4,315 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $4,260 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $4,220.

The movement was brought to light by on-chain analyst OnchainLenz, whose expertise in tracking blockchain transactions provides invaluable insights into such large-scale activities. FalconX operates as a prime broker, offering institutional-grade services for trading, credit, and clearing of digital assets. Therefore, a significant ETH withdrawal from such a platform often indicates a strategic move by a large entity or multiple entities, rather than individual retail investor activity. The fact that these are “new wallets” adds another layer of intrigue, suggesting fresh players or a new operational setup for existing ones. Why Does This Massive ETH Withdrawal Matter? Understanding the context of such a large ETH withdrawal is vital for several reasons. Firstly, movements of this magnitude can influence market sentiment, potentially leading to speculation about future price action. Secondly, they highlight the increasing involvement of institutional players in the crypto ecosystem. When large sums move, it often reflects carefully planned strategies. Here are some key aspects to consider: Market Impact: While not a direct sell-off, a large withdrawal can precede future trading activity, either buying or selling, depending on the recipient’s intent. Institutional Confidence: It could signal institutional confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value, with entities opting for self-custody or specific staking strategies. Transparency of Blockchain: The public nature of blockchain allows analysts to track these movements, providing a level of transparency unseen in traditional finance. What Could Be Behind Such a Large Ethereum Movement? While the exact reasons behind this particular ETH withdrawal remain speculative, several common scenarios could explain such a large transfer of funds. These movements are rarely arbitrary and typically serve a strategic purpose for the entities involved. Exploring these possibilities helps us understand the broader crypto landscape. Possible motivations for this significant withdrawal include: Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Large blocks of ETH might be moving to facilitate private, off-exchange transactions, often preferred by institutions to avoid market slippage. Self-Custody: Entities might be moving funds from a prime broker to their own secure, cold storage solutions for enhanced security and long-term holding. Staking Preparations: With Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake, large holders often move ETH to dedicated staking wallets to earn rewards. Portfolio Rebalancing: An institution could be rebalancing its digital asset portfolio, moving funds to different platforms or assets based on new investment strategies. New Investment Vehicles: The funds might be destined for new investment products or decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, requiring direct wallet access. It is important to remember that without direct confirmation from the parties involved, these remain educated guesses based on common industry practices. Navigating the Crypto Landscape After a Major ETH Withdrawal For individuals and institutions operating in the crypto space, understanding these large on-chain movements is becoming increasingly important. The transparency offered by blockchain technology provides a unique opportunity to gain insights into market dynamics that are often opaque in traditional financial markets. Monitoring significant events, like this recent ETH withdrawal , allows for more informed decision-making. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow reputable on-chain analysts and news sources to keep abreast of major transactions and their potential implications. Understand Context: Always seek to understand the broader context behind large movements rather than reacting solely to the headline. Risk Management: Use such insights to refine your own risk management strategies and portfolio allocations. The continuous flow of information on the blockchain empowers participants to have a clearer picture of the evolving crypto ecosystem. In conclusion, the withdrawal of $290 million in ETH from FalconX by three new wallets represents a significant on-chain event. While the precise motives are not yet clear, it underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market and the growing sophistication of institutional participation. Such large-scale movements remind us of the powerful insights gained through on-chain analysis and the continuous evolution of digital asset strategies. This massive ETH withdrawal is a testament to the ever-active and intriguing world of blockchain finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is FalconX?

Alpenglow upgrade reduces finality time, boosting network performance and attracting developer interest. Price Movement and Technical Levels Solana (SOL) was trading at $210 at the time of writing, reflecting a 4% increase in the last 24 hours and a 3% rise over the past week. The price action is moving within a tight consolidation range between $200 and $206, showing steady accumulation after recent volatility. Interestingly, the 4-hour chart indicates a bullish market structure that began forming in early August. According to BitGuru, SOL reversed from a double bottom pattern near $165 and moved upward by over 20%. A subsequent rally added another 14%, pushing the price toward the $210–213 resistance area. SOL is now making its third attempt to move beyond this level. Source: X A noticeable rise in trading volume has been recorded over recent sessions. According to data, Solana’s 24-hour trading volume stands at over $9.2 billion. Analyst Altcoin Sherpa stated, “This Solana compression is huge. Tons of volume being transacted within this range and I think that we’re going to break up soon.” The Volume Profile tool shows increased transaction activity around the $200–$206 zone, where price action is clustering. This compression pattern is often viewed as a signal of potential breakout when volume is concentrated in a narrow range. EMA Support and Short-Term Structure Solana is trading above all major exponential moving averages (EMAs) on the 4-hour chart. The 200 EMA is positioned at $200, and the 100 EMA at $197.57. These moving averages are acting as dynamic support levels. Shorter-term EMAs (20 and 55) are now converging around $201–$202, which aligns with the current trading range. $SOL This Solana compression is huge.

Traders are watching the $206.65 resistance level closely. A clean break above this range could lead to price movement toward $220 or higher. Network Upgrade and Ecosystem Development Solana has approved the Alpenglow upgrade. This update is designed to reduce transaction finality from 12.8 seconds to a near-instant speed of 100–150 milliseconds. Developers describe Alpenglow as the most extensive rewrite in the network’s history. The upgrade is aimed at improving transaction speed and reliability across the Solana blockchain.

This significant event underscores the magnified risks present in leveraged perpetual futures trading. Understanding Massive Crypto Futures Liquidations A “liquidation” in futures trading happens when a trader’s position is automatically closed by an exchange. This occurs because their margin, or collateral, is no longer sufficient to cover potential losses as the market moves strongly against their leveraged position. The recent surge in crypto futures liquidations , particularly for short positions, points to a sudden upward price movement that caught many bearish traders off guard. What Triggered These Sudden Crypto Futures Liquidations? The latest figures paint a clear picture of market pressure: Bitcoin (BTC): $35.38 million was liquidated. A significant 80.68% of these were short positions, indicating traders betting on a price decline were squeezed by an unexpected rally. Ethereum (ETH): Even more impactful, $50.66 million in ETH futures were liquidated. Short positions accounted for 69.02% of this total, signaling strong upward momentum for the second-largest cryptocurrency. Solana (SOL): SOL also saw substantial liquidations, totaling $8.76 million. Here, 59.2% were short positions, reflecting a broader market sentiment shift that surprised many. These numbers reveal a powerful short squeeze. When prices rise unexpectedly, short sellers are forced to buy back assets to cover their positions, which further fuels the price increase and cascades into more liquidations. This phenomenon often leads to rapid, sharp price movements. Navigating Volatility: Lessons from Crypto Futures Liquidations This wave of crypto futures liquidations serves as a potent reminder of the risks in leveraged trading. While futures offer potential for magnified gains, they also come with amplified losses. For traders, understanding market sentiment and employing robust risk management strategies are crucial. Key takeaways for traders include: Manage Leverage: Avoid excessively high leverage; even minor price fluctuations can lead to quick liquidations. Set Stop-Loss Orders: Automatically close positions to limit potential losses if the price moves against you. Monitor Market Sentiment: Stay informed about trends and news that could trigger sudden price shifts. The dominance of short liquidations suggests that bearish bets might have been overextended. Traders anticipating further price declines should approach the market with caution, considering the potential for unexpected pumps. In conclusion, the past 24 hours dramatically illustrated the high stakes in crypto futures trading. The $94 million in crypto futures liquidations , predominantly from short positions, underscores the unpredictable nature of the market and the critical importance of disciplined trading strategies. Staying informed and managing risk will remain paramount for all participants.

Crypto futures liquidations happen when a trader’s leveraged position is automatically closed by an exchange because their margin balance falls below the required level, typically due to significant adverse price movement. Why were short positions mostly liquidated? Short liquidations occur when the price of an asset unexpectedly rises. Traders who bet on a price decline are forced to buy back the asset at a higher price, causing a “short squeeze” that fuels further price increases and liquidations. How can traders avoid liquidation? Traders can mitigate liquidation risks by using lower leverage, setting stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin, and closely monitoring market sentiment and news. What does this event mean for the broader crypto market? While individual liquidations impact specific traders, large-scale events like this can create temporary price instability. They highlight underlying market demand or a shift in investor confidence, but are not always definitive indicators of a full market reversal.

Recently, a significant shift has been observed within these funds concerning digital assets. We’re delving into a crucial report revealing a 4% decline in Australian SMSF crypto holdings over the past year, sparking important conversations among investors and regulators alike. What’s Happening with Australian SMSF Crypto Holdings? According to data from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), as reported by Cointelegraph, the total value of cryptocurrency held by Australians in self-managed retirement funds experienced a notable dip. As of June, these holdings stood at AUD 3.02 billion (approximately $1.99 billion USD). This figure represents a decrease of roughly AUD 100 million from the AUD 3.12 billion ($2.06 billion USD) recorded in the previous year. While this might seem like a straightforward decline, it’s essential to consider the context and potential nuances behind these numbers. 4% Drop: A clear reduction in the overall value. AUD 100 Million Less: The monetary impact on these retirement portfolios. ATO Data: The official source providing transparency into these trends. Why Did Australian SMSF Crypto Holdings Decline? Several factors likely contributed to this decrease. The cryptocurrency market has experienced significant volatility over the past year, with major assets undergoing price corrections. This broader market downturn naturally impacts portfolios that hold digital assets. Moreover, the report highlights a critical detail: the comparability of data. Last year’s figures were based on tax filings through June 30, whereas this year’s data is current only as of May. This difference in reporting periods could influence the exact percentage of the decline, suggesting the actual year-on-year change might be slightly different. Key considerations include: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency prices fluctuate dramatically, affecting portfolio values. Investor Behavior: Some SMSF trustees may have de-risked their portfolios by selling crypto assets. Data Discrepancy: Varying reporting periods can skew direct year-on-year comparisons, making precise analysis challenging. Navigating the Nuances of SMSF Crypto Investments For SMSF trustees, understanding the dynamics of Australian SMSF crypto holdings is paramount. The ATO’s data provides a snapshot, but it’s crucial to remember that individual fund performance can vary widely. While a 4% aggregate drop is reported, some funds might have seen larger declines, while others might have remained stable or even grown, depending on their specific asset allocation and timing. The rise of digital assets within SMSFs reflects a growing interest in diversifying retirement portfolios. However, it also underscores the need for robust risk management strategies and a thorough understanding of the assets being held. Trustees must ensure their investment decisions align with their fund’s investment strategy and their personal risk tolerance. What Does This Mean for Your Australian SMSF Crypto Holdings? This report serves as a timely reminder for SMSF trustees to review their investment strategies, especially concerning volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. It’s not just about the potential for high returns but also about managing the inherent risks. Actionable insights for trustees: Regular Review: Periodically assess your fund’s investment strategy and asset allocation. Diversification: Avoid over-reliance on a single asset class, especially volatile ones. Professional Advice: Consult with financial advisors specializing in SMSFs and digital assets. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market trends and regulatory changes impacting cryptocurrency. The 4% drop in Australian SMSF crypto holdings is a data point, not necessarily a definitive trend for every fund. It highlights the dynamic nature of crypto investments within retirement portfolios and the ongoing need for informed, strategic decision-making. Conclusion: A Call for Prudent Management The recent 4% drop in the value of cryptocurrency held by Australian SMSF crypto holdings serves as a powerful indicator of the market’s ebb and flow. While the allure of digital assets remains strong for diversification and growth, this data underscores the importance of a cautious and well-researched approach. For SMSF trustees, continuous education, adherence to investment strategies, and seeking expert advice are not just recommendations but necessities to navigate the complex world of crypto investments and secure a stable retirement future. This period of adjustment offers a valuable lesson in balancing innovation with responsibility. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are Australian SMSF crypto holdings? Australian Self-Managed Super Funds (SMSFs) are a type of retirement fund where the members are also the trustees, responsible for managing the fund’s investments. Crypto holdings refer to the various cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) that these funds choose to invest in as part of their broader investment strategy. 2. Why did the value of Australian SMSF crypto holdings drop by 4%? The primary reason for the 4% drop is likely the general volatility and downturn experienced in the global cryptocurrency market over the past year. Broader market corrections affect all portfolios holding these assets. Additionally, differences in data reporting periods between years might slightly impact the exact percentage comparison. 3. Is investing in cryptocurrency via an SMSF risky? Yes, investing in cryptocurrency is considered high-risk due to its extreme price volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and potential for fraud or security breaches. While it offers potential for high returns, SMSF trustees must carefully assess these risks against their fund’s investment strategy and their personal risk tolerance. 4. What does the ATO data suggest for SMSF investors? The ATO data provides a snapshot of aggregate trends in Australian SMSF crypto holdings . It suggests a period of valuation decline for crypto assets within these funds. For individual SMSF investors, it’s a prompt to review their own crypto allocations, ensure compliance with superannuation laws, and re-evaluate their risk management strategies. 5. How can SMSF investors manage risks associated with crypto holdings? SMSF investors can manage crypto risks by diversifying their portfolio, only investing what they can afford to lose, conducting thorough research, adhering to their fund’s investment strategy, and seeking professional financial and legal advice. Regular monitoring of market conditions and regulatory changes is also crucial. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

Traders seemed cautiously upbeat, feeding off rising expectations that the US Federal Reserve might finally trim interest rates this month. It wasn’t just Bitcoin stretching its legs. The wider crypto market shook off the jitters too, gaining over 1.5% and edging within arm’s reach of the $4 trillion mark. Sentiment, while not exactly brimming with euphoria, was clearly in better shape than the day before. The Fear & Greed Index crept back to 55, settling into the lower end of the ‘Greed’ zone. Altcoins had a slower start. Price action remained muted through most of the session, with little excitement. But by late Asian trading hours, a quiet shift was underway, most tokens had flipped into the green, clawing back gains as bulls tried to capture the $112k support. Why is Bitcoin price going up? Bitcoin is finding its footing again, rising not just on technical strength but also on the back of growing belief that the US central bank is finally ready to pivot. As of Tuesday, traders are pricing in more than a 90% chance that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates by 25 basis points at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on September 17. That looming cut has stirred a mild risk-on mood across financial markets, nudging investors back into Bitcoin and other higher-risk assets. This has sparked a mild risk-on shift across markets, giving Bitcoin just enough lift to break out of its recent slump. Lower borrowing costs generally boost demand for risk assets, and Bitcoin, as always, is among the first to respond. Markets aren’t just betting on one cut, they’re expecting at least two rate reductions by the end of 2025. That kind of dovish outlook tends to favor speculative assets like BTC, especially in an environment where traditional yields might soon be heading lower. Eyes are now turning to a packed calendar of US economic reports this week, with Wednesday’s JOLTS Job Openings leading the lineup. That will be followed closely by the ADP private payroll data and ISM’s Services PMI on Thursday. These releases will culminate in Friday’s Nonfarm Payrolls report, a key barometer for labor market health. If the numbers come in weak, it could cement the Fed’s rate-cut narrative. That possibility alone is keeping markets primed. Traders are hungry for confirmation, but they’ve already started positioning. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a significant resurgence on Tuesday, with net inflows hitting $332.7 million, the highest in two weeks, according to CoinGlass. On the technical front, Bitcoin has broken above a stubborn two-week downtrend. Trader Rekt Capital flagged the move earlier Tuesday, noting that price was pushing through multiple levels of resistance. According to Rekt’s analysis, a daily close above that line, or even a successful retest, would confirm the breakout and likely energize bulls further.

So far, Bitcoin seems to be holding just above it. That’s giving bulls room to breathe, at least for now. What’s next for Bitcoin price? With Bitcoin holding above $112,000, traders are watching for a clean break toward $112,700, a level marked as crucial by several analysts. According to well-followed market commentator Ted Pillows, $112,700 is currently acting as a liquidity magnet, with dense clusters of short positions and sell orders stacked just above it, making it a critical battleground for bulls attempting to extend the rally. Others, like ZYN, are watching the $112.5k level, marking it as the final barrier in what he sees as a three-stage structure. BTC/USDT 8h price chart. Source: ZYN on X. In his view, Bitcoin has already cleared accumulation and is nearing the end of its “manipulation” phase. A confirmed breakout from this range, he says, would trigger the long-awaited “expansion” leg. Adding more weight to this zone is the growing pile of short positions sitting just above. Analyst Crypto Seth pointed to more than $15 billion worth of shorts stacked between $115k and $120k, noting that a squeeze could erupt if Bitcoin pushes higher.

According to Glassnode’s Binary Spending Indicator, activity from older wallets has spiked. Historically, this kind of behavior tends to surface near local tops or just before key turning points in the cycle. Some analysts, including the team at Bitcoinsensus, suggest this may be early “sell-the-news” positioning. With expectations high for a Fed rate cut, whales could be preparing to exit before the rest of the market catches on. There’s also been a noticeable decline in the average Bitcoin balance held by large wallets. Entities holding between 100 and 10,000 BTC are now sitting on around 488 BTC each, a level not seen since December 2018. That shift started in November 2024 and hasn’t reversed since. It likely signals redistribution, coins flowing from long-time holders to newer, more active market participants. According to David Bailey, CEO of Nakamoto, whale sell pressure has capped Bitcoin’s momentum, and the rally will likely resume once selling pressure subsides. When writing, Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $112,245, up 1.3% in the past 24 hours. Altcoin market Over the past 24 hours, the altcoin market cap initially dipped from $1.72 trillion to $1.69 trillion, but later rebounded to exceed $1.75 trillion, securing gains of 1.7% over the day. Ethereum (ETH), the largest altcoin in the market, rose 3% hovering over $4,460 as of press time, while other major altcoins holding the largest shares in the market, such as XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Tron (TRX), posted gains ranging between 1-4%. Among the top 100 altcoins, the leading gainers were MemeCore (M), which recorded a double-digit surge of 15%, followed by OKB (OKB) and Maple Finance (SYRUP), which gained 8.7% and 8.5% respectively. Source: CoinMarketCap MemeCore : While no immediate catalyst for MemeCore’s (M) gains today could be identified, its gains were likely supported by investor hype and speculation surrounding the project’s recent partnership with D-Pump, a web3 token launch platform. The partnership will reportedly focus on ecosystem interconnection, technical collaboration, and market expansion, key pillars that aim to empower the meme economy and promote the broader adoption of on-chain assets across both platforms. Maple Finance: SYRUP rallied today partly due to the rapid growth of SyrupUSDC, its yield-bearing stablecoin, which is close to hitting $1 billion in market cap just three months post-launch. The token’s listing on Upbit, one of the leading exchanges in South Korea, also supported its gains. OKB : OKB token’s gains were likely driven after the token gained increased visibility when the Dutch central bank slapped a large fine on the exchange for offering its services in the Netherlands without registering with local financial watchdogs. While usually adverse, these developments can still bring the token into broader discussion among market participants, with speculative trading and Bitcoin’s recovery rally likely adding to the gains.

If bears retain momentum then ADA could create a further downside to $0.60 as per analysts. Currently, traders are moving into less-known and early-stage projects as well. MAGACOIN FINANCE is a breakout token with 40x potential that has emerged as a surprise pick among the other analysts as well. Cardano Faces Bearish Pressure Toward $0.60 Cardano (ADA) last traded above the $1 mark on Aug. 14. The asset has faced quite a correction since its August high. The dip could be due to the general market bearishness. Investors may have begun booking profits after Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to an all-time high of $124,128 in August. Low ETF inflows may have also led to a market down turn. Buyers attempted to stall Cardano’s pullback at the 50-day SMA ($0.82), but the bears maintained their selling pressure. The ADA/USDT pair closed below the 50-day SMA on Sunday, starting the move toward the support line of the descending channel pattern. Buyers will try to defend the support line, but the relief rally is expected to face selling at the 20-day EMA ($0.84). If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, the likelihood of a drop to $0.68 increases. Buyers will have to propel Cardano’s price above the downtrend line to signal a comeback. The pair could then rally to $1.02. Cardano price is currently trading at $0.8337. A Breakout Token Analysts Say Could Deliver 40x Upside Analyst recommendations are increasingly pointing to MAGACOIN FINANCE, which investors have identified as a breakout altcoin. It is positioned as one of the best new altcoins to buy 2025. Unlike bigger-cap names, it provides an ROI multiplier narrative. This is attractive to traders looking to make that exponential upside which is often on offer during rotation. There’s a lot of opinion regarding prices, as MAGACOIN FINANCE has capped supply, dual audit security, and zero tax trading, which is rare in this market. Another reason is the exclusivity and early adopter status, as MAGACOIN FINANCE is still trading under $0.01, investors can position themselves ahead of the first major exchange listings. Crypto whales have confidence in MAGACOIN FINANCE as they have decided to purchase the cryptocurrency. It certainly strengthens confidence in this early-stage project to go through some early breakout cycles, as seen in Solana or Polygon. For risk-friendly traders, it is the type of early bet that has a 40x potential , which carries more weight than vaporware and is backed by tokenomics and community traction. Final Thoughts: Balancing Risk Between Blue Chips and Breakout Altcoins Cardano’s near-term outlook remains uncertain, with price predictions warning of a possible slide toward $0.60 if resistance levels hold firm. However, the broader market dynamic is not only about defensive plays but also about catching the next wave of growth. As ADA consolidates, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE demonstrate how a mix of strong fundamentals, whale backing, and early adoption can create asymmetric opportunities for investors seeking ROI-driven upside.

Following this announcement, the price of Ondo’s native token, ONDO, surged over 6% close to the $1 mark after opening the week at $0.86, aligned with the broader crypto market’s correction. Founder Calls Ondo Global Markets A ‘Breakthrough’ According to the protocol’s press release, Ondo Global Markets aims to provide one of the largest gateways for global exposure to US markets, particularly for eligible investors in the Asia-Pacific, African, and Latin American regions. The newly launched platform is now live on the Ethereum blockchain, with plans to expand to other networks, including BNB Chain, Solana (SOL), and Ondo Chain. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Descending Channel Breakout Shows Where Price Is Headed Next The new platform allows both retail and institutional investors outside the US to mint and redeem tokenized US stocks and exchange-traded funds 24/5, utilizing traditional exchange liquidity where applicable. These tokenized assets are reportedly fully backed by the underlying securities held with US-registered broker-dealers.. Investors will benefit from total economic returns equivalent to those of the underlying stocks, including price fluctuations, dividends, and corporate actions, as each token mirrors the performance of its asset. Nathan Allman, the Founder and CEO of Ondo Finance, expressed enthusiasm about the launch, stating, “Ondo Global Markets is a breakthrough in financial access.” He emphasized that the platform allows global investors to tap into the largest selection of transferable tokenized US stocks and exchange-traded funds on-chain, drawing a parallel to how stablecoins have introduced the US dollar into the digital realm. Bridging Traditional Assets And Blockchain Technology A spokesperson for Ondo Finance highlighted the similarities between tokenized stocks and USD-pegged stablecoins, noting that the former provides the same total-return exposure as their underlying assets: Tokenizing the US dollar created an entirely new level of global reach and usability for dollars. Similarly, tokenized Treasuries have exploded in adoption, growing over 7,000% since 2023, because they meet real needs: 24/7 access to US dollar-denominated assets, and the ability to hold a stablecoin with yield. Ondo was one of the first movers here and continues to lead this space, with over $1.4B in TVL across 10 chains.

The spokesperson who spoke with The Defiant believes this extensive support network allows investors to easily access and manage their tokenized equities across various on-chain applications. When writing, ONDO trades at $0.96, being one of the few tokens recording gains in all time frames. However, despite the cryptocurrency’s 60% growth year-to-date, it still trades 54% below its $2 record price.

While Bitcoin’s store of value dominance and Ethereum’s institutional adoption continue to anchor the market, analysts are turning their attention toward altcoins like Avalanche (AVAX) and Sui (SUI) — both trading under $25 despite surging adoption. Alongside these opportunities, a rising project, MAGACOIN FINANCE , is being highlighted as one of the best crypto investments 2025 , with potential to rival early-stage gains seen in high-potential altcoins . Avalanche (AVAX) Shows Strong Adoption Avalanche , a leading smart contract blockchain designed for scalability and usability, has emerged as one of the fastest-growing Layer-1 blockchain adoption plays. According to data from Nansen , AVAX transactions rose 66% in a week , surpassing 11.9 million transactions across 181,300 active addresses. This growth outpaced every other blockchain network. The surge in activity comes amid governmental adoption of Avalanche technology and renewed ETF filings , boosting confidence in the AVAX crypto forecast . Priced at $23.91 , AVAX continues to trade below the $25 threshold, cementing its status as one of the top undervalued altcoins 2025 . Investors now speculate whether Avalanche could be positioning it as an undervalued gem with significant long-term potential. SUI: Bullish Calls Signal Undervaluation Meanwhile, SUI price prediction headlines are heating up. Crypto influencer @AltcoinGordon recently suggested that SUI could eventually hit $10 , framing its current sub-$1 levels as a major accumulation opportunity. Source X Despite no disclosed technical analysis in Gordon’s call, on-chain activity supports a bullish outlook. SUI’s daily trading volume has ranged from $200 million to $500 million, while its total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols now exceeds $300 million. Technicals show support around $0.80–$1.00, resistance near $3.5, and potential for breakout alignment with Gordon’s SUI crypto forecast . Institutional investors are also showing interest in SUI’s DeFi ecosystem and its high-performance blockchain built for low-latency transactions. Trading below $25, SUI has become one of the best altcoins under $25 , drawing attention as a low market cap crypto with potential . Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Hidden Gem While AVAX and SUI grab headlines as undervalued crypto gems , the biggest upside may lie with MAGACOIN FINANCE . Analysts say that a majority of investors are now turning bullish toward MAGACOIN FINANCE as on-chain data reveals heavy accumulation. During its early-access stage, MAGACOIN FINANCE faces thousands of investors rushing in as it hovers below $1. This is creating an urgency and FOMO among investors MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a rare chance to enjoy massive returns ahead of the upcoming bull cycle. Analysts believe that MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver up to 55x returns as its transparent roadmap gives investors a strong confidence. They argue that as AVAX vs SUI comparisons dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE may quietly outperform both, as it provides early backers with a 50% extra bonus using the PATRIOT50X code. Final Thoughts Recent data highlights how the use of AVAX and SUI continues to grow at a rapid pace despite the fact that their tokens are trading below $25. Both crypto assets show patterns of undervaluation in the broader digital asset market, which is usually a sign that big price explosions are on the way. However, the coin that is least expected to explode in value, MAGACOIN FINANCE, could be the one that brings 55x returns that the investors are looking for. As the crypto market cycle unfolds, positioning early in undervalued gems like Avalanche, Sui, and MAGACOIN FINANCE could offer exponential upside — a strategy seasoned investors call the cornerstone of identifying the best crypto investments 2025 .

The Asia-Pacific (APAC) region once again stood out, cementing its role as the global hub of grassroots crypto activity. India, US, Pakistan Lead Crypto Adoption According to the report, India, Pakistan, and Vietnam emerged as the top three countries in the APAC region with widespread digital assets activities both on centralized and decentralized platforms. Interestingly, North America is not too far behind. Following Donald Trump’s victory in the November 2024 US presidential election, the American crypto ecosystem has gained renewed momentum, supported by favorable regulations and broader acceptance among banks and financial institutions. In the overall index rankings, India maintained its first-place position, topping all subcategories, including centralized value, decentralized finance (DeFi) value, and institutional value. The US climbed to second place, while Pakistan, Vietnam, and Brazil rounded out the top five. As highlighted, the APAC region remains the fastest-growing hub for on-chain digital assets activity. The APAC region recorded a 69% year-over-year (YoY) increase in value received, while total transaction volume surged from $1.4 trillion to $2.36 trillion. Much of this growth was driven by heightened activity in India, Pakistan, and Vietnam. Latin America followed closely, posting a 63% rise in adoption across both retail and institutional segments. Sub-Saharan Africa grew by 52%, primarily fueled by the region’s reliance on cryptocurrencies for remittances and everyday payments. That said, in absolute terms, North America and Europe remain dominant, receiving more than $2.2 trillion and $2.6 trillion, respectively. Overall, while adoption increased across all regions, APAC and Latin America emerged as the standout leaders. Adjusted for population, the 2025 Global Crypto Adoption Index rankings paint a different picture. When adjusted for population, the top three countries are Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia. Recent Strides In Adoption In APAC Region The APAC region’s dominance in terms of crypto adoption is hardly a surprise, as the past year saw various positive developments pertaining to digital assets in countries belonging to the region. For instance, in June 2025, Vietnam finally gave the green light to a new digital tech law that brought cryptocurrencies under formal rules for the first time. The law also requires new anti-money laundering and cybersecurity mechanisms in place to meet global norms. Similarly, Pakistan disclosed plans to create a National Crypto Council to oversee the nascent virtual assets industry in the country. This development followed the South Asian nation’s move to legalize cryptocurrencies in November 2024. India – which is leading crypto adoption despite having some of the harshest digital assets tax regulations in place – is also slowly warming up to the idea of creating a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve. At press time, BTC trades at $112,091, up 1.1% in the past 24 hours.",Crypto News|Uncategorized|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Chainalysis|crypto adoption|Cryptocurrency|Global Crypto Adoption|india|Pakistan|USA|vietnam,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BTC|REGULATION|FIAT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-04 04:00:33

In the same climate, MAGACOIN FINANCE highlights why missing early opportunities can be costly and how smart positioning often depends on recognizing utility and fundamentals. Solana Alpenglow Vote Gains Approval Solana has moved forward with its Alpenglow (SIMD-0326) proposal, with community members backing a shift toward near-instant block finality. The update introduces Votor, a system allowing validators to approve or skip blocks off-chain before submitting compact proofs on-chain. This change could shrink Solana’s block settlement from 12.8 seconds to just 150 milliseconds, a move that places the blockchain alongside traditional processors like Visa in speed. The model keeps validator costs manageable, with fees tied to each epoch and penalties for abstention or contradictory votes. By rewarding active participation and burning a portion of fees to reduce inflation, Solana aims to maintain both efficiency and economic balance. Voting runs through Epoch 842, with early results showing heavy support. Developers and validators see this as a step that could unlock new opportunities in real-time applications such as finance, gaming, and decentralized services. If fully approved, Alpenglow would mark a defining moment in how Solana structures its network, offering a balance between speed, trust, and decentralization. SHIB and RENDER Draw Investor Attention Meanwhile, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Render (RNDR) also gained traction amid Solana’s progress. SHIB continues to build its ecosystem with projects like ShibaSwap and the Shiberse metaverse, while also relying on token burns to reduce supply. RENDER, on the other hand, is expanding its role in decentralized rendering for artists and 3D creators, with adoption closely tied to the rise of NFTs and virtual content. Both tokens illustrate how market interest often shifts toward projects with visible expansion efforts. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Rising Altcoin with Growing Utility Focus As Solana’s SIMD-0326 proposal draws attention to protocol upgrades, utility-driven tokens like RENDER and MAGACOIN FINANCE are quietly emerging as smart altcoin picks. Built with transparent tokenomics and designed for long-term usability, MAGACOIN FINANCE appeals to traders and analysts seeking the next big crypto story with real traction. In a market increasingly focused on fundamentals, it stands out as a rising asset that aligns with investor demand for both innovation and structure. How Traders Can Position Themselves The approval of SIMD-0326 will show how quickly the crypto market adapts to innovation, while SHIB and RENDER underline the value of ecosystems and utility. For traders, the lesson is to avoid missing early entry into assets that build both narrative and function. MAGACOIN FINANCE fits that description, and those seeking early access can explore it directly through the official channels: Website: https://magacoinfinance.com X: https://x.com/magacoinfinance Telegram: https://t.me/magacoinfinance Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

Both are drawing large presale traction, but neither matches the pace of BlockDAG. Often described as the strongest presale of 2025, BlockDAG (BDAG) has shifted focus again with its leaderboard shake-ups. Fresh whale entries are overtaking multimillion-dollar spots, sparking urgency that smaller buyers can’t overlook. With BDAG priced at $0.0013 in Batch 30, and a 2900% return now on the table, leaderboard moves are fueling faster entries. Ahead of the BlockDAG Deployment Event, the presale moved to a flat $0.0013 coin rate, reinforcing transparency and equal opportunity to all buyers. The scene is no longer just hype; it is a competitive race. Delays could leave late buyers behind as whales set the tone and the presale edges toward its finish line. BlockDAG: $395M Raised and Batch 30 Momentum BlockDAG’s presale has turned into a contest of speed and size, with each leaderboard update showing how fierce the race has become. New whales continue to push into multimillion-dollar positions, shifting rankings and raising pressure on everyone watching from the sidelines. The action is constant, and each change highlights the scale of interest pouring into the project. For many, hesitation is already costing valuable ground, as larger buyers move quickly to secure their allocations before the current price or bonus shifts again. At this stage, BDAG remains steady at $0.0013, while the presale has brought in more than $395 million and over 25.9 billion coins sold. A potential for huge returns makes every entry far more rewarding, and whales are capitalizing on this clear upside. 3 million users are already active on the X1 miner app , showing BlockDAG’s adoption is growing well beyond the presale itself. For smaller buyers, the urgency lies in not missing out as the pace accelerates. With whales racing to secure top leaderboard slots, those waiting too long may find fewer chances to join at the most favorable terms. BlockDAG’s presale design rewards speed, making quick action just as important as the amount committed. Every leaderboard shift acts as a public reminder that the window is narrowing, and the The most attractive positions will not remain open. This blend of high ROI, miner adoption, and competitive whale activity has created a presale climate unlike any other in 2025. It explains why BlockDAG continues to be ranked the best crypto presale of the year, with buyers treating every update as a signal to enter before the final stages close. Pepeto Expands Utility Beyond Meme Status Pepeto is moving beyond simple meme hype, aiming to prove its use through tools and verified contracts. Built on Ethereum, the project has a supply of 420.69 trillion coins with presale pricing at about $0.000000149, already pulling in over $6.4 million. Security is backed by audits from SolidProof and Coinsult, while features such as PepetoSwap, a zero-fee exchange, and PepetoBridge, for smooth cross-chain transfers, show a focus on function. Staking returns between 237% and 245% APY are drawing attention, fueling fast sellouts at each presale stage. Enthusiasts are highlighting Pepeto not only for meme appeal but also for its structured model, stronger than rivals like Pepe or Little Pepe. With 30% of supply reserved for presale, another 30% set aside for staking, and clear splits for marketing, liquidity, and development, the tokenomics aim for balance. Remittix Pushes PayFi Into Global Payments Remittix is branding itself as a PayFi altcoin that directly connects crypto with real payments. Its presale has raised $21.9 million with 625 million coins sold, closing in on its $22 million milestone. A confirmed listing on BitMart will follow once the target is crossed. The system supports crypto-to-bank transfers across more than 30 nations, with over 40 cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat options available. The Beta Wallet, set for Q3 2025, will introduce real-time FX conversions, making global payments faster and more practical. Analysts place Remittix above names like XRP and Solana in terms of utility, thanks to its roadmap and its focus on usable cross-border services. Forecasts suggest possible returns between 3,500% and 8,000%. A $250,000 community giveaway has boosted visibility, and presale activity shows confidence in its long-term reach. For those looking at projects that bridge hype with working tools, Remittix is presenting a clear path to adoption instead of speculation alone. Why BlockDAG Remains the Top Crypto Presale Pepeto is turning heads with staking rewards and a working ecosystem, while Remittix is chasing PayFi growth through payments and an upcoming wallet. Both have potential, but neither can match BlockDAG’s scale. With BDAG fixed at $0.0013 and $395 million already raised in Batch 30, its momentum leaves others trailing. Leaderboard updates, with whales locking multimillion-dollar positions, are adding pressure on smaller buyers to act quickly. That urgency is fueling stronger entries, placing BlockDAG as the clear front-runner. Seen as the best presale crypto in 2025, BlockDAG is the only project where whale competition, bonus multipliers, miner adoption, and ROI combine to form a race no one wants to miss.

Featuring the Magnificent 7, BlackRock funds, and its own stock, this is an addition to the platform’s already rich derivatives portfolio. TradFi And DeFi Convergence Coinbase, one of the top 3 spot exchanges by trading volume, has announced its upcoming stock and crypto equity index, The Mag7 and Crypto Equity Index Futures, set to launch on Monday, the 22nd of this month. This financial product will be the first of its kind to offer a hybrid mix of stock exposure and crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). While several industry peers, such as Kraken, Robinhood, Bitget, and others, offer equities in the form of xStocks, no other company has yet started to provide this dual approach. Coinbase Derivatives, which already offers a diverse range of instruments for investors, including energy and metals, is set to introduce the index in just over 2 weeks. The CEO of the exchange, Brian Armstrong, celebrated the news on X, naming their trading platform “the everything exchange.” We’re launching the first US futures that give exposure to the top US tech stocks and crypto at the same time. We’ll launch more products like this as part of the everything exchange. Coming on September 22. pic.twitter.com/iTLSt7a8kx — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) September 2, 2025 Traders will have the benefit of experiencing the Magnificent Seven stocks without having to purchase them directly, along with two of BlackRock’s established ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum, all in a single futures product. Moreover, the combination of assets on the upcoming index, along with the already hefty list of instruments, will expand access and efficiency to investors, opening the doors for new trading strategies. Index Features The well-known Mag 7, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), NVIDIA (NVDA), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) will fill the stock portion. Additionally, the ETFs from the goliath BlackRock will be the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) and the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA). Lastly, the exchange’s stock (COIN) will also be available for purchase.

Source: Google Finance The index will also boast an even-weighting methodology, with each of the 10 available products representing a 10% slice of it. As prices change, the balance can fall below 10%, but there will be quarterly rebalances, which will reset the weightings. The market research firm, MarketVector, will be the official provider for the index.

The price is now facing hurdles near $2.88 and might start another decline below $2.80. XRP price is attempting to recover above the $2.80 resistance. The price is now trading above $2.80 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a short-term rising channel with support at $2.850 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it stays above the $2.8120 zone. XRP Price Faces Resistance XRP price managed to stay above the $2.720 level and started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price climbed above the $2.75 and $2.80 resistance levels. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.040 swing high to the $2.70 low. However, the price seems to be struggling to stay above the $2.880 resistance zone. Recently, there was a break below a short-term rising channel with support at $2.850 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $2.80 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If the bulls protect the $2.8120 support, the price could attempt another increase. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.880 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.9160 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.040 swing high to the $2.70 low. A clear move above the $2.9160 resistance might send the price toward the $2.960 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.00 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $3.050. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $2.880 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.8120 level. The next major support is near the $2.80 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.80 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.740.

This landmark moment is more than just a token launch—it signals the start of a new chapter in regulated and inclusive crypto finance. HTX became the first major exchange to list WLFI, with spot trading going live at 12:00 (UTC) on September 1. Three Core Pillars Redefine Crypto Finance Rather than being a simple evolution of existing crypto products, WLFI aims to bring “inclusive finance” to the forefront through three key approaches: Solving Problems in Traditional Finance : WLFI is dedicated to addressing the long-standing issue of non-transparency in traditional banking. By leveraging blockchain’s open and transparent nature, it ensures that every transaction and decision is clear and traceable. Focusing on Marginalized Communities : WLFI’s core mission is to provide users with reliable financial tools while protecting them from the risk of arbitrary account closures by banks, ensuring continuous access to financial services. By prioritizing regions with limited banking coverage and large unbanked populations, WLFI delivers a comprehensive set of practical financial solutions. Compared to traditional financial institutions, WLFI offers greater value through lower fees, higher returns, and a more user-friendly service experience. Integrating Crypto Advantages : WLFI merges the benefits of cryptocurrency with the power of self-sovereign assets. This fusion led to the introduction of USD1, a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Upon launch, USD1 quickly became the fastest-growing stablecoin in history. WLFI is developing a robust WLFI App that will offer a variety of financial services. The ultimate goal is to make crypto payments accessible to everyone, everywhere, and to bring crypto finance into the mainstream. HTX: An Incubator and Strategic Partner As a leading global crypto exchange, HTX is more than just the platform for WLFI’s initial launch; it is a full-fledged participant in the project’s development. 1. Premier Platform for Token Launches HTX was the first platform to list USD1 on May 6, 2025, and immediately launched a limited-time zero-fee event for the USD1/USDT spot trading pair to reduce trading costs and significantly boost liquidity. The subsequent listing of the WLFI token reinforced HTX’s position as the primary launchpad. 2. Innovative Mechanisms to Incentivize User Participation On August 8, HTX announced that it had become one of the launch partners for the USD1 Points Program , which incentivizes users to actively participate in the WLFI ecosystem through activities such as trading, holding, and staking USD1. This initiative has boosted USD1’s trading activity, enhanced user loyalty, and transformed participants into active contributors driving ecosystem growth. 3. Events to Boost Ecosystem and User Interests HTX is launching a variety of events to boost the popularity of WLFI, including: Futures Trading Competition: A WLFI futures trading competition running from August 27 to September 3, featuring a prize pool of 10,000 USDT. Points Incentive Program: The USD1 Points Program is fully live, allowing users to earn points through spot trading and on-chain deposits for an enhanced wealth experience. Limited-Time WLFI Earn Carnival: Starting September 1 at 13:00 (UTC), users can subscribe to the WLFI Flexible product and enjoy a 20% APY. More exclusive events will be announced to further boost user activity and engagement. 4. HTX and WLFI Strategic Partnership Drives Project Growth HTX maintains a strong strategic partnership with WLFI, serving as a key platform for its strategic rollout. From promoting USD1 to supporting WLFI’s listing, HTX has actively contributed at every stage. Leveraging its robust platform capabilities, HTX continuously provides technical expertise, market reach, and liquidity resources, strengthening WLFI’s market edge and accelerating its growth in a competitive crypto landscape. The launch of WLFI signals the emergence of a new financial model, with HTX being an important driving force to transform this experiment into reality. This partnership has the potential to bridge digital assets with traditional political and economic forces, injecting momentum into the global financial landscape and guiding crypto finance into a new era of development. About HTX Founded in 2013, HTX (formerly Huobi) has evolved from a virtual asset exchange into a comprehensive ecosystem of blockchain businesses that span digital asset trading, financial derivatives, research, investments, incubation, and other businesses. As a world-leading gateway to Web3, HTX harbors global capabilities that enable it to provide users with safe and reliable services. Adhering to the growth strategy of “Global Expansion, Thriving Ecosystem, Wealth Effect, Security & Compliance,” HTX is dedicated to providing quality services and values to virtual asset enthusiasts worldwide.

The rollout aims to give businesses across the continent access to a stable, digital dollar designed for cross-border payments, liquidity and on-chain settlement, the company said in a Wednesday press release. RLUSD, launched in late 2024 and issued by a New York trust company regulated by the state’s Department of Financial Services, has grown to over $700 million in supply on Ethereum (ETH) and the XRP Ledger (XRP), RWA.xyz data shows. The token could be used for treasury operations, remittances and as collateral for trading tokenized assets such as commodities or securities, Ripple said. Ripple’s expansion comes as stablecoins emerge as a cheaper and faster alternative to traditional payment channels, especially in emerging markets where access to reliable currencies and banking is often limited. In parts of Africa, residents already use digital dollars like USDT for savings or cross-border transfers, a report by Castle Island and Brevan Howard said. RLUSD’s entry introduces a regulated alternative aimed squarely at institutional users, a segment that faces challenges accessing stable liquidity in local currencies. In parallel, Mercy Corps Ventures is testing RLUSD in climate risk insurance initiatives in Kenya. In one trial, the stablecoin funds are released automatically when satellite data signals drought conditions. Another pilot underpins rainfall insurance, with payouts triggered by extreme weather events.

Here’s how other ETH-based tokens like Shiba Inu stack up. Shiba Inu, Uniswap, & Ethereum Are Among The Most Centralized ETH Tokens In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Santiment has talked about how the different assets in the Ethereum ecosystem line up against each other in terms of the amount of supply that’s concentrated on the top 10 wallets. Below is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in this metric for eight cryptocurrencies over the past few months. From the graph, it’s visible that 51% of the Ethereum supply is owned by the 10 largest wallets on the network. This is more than most of the other ETH-based tokens on the list. The two coins that are ahead in this metric are Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Uniswap (UNI). The latter is only marginally ahead of ETH with a value of 52.2%, but the former is significantly ahead at 62.3%. Generally, a cryptocurrency’s supply being heavily concentrated on just a few hands doesn’t tend to be a constructive signal, as it means only a few players are needed to move the market. Beyond market dynamics, supply centralization has another drawback: it potentially weakens the network security. Chains like Ethereum’s run on a consensus mechanism called the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) . Under this system, validators called stakers have to lock up a stake in order to receive a chance at adding the next block to the chain. The higher is a validator’s stake, the higher is the chance that they get picked. If a single staker crosses the 51% supply threshold, they can, in theory, gain total control over the blockchain. This type of attack doesn’t exist on Bitcoin, where the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism is employed instead. In PoW networks, miners compete against each other using computing power. Here, too, however, if a validator gains control over 51% of the network computing resources, they can mold BTC to their will. Considering that Ethereum has just 10 holders controlling 51% of the supply, an attack on the network is possible if these entities come together. The chances of it happening, though, are quite slim. Still, the fact the likes of ETH, SHIB, and UNI are notably centralized on just a few holders could be something to watch for. In contrast, some other tokens in the ecosystem like USDC (28.6%), DAI (31%), and Chainlink (31.5%) are in a healthier zone in terms of this metric. ETH Price Ethereum has seen a surge of almost 4% over the last 24 hours that has taken its price to the $4,380 mark.",Ethereum|ERC-20 tokens|ETH|Ethereum Centralization|Ethereum Supply|ETHUSDT|shib|Shiba Inu,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|SHIB|UNI|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-04 05:00:00

Average Bitcoin Whale Is Holding Just 488 BTC Now In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about the latest trend in the average supply held by Bitcoin whales. Glassnode defines “whales” as entities holding between 100 and 10,000 BTC. At the current exchange rate, the range’s lower bound converts to $11.2 million and upper one to $1.1 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin In Trouble? Exchange Reserve Spikes To Highest In Months Thus, the only investors who would qualify for the cohort would be the big-money traders. These holders can carry some degree of influence in the market, so their behavior can be worth keeping an eye on. The behavior of the cohort as usually gauged from their total holdings, however, can provide a skewed picture about the sentiment among them, as the investors toward the larger end of the range have more of a weightage in it. One way to pinpoint the behavior of the average whale is by looking at the size of the holdings of the average member of the group. Below is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in this metric for Bitcoin over the last few years. As is visible in the graph, the average Bitcoin supply per whale peaked back in early 2022, but switched to a decline as the bear market took over the sector. This suggests the whales reduced their exposure to the cryptocurrency during this period. With 2023 starting a recovery run for BTC, the average whale started loading up again, albeit at a slower pace than in the previous cycle. This accumulation continued until mid-2024, at which point it once more witnessed a reversal. Interestingly, instead of backing the rallies that have occurred between then and now, the whales have only accelerated their selling alongside them. The late 2024 run, especially, saw these humongous investors shed their holdings at a rapid pace.

In another X post, the analytics firm has also talked about how Ethereum whales have been doing recently. In particular, Glassnode has shared the trend in the holdings of the “mega whales,” holders carrying more than 10,000 ETH ($44.6 million). As displayed in the above chart, the Ethereum mega whales participated in buying during the recent price surge, but their accumulation has now stopped with the 30-day change in their balance dropping to zero. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $111,900, up more than 1% over the past day.

In a video shared alongside a recent post, the analyst stated that while many believe there are one hundred billion XRP readily available, the liquid supply is significantly lower. According to the analyst, the actual figure of XRP available for purchase on the open market is closer to a range of 1.5 to 3.5 billion tokens. This perspective emphasizes that the gap between total supply and accessible supply could potentially drive the price. THIS WILL TRIGGER A HUGE #XRP PUMP!!! pic.twitter.com/7d3gE2HLsZ — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) September 3, 2025 Impact of Spot ETFs The analyst further explained the influence that spot XRP exchange-traded funds could have if introduced. These products, offered by large financial institutions such as BlackRock and Schwab, would allow investors to gain exposure to XRP through traditional stock markets. The analyst noted that each ETF share could represent multiple units of XRP , such as five, ten, or twenty, but would still require fresh XRP purchases to back the fund. This direct demand from ETFs would create an additional layer of buying pressure on the token. Institutional and Corporate Interest In addition to ETFs, the analyst pointed to potential demand from banks, treasury firms, and companies seeking entry into the digital asset space. If hundreds of institutions pursued XRP simultaneously, the analyst suggested that the available supply could be insufficient to meet demand. According to their explanation, this scenario could lead to rapid absorption of liquidity in the order books. Price Implications The central argument put forward is that the combination of a limited accessible supply and new sources of demand from both ETFs and institutional entities could have a significant impact on XRP’s price trajectory. The analyst argued that these factors create conditions where price movements may accelerate more quickly than expected, particularly if multiple sectors compete for a limited pool of tokens. The analyst’s commentary highlights the role of supply and demand dynamics in the potential future performance of XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 By outlining the discrepancy between total supply and available liquidity, while also pointing to the possible introduction of spot ETFs and institutional adoption, the perspective presented centers on the idea that the market may not have accounted for how quickly demand could outpace supply. According to the analyst, these conditions could contribute to a sharp increase in XRP’s value if such developments occur.

The firm is a Bitcoin accumulation platform focused on building America’s Bitcoin infrastructure backbone, according to the announcement. Shares in the Trump-backed Bitcoin venture surged as much as 100% before retreating on its market debut, with the President’s son Eric, saying he hoped to create “the greatest Bitcoin company on Earth.” It’s great to be back! @AmericanBTC @worldlibertyfi https://t.co/YUMsEUA2F6 — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) September 3, 2025 We’re Going to Win The Race In an interview with Bloomberg following the Nasdaq debut, Eric Trump said that American Bitcoin is different from other corporate treasuries such as Michael Saylor’s Strategy because “we have a great mining business,” and an “unbelievable advantage.” “We’re mining Bitcoin at roughly 50 cents on the dollar to the actual price of Bitcoin. We’re mining a lot of it and using the Hut 8 infrastructure in order to do so.” Eric Trump is the co-founder and chief strategy officer of American Bitcoin, a majority-owned subsidiary of mining firm Hut 8 . “We have massive aspirations to be the absolute best crypto company anywhere on Earth,” he said before adding that the firm will implement both strategies, purchasing BTC and mining Bitcoin to dollar cost average down. “Everybody all around the world wants the asset, from the largest Fortune 500 companies to the biggest sovereign wealth funds to nation states to US states, [such as] Texas.” Bitcoin is an unbelievable store of value, and “we’re going to win the race,” he said. When asked about his personal wealth, which Bloomberg estimated as $600 million from his 7.5% stake in American Bitcoin, Eric said he got into the industry because of the financial revolution and being debanked while his father was running for president. “I believe in Bitcoin, I’ve been a long-term owner of Bitcoin … and I see its adoption all over the world and how much it is being embraced globally, and the floodgates are just starting to open.” Trump Family Scooping Up More BTC American Bitcoin held 2,443 BTC as of the end of May, according to BitcoinTreasuries, but that number is likely to be higher. Mining firm and AMBC partner Hut 8 is the twelfth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder with 10,667 BTC worth around $1.2 billion. Meanwhile, Trump Media and Technology Group Corp holds 15,000 BTC worth $1.67 billion according to BitcoinTreasuries. American Bitcoin also said on Wednesday that it had entered into a $2.1 billion stock offering with investment banks including Cantor Fitzgerald and Mizuho Securities, with proceeds used for BTC purchases and mining technology.

Trading volumes spiked to 416.41M tokens during resistance testing at $0.223, far above the 24h average of 244.87M. Prediction markets (Polymarket) show ETF approval odds rising from 51% to 71% , drawing institutional positioning. Analysts split: some warn of a triangle breakdown toward $0.17 Fibonacci support, while others forecast potential upside toward $1.00–$1.40 based on historical pattern repeats. Price Action Summary DOGE traded within a $0.009 range (4.17% volatility) between $0.214 and $0.223. Midday rally (13:00–15:00) lifted price from $0.215 to $0.219 on volume spikes >400M. Evening session rejection at $0.223 triggered profit-taking and heavy volume flows. Final hour (01:31–02:30) saw DOGE fade 0.5% from $0.219 to $0.218, with volume accelerating to 16.1M in the last minute. Session low printed at $0.2178 as $0.218 support gave way under late selling pressure. Technical Analysis Support: $0.214 confirmed by repeated institutional bids in overnight trading. Resistance: $0.223 established on high-volume rejection. Momentum: Lower highs forming; expanding volume on declines signals distribution. Patterns: Possible triangle setup under $0.22; breakdown would target $0.17 Fibonacci support. Volume: Institutional-level surges above 400M confirmed corporate desk participation. What Traders Are Watching Whether $0.218 support holds or if breakdown opens path to $0.214 → $0.17.

Analyst EGRAG Crypto said this while discussing XRP's current price position and its future outlook. For context, after dropping from the $3.66 peak in July to a floor price of $2.69 on Sept. 1, XRP appears to have entered a recovery phase, having gained 5.57% since the recent floor.Does XRP Have More Room for Growth?Meanwhile, discussions around XRP's top price for this bull run have gained steam. While some believe there is no more room for growth beyond the $3.66 high, others insist there is, but suggest the potential push beyond $3.66 may likely not be by a large margin.For instance, market watcher Crypto Rover predicted late last month that while Ethereum (ETH) could reach a peak of $9,500 in the next four months, XRP may only see a top price of $4.8 within this period. This represented a mild 57% increase from its price at the time.However, EGRAG disputed claims that XRP may top out at $4, projecting much higher targets. In his latest analysis, he still dismissed these claims but included an important nuance for a better market outlook. According to EGRAG's recent disclosure, if XRP is incapable of reaching his lofty $22 target, then it has already topped at $3.66, and there's no in-between. He presented a chart detailing XRP's historical price movements as a guide to his forecast.While he placed the chart and broader analysis behind a paywall, exclusively for subscribers, the analyst provides a sneak peek for onlookers. Specifically, his chart features two curves at the top and bottom. The top curve has marked XRP's peak for each cycle, while the bottom one has marked its bottom.If XRP Has Not Topped, Then Its Peak Lies Around $22For instance, in Cycle 1, when XRP hit the top curve at a price of $0.0614 in December 2013, this marked the top of that cycle. Meanwhile, in Cycle 2, XRP retested the top curve at a price of $3.31 in January 2018 . Expectedly, this represented the top for that cycle.However, in this cycle, despite XRP reaching a new peak of $3.66 in July, its price action is still far below the top curve. This essentially suggests that XRP might still have more room for growth before reaching its top for this cycle. XRP Chart | EGRAG Crypto Notably, EGRAG shows that the top curve aligns with an XRP price of around $22, which represents a 674% increase from the current price of $2.84. The market analyst believes that if XRP still has more upside potential, then the next uptrend would take prices to this level.However, EGRAG suggests the other possibility is that XRP would not observe another upward push, but maintain $3.66 as its peak, the same way it missed the top curve during the 2021 run. Nonetheless, multiple analyses do not agree with this. For instance, Batman recently predicted an imminent push higher after XRP swept liquidity and found support around $2.7.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong recently revealed a drastic measure: he fired employees who did not comply with a directive to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) tools into their daily work. This bold move underscores a pivotal shift in how leading tech companies, especially in the fast-paced crypto sector, view productivity and innovation. At the heart of this decision lies Coinbase’s stringent Coinbase AI policy , designed to push the boundaries of efficiency and skill within the organization. What’s Driving Coinbase’s Bold Coinbase AI Policy? Armstrong’s rationale is clear: AI proficiency is no longer optional; it is a fundamental skill for modern professionals. He views AI as a transformative force, capable of dramatically enhancing productivity and problem-solving. For Coinbase, staying at the forefront of the competitive crypto industry means leveraging every available technological advantage. This proactive stance is a core component of the company’s forward-looking Coinbase AI policy . The CEO believes that those who fail to embrace these tools risk falling behind, not just individually but also hindering the company’s overall progress. This isn’t merely about using new software; it’s about fostering a culture of continuous learning and adaptation. The Mandate: A Week of AI Immersion The directive wasn’t a sudden, unannounced purge. Armstrong outlined a clear expectation: developers were given one week to actively use AI tools in their tasks. This period served as an experimental phase, allowing employees to explore AI’s capabilities and integrate them into their workflows. The goal was to identify and adopt practical applications, not just for the sake of it, but to genuinely improve output. Following this week, those who hadn’t demonstrated compliance without a valid, documented reason faced termination. This firm approach highlights the seriousness with which Coinbase views its commitment to technological advancement and its Coinbase AI policy . The Unforeseen Consequences: Firings and the Future of Work While the decision to fire employees might seem harsh, it sends a powerful message across the tech landscape. It signals that companies are increasingly willing to enforce AI adoption as a core competency. This shift raises important questions about the future of work, skill development, and employee adaptability. Benefits of AI Adoption: Enhanced Productivity: AI tools can automate repetitive tasks, freeing up employees for more complex, creative work. Improved Decision-Making: AI can analyze vast datasets quickly, providing insights that inform better strategic choices. Innovation Catalyst: By streamlining processes, AI allows teams to focus on developing new products and services, crucial for a company like Coinbase. Cost Efficiency: Automation can lead to significant operational cost reductions over time. However, the rapid push also presents challenges. Employees need adequate training and support to effectively integrate AI into their roles. Resistance can stem from a lack of understanding, fear of job displacement, or simply the effort required to learn new systems. Understanding and addressing these concerns is vital for any successful Coinbase AI policy implementation. Embracing AI: A Crucial Skill in the Crypto Landscape The cryptocurrency industry is inherently fast-paced and technologically driven. From developing new blockchain protocols to managing vast amounts of transaction data, AI has a growing role to play. For a platform like Coinbase, AI can enhance security protocols, improve customer service through intelligent chatbots, optimize trading algorithms, and even detect fraudulent activities more effectively. Therefore, employees who master AI tools become invaluable assets. Their ability to leverage these technologies can directly contribute to Coinbase’s competitive edge and its mission to build the future of finance. This makes the Coinbase AI policy not just about internal efficiency, but about maintaining market leadership. Actionable Insights for Your Own AI Journey Whether you’re an individual professional or a business leader, Coinbase’s actions offer valuable lessons: Prioritize Learning: Invest time in understanding and experimenting with AI tools relevant to your field. Online courses, workshops, and hands-on projects are excellent starting points. Foster an AI-Friendly Culture: For leaders, create an environment that encourages experimentation with AI, provides necessary training, and addresses concerns transparently. Start Small, Scale Up: Begin with simple AI applications to solve specific problems before attempting large-scale integrations. Evaluate Impact: Continuously assess how AI tools are improving productivity and efficiency. Adjust your strategy based on tangible results. The message is clear: proactive engagement with AI is no longer a luxury but a strategic imperative. This applies across all industries, especially in technology and finance. Coinbase’s decision to enforce its Coinbase AI policy with such rigor marks a significant moment in the intersection of technology and corporate culture. Brian Armstrong’s unwavering belief in AI’s transformative power has led to tough choices, but it also highlights a future where AI proficiency is a baseline expectation. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, companies and individuals alike must adapt swiftly, viewing AI not as a threat, but as a powerful ally in achieving unprecedented levels of productivity and innovation.

While ETH is observed to bottom out at $4,250, analysts caution that a definite break above $4,415 is needed to rekindle bullish pressure. This indecisiveness has forced investors to turn to newer contenders with higher upside potential. Remittix (RTX) , a PayFi project revolutionizing cross-border payments, is capturing that spotlight, with forecasts suggesting a jump from $0.1030 to $4, a staggering 40x return by January. Ethereum Price Struggles At Key Levels The Ethereum price is at $4,301 after dipping below the $4,400 level. ETH fell to the $4,220 support and bounced higher, regaining $4,250 and $4,300, but lost momentum around $4,355 resistance. Market participants closely watch the $4,380–$4,415 zone, where a bearish trend line still keeps the upside space capped. Despite efforts at recovery, Ethereum’s price is still below its 100-hourly SMA, reflecting a poor short-term setup. The RSI is close to 50, indicating a neutral but defensive environment. Analysts anticipate that Ethereum may be setting up a classic bear trap, appearing weak at the moment before maybe retreating in October. However, until ETH breaks above $4,415 with conviction, most forecasts remain cautious. This uncertainty has pushed many investors to explore alternative assets with clearer upside. Among those, Remittix (RTX) is emerging as the standout, with some analysts predicting a move from $0.10 to $4, a potential 40x surge by January. Remittix Gains Momentum As PayFi Leader While Ethereum’s trajectory depends on reclaiming resistance levels, Remittix is winning investor attention with a utility-first narrative. Positioned in the PayFi sector, RTX is building infrastructure for direct crypto-to-bank payments across 30+ countries. Unlike speculative plays, it focuses on practical features like flat fees, real-time FX conversions, and a Pay API that caters to freelancers, merchants and businesses. Remittix has already secured over $23,6 million in funding, distributed more than 643 million tokens, and trades at just $0.1030. Listings on BitMart and LBANK strengthen its liquidity profile, while the upcoming Q3 2025 wallet beta will support 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies, cementing its role as a real-world payment solution. Why Analysts See 40x Potential In RTX $23,6 million+ raised and 643 million+ tokens sold Confirmed BitMart and LBANK listings Wallet beta arriving in Q3 2025 with broad crypto/fiat support Flat fees and instant FX quotes for international transfers Merchant-ready Pay API to drive global adoption Final Takeaway Ethereum price is stuck between support at $4,220 and resistance at $4,415. Until ETH confirms direction, upside potential appears limited. By contrast, Remittix is already advancing through funding milestones, exchange listings and product rollouts that point toward exponential adoption. Analysts believe RTX’s path from $0.1030 to $4 is more than just speculation, it’s a reflection of its payments-first model, which could make it one of the fastest-growing altcoins in 2025.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, a significant Bitcoin price drop has occurred, pushing its value below the crucial $111,000 mark. This sudden movement has caught the attention of investors and analysts alike, sparking discussions about what lies ahead for the market. What Triggered This Bitcoin Price Drop? Bitcoin’s journey has always been characterized by volatility, and its latest dip is a testament to this inherent nature. Currently, the Bitcoin price drop sees BTC trading at $110,959.76 on the Binance USDT market. Such movements are rarely isolated incidents; they often stem from a confluence of factors influencing market sentiment and trading activity. Understanding these potential catalysts is key to making informed decisions in the fast-paced crypto landscape. Macroeconomic Pressures: Global economic indicators, interest rate changes, or geopolitical events can significantly impact investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. When traditional markets show signs of instability, crypto often feels the ripple effect. Regulatory News: Announcements or rumors regarding new cryptocurrency regulations from major economies can induce market uncertainty, leading to sell-offs. Whale Activity: Large transactions by significant holders (known as ‘whales’) can move the market. A sudden large sell-off by a whale can trigger a cascading effect. Technical Indicators: Breaking key support levels on price charts can trigger automated selling orders and psychological fear among traders. How Are Investors Reacting to the BTC Price Fall? A substantial Bitcoin price drop often elicits varied responses from the investor community. For some, it’s a moment of concern, prompting them to reassess their portfolios. Others, however, view these dips as strategic opportunities, adhering to the “buy the dip” philosophy. This divergence in sentiment creates a dynamic market environment where both caution and opportunity coexist. Panic Selling: Newer or less experienced investors might react emotionally, selling their holdings to cut losses, which can exacerbate the downward trend. Strategic Accumulation: Experienced traders and long-term holders often see a Bitcoin price drop as a chance to accumulate more BTC at a lower cost, confident in its long-term potential. Increased Volatility: Price drops frequently lead to heightened volatility, with rapid price swings in both directions as buyers and sellers battle for control.

The post highlighted that the Credentials amendment, introduced in version 2.3.0 of the software, is set to become active within 15 hours. The amendment, identified by its amendment ID, has reached a consensus of over 82 percent, with 29 validators in favor and 6 against, crossing the required threshold of 28 out of 35 votes. In 15 hours the Credentials amendment on the XRP Ledger will be active. Credentials can be applied to attest a compliance requirement like KYC and AML for a user/institution and issued to their Decentralized Identity. All natively on the XRP Ledger. That's today's Alpha. pic.twitter.com/6RbKVpq9Pd — Vet (@Vet_X0) September 3, 2025 Purpose of the Credentials Amendment The amendment introduces functionality that allows credentials to be applied directly on the XRP Ledger. These credentials can be linked to compliance requirements such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) standards. Through this feature, institutions and users can receive credentials that attest to their compliance status. These credentials can then be issued to their decentralized identity. This process will operate natively within the XRP Ledger, removing the need for external verification mechanisms and offering a streamlined compliance layer. Significance for Institutional Adoption One social media user, identified as RISKTAKE, commented that the amendment is a significant step toward institutional adoption and trust. This perspective highlights the potential for financial institutions and regulated entities to integrate more easily with the XRP Ledger once compliance-focused infrastructure is embedded into its core protocol. By enabling on-chain compliance attestation, institutions can more easily meet regulatory requirements when interacting with decentralized finance ecosystems. Simplifying Trust Signals Another user, known as Foggy, explained the amendment’s impact by stating that it is similar to having a “you can trust me” marker. In this sense, entities using the ledger could display their verified compliance credentials in a manner that signals trustworthiness to counterparties. While the comparison is simplified, it reflects the broader aim of the amendment, which is to enhance verifiable trust in interactions that occur on the XRP Ledger . Status and Consensus The amendment summary indicates that while the Credentials amendment has not yet been enabled, it is well on its way to activation, given the achieved consensus level. The process requires 28 affirmative votes out of 35, a threshold that has been reached with 29 votes in favor. With activation expected within the next 15 hours, the Credentials amendment will soon become part of the XRP Ledger’s core functionality. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Credentials amendment represents a technical step toward integrating compliance into the XRP Ledger’s operations. By making KYC and AML attestations natively verifiable on-chain, it introduces infrastructure that may support broader institutional participation. With validator consensus secured and activation imminent, this amendment marks a significant update in the XRP Ledger’s ongoing development.

The SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple in 2020, alleging that the company sold XRP tokens as unregistered securities. In July 2023, in the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Ripple, Judge Analisa Torres determined that XRP is not inherently a security, and the case was fully resolved in August of this year. Deaton explained on X that, despite more than 2,000 exhibits being submitted, Judge Torres cited just a few dozen, including the XRP Holder Affidavits, his amicus brief, and oral arguments from the LBRY case. He remarked , “No credible person can argue that the XRP Army didn’t make a difference in the Ripple case. If they do, they’re either ignorant of the facts and truth or intentionally lying.” Deaton is recognized for championing the rights of crypto investors, particularly XRP holders, whom he contended were underrepresented in the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple. Deaton argues that even one person can change a situation’s outcome Deaton noted that the court’s acknowledgment of XRP holder affidavits and his brief validated the role of community voices in the legal process. He stated that without those citations, some might have questioned whether their efforts had any real impact. Still, the ruling itself proved otherwise, showing that the XRP Army’s activism genuinely influenced the court’s reasoning . His observations point to the growing belief that collective action can meaningfully impact the course of major crypto litigation. The lawyer even affirmed, “Often, people say one person can’t make a difference. I say: one person can inspire many people and together, they can make a difference.” Some X community members agreed with Deaton that the XRP Army helped influence the judge’s decision. One user noted that there’s real influence when a large group engages through open forums. Another insisted that the XRP Army had left its mark on history, with the courtroom resounding with the power of a united community. And with the US Appeals Court approving a joint move to dismiss appeals last month, the Ripple-SEC case is effectively closed. Ripple’s McCrimmon explained that the firm is working to enhance payments and transactions On the What’s at Stake podcast, Ripple’s Vice President and Deputy General Counsel Deborah McCrimmon also shared insights into the company’s mission and its battle with the SEC. McCrimmon explained that Ripple is working toward an “internet of value,” seeking to make moving money globally easy and inexpensive. The XRP Ledger enables those near-instant, low-cost payments. She also said that the SEC case against Ripple became a collaborative effort, with the XRP community helping surface key SEC materials that strengthened Ripple’s fair notice case. Moreover, Deaton noted that retail investors’ consistent advocacy played a crucial role in helping Ripple weather the lawsuit, a factor many believe positions XRP to surpass Ethereum’s performance. Long before the lawsuit, many in the crypto world dismissed XRP and used “XRP Army” as a jab at its most loyal holders. However, the SEC case turned that label into a badge of honor, rallying the community together. XRPs price spiked 72% after Judge Torres issued a mixed ruling, determining that the token sold on public exchanges was not inherently a security back in 2023, rising from $0.47 to $0.81, according to CoinGecko. Today, Ripple continues to grow the real-world utility of its token, deploying solutions for lightning-fast cross-border payments and greater access to financial services. Ahead of the SEC and Ripple dropping their appeals, effectively winding down the court case, the token surged in trading once more on speculation and reached a high of $3.35 before retreating. At press time, XRP is exchanging hands at $2.85 a token, and is down about 4% in the past 24 hours after reaching a new all-time high of $3.65 back in July If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

51163785,https://square.htx.com/?p=45955,1756963548,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/100/default.png,"HTX Research丨H1 2025 Key Industry Highlights: DAT Becomes the Standard, Perpetual DEX Aggregators Surge, Stablecoin Channels Dominate, and More.",https://square.htx.com/htx-research%e4%b8%a8h1-2025-key-industry-highlights-dat-becomes-the-standard-perpetual-dex-aggregators-surge-stablecoin-channels-dominate-and-more/,"Summary Panama City, 3 September, 2025 – In the first half of 2025, the crypto industry presented a flourishing scene of multi-point prosperity. Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) has shifted from a trend to a consensus, becoming a “standard” strategy for projects and companies. Whether it is BitMine continuously raising funds to purchase tokens and becoming the world’s largest Ethereum treasury, or MicroStrategy adjusting its financing structure to focus on issuing preferred shares to expand its Bitcoin holdings, both reflect that the model of continuously accumulating crypto assets through the capital market flywheel is gaining favor and validation. At the same time, veteran projects in the Ethereum ecosystem are rejuvenating , regaining growth under a warming regulatory environment and technological iteration— the U.S. SEC’s attitude shift clarified the compliance prospects for Uniswap, MakerDAO’s reorganization into Spark and issuance of the new token SPK drove a sharp increase in TVL, and Maple’s integration of Syrup and adoption of Pendle to enable yield trading innovation all prove that “old trees” can indeed bloom with new flowers. In the DeFi field, the perpetual contract trading track has risen as one of the biggest highlights: high-performance on-chain exchanges such as Hyperliquid saw revenues surge this year, with trading depth comparable to centralized exchanges, and trading volume and fees ranking among the industry’s top. More importantly, perpetual aggregators such as Hypersolid and Range aggregate liquidity from multiple DEXs into one interface, lowering user thresholds and offering better prices. Together with Hyperliquid’s launch of Builder Codes and the HIP-3 mechanism for an open market, developers can easily introduce contracts for new underlying assets. These innovations signal that this track contains exceptional primary market opportunities. The stablecoin payment war heated up rapidly during this period, with major dedicated chains competing around the concept of “channels as king”: Stripe’s Tempo focuses on merchant network integration, Tether’s Plasma promotes zero-fee transfers and Bitcoin-level security, and Circle’s Arc positions itself as open financial-grade infrastructure, while Tron, leveraging its control over more than half of the world’s circulating USDT, its low-fee and efficient network, and strong partnerships with exchanges and cross-border channels, continues to sit firmly on the throne, demonstrating that beyond technology, “network effects + user experience” are the true keys to victory for stablecoin settlement networks. On the macro front , as expectations strengthen for the Federal Reserve to shift from tightening to easing, with inflation falling and potential rate cuts signaled, large amounts of cash parked in money market funds are likely to flow back into risk asset markets. We have already seen Bitcoin dominance retreat from its May peak, with funds accelerating into Ethereum and other sectors with substantial yields and new narratives. Overall, this round of the market emphasizes value and structural opportunities rather than broad bubbles: from the stock-coin resonance brought by the DAT model, to technological upgrades and compliance dividends for veteran projects, and to the leap in derivatives and stablecoin infrastructure, all provide the market with resilience beyond previous cycles. At the same time, caution is required— only projects with solid fundamentals and sustainable models can endure cycles, enjoying macro tailwinds while withstanding volatility risks potentially triggered by over-financialization. 1.From Trend to Consensus: Digital Asset Treasury Companies (DAT) Have Become Blue-Chip Standard 1.1 What is DAT? The story begins with MicroStrategy: in 2020, MicroStrategy bought Bitcoin into its corporate treasury, effectively turning “publicly listed company stock” into a way of investing in Bitcoin. This was the first true DAT. The Ethereum version of DAT is on the rise: by 2024–2025, with spot BTC/ETH ETFs approved and accounting standards improved (allowing crypto assets to be measured at fair value), more companies began openly making large-scale crypto purchases. The case of BitMine: in August 2025, BitMine announced ETH holdings exceeding 1.15 million tokens, worth nearly $5 billion , becoming the world’s largest ETH treasury. To keep buying, it raised the ceiling on the amount of funds it could raise through stock issuance to $24.5 billion . This was essentially telling the market: “We will keep using stock issuance proceeds to buy more ETH.” In other words, the essence of DAT is a “coin-buying machine,” continuously increasing crypto holdings through the financing power of the stock market. 1.2 Investment Logic of DAT When analyzing Digital Asset Treasury (DAT), the core lies in understanding its valuation framework and key indicators. Net Asset Value (NAV) is the most important benchmark, representing the amount and value of token holdings per share, serving as the foundation of all valuation judgments. The relationship between stock price and NAV reflects the rationality of the market’s pricing of this model: if the stock price is close to NAV, the premium level is limited; if the stock price is significantly higher than NAV, it indicates substantial sentiment or expectation components. mNAV (Market-to-NAV Ratio) is calculated by dividing the stock price by NAV, directly measuring the premium level given by the market. When mNAV The number of tokens per share , i.e., the actual number of tokens corresponding to each share, directly reflects whether the company can continuously enhance NAV through financing activities. If the number of tokens per share continues to rise, it indicates that financing and token-swapping processes are smooth and the flywheel logic is sustainable; if stagnant or declining, it suggests that this model may face structural problems. Leverage level (Debt/NAV) also needs to be included in risk assessment. While high leverage can accelerate NAV growth, it also amplifies risk exposure amid market volatility. The valuation logic of DAT stock can be simplified as: Stock Price ≈ Number of Tokens per Share × Token Price × Premium Multiple (mNAV). The essential difference between DAT and spot or ETF investment lies in its ability to obtain two types of returns simultaneously: first, asset appreciation from the underlying token price increase; second, NAV growth from increasing the “number of tokens per share” through stock issuance financing and token conversion. The operation of the DAT logic is manifested as: stock price rises → stock issuance → purchase more tokens → tokens per share increase → NAV rises → stock price rises further. This mechanism relies on the two-way linkage between the capital market and the token market, theoretically giving DAT higher elasticity than spot or ETFs. Taking BitMine as an example, its data clearly demonstrates the valuation logic of DAT. At the end of June 2025, its NAV/share was about $4, with a stock price of $4.27, close to 1× NAV. By the end of July, NAV/share had increased to $30, and the stock price had risen to $51, corresponding to 1.7× NAV. A decomposition of the increase shows that about 60% came from the increase in ETH holdings per share (achieved through issuance and token conversion), 20% came from ETH’s own price increase, and another 20% from the rise in market premium levels. This case illustrates that DAT’s stock price growth is not only driven by the underlying token price, but also depends on whether financing strategies can effectively convert into NAV growth, and whether the market recognizes this model. In summary, the value of DAT lies in its ability to leverage capital market financing capacity into continuous growth of token holdings, thereby forming valuation elasticity higher than spot or ETFs. But its sustainability depends on market confidence in the flywheel logic. Once the market premium declines, issuance fails to effectively enhance tokens per share, or the macro environment reverses, DAT stock adjustments may exceed that of the tokens themselves. Therefore, a reasonable investment strategy should be to position around mNAV = 1, ensuring premium levels are controllable, while continuously monitoring the trends of mNAV and tokens per share. Only when these conditions are met does DAT have long-term investment value. https://blockworks.co/analytics/treasury-companies It is worth noting that Ark Invest also explicitly emphasized the unique value of DAT compared to ETFs when evaluating BitMine . Ark pointed out that this was actually their first time being able to obtain stable exposure to Ethereum within the ETF system. Directly buying other funds or ETFs faces many problems, such as tax compliance (the “bad income” rule stipulates that if certain gross profits exceed 10% of a fund’s annual profit, it may lose tax benefits or even be forced to close) and risks of overlapping fees, making it difficult to be a viable path. BitMine, however, provided a feasible solution. Although BitMine stock has some premium, the utility of its Ethereum Treasury is significantly higher than that of a Bitcoin Treasury, because ETH can be staked, while current ETFs still cannot achieve ETH staking. This difference means that DAT not only provides exposure to asset prices, but can also capture additional on-chain yield sources, further enhancing its relative competitiveness. 1.2.1 SharpLink and BitMine: The Power Shift in Ethereum Corporate Holdings The Ethereum corporate holding landscape was originally dominated by SharpLink, but in just 35 days from July to August 2025, BitMine quickly overtook it through continuous financing and large-scale accumulation, becoming the world’s largest ETH treasury company. This is not only a reversal in holding scale, but also a showdown between OG capital and Wall Street capital lineages. 1.2.1.1 SharpLink: The Slow Accumulation of the Native Community SharpLink’s shareholder lineup covers the core capital of the Ethereum ecosystem. Consensys founder Joseph Lubin serves as chairman of the board; Pantera, Arrington, Galaxy Digital, and others participate, forming a mix of OG camp, infrastructure camp, and financialization camp. The company emphasizes long-term token holding, on-chain security, and transparent management. Most of its ETH holdings come from transfers within team wallets or small batch purchases, with build-up costs concentrated in the $1,500–$1,800 range, and some early costs even below $1,000. This “native” path brings three characteristics: Strong hoarding mentality : prone to selling pressure when prices rise sharply. Closed-loop information flow : focused on on-chain operations and audit disclosure, more cautious in capital market narrative tactics. Slow disclosure cycle : relies on quarterly reports, lacking rhythmical market communication. For example, the S-ASR document submitted in June 2025 allowed it to sell stock at any time, causing market concerns about selling pressure. Due to these characteristics, when BitMine launched a rhythmical disclosure offensive, SharpLink’s response appeared half a beat slower, causing market attention and capital to lean toward the faster-paced competitor. 1.2.1.2 BitMine: A Structural Blitz with Wall Street Strategy BitMine was previously a small Nasdaq-listed company without a crypto label. But starting in July 2025, it rapidly expanded its ETH treasury through a typical Wall Street path: PIPE financing + warrant structure : cooperating with Galaxy Digital, ARK Invest, Founders Fund, etc., first obtaining funds and warrants through PIPE financing, then gradually issuing more stock, using new funds to purchase large amounts of ETH. Rhythmical disclosure : almost every 7 days releasing rhythmical announcements, disclosing new holding scales in each announcement, creating a market expectation cycle of “buy → disclose → price rises → buy again.” Narrative marketing : BitMine positioned itself as the “leading Ethereum corporate treasury,” with each holding update not only pushing up its own stock price, but also increasing ETH spot trading volume and price. In just 35 days, BitMine’s holdings grew from 0 to 830,000 ETH, its stock price rose from $4 to $41, and its total market capitalization exceeded $3 billion, achieving a complete overtake of SharpLink. More importantly, it changed the market’s perception of ETH corporate holdings—from “slowly hoarding tokens while waiting for appreciation” to “structural financing driving price increases.” 1.2.1.3 The Narrative King’s Opinion Shield In this Ethereum treasury competition, the role of opinion leaders was equally important. Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, is one of the most influential bridges between U.S. equities and the crypto market. His influence lies not in accurate predictions, but in his skill at creating narratives: Self-built indicators to boost sentiment : his Bitcoin Misery Index (BMI), which quantifies market sentiment using volatility, trading volume, and other data, calls for “buying the dip” at low values and emphasizes “structural bull market arrival” at high values. Regardless of market trends, he always finds positive interpretations. High-frequency appearances across platforms : a regular guest on CNBC’s Fast Money , Bloomberg commentator, and daily updates on his own Twitter and YouTube, spreading views through short videos and charts to attract retail and institutional attention. Creating belief : he doesn’t just call for rises, but attaches “macro narratives.” For example, he claimed ETH would become part of corporate balance sheets, providing narrative protection for structural plays like BitMine; similarly, he repeatedly emphasized halving cycles and institutional allocation importance, thereby guiding the market to view price increases as inevitable. Thus, during BitMine’s build-up period, Tom Lee’s rhetoric provided the market with strong backing: when ETH prices rose, he emphasized institutional buying; when prices adjusted, he emphasized buying opportunities. Whether up or down, he always redirected attention to “structure and long-term value.” 1.2.2 Future Market Path for BTC Treasury Companies in the Next 6–12 Months If DAT prices experience sustained decline, their financing flywheel may reverse, forming an “ mNAV death spiral .” In short, the premium (mNAV) between the company’s market value and its NAV acts as an “umbilical cord”: when the price of assets (BTC/ETH) drops, NAV shrinks, and the company’s stock price also falls; if the stock price falls close to or below NAV, the company loses the ability to issue new shares at a high premium; if debt or preferred shares require repayment, the company may be forced to sell assets to repurchase stock or service debt. Such selling behavior in turn suppresses market prices, accelerating NAV decline and triggering more forced selling by companies. Only those able to maintain strong mNAV and continuously increase BTC per share holdings are likely to survive. How DAT Prices Decline Could Trigger Death Spiral 1.2.3 Who Can Survive the Cycle? Different Tiers of DAT Companies Strategy (MicroStrategy) has long financed through issuing common shares, multiple types of preferred stock, and convertible bonds, building the world’s largest Bitcoin reserve. These preferred stocks provide fixed dividends or conversion rights for the coming years, while the convertible bonds allow creditors to convert into stock in the future. As of Q2 2025, the company held about 628,791 BTC, maintained a clean balance sheet, had an enterprise value of $126 billion, and debt of only $8.2 billion. On the July 31 earnings call, Strategy announced it would “exit the debt game”: it plans to redeem all convertible bonds and focus on multiple tranches of preferred stock issuance. The company expects its existing $6.3 billion preferred stock size to grow significantly, and during its investor roadshow announced issuance of a brand new $4.2 billion Stretch (STRC) perpetual preferred stock, targeting a 10% apy. TD Cowen’s Lance Vitanza noted that the convertible bond market is mainly dominated by hedge funds and arbitrageurs, who usually buy convertibles while shorting the stock to manage risk, so issuing convertibles causes heavy short-selling pressure. As Strategy’s market cap and reputation increased, it has been able to access the preferred stock market with better terms, avoiding this issue. In addition, the company stated that unless Bitcoin’s price drops more than 80%, it is almost impossible for it to face forced liquidation, reflecting the robustness of its capital structure. Such a financing strategy makes Strategy a unique crypto treasury company. Most latecomers in BTC, ETH, Solana and other sectors are still in growth stages, often needing to use PIPE placements, convertible bonds, and credit facilities to raise funds quickly, which increases leverage and creates potential selling pressure. For example, Twenty One and ProCap in 2025 respectively raised $485 million and $235 million through convertible bond issuance to launch Bitcoin treasury strategies. Therefore, currently only Strategy can expand without leverage through the preferred stock market, while other companies still rely on hybrid financing models. Conclusion Through its new “preferred stock + no debt” financing strategy, Strategy avoids the arbitrage short-selling pressure of the convertible bond market, while maintaining sufficient capital to handle price fluctuations. This model enhances its uniqueness among strong players, showing that the company not only focuses on accumulating Bitcoin but also prioritizes optimizing its financing structure. By contrast, mid-tier and weaker treasury companies still need to rely on convertibles, PIPE, and credit facilities, with higher leverage levels, making them vulnerable when markets cool down. This difference also explains why Strategy’s stock performance has outpaced Bitcoin itself, allowing it to remain ahead in the fiercely competitive crypto treasury market. 2. Stablecoin Payment Wars: Channels Are King, Tron Holds the Core Advantages Over the past few years, stablecoins have evolved from trading instruments into global payment infrastructure. With the passage of the U.S. GENIUS Act, more financial and tech companies are exploring stablecoins to lower cross-border payment costs and capture yield spreads. However, competition in stablecoins is shifting from “issuance capacity” to “channel control.” Winning the stablecoin payment war will depend not just on technology or fees, but on capturing key inflows and outflows of capital. Several stablecoin-dedicated chains are advancing quickly: Stripe’s Tempo, Plasma, Stable, Circle’s Arc—and TRON, which has already established dominance. Below, we examine their strategic positioning and the core competitive drivers of stablecoin payments. Comparison Between Traditional SWIFT Model and Public Chain+Stablecoin Pool Model Stripe’s Tempo: An Enterprise-Grade Chain Built on Existing Channel Payment giant Stripe is developing a dedicated payment chain, Tempo, in collaboration with Paradigm. Reports indicate that Tempo is a payment-focused Layer 1 blockchain, Ethereum-compatible, developed quietly by a small team. Paradigm’s reth execution client supports Tempo’s operations, providing critical technical infrastructure. Unlike open DeFi ecosystems, Tempo is designed to integrate deeply with Stripe’s merchant and channel network, offering enterprise customers stablecoin settlement. Its success depends on migrating existing business payment flows on-chain rather than targeting crypto-native users. In other words, Tempo follows a “channel-first” logic—leveraging Stripe’s global merchant base to scale its on-chain settlement network, rather than bootstrapping a developer ecosystem from scratch. Plasma: A Zero-Fee, Bitcoin-Anchored Stablecoin Network Backed by Tether, Plasma is a Bitcoin settlement-layer L2 network that combines Bitcoin’s security with EVM compatibility, enabling Ethereum contracts to migrate seamlessly. Plasma’s main selling point is “gasless USDT transfers”—users only post a small bond to prevent abuse, while ordinary transfers are fee-free. This drastically lowers friction for payments and remittances. Plasma also supports optional private transactions and promises permissionless bridging of native BTC, integrating Bitcoin liquidity with Tether’s dollar pools to create a low-slippage exchange and lending layer. On the funding side, Plasma secured early backing from Founders Fund and Tether at the end of 2024; its first liquidity tranche sold out within minutes, showing strong demand for zero-fee stablecoin chains. If Plasma succeeds in capturing significant USDT flows currently on Ethereum and TRON, it could bring Tether $1–2B in new annual revenue, solving its structural problem where issuance profits are strong but on-chain fee capture is weak. Stable: A Settlement Chain for Institutions and Large Transactions Unlike Plasma’s focus on user experience and zero fees, Stable is designed for compliant settlement for enterprises and institutions worldwide. Supported by Tether and Bitfinex, Stable uses USDT directly as both a gas and accounting unit—users don’t need to hold a separate native token. The chain emphasizes sub-second settlement speeds and “blockspace guarantees” for cross-border payments and commodity trades, ensuring large-value transactions receive priority finality on-chain. Combined with Tether’s investments in Latin American agriculture, African payments, and Canadian gold mining, Stable aims to embed USDT into supply chain finance and global trade settlement. For multinational companies reliant on wire transfers and letters of credit, if on-chain clearing can provide instant release, its efficiency would far surpass traditional methods. Thus, Stable could elevate USDT from a “trading pair currency” to a “global settlement currency,” further strengthening Tether’s control over stablecoin capital flows. Circle’s Arc: Neutral and Open Financial Infrastructure Circle, the issuer of USDC, announced the launch of its own blockchain, Arc, to meet institutional demand for stablecoin finance. Arc is an open, EVM-compatible Layer 1 that supports USDC and other stablecoins, integrating Circle’s CCTP cross-chain protocol, payment network, wallet services, and smart contract infrastructure. Powered by Malachite’s high-performance consensus engine, Arc offers sub-second finality and introduces a predictable, USDC-denominated gas fee mechanism. Arc also includes a stablecoin FX engine, enabling cross-border payments, FX trading, and capital market settlements. Circle argues that existing public chains cannot fully meet financial institutions’ compliance and efficiency requirements, so Arc aims to provide specialized stablecoin financial infrastructure while remaining open and neutral to attract other issuers. Unlike Tether’s strategy of channel capture via proprietary chains, Circle positions Arc as a collaborative “public utility” for finance, aspiring to become the settlement layer of the stablecoin industry. Tron: Defending Its Moat with Channel Dominance Despite new chains entering the race, the current king of stablecoin payments remains TRON . As of mid-2025, TRON hosts over $80.7B in USDT supply with daily transaction volumes above $21B—far exceeding Ethereum during the same period. TRON’s advantages come from several factors: Low migration costs – TRON VM is Ethereum-compatible, and TRX itself was originally an ERC-20; migrating USDT from Ethereum to TRON required almost no changes. Deep exchange integration – Binance designates TRON as its default deposit network, supported by Huobi, Poloniex, and others, forming massive channels. Emerging market dominance – In Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia, TRON is the leading network for payroll and remittances. Low fees & reward model – Its DPoS consensus and “bandwidth + energy” model allow institutions and exchanges to complete transfers at near-zero cost by staking. Strong channel stickiness – OTC desks and cross-border networks are deeply locked into TRON liquidity; migrating elsewhere would require rebuilding flows, making replacement difficult. These advantages have created a strong channel moat, ensuring TRON’s dominance in stablecoin payments. Comparison of Public Chains Core Competitive Drivers of Stablecoin Payments The comparisons above show that the real competition in stablecoin payments lies not simply in “technology” or “lower fees,” but in channel control and network effects. USDT flows are concentrated among exchanges, OTC desks, cross-border networks, and high-frequency institutions. Whoever secures these channels becomes the market leader, even without offering the lowest fees. At the same time, user experience optimization is equally critical. For example, Stable and Arc lower barriers by introducing gasless or predictable fee mechanisms and faster settlement, making institutions more willing to adopt. In payment use cases, the decisive factor is not marginal performance gains, but the ability to build a robust clearing network and sustainable ecosystem. 3.Winners in Payment Channels & New Token Listings: Tron and HTX’s Six-Month Story 3.1 Tron: Stablecoin Supremacy and the DAT Experiment Tron continues to dominate the stablecoin and cross-border payment sectors. Research from Cointelegraph and CryptoQuant shows that in H1 2025, Tron’s stablecoin supply grew 40% YTD, with over 51% of global USDT now on Tron. CryptoQuant further reports that Tron processes ~2.3–2.4M USDT transfers daily, with $2.46B in average daily transfer value—6.8× and 2.7× Ethereum, respectively. In May 2025, network transaction count hit 273M, while active addresses reached 28.7M in June, setting multi-year highs. This growth was driven by surging SunSwap volumes (wTRX monthly volume spiked to $3.8B in May) and rising JustLend demand, making Tron the primary battlefield for stablecoin circulation and DeFi rates. https://defillama.com Beyond payments, the Tron ecosystem is experimenting with Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) models. Publicly listed Tron Inc. (formerly SRM Entertainment) adopted a blockchain-integrated treasury approach in 2025, holding 365M TRX staked on JustLend to earn ~10% annualized yield—among the first DATs directly combining staking income. In July, Tron Inc. filed a $1B shelf registration with the SEC, planning equity or bond issuance to acquire more TRX, effectively mirroring MicroStrategy’s equity-financed Bitcoin accumulation strategy. This model combines equity financing with on-chain yield, potentially driving continuous TRX treasury expansion. 3.2 HTX: Leading in Fiat Gateways and New Token Trading In exchange competition, HTX is consolidating its edge via two strategies. Safe and efficient fiat on/off ramps – In Aug 2025, HTX launched the industry’s first “Verified Station” module, allowing only merchants with a “zero-freeze” record. It also introduced a “0-freeze + 100% reimbursement” dual insurance mechanism: if an order is frozen by judicial action, compensation is split 50/50 between the merchant and platform, capped at 10,000 USDT per order. Supported by a 24/7 rapid-response compensation team, this significantly reduced fiat ramp risks and boosted user trust. Leadership in new token trading – According to CryptoQuant, as of mid-Aug 2025, HTX’s YTD spot trading volume for new listings reached $38B, ranking first among “second-tier” exchanges and accounting for 22% of daily new-coin trading. Binance led with $133B, followed by Bybit ($35B) and MEXC ($34B). This included hot projects such as BIO, AIXBT, and CGPT, showing that new assets have become a major traffic driver. HTX’s broader market standing has also improved: CoinGecko ranking rose from #13 to #7, CoinMarketCap from #15 to #9, DefiLlama (North America-focused) at #6, Kaiko Q2 spot ranking from #10 to #8 with an AA rating, and CryptoRank CIS ranking at #3. Official data shows HTX has disclosed reserve data for 32 consecutive months, with platform USDT balances rising from 665M to 1.15B in the past three months—a >30% increase, underscoring its growing liquidity and security capacity. https://www.coingecko.com Together, Tron and HTX demonstrate powerful chain–payment–exchange flywheel dynamics in 2025. Tron is expanding stablecoin dominance, strengthening DeFi, and pioneering TRX DATs to anchor payments and lending. HTX is reinforcing fiat gateway safety and driving activity in new token markets, combining liquidity depth with user security. This dual-engine model positions Tron and HTX at the core of the stablecoin and exchange ecosystems, while reminding investors to watch closely for risks in DAT leverage, volume structures, and platform governance. 4. Ethereum Ecosystem: Old Trees Bloom Again—Legacy Projects Find New Narratives, Roadmaps Gradually Realized 4.1 U.S. Policy Shift: From Regulatory Resistance to Policy Support In early 2025, with the change in SEC chairmanship, regulatory winds made a historic turn. The new SEC chair, Paul Atkins, launched the “Project Crypto” initiative, explicitly stating “we will no longer regulated by enforcement,” and declared that most tokens are not securities. This policy not only granted legitimacy to on-chain projects but also reduced compliance burdens for new issuances. Soon after, U.S. lawmakers passed the CLARITY Act and policies such as 401(k) crypto investments, further paving the way for institutional participation. This warming policy climate had profound impact on several legacy projects: Uniswap : In February 2025, the SEC withdrew its investigation into Uniswap Labs. Media commentary described this as signaling regulators no longer see it as an illegal securities trading platform—a major victory for DeFi. UNI price and Uniswap v4 TVL both rose as a result. Cardano/ADA : New policy clarified that “liquid staking is not a security.” Project leader Charles Hoskinson emphasized ADA staking is not a security. This allowed ADA, previously affected by staking disputes, to regain market recognition. Chainlink/LINK : By cooperating with the SEC’s crypto compliance task force and participating in compliance framework development, Chainlink formed a collaborative relationship with regulators, with its token rising on regulatory tailwinds. From a policy perspective, the U.S. regulatory shift brought a new narrative to old projects—“only compliance can scale.” Legacy projects shifted from being in a “regulatory gray zone” to “compliance infrastructure,” attracting renewed attention from institutions and developers. 4.2 MakerDAO to Spark: Rebranding and Token System Reconstruction As DeFi’s old “central bank,” MakerDAO completed a strategic restructuring in 2024: the community renamed the parent brand to Sky , and elevated the stablecoin sub-brand “Spark Protocol” into an independent sub-DAO, launching governance token SPK . Under the restructuring plan, Spark will airdrop 666,600 SPK to the community, then issue 100 million annually for depositor incentives and governance. Sky also used SparkLend, Spark Savings , and the cross-chain liquidity module SLL to allocate multi-chain stablecoin capital across DeFi, CeFi, and RWA. Spark’s TVL has since grown to $8.2 billion, up 250% in just a few months, ranking sixth among DeFi platforms. SPK’s strong performance made the “MakerDAO → Spark” transition a typical case of an old project shedding its stale label and discovering a new narrative. https://spark.fi 4.3 Syrup/Pendle: Building a New Yield Trading Curve Lending giant Maple Finance’s Syrup.fi found a new growth curve through cooperation with Pendle . In 2024, SyrupUSDC launched on the Pendle platform, where users could hold PT-SyrupUSDC for fixed income, trade YT-SyrupUSDC for future yields, or provide liquidity to earn fees and Pendle rewards. With Pendle V3’s launch of the Boros platform in 2025, BTC/ETH funding rates were split into tradable yield units, further expanding TVL and trading volume, pushing Pendle’s TVL to $10 billion. https://syrup.fi At the same time, Maple integrated Syrup with its institutional business, forming a unified ecosystem; Q2 2025 updates showed Maple’s AUM reached $2.6 billion, with syrupUSD becoming the fastest-growing yield-bearing dollar asset ($2.1 billion AUM), deeply integrated with platforms like Pendle. The Syrup + Pendle combination demonstrated how legacy lending platforms can use “yield trading” innovation to unlock new markets. https://maple.finance/insights/q2-2025-maple-market-update 4.4 ZKVM Roadmap: Boundless and Succinct Exploring Ethereum’s New Infrastructure On the technical front, Ethereum’s roadmap is moving toward “ZK-first.” According to the Ethereum Foundation’s 2024 plan, future validators will be able to use ZK clients to verify zkVM-generated proofs instead of re-executing transactions, achieving faster block verification and on-chain light clients. This vision has spawned multiple zkVM infrastructure projects, with RISC Zero’s Boundless and Succinct’s SP1/Prove among the most important. Boundless : In July 2025, the RISC Zero team launched Boundless’ incentivized testnet on the Base chain. It is a decentralized zero-knowledge compute marketplace using “Proof of Verifiable Work (PoVW)” consensus, where ZK miners earn rewards by verifying zkVM proofs. Boundless allows blockchains to share computation without redundant execution. CEO Shiv Shankar noted it can “enable cross-chain reuse of on-chain computation, improve efficiency and security, and attract developers and miners across ecosystems.” SP1 and Succinct Network : Succinct Labs’ SP1 is a fully open-source zkVM. According to the team, SP1 leverages cross-table lookup architecture and customizable precompiles to significantly speed up proving, achieving 4–28x performance gains over existing zkVMs for certain tasks. SP1 is a general-purpose zkVM designed for Rust developers, supporting compilation of normal Rust programs into verifiable zero-knowledge proofs. The Succinct Network (token symbol PROVE) builds a decentralized proving marketplace, providing “zero-knowledge infrastructure” with SP1, and accelerating proofs up to 20x with FPGA. The network supports multiple proving systems and is compatible with Ethereum, Solana, and other ecosystems. The evolution of zkVM means Ethereum could achieve efficient verification directly on Layer 1 in the future, enabling rollups, cross-chain bridges, AI inference, and other applications to operate within a zero knowledge environment. The advancement of these infrastructure projects allows Ethereum, the “old tree,” to grow new technical branches. 5.Gamified Investment Logic: Primary Opportunities in Derivatives Exchanges and Aggregators If we compare the crypto primary market to a game, the investment rhythm becomes clear: enter early in projects, enjoy the short-lived cash flow boom, then exit when channels mature. It is exactly this “game-like” logic that makes derivatives DEXs and their aggregator s such an intriguing track. On one hand, the market environment is shifting. According to CoinGecko’s quarterly report, decentralized spot trading volume grew 25% in Q2 2025 compared to the previous quarter, while centralized exchange volume fell nearly 28%, pushing the CEX/DEX ratio to a record high. In the same quarter, decentralized perpetual contract trading volume surpassed $89.8 billion for the first time, with Hyperliquid capturing 73% of the market. This liquidity migration signals that large capital flows are moving on-chain, and users are increasingly willing to trade high-volatility perpetuals on decentralized platforms. On the other hand, product-level innovations are reinforcing this trend. Meme-coin trading aggregators such as GMGN helped 28,000 users earn $163 million during the TRUMP token boom in 2024. Its edge lay in capturing new coin signals, enabling 1-second transactions, and offering copy-trading and stop-loss/take-profit functions. This proved that combining deep liquidity, fast execution, and user-friendly interfaces can attract large numbers of retail investors and KOLs. Perpetual aggregators are replicating this model. Projects like Hypersolid and Range connect multiple perpetual DEXs such as Hyperliquid through a single interface, aggregating fragmented liquidity to offer users better prices, funding rates, and cross-chain collateralization. Similarly, Hyperliquid’s Builder Codes allow front-end apps (wallets, bots, or trading tools) to plug directly into its deep order book and earn fee-sharing, letting developers profit without building their own trading engines. Tools like Unit let users inject Solana assets into Hyperliquid in one click and automatically convert them into futures margin, streamlining the experience. In summary, the perpetual aggregator track combines both “fast breakout + clear exit” features: policy-driven liquidity migration, mature technical components lowering startup barriers, and aggregator network effects rapidly accumulating users. This makes it highly aligned with the traditional primary market “game” investment logic—an emerging opportunity worth watching. 5.1 Derivatives Trading Track: The Core Sector of Exploding Revenues As the crypto market entered a new bull cycle from late 2023, derivatives trading gradually became DeFi’s largest cash flow source. DeFiLlama’s rankings show that Hyperliquid generated about $3.15M in 24h revenue—second only to Tether and Circle; in the derivatives sub-ranking, edgeX led with $688.6K in 24h revenue, followed closely by Jupiter JLP and others. https://defillama.com Perp DEX (Perpetual DEX) is a decentralized exchange supporting perpetual futures contract trading. Unlike centralized exchanges, Perp DEXs rely entirely on blockchain smart contracts, with users managing assets directly through Web3 wallets—achieving self-custody and full on-chain transparency . 5.2 Differences between Perp DEX and CEX Ownership of funds : Users hold private keys, avoiding the risk of CEX misappropriation or collapse. No KYC : Most Perp DEXs do not require identity verification. On-chain transparency : All transactions and funds are verifiable, avoiding FTX-style black-box risks. Fee advantages : Many DEXs run on Layer 2 or custom chains with near-zero gas fees. Performance & liquidity : While historically weaker than CEXs, today’s DEXs have improved significantly, with some achieving near-centralized speed and depth. Transparency pressure : CEXs only launched “Proof of Reserves” under pressure from DEXs, which are natively verifiable. User access : Most Perp DEXs require Web3 wallet connections, but more are beginning to support email/social login (semi-custodial wallets), lowering barriers for newcomers. Core Metrics TVL (Total Value Locked) : Reflects capital scale and community trust. OI (Open Interest) : Shows trading activity and leverage usage. High TVL and OI usually mean strong liquidity, good depth, and low slippage. Maker fees : Liquidity provision fees, sometimes with rebates. Taker fees : Immediate execution costs, typically higher. Rebates : Encourage market-making, improve liquidity. Vaults (Strategy Vaults) Copy-trading vaults : Users can follow professional traders’ strategies. LP vaults : Provide liquidity, earn fees and liquidation income, but carry drawdown risk. 5.3 Hyperliquid Ecosystem: Growth Driven by Speed, Depth, and Buybacks Hyperliquid is far ahead in the perpetual trading track thanks to its self-developed Layer 1 chain, high-performance order book, and powerful economic model. Year-to-date, Hyperliquid has generated $406M in revenue, with an annualized run rate of over $810M ; 92% of fees are used for HYPE buybacks. Open Interest stands at ~$12B , with TVL reaching $4.93B —far surpassing other Perp DEXs. Ecosystem expansion is another of Hyperliquid’s strengths: the Unit protocol, launched in February, enabled native deposits and withdrawals for BTC, ETH, SOL, and more, while placing orders directly on-chain via an auction system. Unit TVL has reached $800M , though spot trading volume accounts for just 2%, still in its early phase. HyperEVM’s mainnet grew TVL from under $50M to $2.08B within two months of launch, with new tools such as Builder Codes (e.g., Phantom Perps) driving sharp increases in daily active addresses and transactions. On the revenue side, Hyperliquid has already accumulated $406M this year; daily revenues rose from $1M to $3M in Q1, peaking above $5M . In the last 24h, the Aid Fund repurchased 92,180 HYPE , spending $3.87M at an average price of $42.02 —showing that the buyback mechanism continues to support the token price. https://data.asxn.xyz/dashboard/hl-buybacks 5.4 From “Meme Aggregator” Logic to Contract Aggregators On Solana, GMGN.ai became a popular entry point for meme-coin trading by aggregating liquidity across multiple DEXs, offering instant token discovery and copy-trading. The keys to its success lie in three aspects: Liquidity aggregation providing the best prices.Minimalist UI enabling seamless trading for new users. Leaderboards and social elements enhancing user stickiness. This logic is now migrating to perpetuals. Early multi-chain perpetual aggregators such as Rage Trade have started integrating Hyperliquid, GMX, and Synthetix, but the true “GMGN for contracts” may emerge within Hyperliquid’s ecosystem: leveraging Hyperliquid’s high-speed order book and deep liquidity, a front-end could aggregate perpetual liquidity across multiple protocols—even CEXs—while offering one-click position opening, strategy copy-trading, follow-trading, and performance leaderboards. Meanwhile, Unit and Builder Codes allow wallets or apps to embed Hyperliquid trading directly, further lowering barriers for users. Such contract aggregators could solve the current challenges of complex DEX UIs and fragmented liquidity, sparking a new wave of user growth similar to GMGN’s impact on memecoins. 5.5 HIP-3: Contract Engine for Stocks and Beyond The rise of contract aggregators depends on openness at the base layer. Hyperliquid’s HIP-3 proposal is a turning point. HIP-3 allows any user holding 1M HYPE to bid for new market deployment rights: winners can freely set perpetual parameters, select on-chain oracles, and capture up to 50% of trading fees. This means creators can launch perpetual products without building their own order book—Hyperliquid provides the infrastructure and liquidity. HIP-3’s openness not only enables community-created perpetual markets for crypto assets and commodities but also opens the door to traditional assets like stocks. For example, Ventuals leveraged HIP-3 to launch “stock valuation perpetuals,” where the valuation of private companies (e.g., OpenAI, Stripe, SpaceX) is divided by 10^9 to form a “valuation unit.” Investors can long or short these company valuations using USDC, with up to 10x leverage , suspension, and settlement mechanisms. Ventuals also plans to source pre-IPO valuation data as oracles, effectively tokenizing equity valuations into perpetual contracts. With HIP-3 live and more developers and institutions acquiring HYPE to deploy markets, contract versions of stocks and other RWAs could emerge at scale—aggregators will allow users to trade across asset classes in one place. 6. Macro Market Outlook Historically, Fed rate cuts fall into two categories: Preemptive – to hedge risks before a severe downturn (e.g., 1990, 1995, 2019). Crisis-driven – forced easing during recessions (e.g., 2001, 2008). Today, with a weakening labor market, trade tariffs, and geopolitical uncertainty—but inflation clearly easing—the environment resembles a preemptive cut, which supports risk assets. Both Bitcoin and U.S. equities have hit new highs. 1990–1992 : During the S&L crisis and Gulf War, the Fed cut rates from 8% → 3%, easing credit stress, CPI fell, GDP rebounded, equities rallied. 1995–1998 : To avoid over-tightening, the Fed cut in 1995–96, supporting growth. Later, the Asian financial crisis and LTCM collapse prompted further cuts, fueling the dot-com bubble. Money market fund assets have surpassed $7 trillion Despite debates on whether a September cut could trigger a crypto top, fund flows suggest otherwise. U.S. money market funds hold a record $7.2T in assets. Historically, outflows from MMFs correlate positively with inflows into risk assets. As cuts reduce their yield advantage, more capital could shift into crypto and equities. This unprecedented cash reserve is the strongest potential powder keg for the bull market. Fed Meeting Dates and Target Rate Ranges Structurally, capital is already rotating away from Bitcoin. BTC dominance has fallen from 65% in May to 59% in August, while altcoin market cap has surged >50% since July to $1.4T. CoinMarketCap’s “Altseason Index” still sits at ~40, well below the 75 threshold, yet the divergence between muted indicators and soaring market cap reveals selective capital inflows—especially into Ethereum (ETH). ETH benefits from $22B+ in ETF flows, plus its role as the backbone of stablecoins and RWAs, giving it stronger capital pull than BTC. https://www.coingecko.com This bull market differs fundamentally from past cycles. With an overwhelming number of tokens, the era of “everything pumps” is over. Investors are focusing on value and structural opportunities—favoring projects with real cash flows, regulatory prospects, or strong narratives, while long-tail assets without fundamentals are being marginalized. At the same time, valuations are stretched. Treasury strategies may be at risk of over-financialization: if institutions or treasuries engage in concentrated selling, it could trigger cascading liquidations and deep market shocks.

Called the Ethereum ‘Strategy,’ Bitmine now holds a total of 1,947,299 ETH, valued at $8.69 billion, per on-chain analyst EmberCN. Bitmine (BMNR) 在过去 1 小时里从 Galaxy Digital 和 FalconX 两家机构业务平台收到了 80,325 枚 ETH ($3.58 亿)。 这应该是他们在本周所购买的 ETH，再加上他们截至 8/31 时所持有的 1,866,974 枚 ETH，他们现在应该是有 1,947,299 枚 ETH ($86.9 亿) 了。 本文由 #Bitget ｜ @Bitget_zh 赞助 https://t.co/yXOy23Idg3 pic.twitter.com/ha2VqgeEj4 — 余烬 (@EmberCN) September 4, 2025 This means that the total stash is more than double the holdings of SharpLink, the second-largest ETH holder. As of August 31, Bitmine held 1,866,974 ETH with an average cost of $3,883, while SharpLink held 837,230 ETH with an average cost of $3,594. The purchase comes a day after the publicly traded Bitcoin mining company announced that it holds 1.87 million Ethereum tokens . This is nearly 1.55% of the entire ETH supply. This development underscores how institutional players like Galaxy Digital and FalconX are facilitating large-scale crypto movements. Bitmine Mirrors Saylor’s Strategy Playbook – Bullish for Supply Squeeze The transfers highlight Bitmine’s aggressive ETH accumulation plan, potentially signalling confidence in the token’s long-term value, despite recent price fluctuations. Besides, on Tuesday, The Ether Machine announced that it added another 150,000 ETH to its treasury, bringing its total holdings to 500,000 ETH, worth around $2.19 billion. Consistent accumulation by major players highlights that strategic positioning is key in the current market. Further, the token will likely continue to attract institutional interest in the coming months, driving the price further. Ethereum accumulation has helped the coin climb to $4,385, making a 20.1% increase in a month and a staggering 84% rise in the past year, per CoinMarketCap data . Additionally, the latest CoinShares report indicates that ETH ETFs have assets under management of $37.9 billion, an optimistic signal to maintain ETH’s momentum. How Long Will ETH Amid Treasury Play Sustain? Treasury excitement has been a major driver of ETH’s recent price surge. Unlike Bitcoin, ETH holdings can be staked, turning idle reserves into a yield engine. This makes Ethereum a different kind of balance sheet bet: asset and an income stream. That said, it’s a double-edged sword. If ETH keeps getting locked up for staking/yield, investors can expect sustained price pressure, but also sharper volatility if hoarders face forced selling or sentiment turns. James Toledano, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet, told Cryptonews that network-level improvement in capacity, lower DeFi transaction costs, and active Layer‑2 adoption have also fostered a flurry of on‑chain activity. “Momentum may carry ETH higher in the near term; however, history cautions toward late‑Summer/September pullbacks even after sharp rallies,” he added. Bulls see ETH’s ability to hold $4,450 as critical for maintaining upward momentum.

Analysts Comment,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/are-new-solana-sol-price-peaks-on-the-horizon-analysts-comment/,"Solana (SOL), which entered 2025 with sharp fluctuations, is gaining momentum again despite experiencing declines of up to 70 percent during the year. SOL, which has risen 15% in the last two weeks, has outperformed Ethereum, which remained stagnant, and Bitcoin, which lost 4% in the same period. The token, which has gained 30% on a monthly basis, reached a six-month high of $216.87 last week. Solana's rally accelerated particularly after VanEck filed for a staked Solana ETF alongside decentralized finance platform Jito. Bloomberg's recent report that Galaxy and Jump planned to establish a $1 billion Solana-focused treasury fund also supported the rally. “Solana is currently at a critical resistance level,” said Leo Zhao, Investment Director at MEXC Ventures. “Positive macro signals, such as a potential US interest rate cut, could lead to new highs.” Related News: BREAKING: FED Releases the Much-Anticipated Beige Book - Here's Everything You Need to Know Interest from institutional investors is growing. Giants like Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, and Bitwise have applied for SOL ETFs, while BlackRock expanded its tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, to Solana this year. Institutions like Ark Invest, Galaxy, and Republic are increasing their presence on the network through SOL staking and tokenization projects. The Solana network stands out in the tokenization trend with its high transaction capacity. “If you believe in a future where everything from farmland to buildings to stocks will be tokenized, Solana is the perfect vehicle,” said Josh Brown of Ritholtz. “Because no other Layer 1 network can handle such high transaction volume.” *This is not investment advice.

Judge Analisa Torres even cited XRP holder submissions in her ruling, which concluded that XRP itself is not a security. While the token soared to a record $3.65 in July, XRP has since cooled and is currently trading at $2.83. XRP Army Shaped Ripple’s Case Ripple Labs’ long-running legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially ended last month after both parties agreed to drop their appeals. This put an end to the case which began in 2020. The SEC accused Ripple of selling its XRP token as an unregistered security, but Judge Analisa Torres’ 2023 ruling determined that only some XRP transactions could be classified as securities, setting the stage for the eventual conclusion. Now, with the dust settled, many in the crypto community are crediting XRP tokenholders —who are referred to as the “XRP Army”—for playing a major role in shaping the outcome. Crypto lawyer John Deaton, who became a central figure in representing XRP holders during the case, argued that their involvement was decisive. He pointed out that over 2,000 exhibits were filed, including affidavits and amicus briefs from XRP holders, which Judge Torres explicitly cited in her ruling. Deaton said this provided undeniable proof that retail investors’ voices influenced the court. Ripple executives agreed with this. Deputy general counsel Deborah McCrimmon even mentioned how XRP supporters helped uncover speeches and public statements from regulators that boosted Ripple’s fair notice defense. She explained that while Ripple never asked for this assistance, the grassroots efforts saved the company potentially thousands of dollars in legal work and provided critical context showing the case’s impact beyond Ripple itself. The XRP Army’s activism extended far beyond court documents. Over the years, they lobbied regulators, submitted affidavits, launched petitions, and organized coordinated social media campaigns. Deaton said this collective action proved that while one person might not be able to shift the outcome alone, one person can inspire many, and together they can drive change. XRP price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Market reactions to the case have been mixed. XRP surged 72% immediately after Judge Torres’ 2023 ruling, and more recently spiked to a record high of $3.65 in July amid speculation about a final resolution. However, after briefly touching $3.35 when news of the appeals being dropped surfaced, the token has cooled and is currently trading at $2.83.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|REGULATION|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-04 05:30:00

Following approvals for Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, analysts believe Solana may be next in line to receive the SEC’s blessing. Reports suggest the regulatory timeline could be shorter than many expected, with conversations already underway between major asset managers and US regulators. For Solana, an ETF would be a historic milestone, validating its rise as one of the most important blockchains in the ecosystem. Yet while institutional attention continues to flow toward Solana, retail traders are increasingly looking beyond the obvious. Many believe the biggest multiples won’t come from large caps, but from emerging names like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is quickly gaining recognition among early investors. Solana’s case for an ETF The argument for a Solana ETF rests on momentum. Solana has become one of the most active Layer-1 blockchains, boasting transaction speeds of more than 65,000 TPS and fees measured in fractions of a cent. Its developer ecosystem has expanded rapidly, hosting leading projects in DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. Institutional players now view Solana as the logical third pillar of the crypto market, after Bitcoin and Ethereum, making it a prime candidate for regulated investment vehicles. Data from CoinShares shows Solana has consistently led inflows among altcoins in 2025, with nearly $1.2 billion entering Solana-focused products this year alone. Analysts argue that an ETF could unlock billions more in institutional capital, cementing SOL’s place as a core asset in diversified crypto portfolios. Why timing matters The prospect of a Solana ETF arriving sooner than expected carries major implications for market structure. ETFs not only legitimize assets but also make them accessible to new classes of investors, retirement accounts, wealth managers, and risk-averse funds. If the SEC accelerates approval, Solana could experience a similar effect to Ethereum in mid-2024, when its ETF drove billions of inflows in just weeks. But while Solana’s upside from an ETF is undeniable, analysts caution that large-cap gains are often measured in multiples of 2x or 3x, not the explosive surges seen in earlier days. For investors looking for transformative growth, presales and small-cap projects remain the higher-risk, higher-reward arena. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the conversation. Ranked among the Best Cryptos to Buy for the coming multi-year bull market, it has already become one of 2025’s most talked-about presales. Early rounds have sold out in record time, signaling both grassroots demand and early whale interest. What differentiates MAGACOIN FINANCE from typical meme tokens is its blend of cultural branding, capped supply, and credibility anchored by completed audits. Analysts project it could deliver extraordinary upside by capitalizing on the same dynamics that fueled SHIB and PEPE, but with stronger foundations. The project’s accessibility is also a key advantage. Unlike Solana, which trades in the hundreds, MAGACOIN FINANCE allows retail investors to stack millions of tokens at low entry points. This psychology, owning a “big stack” before listings, creates community loops that spread virally across social platforms. For those seeking exponential returns rather than institutional stability, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as the cultural ignition point. A dual-track opportunity Investors don’t need to choose between Solana and MAGACOIN FINANCE; they serve different purposes. Solana represents the institutional track: steady growth, ETF validation, and large-scale adoption. MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the retail-driven track: asymmetric upside, cultural magnetism, and viral momentum. Together, they form a balanced strategy, anchoring a portfolio in credibility while still leaving room for breakout multiples. Conclusion The possibility of a Solana ETF arriving earlier than expected has sent a wave of optimism through the market. Institutional money is circling, and Solana’s position as a top Layer-1 makes it a strong candidate for accelerated approval. Yet for investors seeking more than stability, the real buzz is forming elsewhere. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its surging presale, capped supply, and inclusion on “Best Cryptos to Buy” lists, is being called one of the most compelling breakout opportunities of 2025. The coming months may show that while Solana secures its institutional crown, MAGACOIN FINANCE ignites the hopes for huge gains.

This new target comes right after a 30% plunge in quarterly profits last week, shaking investors and confirming what the numbers were already saying. Deliveries in both July and August were nearly identical to the same period last year, offering no growth. Local rivals are flooding the market with cheaper models stacked with tech, and consumers are biting. The company, based in Shenzhen, now faces the rest of the year with that revised number hanging over its head and no room left for mistakes. BYD loses edge as rivals take customers Profits aren’t the only thing bleeding. BYD’s ability to grab more customers through aggressive discounting has been slammed by new restrictions from Beijing, which has started cracking down on wild price cuts that were once common. Without that tool, the company is now trying to survive in the busiest part of the year (September and October) by pushing full-priced models against cheaper, sleeker offerings from companies like Geely and Xpeng. Even newer players are chipping away. Xiaomi’s SU7 sedan and YU7 SUV came out of nowhere and gained traction fast, surprising both consumers and analysts. These models are loaded with features and priced to compete. As a result, BYD is being squeezed from all sides and can’t rely on discounts to fight back. Its shares fell by 2% in Hong Kong at Thursdsy’s market open, which suggests most investors had already braced for a drop. Analysts at Bloomberg are now estimating 4.5 million units sold by year-end. Eunice Lee, senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said the company’s new number is “largely in line with buyside expectations now and should be achievable.” She added, “This could also be a near-term clearing event for the stock.” Still, hitting that lower number won’t be easy. The company’s brand strength is being tested daily by new models, tight margins, and tighter regulation. Even though BYD is still the biggest EV brand in China by volume, its lead is shrinking fast. The weapons it once used to dominate (scale, price, speed) are now liabilities in a crowded market that’s watching every yuan. Tesla goes public with robotaxi app in Austin While BYD fights to hold its ground in China, Tesla is opening up its robotaxi service to the public in the U.S. On Wednesday night, the company’s official Tesla Robotaxi account posted on social media platform X that the app is “now available to all.” This marks the first time the app isn’t limited to investors or influencers. The post included a link to Apple’s App Store , allowing users to download and join the waitlist. The rollout lines up with earlier comments from Elon Musk, who said the app would go public in September. Tesla originally launched the service in June, using about 10 to 20 Model Y SUVs in Austin, Texas for a small test group. Since then, it has quietly expanded into California, where it offers a non-autonomous rideshare service under the same branding, according to several X posts from Elon Musk. What’s not clear yet is whether the same app will work across both Austin and the Bay Area. The terms of service inside the app include legal details for California users, which hints at possible expansion, but there’s been no official word from Tesla on the exact locations that are live.

The 2017 cycle set the gold standard for parabolic crypto rallies, and Crypto Metric sees XRP aligning with the same structural markers, prolonged accumulation, shrinking exchange reserves, tightening volatility, and heavy on-chain positioning by whales. If these parallels hold, XRP’s next leg shifts from mere speculation to a scenario with real probability. Notably, in 2017, prolonged sideways trading allowed demand to concentrate while readily available supply thinned, creating the conditions for fast, sustained appreciation. Therefore, a $4.50-plus target represents a multi-bagger move from recent levels, which explains the renewed excitement among momentum traders and allocators hunting asymmetric returns with such a move leading to a new all-time high (ATH) since the present one stands at $3.65. Presently, XRP is trading at $2.84, according to CoinGecko data . $706.5M Worth of XRP Moves On-Chain — Whale Games or Institutional Play? According to renowned market analyst Xaif Crypto, a massive 257,105,694 XRP, valued at approximately $706.5 million, was just transferred on-chain , sparking intense speculation within the crypto community. Such a large-scale movement raises pressing questions: Is this the latest round of whale maneuvering, or the quiet entry of institutional capital? Whale activity has consistently shaped XRP’s market moves, often foreshadowing sharp volatility. A transfer of hundreds of millions signals more than routine activity, it suggests coordinated action, whether for liquidity shifts, exchange positioning, or strategic accumulation. However, analysts warn such moves frequently precede major swings, specifically upward if whales are stockpiling, or downward if distribution is underway. On the other hand, growing institutional interest in XRP cannot be ignored. With Ripple’s expanding footprint in cross-border payments, coupled with increasing regulatory clarity in major markets, institutions may be positioning themselves for exposure. A $706.5 million transfer aligns more closely with the type of balance sheet reshuffling typical of large financial entities rather than retail-driven market speculation. Adding to the intrigue, this transaction surfaces during a period of tight consolidation in XRP’s price, echoing patterns seen before previous rallies. Historically, large on-chain movements have coincided with accumulation phases, suggesting that a breakout could be on the horizon. Traders are closely monitoring the charts, where cup-and-handle and ascending triangle structures point toward a potential upside target of $3.55. Conclusion Whether this staggering $706.5 million XRP transfer represents whale-driven market tactics or the early signs of institutional accumulation, its sheer scale cannot be overlooked. It signals that powerful players are positioning themselves ahead of a potentially pivotal moment for XRP. Meanwhile, while XRP’s current consolidation bears striking resemblance to its legendary 2017 setup, the path to $4.50 and beyond hinges on more than just technical echoes of the past with on-chain metrics suggesting the groundwork for a breakout is forming.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-04 05:37:53

This stability makes it an ideal digital asset for cross-border transactions and institutional use, offering predictability in volatile crypto markets. For institutional clients, RLUSD provides a reliable bridge between traditional finance and the digital economy. Africa represents a vibrant and rapidly evolving financial landscape. The continent has seen an explosion in mobile money adoption and digital payments, yet traditional cross-border transactions often remain slow, expensive, and complex. This creates a compelling need for efficient, low-cost, and transparent solutions. Ripple recognizes this immense potential, positioning Ripple RLUSD as a powerful tool to address these challenges and foster economic growth. Forging Powerful Partnerships for Widespread Adoption of Ripple RLUSD Ripple’s strategy for Africa hinges on strong local partnerships, ensuring that Ripple RLUSD can effectively serve diverse markets.

Yellow Card: An African stablecoin exchange, Yellow Card is crucial for ensuring the accessibility and exchangeability of RLUSD across various African nations, supporting local currency conversions and wider utility. These collaborations are not merely transactional; they represent a concerted effort to build a resilient and interconnected digital financial infrastructure that can truly empower African institutions. How Will Ripple RLUSD Transform Institutional Finance? The introduction of Ripple RLUSD for institutional clients promises several significant benefits: Faster and Cheaper Cross-Border Payments: Traditional international transfers can take days and incur high fees. RLUSD facilitates near-instant settlements at a fraction of the cost, improving efficiency for businesses operating across borders. Enhanced Liquidity Management: Institutions can manage their liquidity more effectively by converting between fiat and stablecoins with greater speed and lower friction. Increased Transparency: Blockchain-based transactions offer an immutable record, enhancing transparency and traceability, which is vital for compliance and auditing purposes. Financial Inclusion: By making digital finance more accessible and efficient, RLUSD can indirectly support broader financial inclusion, allowing more businesses to participate in the global economy. These advantages are critical for businesses looking to expand, streamline operations, and leverage the growing digital economy in Africa. Navigating the Future: Opportunities and Potential Impact of Ripple RLUSD While the opportunities for Ripple RLUSD in Africa are immense, the journey will involve navigating various market dynamics. Regulatory frameworks are still evolving across different African nations, and adapting to these diverse environments will be key. However, the clear demand for modern financial solutions and the strong local partnerships position Ripple favorably. The move to support RLUSD in Africa is a bold step towards integrating the continent more deeply into the global digital economy. It represents a commitment to leveraging blockchain technology to solve real-world financial challenges, potentially setting a new standard for institutional digital asset adoption. In conclusion, Ripple’s strategic push to introduce Ripple RLUSD to institutional clients in Africa, backed by powerful local partnerships, marks a pivotal moment.

The price is now trading above $200 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $207 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $212 resistance zone. Solana Price Faces Resistance Solana price started a decent increase from the $194-$195 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL was able to climb above the $200 and $202 resistance levels. There was a clear move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $218 swing high to the $194 low. However, the bears seem to be active near the $212 resistance zone. The price reacted to the downside below $210. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $207 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. Solana is now trading above $204 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2102 level. The next major resistance is near the $212 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $218 swing high to the $194 low. The main resistance could be $218. A successful close above the $218 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $232. Any more gains might send the price toward the $245 level. Another Decline In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $212 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $204 zone. The first major support is near the $200 level. A break below the $200 level might send the price toward the $195 support zone. If there is a close below the $195 support, the price could decline toward the $184 support in the near term.

The high-level gathering will follow a separate event on artificial intelligence hosted earlier in the day by First Lady Melania Trump. The dinner is being labeled the administration’s inaugural tech-policy dinner, according to information confirmed by a White House official. The confirmed guest list includes Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, and OpenAI founder Sam Altman. Each of them is expected to attend this private meeting, which is invitation-only. A broader list includes Greg Brockman, who is president of OpenAI, Sergey Brin from Google, Shyam Sankar from Palantir, and Alexandr Wang, who co-founded Scale AI and now leads a superintelligence group at Meta. Trump excludes Elon while bringing in crypto czar and reshoring allies Also attending are Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella, Oracle’s Safra Catz, and Micron Technology’s David Limp. All of these names have either aligned themselves with Trump’s second-term economic reshoring agenda or played roles in past administration-led announcements on emerging technologies. David Sacks, a venture capitalist who now holds the title of White House crypto and AI czar, is expected to be seated at the table. Also attending is Jared Isaacman, founder of Shift4, despite the fact that Trump canceled his NASA nomination back in June without explanation. One person not attending is Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, who was notably excluded from the invitation list. Elon previously held a position as a special government employee in the early months of Trump’s current term and later ran the administration’s DOGE office, focused on crypto, before resigning in May. Trump explains Elon’s absence and addresses personal feud on-air When asked about the snub during a phone interview on The Scott Jennings Show , recorded Tuesday and aired Wednesday, Trump didn’t dodge. “He’s got 80% super genius, and then 20% he’s got some problems. And when he works out the 20%, he’ll be great,” Trump said. He continued, “I always liked him. I like him now. But he went off the reservation and he wished he didn’t do it.” Trump described Elon as “a man of common sense” and “a good man,” then added, “I don’t think he has a choice. What’s he gonna do? He’s gonna go with the radical left lunatics? They’re lunatics.” Elon reportedly contributed at least $277 million to support Trump and other Republican campaigns. He later took credit for Trump’s 2024 victory and the GOP’s Senate edge. In a June 5 post on X, Elon claimed, “Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House, and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate.” He followed that with “Such ingratitude.” The feud escalated after Elon publicly slammed the administration’s latest tax legislation, nicknamed the “Big Beautiful Bill,” which had passed earlier in the year. On social media, Elon called it a “MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK.” In response, Trump initially floated the idea of terminating government contracts tied to Elon’s companies. But during a press interaction in June, he toned things down. “Look, I wish him well. You understand? We had a good relationship, and I just wish him well.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",Tech|Apple|OpenAI|SpaceX|Tesla,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-04 05:50:36

China's markets, however, lagged behind, with benchmarks falling on reports that regulators are considering new rules to curb speculation. Elsewhere, the US dollar struggles after weaker July JOLTS job openings, with traders now eyeing weekly jobless claims, ADP employment data, and the ISM Services PMI later. Silver slipped 1% to around $40.7 per ounce on Thursday, easing from 14-year highs. Gold dipped to around $3,540 per ounce on Thursday, pausing its longest winning streak since March but remaining at record highs. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 1.56% to above 42,400 while the broader Topix Index added 0.7% to 3,070 on Thursday. The Japanese yen strengthened past 148 per dollar on Thursday, recovering from the prior session’s losses. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 1.44% to below 3,770 while the Shenzhen Component slid 2.2% to 12,200 on Thursday, marking a third straight decline as artificial intelligence and semiconductor shares came under heavy selling pressure. Chinese regulators are weighing measures to cool the stock market after a strong rally since early August, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday. Furthermore, China has imposed new tariffs on certain U.S. optical fiber products following a six-month probe that concluded American exporters were evading existing anti-dumping rules. The levies, set between 33.3% and 78.2%, took effect Thursday in Beijing on “certain cut-off shifted single-mode optical fiber,” the Ministry of Commerce said. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 1.17% to 25,100 in Thursday morning deals, marking the third straight decline amid broad-based sector losses. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.42% to 80,958 in morning trade on Thursday, extending gains from the previous session after the Goods and Services Tax Council approved a major overhaul of the GST regime. The new GST rate structure, set to take effect on September 22, aims to boost domestic consumption and offset the impact of the recently imposed 50% US tariffs. India's free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association will come into effect on October 1, according to a statement by Switzerland, as reported by the Economic Times. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.97% to above 8,805 on Thursday, snapping a four-session losing streak, as heavyweight miners and gold stocks advanced on firmer commodity prices. The Australian dollar was little changed at around $0.654 on Thursday, holding its recent gains, supported by stronger-than-expected trade balance figures. Australia's trade surplus expanded significantly in July, reaching A$7.31 billion. The surge was driven by rising exports, which increased by 3.3%, combined with a decline in imports, which fell by 1.3%. At the same time, household spending climbed 5.1% year-on-year in July, the highest growth since November 2023, following a 4.6% rise in June. On Wednesday, RBA Governor Michele Bullock warned that further interest rate cuts may be unlikely if consumer spending continues to rise rapidly. In the U.S. on Wednesday, all three major indexes ended mostly higher as tech strength offset broader market weakness, with investors weighing a favorable antitrust ruling for Google against signs of labor market softening. U.S. stock futures held firm on Thursday following a mixed performance on Wall Street: Dow -0.11% ; S&P 500 +0.07% ; Nasdaq +0.14% .

Hoskinson Shares IOG Audit Results,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano-ada-redemption-controversy-over-hoskinson-shares-iog-audit-results/,"Following the controversial accusations, the results of the third-party forensic review of the Cardano (ADA) voucher redemption program have been made public. Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, says he’s now “waiting for the apologies to come rolling in.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Attempts $111,000 Reclaim, But Last Leg Up Could Be Weeks Away – Analyst Cardano Accusations Have ‘No Basis’ On Wednesday, the Cardano community celebrated after the third-party forensic review of the ADA voucher redemption program was published. The investigative report, conducted by law firm McDermott Will & Schulte and the audit firm BDO, determined that the allegations against Input Output Global (IOG) don’t have any foundation. “After review of tens of thousands of documents, a forensic on-chain and traditional forensic analysis, and eighteen formal interviews of current employees, former employees, Voucher Holders, service providers, community members, and other third parties, the Investigation determined that each of the allegations related to the Topics of Investigation do not have any basis,” the report reads. Public accusations included five main allegations, including that insiders stole or misused ADA that should have been allocated to voucher holders and that there were improper sale tactics related to the voucher program. The claims also accused Cardano blockchain upgrades of being designed to make voucher redemption difficult, and deleted voucher holders’ “private keys” or assets. Lastly, the allegation that Cardano insiders had no legal right to send unredeemed ADA to CDH and decide how to spend it. The controversy emerged in May, when Non-Fungible Token (NFT) artist Masato Alexander alleged that Charles Hoskinson had “unilaterally used his genesis keys to REWRITE the Cardano ledger” during the Allegra hard fork in 2021 to take control of 318-350 million ADA, about 0.2 percent of the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) allocation that remained unclaimed years after launch. Hoskinson denied Alexander’s claims, arguing that 99.8% of the vouchers sold were redeemed by their original buyers, while the remaining 0.2% were “returned to the TGE and donated to Intersect through the same process that funded the Cardano Foundation.” The Review Findings Based on the Investigation, McDermott Will & Schulte and BDO found that the sources of the public allegations against IOG and Charles Hoskinson didn’t originate from unredeemed voucher holders, and they “did not identify evidence indicating that Input Output or Sawyers turned away any potential Voucher Holder who possessed a valid Voucher.” Additionally, they concluded that reasonable guardrails were implemented to prevent deceptive marketing and sales tactics, noting that the program was not designed to exploit the elderly. The audit also revealed that 97.3% of all the vouchers, or 98.8% of the ADA allocated, were redeemed on-chain during the Byron era, and “substantial efforts were undertaken to cause Voucher Holders to redeem on-chain” at the time. As of August 15, 2025, 99.2% of Vouchers consisting of 99.7% of all ada sold pursuant to the Voucher Program have been redeemed through the on-chain redemptions and Post-Sweep Redemption Project. Meanwhile, the review highlighted that the voucher certificates contained redemption codes instead of “private keys,” refuting the accusation that these keys were later deleted. It also concluded that Cardano insiders did not misappropriate the staking rewards from the unredeemed ADA. Time To Move On, Says Hoskinson Hoskinson went on X Space to share the audit result, reading the announcement of IOG’s Chief Legal Officer & Chief Policy Officer, Joel Telpner, and the executive summary of the 128-page document. Cardano’s founder said that it’s been a “deeply frustrating” process, noting that “It’s one thing to attack my intelligence, my physical appearance, my business acumen, my integrity. It’s another thing to accuse me of a crime.” Related Reading: No Ethereum Rally Until Q4? Analyst Eyes Choppy September Before New Highs “This is over. And for the people who stirred this pot: do the right thing, and just apologize. Have some common fucking decency as a human being. Apologize. Let’s just all move on, say you were wrong. Have enough integrity to do that,” he asked. Hoskinson shared his hope that most people will realize that the accusations were taken “too far,” concluding that “Hopefully, we can now just put this nightmare behind us.” Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",Cryptocurrency Market News|ADA|ADAUSDT|Cardano|Cardano audit|Cardano Controversy|Charles Hoskinson|Charles Hoskinson Cardano|crypto community|Input-Output Global (IOG)|Joel Telpner,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ADA|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-09-04 06:00:19
51165215,573731,1756965621,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51165215.jpeg,Bitcoin Treasury Firm Supported By Winklevoss Twins Announces Upcoming IPO,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-treasury-firm-winklevoss-twins-announce-ipo/,"In a notable trend this year, crypto-focused companies are increasingly seeking to go public. The latest entrant to this wave is a newly established Bitcoin treasury firm backed by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, which is preparing for a public listing in Amsterdam. Treasury Plans Amsterdam Debut According to a report by Reuters, the Netherlands-based firm, named Treasury, has announced plans to list on the Amsterdam stock exchange through a reverse merger with Dutch investment firm MKB Nedsense. This move is said to allow Treasury to access public markets more quickly and efficiently. The company recently raised €126 million (approximately $147 million) in a private funding round led by Winklevoss Capital and Nakamoto Holdings, indicating strong backing from notable investors. The reverse listing is expected to provide a significant premium, reflecting a 72% increase over MKBN’s closing share price of €0.7 as of July 11. Both companies aim to achieve a post-consolidation share price of €2.10. To finalize this process, MKBN will hold an extraordinary shareholders meeting to approve the transaction. Following the successful completion, MKBN will be rebranded as “Treasury N.V.” and will trade under the ticker symbol “TRSR.” This move follows a broader trend in the Dutch market, where local crypto firm Amdax announced its plans in August to launch a Bitcoin treasury company named AMBTS on Euronext Amsterdam. Bitcoin treasury companies, like Treasury, hold Bitcoin reserves as their primary assets, differentiating them from traditional firms that typically hold cash. This model allows them to focus on accumulating and retaining Bitcoin over the long term. A prominent example of this strategy is Michael Saylor’s company, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which has continually added to its Bitcoin holdings on weekly basis, resulting in significant unrealized profits for the company so far. Treasury has already amassed over 1,000 Bitcoin, which pales in comparison to Strategy’s stash of 636,000 Bitcoin, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net data . However, it is positioning itself to attract investors in a region where crypto options are relatively limited compared to those in the United States. Gemini’s Upcoming IPO In addition to their new venture, the Winklevoss twins are also preparing crypto exchange Gemini for an initial public offering (IPO) in the US. As reported by Bitcoinist on Tuesday, they are targeting a valuation of up to $2.22 billion, with plans to offer 16.67 million shares priced between $17 and $19 each under the ticker “GEMI.” If successful, this IPO could raise approximately $317 million at the upper end of the pricing range, making Gemini the third publicly traded digital asset exchange, following the successful launches of Bullish and Coinbase.

At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention for trading under $0.004 and being talked about as a stronger play for those seeking 20x returns. Elon Musk’s Lawyer Leads Dogecoin Treasury Plans Elon Musk’s personal lawyer, Alex Spiro, has been named chairman of a new public company aiming to create a Dogecoin treasury worth $200 million . According to reports, the House of Doge has approved the treasury as the official corporate vehicle behind DOGE, making it one of the largest steps toward institutional recognition for the memecoin. The new setup is fueling renewed conversations among traders about Dogecoin’s upside. With DOGE already trading in a relatively tight range this year, many analysts argue that a successful treasury launch backed by Musk’s circle could act as a catalyst for the token. Some forecasts point to the possibility of Dogecoin delivering a 20x ROI , should institutional demand and retail interest align around the treasury project. Dogecoin’s history shows how sensitive it is to Musk’s influence. His public endorsements have often led to quick price moves, cementing DOGE’s reputation as the meme coin most closely tied to mainstream recognition. With the treasury plans underway and investors watching Musk’s next steps, speculation is rising on whether DOGE could once again enter a new growth phase. Why Dogecoin Matters to Traders Since its creation in 2013, Dogecoin has consistently held its place as the leading meme coin by market value. The token’s movements often mirror public hype, making it attractive for short-term traders who thrive on volatility. Now, with corporate-backed funds and treasury projects in play, Dogecoin is finding a new narrative. Institutions seeking exposure to memecoins are beginning to create structured vehicles that make DOGE accessible without direct ownership. This trend is reshaping how traditional investors can access the meme coin market. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Altcoin Trading Under $0.005 With Stronger 20x Outlook While Dogecoin garners attention from Musk’s orbit, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being discussed as a fresher alternative for those looking ahead. Currently trading under $0.005 , this altcoin combines meme coin appeal with real DeFi utility — giving it fundamentals that DOGE lacks. Analysts tracking new projects have pointed out that MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver 20x gains before Dogecoin , given its utility-first design and early pricing. For traders shifting focus away from crowded meme coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a mix of early entry pricing and a story built around more than just hype. With a community-first structure and transparent setup, it is quickly becoming the coin that investors are curious to learn more about — especially those looking for the “next Dogecoin” but with added fundamentals. What Traders Should Do Next Dogecoin’s treasury plan under Alex Spiro is likely to keep it in headlines, but traders looking for higher upside should consider diversifying into new altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as one trading under $0.005, with a case for stronger 20x growth compared to DOGE. Those aiming to position early should review the project now before wider attention builds.

Bloomberg data shows that more than a dozen XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been filed this year, including seven spot products that remain under review. Market observers argue that these pending approvals could represent one of the most important developments for XRP’s long-term price trajectory. Institutional Interest Already Growing Even before a decision on spot products, investor interest in XRP-linked funds has accelerated. Teucrium’s XRP ETF, a leveraged product, has become the firm’s best-performing fund in its 16-year history, attracting over $300 million in inflows within three months of launch . This momentum suggests that spot ETFs, if approved, could see even greater demand given their direct exposure to XRP. Demand is also evident in derivatives markets. Futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) have seen rapid growth, with XRP becoming the fastest cryptocurrency to reach $1 billion in open interest, surpassing both Bitcoin and Ethereum on that metric. Analysts view this as a sign that institutional participants are prepared to scale their involvement if easier investment vehicles, such as spot ETFs, become available. Expectations for XRP ETF Inflows Industry leaders have begun to outline possible inflow scenarios. Steven McClurg, Chief Executive Officer of Canary Capital, recently suggested that up to $5 billion could enter XRP ETFs within their first month of trading. He also argued that XRP spot ETFs might outperform Ethereum ETFs in terms of early adoption. If such forecasts prove correct, XRP could benefit from a surge of institutional capital rarely seen outside of the largest digital assets. Presently, XRP trades at $2.71 with a market capitalization of $163.1 billion. For the token to reach substantially higher levels, it would require significant new demand, precisely what proponents expect ETFs to generate. Still, the scale of inflows will depend on wider market conditions, investor sentiment, and global liquidity trends. XRP Price by December 2025 if ETFs Are Approved To possible projections , Gemini AI was asked to model a scenario where all pending spot ETFs gain approval by their October deadlines. The analysis suggested that widespread approval could serve as a turning point, providing institutional investors, including pension funds, hedge funds, and asset managers, with a regulated avenue for XRP exposure. According to the model, ETF issuers would need to purchase large amounts of XRP to back their funds, which could apply upward pressure on the price. Additionally, extensive media coverage and renewed retail enthusiasm could reinforce this demand. Based on these assumptions, Gemini projected that XRP could reach between $10 and $16 by December 2025. A price in this range would push XRP’s market capitalization above $500 billion, potentially placing it among the top three cryptocurrencies by value. While the outlook is encouraging, analysts caution that the projection remains speculative. Market performance will ultimately hinge on a range of factors, including regulatory developments, global financial conditions, and overall trends in digital assets. The ETF approvals themselves may not guarantee a lasting rally if broader economic pressures weigh on investor appetite. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 October 2025 could be a decisive moment for XRP. If the SEC grants approval to all pending spot ETFs, the influx of institutional participation has the potential to drive prices significantly higher. However, investors are reminded that outcomes remain uncertain and that long-term success will depend on sustained demand beyond the initial launch period.

According to the company's assessment, on August 13th, the MVRV Z-Score returned to its March 2024 levels. Ethereum hadn't performed strongly during that period. The MVRV Z-Score measures the difference between market value and realized value, adjusting for historical volatility. This metric is used to identify both periods of market enthusiasm and attractive accumulation opportunities for long-term investors. Related News: Expert Analyst Claims Bitcoin Will “First Fall to $100,000,” Then Shares What They Expect Next According to data shared by Alphractal, the metric is currently trading below the on-chain “indecision zone.” Historically, this zone has acted as both a resistance and pullback area depending on whether the market is bullish or bearish. For a more optimistic outlook, the indicator needs to surpass its August peak of 1.33. However, the MVRV Z-Score, currently at 0.9, suggests that Ethereum may face sideways consolidation and selling pressure in the short term. *This is not investment advice.

In 2027, it will range between $146.30 and $173.73, with an average price of $160.02. In 2031, it will range between $329.18 and $356.61, with an average price of $342.89. Hyperliquid is a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) . It has its own Layer 1 blockchain, and HYPE is its native token, which is used for staking, governance, and payments within the ecosystem. One of the key features of Hyperliquid, along with its high-speed platform, is that it offers crypto perpetual futures for trading by its users without the need to own the asset. The platform supports a number of cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to BTC, ETH, SUI, AVAX, and SOL, to name a few. Technically, the Hyperliquid blockchain is based on two protocols, namely HyperEVM and HyperBFT; combined, they help provide high-speed trading and Ethereum-based smart contracts with reliability to support the Hyperliquid ecosystem. The Hyperliquid platform revolves around community participation, as token holders have voting rights to govern and influence developments taking place on the platform. On November 29, 2024, Hyperliquid conducted an airdrop of its native token, HYPE, but unlike other players, it was selective in allocating the airdrop to only 94,000 users with an average value of $45,000 to $50,000, making it one of the most worthy airdrops in crypto history. Let’s take a deep dive into what the future holds for the HYPE token in Cryptopolitan’s Hyperliquid price prediction for 2025 and beyond.

According to an overall analysis, the currency has lost 1.11% of its value today. Technical indicators give bullish signals, but the price charts also showcase a bearish market scenario at the time of writing. Why is Hyperliquid down? The cryptocurrency market is shedding, and HYPE is receiving the same sentiment. Moreover, it is encouraging that HYPE marked a new ATH on August 27, 2025. From a broader perspective, the HYPE price decreased to $45.48, losing 1.11% of its total value in the last few hours, but it is still trending near its ATH. Is Hyperliquid a Good Investment? HYPE has growing utility, and its Ethereum compatibility helps it steal a share of DeFi industry. While the technical analysis can change from bullish to bearish, price predictions paint a different picture. However, a risk analysis is recommended. Will Hyperliquid reach $50? The current price action does justify predicting a $50 target. In the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, but if the token maintains its price levels, a rally can be initiated. It can be expected that HYPE will reach above $50 by any time in 2025. Can Hyperliquid Coin reach $100? According to Hyperliquid price prediction, HYPE price might surpass $100 in 2026. The highest price HYPE could attain that year is expected to be above $114.30. Will Hyperliquid reach $500? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, Hyperliquid may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will Hyperliquid reach $1000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, Hyperliquid is unlikely to reach $1000 before 2031. How high can Hyperliquid go? The highest expected price for Hyperliquid is $303.53, which it will achieve in 2031. Does Hyperliquid have a good long-term future? Hyperliquid is trading higher than its December 2024 price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current price and a favorable future valuation of $356.61 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

However, you should note that HYPE is still quite volatile. Negative market sentiment, such as market crashes, could derail the predictions. Hyperliquid Historic Price Sentiment Hyperliquid price history: Coingecko The native token of Hyperliquid, called HYPE, was launched on November 29, 2024, through an airdrop targeted at a limited number of only 94,000 users. This was one of the most lucrative airdrops, with an average allocation of value of $45,000 to $50,000. Hyperliquid kept away from venture capitalists, who usually get most of the tokens in usual airdrops; rather, 76% of the supply was slated for user-centric initiatives. Usually, tokens dump after airdrops until the market momentum picks up, but Hyperliquid’s approach helped garner trust, and the token jumped from $4 to $35 from November 2024 to December 22, 2024. Hyperliquid’s market cap improved during this period, reaching above $8 billion, showing significant growth, as it received super positive market sentiment. In late December and early January 2025, the HYPE token corrected down to $20.24, shedding significant value as per crypto market data. Price stabilized through February as it traded in a range of $19.92 to $27.42 before taking a dive at the end of February, when the broader trend turned bearish again. HYPE stumbled to $12.34 by mid-March, and it touched a low of $10.21 on April 7, 2025. The token saw nothing but improvement in the remainder of the month of April, and its price surged to $18.57 by the end of the month. On June 16, 2025, HYPE reached an all-time high of $45.57. A month later, on July 14, it marked another all-time high of $49.75, and on August 27, it marked its current ATH of $50.99 with changing market dynamics. At the start of September, HYPE is trading near $45.",Crypto Price Predictions|HYPE|Hyperliquid,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|AIRDROP|ETH|ALTCOIN|USDC|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-04 07:20:00

A truly rare Bitcoin buy signal is potentially on the horizon, one that has only emerged twice before in past bear markets. This could represent a significant development for investors and the broader cryptocurrency community. Unpacking the Crucial Bitcoin Buy Signal According to an insightful analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost, a powerful on-chain indicator is flashing green. This indicator is the Binance Bitcoin/stablecoin ratio. Historically, when this ratio approaches one, it has acted as a very rare Bitcoin buy signal . What exactly does this mean? A ratio close to one signifies that the volume of Bitcoin and stablecoins held on Binance is nearly equal. This suggests a unique market dynamic: a substantial amount of stablecoins have flowed into the exchange, yet this capital has not yet been heavily concentrated into Bitcoin. Darkfost further highlighted that Binance’s holdings of ERC-20 stablecoins have reached an unprecedented record high of $37.8 billion. This massive pool of stablecoins represents significant latent buying power, poised to potentially enter the Bitcoin market. A Glimpse into the Past: Historic Accuracy of This Bitcoin Buy Signal The historical context of this indicator is particularly compelling. The same Bitcoin buy signal appeared just last March. What followed was a remarkable market rebound, with Bitcoin surging from a retreat to $78,000 to establish a new all-time high of $123,000. This previous instance underscores the potential significance of the current observation. While past performance is never a guarantee of future results, the rarity and historical accuracy of this specific indicator warrant serious attention from investors. Benefit: The potential for a significant upside if historical patterns repeat. Rarity: This signal has appeared only twice before in past bear markets, making its current emergence highly notable. What Does This Imminent Bitcoin Buy Signal Mean for You? The potential re-emergence of this strong Bitcoin buy signal offers a fascinating perspective on current market dynamics. It suggests that despite recent price movements, there is considerable capital waiting on the sidelines, ready to be deployed into Bitcoin. However, it is crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile. While on-chain indicators provide valuable insights, they should be part of a broader investment strategy. Always conduct your own thorough research and consider your risk tolerance. Actionable Insight: This indicator suggests a potential accumulation phase for Bitcoin, backed by significant stablecoin reserves. Challenges: Market volatility and unforeseen global economic factors can always influence price action. The current environment, with record stablecoin holdings on Binance, indicates a robust potential for demand. This could pave the way for an interesting period in Bitcoin’s price trajectory. In conclusion, the potential return of this rare Bitcoin buy signal is a compelling development for the crypto community. While it is not financial advice, the historical accuracy of this specific indicator, as highlighted by CryptoQuant, suggests a unique opportunity. Investors should remain informed and consider how this on-chain data fits into their overall market outlook. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Binance Bitcoin/stablecoin ratio? This ratio compares the amount of Bitcoin held on Binance to the amount of stablecoins. A ratio approaching one indicates that the volumes are nearly equal, suggesting significant stablecoin inflow without immediate conversion to Bitcoin. Who is Darkfost from CryptoQuant? Darkfost is a contributor to CryptoQuant, an on-chain analytics platform. Analysts like Darkfost use various data points from blockchain networks and exchanges to provide insights into market trends and potential price movements. How accurate has this Bitcoin buy signal been historically? Historically, this specific indicator has appeared only twice before in past bear markets, and each time it preceded a significant rebound in Bitcoin’s price, including a notable surge from $78,000 to $123,000 in March. Does this signal guarantee a Bitcoin price increase? No, no indicator can guarantee future price movements. While this Bitcoin buy signal has a strong historical track record, the crypto market is complex and influenced by many factors. It serves as a strong indicator, not a definitive prediction. What are ERC-20 stablecoins? ERC-20 stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. They are built on the Ethereum blockchain (ERC-20 standard) and are commonly used by traders to enter and exit positions or to hold value without exposure to crypto volatility.

According to a post by Alpha Crypto Signal, “If this breakdown confirms, $PEPE can slide toward the 0.0000085 – 0.0000080 zone next.” Trading Volume and Liquidation Trends Data shows a 15% decrease in trading volume, now at $980 million. Open interest is also down by 4%, sitting at $535 million. These drops suggest fewer active positions in the market, often a sign of reduced participation before a larger move. On the liquidation side, long positions have taken the brunt of recent moves. Long liquidations totaled over $326K, while shorts accounted for only $9,900. OKX was the exchange with the highest long liquidations at $288,300. Source: Coingass Other platforms like HTX, CoinEx, and Gate registered smaller numbers. The imbalance points to the fact that buyers were losing on trades, whereas sellers were seemingly unaffected. On-Chain Activity Continues to Decline As of August 3, PEPE recorded 2,599 active addresses, continuing a broader downward trend in such activity that began in late 2024. Daily active addresses reached a high of nearly 27,500 in November 2024 during a price rally. Since then, both the address count and price have dropped. Throughout 2025, active wallets have remained below the zone of 5,000, essentially witnessing a decline in user activity on the network. Source: Glassnode Meanwhile, the symmetrical triangle pattern comes close to testing. The next area to watch will be around $0.0000085 and $0.0000080 if the price breaks through the support line at $0.0000095, followed by strong volume. A recovery above $0.0000115 is needed to change the current setup. Until then, trading volume, liquidation data, and on-chain usage continue to promote a cautious outlook for the token.

If you’re involved in digital assets, you’ll want to pay close attention to the recent announcement concerning the MixMarvel delisting . This development from a major exchange like Bithumb often signals important shifts for investors and the broader market. What Prompted the MixMarvel Delisting by Bithumb? South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb recently confirmed a significant decision: it will officially delist MixMarvel (MIX) on October 13 at 6:00 a.m. UTC. This isn’t a snap judgment; it follows a thorough review process. Bithumb initially placed MIX on its investment warning list, giving the project time to address concerns. The core issue, according to Bithumb, was the ""insufficient explanatory materials"" provided by the MixMarvel project foundation. These materials were meant to clarify the reasons for the initial warning. After a comprehensive re-evaluation, Bithumb determined that MixMarvel no longer met the essential criteria for continued trading support. This review focused on several critical areas: Project Disclosures: Transparency and clear communication are vital in the crypto space. Business Viability: The long-term operational health and financial stability of the project. Sustainability: The ability of the project to maintain its ecosystem and development over time. Ultimately, Bithumb concluded that these aspects were not adequately addressed, leading to the unfortunate MixMarvel delisting . Understanding the Impact of a Crypto Delisting A delisting, especially from a prominent exchange like Bithumb, can send ripples through the crypto community. For holders of MIX tokens, this news is particularly critical. When an asset is delisted, it typically means: Reduced Liquidity: It becomes harder to buy or sell the token on major platforms. Price Volatility: The token’s price often experiences significant downward pressure due to panic selling and reduced demand. Limited Trading Options: Investors may need to transfer their tokens to other, potentially smaller or less secure, exchanges that still support MIX, or to a personal wallet. This event underscores the importance of due diligence for all crypto investors. Exchanges act as gatekeepers, aiming to protect their users from projects that may not be sustainable or transparent. The MixMarvel delisting serves as a stark reminder of these risks. What Should MixMarvel (MIX) Holders Do Now? If you currently hold MixMarvel (MIX) tokens, taking immediate action is crucial. Here are some actionable insights: Check Bithumb’s Official Announcement: Always refer to the exchange’s direct communication for precise deadlines and instructions. Consider Your Options: You might choose to sell your MIX tokens before the delisting deadline. Alternatively, you could transfer them to a personal wallet or another exchange that still supports MIX. Research any alternative platforms thoroughly. Do Not Procrastinate: Missing the delisting deadline could result in your funds becoming inaccessible or difficult to recover on Bithumb. Remember, the responsibility for managing your assets ultimately rests with you. Staying informed about your investments and the platforms you use is paramount. This Bithumb delisting highlights the dynamic nature of the crypto market. Navigating Future Crypto Investments Post-MixMarvel Delisting The situation with the MixMarvel delisting offers valuable lessons for all crypto enthusiasts. When evaluating potential investments, consider these factors: Project Fundamentals: Look beyond hype. Investigate the team, technology, use case, and roadmap. Transparency: Does the project communicate openly and provide regular updates? Are their financial disclosures clear? Exchange Listings: While being listed on major exchanges is a positive sign, understand that these listings are not permanent. Exchanges regularly review assets. Community Engagement: A healthy, active community can be an indicator of a project’s vitality. By adopting a cautious and informed approach, investors can better navigate the volatile crypto landscape and potentially avoid similar scenarios. The market constantly evolves, and vigilance is key to successful participation. In conclusion, Bithumb’s decision to proceed with the MixMarvel delisting on October 13 underscores the rigorous standards exchanges maintain for listed assets. This move serves as a critical reminder for investors about the importance of project viability, transparency, and the inherent risks in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency. Staying informed and proactive is essential for protecting your digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why did Bithumb delist MixMarvel (MIX)? A1: Bithumb delisted MixMarvel (MIX) because the project foundation provided insufficient explanatory materials to address concerns after being placed on an investment warning list. A comprehensive review found the project lacking in disclosures, business viability, and sustainability. Q2: When will the MixMarvel delisting officially take place? A2: The official delisting of MixMarvel (MIX) from Bithumb is scheduled for October 13 at 6:00 a.m. UTC. Q3: What does a delisting mean for current MIX token holders? A3: For current MIX holders, a delisting typically means reduced liquidity, potential price volatility, and limited trading options on major exchanges. Holders will need to sell their tokens before the deadline or transfer them to a personal wallet or another exchange that still supports MIX. Q4: How can investors protect themselves from similar delisting risks? A4: Investors can protect themselves by thoroughly researching project fundamentals, assessing transparency, understanding that exchange listings are not permanent, and monitoring community engagement. Always stay informed about your investments and the platforms you use. Q5: Are all delistings due to project failures? A5: Not necessarily. While many delistings are due to projects failing to meet exchange criteria (as in the MixMarvel delisting case), some can also occur due to low trading volume, regulatory changes, or a project’s strategic decision to move to other platforms. However, insufficient project viability is a common reason. If you found this insight into the MixMarvel delisting valuable, please share this article with your network.

According to top experts, its potential for wealth-building might be stronger than that of meme-coin giant Shiba Inu (SHIB). Mutuum Finance’s presale is live right now at stage 6 with tokens at $0.035. The project has already recorded more than $15.31 million in raise and acquired more than 16,000 token holders. As the cryptocurrency market continues to migrate towards more utility-driven ecosystems, Mutuum Finance wins. While Shiba Inu sits in the cultural and speculative highlight reel, Mutuum Finance’s lending and liquidity protocols are gaining the attention of both seasoned investors and institutional buyers. Shiba Inu Forecast: Mild Mid-Term Appreciation Expected Under Gentle Sentiment Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading around $0.00001237. Analysts estimate that by the start of October 2025, SHIB would appreciate around 5%, possibly to around $0.00001298. Estimations on a monthly basis suggest a broader range of $0.00001207 to $0.00001587, taking probable upside to 28% in the month into account. Overall, SHIB’s future is muted and range-bound, subject to the overall market dynamics and ecosystem expansion, as investor interest gradually focuses on emerging DeFi platforms such as Mutuum Finance. Stage 6 Presale Live with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance has already made waves in the DeFi arena by securing more than 16,000 investors and raising more than $15.31 million in presale. The project is also conducting a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program for improving security on the platform and further stimulating community engagement, with rewards divided into four levels of risk: critical, major, minor and low. Interest Rate Models When money is abundant, the rates are kept low in MUTM to keep borrowing cheap; however, when money is scarce, the rates are raised, in an effort to make borrowing less attractive and therefore more desirable to borrowers to repay borrowings or to place deposits. Stable rates, as a rule, are higher than variable rates but do not fluctuate unless there is a significant level of volatility in the market. Mutuum Finance Excites investors with a Giveaway Ten lucky investors get to walk away with $10k each as part of an ongoing $100,000 giveaway . This makes it more exciting for existing investors and new investors to join the platform. Mutuum Finance’s lending model is built with 2 characteristics in focus, flexibility and efficiency. A Peer-to-Contract model utilizes smart contracts to facilitate automated lending with zero human intervention. Market dynamics are used for deducting facts while keeping the rate structure the same. The Peer-to-Peer model lets lenders and borrowers get connected directly without middlemen, making it suitable for meme coins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also gaining momentum, with analysts highlighting its greater wealth potential compared to Shiba Inu (SHIB). Stage 6 of presale is live at $0.035, and a raised figure of over $15.31 million is already accompanied by 16,000+ token holders on board. Early adopters can gain substantial upside as demand accelerates ahead of the next price increase. While SHIB’s short-term potential realizes a 5%–28% potential gain, Mutuum Finance offers a use-case-driven solution in its dual lending architecture, $50,000 CertiK bug bounty, and $100,000 community giveaway. With the market shifting in direction of projects with real-world DeFi applications, now is the right moment to invest in MUTM tokens before the next presale phase that will drive the price even higher.

Naturally, this volatility has spurred a wave of trading as crypto traders see this as a time of opportunity due to the fluctuations. The result of this has been a rapid rise in the open interest of both Bitcoin and Ethereum during this time. While this, on its own, is significant, looking at the previous performances, it could suggest where the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are headed next. Bitcoin And Ethereum Open Interest Remain Very High Toward the end of the month of August, the Ethereum price began rising rapidly, fueled by large buys from Ethereum treasury companies such as Bitmine and SharpLink. This push would eventually see the Ethereum price reach a brand new all-time high, beating out its $4,800 peak from 2021 after climbing above $4,950. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Descending Channel Breakout Shows Where Price Is Headed Next In the same vein, the open interest had risen rapidly, and this metric, too, rose to new all-time highs. By August 23, amid the frenzy, the Ethereum open interest climbed above $70 billion for the first time in history, marking a major milestone. Since then, the Ethereum open interest has retraced. But it is still sitting above $55 billion at the time of this writing, suggesting that interest in the altcoin is still high. While the Bitcoin open interest did not hit new peaks in the month of August like Ethereum, it also remained at very high levels. Data from Coinglass shows that the Bitcoin open interest is still averaging at a high $80 billion, still close to the $86 billion all-time high that was recorded back in July. What The Open Interest At ATHs Could Mean Looking at previous performances when the Bitcoin and Ethereum open interest have been at all-time high levels, there is usually a period of consolidation that follows, especially as price retraces. This was seen after the first all-time highs of the year back in February, which was followed by a few months of consolidation. Related Reading: Ethereum price Crash To $4,081: Why The Bears Are In Charge Then again, the peaks in June were followed by short consolidations, which ended in July. And then, another consolidation before the open interest started to rebound in August. This shows that the period of consolidation is not always long, but at the end of it is always another rise in open interest that coincides with a rise in price. From here, if the Bitcoin and Ethereum open interest were to hit new peaks, it would probably mean that their prices are ready to hit new highs as well. Following the trend of the last few months, the open interest could start to pick up again toward the end of September, propelled forward by price recoveries.

It has already held quite well during the recent market downtrend and continues to flash bullish signals during this time. To buttress the bullishness of the SHIB price, crypto analyst Javon Marks has highlighted the confirmation of a bullish pattern. In the event that such a pattern holds and plays out, it could mean new all-time highs for the Shiba Inu price. The Bullish Divergence That Could Send Shiba Inu Price To ATHs In his analysis, Marks pointed out the bullish pattern that has now set the Shiba Inu price on a path to possible new all-time highs. A regular bull divergence had appeared on the MACD histogram, suggesting that the Shiba Inu price may be primed for another reversal. If this reversal does play out, then the first thing for the Shiba Inu price is for it to double . This would quickly put it above $0.00002, which would turn this resistance level into support. In total, the crypto analyst expects the first leg of the recovery to actually reach a 163% gain. This would inevitably help it break the resistance at $0.00003, leading into the next leg of the move. After this move is completed, the analyst expects the Shiba Inu price to keep rising after breaking out of an older structure . Besides the initial 163% run, the Shiba Inu price would still more than double by this point, making it only a part of the total move. A 570% move is expected with a continuation of the bullish momentum, and this would put the price above $0.000081. This target is what pushes the Shiba Inu price toward the new all-time highs and is essential for the total bullish move. Beyond this, though, there is the possibility that the bullish move would actually continue. Going by the analyst’s chart, there could be an almost 100% increase from its previous all-time high for the meme coin to actually eliminate another zero . This target is placed at the $0.0000155 level, something unprecedented in the Shiba Inu history. For now, the Shiba Inu price is still trending around $0.0000125 after the downturn from the weekend. Coinmarketcap data shows that the meme coin is still maintaining a daily trading volume above $200 million as the market fluctuates.",Shiba Inu|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-04 07:30:49

Particularly, Chainlink and Litecoin proponents have renewed attacks on XRP, questioning whether XRP still has a place in the future of digital assets. However, despite the chatter, XRP continues to show strength through its performance with rebuttals from within its community.Chainlink's Growing Institutional Appeal Leads to XRP CriticismsNotably, Chainlink's growing institutional presence has been a major point. Having secured partnerships with SWIFT, Mastercard , and others, Chainlink has built a reputation as the go-to provider of oracle services for decentralized finance and tokenized markets. As a result, Chainlink community figures have recently claimed that these moves put LINK ahead of XRP as the ""banking coin"" for major institutions.Interestingly, Chainlink's new deal with the U.S. Department of Commerce provided another reason for these commentaries. Notably, the partnership will bring major economic data to different blockchains, but the XRP Ledger was not included. This led to some critics suggesting the government snubbed XRPL due to a lack of trust. However, XRP proponents have pushed back.XRP Proponents Push BackFor instance, dUNL validator Vet explained that the issue surrounding XRPL's snob was due to infrastructure. According to Vet, the government leveraged Chainlink and Pyth, and since neither of them has yet to support XRPL, the network wasn't part of the rollout. He argued that the decision had nothing to do with bias.Meanwhile, in another commentary, some Chainlink advocates claimed these recent developments had enlightened investors, leading to a rotation of capital from XRP to LINK.Nonetheless, attorney Bill Morgan dismissed these claims with chart data. He pointed to trading data that shows XRP holding its ground against LINK and reminded critics that XRP has delivered stronger gains this year. Also, former Ripple developer Matt Hamilton stressed that both communities should recognize that XRP and LINK serve very different purposes. Specifically, XRP drives payments and settlement, while LINK primarily powers oracles. These are two roles that don't cancel each other out.https://twitter.com/HammerToe/status/1958533970372571385Litecoin Fuels the XRP AttacksMeanwhile, Litecoin also joined the campaign when its official account mocked XRP's adoption story, comparing it to the foul smell of a comet. The post led to backlash from XRP's community.In his response, attorney Morgan compared XRP's current market ranking and rising market cap with Litecoin's steady decline. He also noted that XRP plays a role in major policy conversations, including at a White House crypto roundtable, while Litecoin has largely faded from relevance.Other community voices also stepped up. For one, Digital Asset Investor brushed off claims that XRP holders were leaving for Chainlink. He called the idea nothing more than a fear campaign designed to create doubt. Multiple XRP community figures share this view, arguing that the project continues to attract unfair criticism that doesn't match its actual track record.Subtle Jab from SWIFT CIOEven outside these community skirmishes, XRP faced shots from industry leaders. Notably, SWIFT's Chief Innovation Officer, Tom Zschach, recently took a subtle jab at Ripple and XRP, arguing that surviving lawsuits does not prove resilience. He said real adoption depends on trust and shared governance, not legal battles. In response, Osama E., Agile Lead at Sharkforce Consulting, argued that XRP's years of legal scrutiny have actually strengthened its position. He said the network has proven itself more than most other blockchains and now stands out as one of the most battle-tested systems in the industry.Despite all the drama, XRP has kept its momentum. Notably, it stands out as one of the biggest gainers in the past year, up 403% within this period despite the recent drop to $2.82. This outpaces the growth from LINK (+111%) and LTC (+71%) in the same timeframe.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|LINK|LTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-09-04 07:33:32

The initiative also aims at ensuring investor protection while maintaining market integrity. The stock exchange suggested plans to introduce enhanced minimum free float requirements and capital raised during initial public offerings. Nasdaq also proposed stricter rules on suspension and delisting of firms that fail to meet its revised listing standards. Nasdaq targets companies operating in China 🚨 Nasdaq just proposed tougher rules for small IPOs & Chinese listings: 🔹Raise public float min to $15M (from $5M) 🔹Faster suspensions for firms 🔹Chinese IPOs must raise at least $25M Goal: curb pump-and-dump swings, boost liquidity. pic.twitter.com/LZ10vMz8dX — Schaeffer's Investment Research (@schaeffers) September 4, 2025 Under the stock exchange’s net income standard, companies will require a minimum of $15 million of public float to be listed. Firms with a market value of listed securities under $5 million and a listing deficiency will also be suspended and delisted from the exchange at a faster rate. Nasdaq’s new requirements are also targeting companies operating in China, establishing a $25 million threshold for public offering procedures in new listings. The $25 million threshold for public offering proceeds matches the exchange’s previous $25 million standard established in its 2020 rule change. John Zecca, executive vice president of the stock exchange, highlighted that the aim is to focus on investor protection and market integrity. Zecca also said the revised standards are in line with market realities and show the company’s commitment to promoting fair and orderly markets. According to him, the initiative also makes emerging companies easily available to investors through the stock exchange platform. “These new listing standards represent one step in a necessary, industry-wide effort – alongside regulators, U.S. exchanges, and market participants – to closely examine trading behaviors in small company securities, with the goal of safeguarding market integrity and enhancing protection for investors.” – John Zecca , Executive Vice President and Global Chief Legal, Risk & Regulatory Officer at Nasdaq. Nasdaq said that its revised standards come as it seeks to address emerging patterns linked to pump-and-dump schemes in the U.S. trading environment. The firm stated that it had to revise its minimum liquidity standard rules to fit the current trading environment. According to the exchange, the new public listing requirements are meant to remain relevant and effective. The stock exchange added that it reintroduced the minimum public offering threshold for China-based companies. The initiative also builds on the firm’s previous standards set for restrictive markets, where the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) could not inspect auditors. Nasdaq plans to collaborate with SEC and FINRA Nasdaq also plans to strengthen its relationship with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) by reporting potential manipulative trading activities. The initiative is also meant to strengthen the exchange’s cooperation with both domestic and international regulators to maintain high standards in the U.S. trading market environment. The proposed rules are still pending approval from the SEC , where the exchange wants to implement the changes promptly. Companies in the initial listing process will get 30 days to complete the process under the prior standards, after which the new listing requirements will begin. Nasdaq is also planning to begin suspending and delisting companies 60 days after SEC approval. Last month, the U.S. stock exchange proposed to suspend and delist companies trading below $0.10 for ten consecutive trading days. Nasdaq also issued a 360 days for companies trading on the exchange below $1, with no added compliance periods for firms that effected a reverse stock split within the prior year. The SEC also requested comments from Nasdaq regarding the eligibility of foreign firms trading in the U.S. to benefit from lighter U.S. reporting requirements. The stock exchange stated the need to balance the interest in attracting foreign companies to the U.S., while still protecting all investors in the U.S. public markets. Don’t just read crypto news.

Ross argued that since COVID, the U.S. has not experienced a ""normal"" economy—business cycles have been heavily influenced by central banks and government spending. Despite years of warnings from so-called ""perma-bears,"" he sees no true recession, only delayed cycles. Key forward indicators are now turning positive. U.S. manufacturing has been in contraction for years, but recent PMI data and new orders suggest a revival. Ross believes this clarity, especially around tariffs and fiscal policy, will spark growth and lift risk assets, including Bitcoin. On geopolitics, Ross voiced concerns about U.S. vulnerability in energy and manufacturing compared to China, warning of a possible conflict in the next few years. However, he also highlighted optimism in AI, robotics, and Bitcoin as transformative forces that could reshape the global economy. For Bitcoin, Ross stressed that liquidity remains the biggest driver. He sees price lagging behind where it “should” be but expects a sharp move higher as the U.S. economy strengthens. While cautious about eventual cycle peaks, he remains bullish into 2026, when he expects Bitcoin to potentially reach new highs. He also warned that the AI-driven manufacturing comeback may not bring jobs, but instead lead to structural unemployment, forcing society to rethink economic models and possibly consider measures like universal basic income. Overall, Ross remains short- to mid-term bullish: “The economy is about to take off, and with it, Bitcoin is finally set to run.”",,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|TRADING|ASIA,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-09-04 07:36:00

In recent months, there have been growing discussions about ETH prices reaching unprecedented levels. One of the boldest forecasts for Ethereum that has gained traction is the $62,000 target popularized by Fundstrat’s Tom Lee.Meanwhile, some are now considering the broader implications of such a price level for the altcoin market. For instance, Cryptoinsightuk suggested that XRP could soar to $50 if ETH were to surpass $62,000 this cycle, as Lee predicted.Tom Lee's Path to $62,000 for EthereumIn a recent analysis shared by Altcoin Daily, Tom Lee explained the foundation of his bold case for Ethereum reaching $62,000, citing the Wyckoff methodology.According to Lee, Ethereum’s current market structure resembles a massive “base,” similar to the one that preceded its 54x rally from $90 in 2020 to its all-time high of $4,866. With the new base forming from the $1,385 level, Lee argues that Ethereum is building potential energy for another outsized breakout.Ethereum-to-Bitcoin Ratio AnalysisAnother key factor in Lee’s projection is the Ethereum-to-Bitcoin ratio. The long-term eight-year average sits at 0.0479, while the current ratio lingers below that at 0.0403. Meanwhile, the 2021 peak reached 0.0807.Lee believes Ethereum not only has room to return to its historical average but could also surpass prior highs—especially as it becomes the preferred chain for Wall Street to build payment rails and financial infrastructure.Fundstrat models Ethereum’s potential price levels using different Bitcoin targets and ETH/BTC ratios. If Bitcoin climbs to $250,000 and Ethereum returns to its average ratio, ETH could range between $12,000 and $22,000.However, factoring in Ethereum’s role in replacing traditional banking payment rails, Lee suggests its implied value could climb as high as $62,000, corresponding to an ETH/BTC ratio of 0.25.Technical Outlook: $9,000 by Early 2026Adding to the bullish case, Fundstrat’s technical strategist Mark Newton projects Ethereum could reach $5,500 by September 2025 and as high as $9,000 by early January 2026. While not as extreme as Lee’s long-term scenario, Newton’s technical analysis underscores strong upward potential in the next cycle.What a $62,000 ETH Means for XRP and the Altcoin MarketFor context, Ethereum is trading at $4,315 today, after dipping 13% from its all-time high of $4,953. The journey from here to $62,000 requires a growth of 1,337%. Notably, this aggressive target could give Ethereum a market cap of approximately $7.48 trillion.Meanwhile, Bitcoin would need to be trading somewhere near $500,000 to maintain a significant lead ahead of Ethereum. Together, both would command a market cap of over $17 trillion in these ambitious scenarios.Given their historical 72.4% dominance, the global crypto market could be close to $24 trillion. This would leave the broader altcoin market with around $7 trillion.Cryptoinsightuk believes XRP could command the next biggest share of the market, with a $50 unit price equating to about $3 trillion. Indeed, XRP currently trails only Bitcoin and Ethereum in the crypto rankings. Notably, XRP demands a growth of 1,685% from its current position to reach $50.However, he also stated that he does not expect these ambitious price scenarios to play out in this cycle or anytime soon. He instead stressed that while Tom Lee’s aggressive $62,000 ETH prediction is receiving applause, a similar outlook for XRP is often met with widespread criticism and skepticism, with many calling such projections unrealistic.https://twitter.com/Cryptoinsightuk/status/1962966542141865989",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|MARKET|XRP|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-09-04 07:38:49

These tokens, valued at an impressive $2.05 million, were transferred from BitGo just hours before the analyst’s report. Moreover, Cumberland has been observed making frequent, smaller-value on-chain transfers over the past 24 hours. This pattern of activity is often indicative of a market maker actively managing a token’s liquidity. This situation gains additional significance because Cumberland is already well-known as the primary market maker for the TRUMP memecoin.

Cross-market AI is an advanced application of artificial intelligence that aggregates and analyzes data from multiple platforms, markets, and industries to create a unified, holistic view. Unlike traditional AI that operates within a single data silo, cross-market AI synthesizes information from diverse sources, such as social media, financial markets, and customer behavior logs, to enable more effective and personalized strategies. Real-world Use Case: A major retail brand uses cross-market AI to analyze customer behavior across its e-commerce site, in-app purchases, and social media interactions. The AI identifies a key trend: customers who engage with a specific product on Instagram are highly likely to respond to a personalized email offer for a related item, leading to a 30% increase in conversion rates for that product line. Why Everyone is Talking About Cross-Market AI The conversation around cross-market AI is driven by its ability to deliver significant business advantages in a competitive, data-driven landscape. Improved Business Outcomes: This technology enables organizations to predict customer behavior with greater accuracy, which directly boosts key performance indicators (KPIs) like conversion rates and return on investment ( ROI ). A McKinsey & Company report estimates that generative AI alone could contribute up to $4.4 trillion in annual global productivity, with marketing and sales being top beneficiaries. Customer-Centric Focus: By creating detailed customer profiles from behavior across multiple channels (e.g., social media, email, online searches), cross-market AI empowers businesses to meet the modern consumer’s demand for highly personalized experiences. Enhanced Predictive Capabilities: The AI’s ability to analyze massive datasets and forecast trends helps companies make smarter, data-driven decisions on everything from marketing budget allocation to product positioning. Automated Efficiency: By automating repetitive tasks like data analysis, A/B testing, and content creation, cross-market AI frees up human employees to focus on high-value, strategic work. Innovation in Marketing: This technology is at the forefront of marketing’s evolution. Companies that integrate cross-market AI tools can develop more creative and targeted campaigns and leverage new capabilities like generative AI for content creation. Key Features of Cross-Market AI Technology The power of cross-market AI lies in its core features, which enable a comprehensive approach to data analysis and strategic execution. Data Integration: Collects and combines data from various sources, including social media, website analytics, and customer relationship management ( CRM ) systems, to provide a comprehensive, 360-degree view of the customer. Customer Segmentation: Analyzes vast datasets to categorize customers into specific segments based on their behavior, psychographics, and preferences, allowing for highly targeted and effective marketing campaigns. Hyper-Personalization: Uses integrated data to deliver deeply personalized content, product recommendations, and offers across multiple channels, enhancing customer engagement and loyalty. Marketing Automation: Automates and optimizes marketing campaigns and workflows, including automated email sends and programmatic advertising, streamlining operations and improving campaign performance. Predictive Analytics: Uses machine learning to forecast consumer behavior, market trends, and campaign outcomes, enabling proactive strategy adjustments and dynamic pricing. AI Chatbots and Assistants: Implements conversational AI to provide intelligent, 24/7 customer support and engagement across various platforms. Real-Time Adaptation: Dynamically adjusts strategies based on real-time market data and customer interactions, ensuring that campaigns remain relevant and effective. Final Summary: The Strategic Imperative of Cross-Market AI The adoption of cross-market AI is not just a technological upgrade—it is a strategic imperative for businesses aiming to stay competitive. The ability to synthesize insights from diverse data streams allows for unprecedented foresight and personalization, leading to tangible improvements in customer experience and business outcomes. Organizations that move quickly to integrate this technology will gain a significant advantage in the race for market share and sustained growth.

Hilton explained that his approach is straightforward, long-term, and built on discipline rather than complicated tactics.Long-Term Hold StrategySpecifically, Hilton noted that his main approach revolves around buying and holding XRP over the years. He said he has accumulated XRP steadily and plans to hold until the asset reaches at least a 30x return from current levels.That translates to an XRP price target of around $80–$90, which he believes is achievable in the future. For Hilton, patience and long-term vision are the cornerstones of his profit strategy. In his words: ""I think XRP will go beyond that. And I don't really care how long it takes—whether it takes a year or two, three, four, or five. I'm going to hold."" This aligns with the perspective of other XRP commentators who urge investors to secure a bag of 10,000 tokens and remain patient for the coin to enter the triple-digit range, enabling portfolios to reach million-dollar levels.In July, investor Armando Pantoja said he is willing to wait for XRP to eventually reach $1,000 per coin, even if it takes over 10 years. This price outlook would make modest holdings worth $2,850 today (1,000 XRP) grow into a million-dollar fortune.Consistently Buying XRP, Even in Red MarketsThe second component of Hilton’s plan is consistent accumulation. He claims to continue buying XRP weekly, regardless of market conditions.Instead of being discouraged during downturns, he views red days as opportunities to acquire more at a discount. He stressed that while others panic and sell, his focus remains on strengthening his portfolio for the long run. ""So, I continue to buy even on the red days. Why? Because buying at $2.85 is still a deal relative to where it's going to be,"" he said.Don’t Sell on FearHilton also noted that it is important to stay unemotional. He said he avoids selling during market crashes or reacting to negative narratives suggesting XRP could fail. Instead, he treats dips as entry points, as he believes XRP, and crypto more broadly, are here to stay. Hilton dismissed the idea that making money with XRP requires complicated strategies. For him, success boils down to three things: holding long-term, consistently buying, and blocking out short-term noise.While XRP won’t create overnight millionaires , he believes time and disciplined investing will deliver results.Diversify, Not Just XRPIn addition to holding XRP, Hilton also uses swing trading tools to expand his profits. However, he emphasized that these are secondary to his main XRP strategy, which he believes is simple but effective.Notably, Hilton also emphasized the importance of diversification in crypto. He noted that he owns stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other crypto assets in addition to XRP. He advised against putting all eggs in one basket, as this could expose one’s portfolio to risk.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-09-04 07:44:27
51170434,https://invezz.com/?p=2860739,1756971900,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Bitcoin dip or altcoin breakout? why MAGACOIN FINANCE could steal the spotlight in 2025,https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/04/bitcoin-dip-or-altcoin-breakout-why-magacoin-finance-could-steal-the-spotlight-in-2025/,"For years, the phrase “buy the dip” has been synonymous with Bitcoin. Investors who followed that rule in 2018 or 2020 walked away with extraordinary returns when the market rebounded. But in 2025, the question has shifted. With Bitcoin already trading above $100,000, can dip-buying still deliver transformational upside, or has the strategy matured into a conservative play? Analysts argue that while Bitcoin remains the bedrock of crypto, the real breakout opportunities are increasingly found elsewhere, in smaller tokens that thrive on cultural momentum and community energy. Among the altcoins gaining attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly emerged as one of the most talked-about contenders for explosive run. Bitcoin: still king, but with limits Bitcoin is not going anywhere. As the world’s first and largest cryptocurrency, it remains a digital store of value, a hedge against inflation, and the benchmark for institutional adoption. Spot ETFs from BlackRock, Fidelity, and others have transformed Bitcoin into a mainstream financial asset, attracting billions in inflows. Yet this very maturity also creates limits. Bitcoin’s market cap is now measured in trillions, making the days of 50x or 100x returns unlikely. Analysts forecast moderate upside, perhaps another 2x in a strong cycle, but the asymmetric returns that once defined Bitcoin’s rise have largely shifted to smaller-cap tokens. Investors who continue to buy dips may still benefit, but the strategy is now more about wealth preservation than wealth creation. Unlike established tokens with capped upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE sits at the ignition point of its story. Presale rounds are selling out in record time, fueled by both retail enthusiasm and early whale participation. What sets it apart from many meme coins is a mix of credibility and identity: completed audits by HashEx and CertiK, a limited supply designed to enforce scarcity, and branding that resonates far beyond crypto-native circles. Analysts describe it as a project designed for visibility and staying power, not just a speculative flash. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE especially compelling is timing. While Bitcoin buyers enter at six-figure levels with modest upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the psychological satisfaction of stacking millions of tokens at a low cost. This narrative, cheap access plus cultural magnetism, has powered every major meme coin explosion in the past. If momentum holds, analysts argue that MAGACOIN FINANCE could capture the same ignition dynamic that turned SHIB and DOGE into household names. Why hesitation is expensive Retail investors often fall into the same trap: they wait for headlines, for listings, for confirmation. By the time that comes, whales and early buyers are already holding positions at far lower levels. This cycle repeats across every breakout token, from Ethereum’s early ecosystem to PEPE’s viral run. The message is consistent: conviction before consensus is where fortunes are made. Today, MAGACOIN FINANCE sits at that same juncture. It is no longer a whisper, but it has not yet become a mainstream phenomenon. Analysts warn that the window to secure allocations at favorable levels is closing quickly. Once it trends broadly on social media or lands on major exchanges, the asymmetry that defines early positioning will vanish. Lessons from past winners The blueprint is clear. Early Ethereum holders who accumulated under $100, Solana believers who bought at $5, and SHIB communities that acted before listings, all were rewarded not because they timed the top, but because they recognized the bottom. The investors who embraced narrative-driven momentum before the mainstream arrived walked away with the largest multiples. Conclusion Buying the Bitcoin dip has worked for over a decade, but its role has shifted from wealth creation to wealth preservation. For investors seeking transformational upside, the spotlight is moving toward cultural tokens that combine scarcity, community, and viral attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its surging presale demand, completed audits, and cultural magnetism, is increasingly viewed as the breakout candidate for 2025. The lesson from past cycles is simple: the biggest gains don’t go to those who follow the crowd, they go to those who act before the story hits the front page.

This is made possible by AI tools trained on the distinct Ghibli aesthetic, which includes soft, hand-drawn textures, warm pastel colors, and a nostalgic, dreamy atmosphere. The primary benefit of this trend is accessibility; anyone can create stunning anime art without requiring artistic skills. The process is simple and can be accomplished in one of two ways. Method 1: Use an Image-to-Image AI Tool This is the fastest method for “Ghiblifying” an existing photograph. It’s ideal for transforming a portrait, pet photo, or landscape into a Ghibli-inspired piece. Select a Tool : Popular platforms offering dedicated AI filters include Fotor and Remaker AI . These tools have specific “Ghibli AI” or anime-style filters. Upload Your Image : Choose a high-quality photo with clear details. The AI uses the photo as a base to create the new artwork. Apply the Filter : With a single click, the AI analyzes and transforms your image into the signature Ghibli style, typically in just a few seconds. Download : Once generated, save your new artwork to your device. Method 2: Use a Text-to-Image AI Tool This method is for creating a brand-new illustration from scratch using only a descriptive text prompt. Choose a Platform : Major AI platforms with advanced image generation capabilities are the best choice. These include Google Gemini , ChatGPT (for Plus users) , and xAI’s Grok . Craft a Detailed Prompt : The key to a great result is a specific prompt. Describe the scene, characters, lighting, and mood. Crucially, explicitly include the phrase “Studio Ghibli style” to direct the AI. Example Prompt : “A peaceful Studio Ghibli-style image of a young girl standing in a sunlit meadow, surrounded by lush green hills and soft pastel clouds. The atmosphere should be warm and dreamy, with hand-drawn textures and soft lighting.” Generate and Refine : Submit the prompt and let the AI create the image. You can then adjust your prompt to refine elements like lighting or character details. The Viral Rise of the Ghibli AI Trend The trend surged in popularity after companies like OpenAI rolled out new image-generation features, making the process seamless. The demand for these whimsical, nostalgic images has been so high that it has even caused server overload for some providers, with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman noting that their GPUs were “melting” from the volume of requests. The viral nature of the trend has also fueled a broader debate about AI art. Critics argue that these tools devalue human creativity and raise copyright concerns, as the AI models are trained on vast datasets of existing art.

Recent dips in Bitcoin’s price have fueled this uncertainty, causing some investors to question the longevity of the current bullish trend. However, a prominent analyst offers a compelling counter-narrative, suggesting that the current Bitcoin cycle is far from finished. This insight could be crucial for anyone navigating the volatile world of digital assets. Is the Current Bitcoin Cycle Truly Unbroken? Despite the recent volatility that has gripped the market, the prevailing sentiment that the Bitcoin cycle has concluded might be premature. According to Axel Adler Jr., a respected contributor at CryptoQuant, the underlying data points to a different story. His analysis indicates that Bitcoin’s current market behavior aligns with a structural uptrend, rather than a cycle top. Adler’s perspective offers a glimmer of hope and a logical framework for understanding Bitcoin’s resilience. He emphasizes the importance of key support levels, which often act as critical junctures for price action. Understanding these levels is fundamental to predicting future movements and making informed investment decisions. Many investors closely monitor such analyses to gauge market health and potential future trajectories. It is vital to look beyond daily fluctuations and consider broader, long-term indicators that reveal the true state of the market. This approach helps to avoid panic selling and to capitalize on sustained growth. Understanding Key Support: Why $107K Matters for the Bitcoin Cycle A significant part of Adler’s argument hinges on Bitcoin’s performance on the monthly chart. He notes that BTC is currently trading around $110,700, which is comfortably above a crucial support level: the short-term holder realized price at $107,600. This metric is a powerful indicator, representing the average price at which short-term investors acquired their Bitcoin. What does this mean for the Bitcoin cycle? Short-term holder realized price: This metric helps to identify the cost basis for investors who have held Bitcoin for less than 155 days. When the price stays above this level, it suggests that these newer market participants are generally in profit, reducing the likelihood of widespread selling pressure. Comparison to other holder groups: Adler highlights that the current price is significantly higher than the realized price for all holders ($52,800) and long-term holders ($35,600). This wide margin indicates robust profitability across different investor cohorts, strongly supporting the notion of a structural uptrend in the ongoing Bitcoin cycle . The fact that Bitcoin maintains its position above these critical realized price levels provides a strong foundation for continued growth. It suggests that the market has absorbed recent selling and is ready to push higher, rather than entering a prolonged bearish phase. This resilience is a hallmark of a healthy and maturing asset class. Decoding Market Sentiment: What NUPL Tells Us About This Bitcoin Cycle Another powerful tool in Adler’s analysis is the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) indicator. This metric helps assess the overall profitability of the Bitcoin market by comparing the unrealized profit of all coins to their unrealized loss. A higher NUPL value indicates greater market-wide profit. Currently, the NUPL indicator stands at 0.53, placing it firmly in the profit zone. While this is a positive sign, Adler points out that it is at a lower level compared to previous market cycles. This observation is particularly insightful: Profit zone, but not overheated: Being in the profit zone means that, on average, Bitcoin holders are sitting on gains. However, the relatively lower NUPL value compared to past peaks suggests that the market is not yet experiencing the extreme euphoria or speculative frenzy often seen at cycle tops. Room for growth: This ‘cooler’ profit zone implies that there is still significant room for the market to expand before reaching potential exhaustion points. It suggests that the current Bitcoin cycle has more fuel to burn, offering further upside potential for investors. This balanced view from the NUPL indicator provides a nuanced understanding of market sentiment. It counters the narrative of an imminent crash by showing that while profitable, the market isn’t excessively overbought, leaving room for continued price appreciation. Navigating the Future: What’s Next for the Bitcoin Cycle? Axel Adler Jr.’s conclusion is clear and provides actionable insight for investors: if Bitcoin’s price can successfully be maintained above the key support level of $107,000, the bullish trend is highly likely to continue. This threshold acts as a crucial barometer for the market’s immediate future, signaling whether the upward momentum will persist. For investors, monitoring this specific price point becomes paramount. A sustained break below $107,000 could signal a shift in market dynamics, while holding firm above it reinforces the analyst’s optimistic outlook for the ongoing Bitcoin cycle . This provides a tangible metric to watch amidst the often-confusing daily price movements. The confluence of strong realized price support and a healthy, yet not overheated, NUPL indicator paints a compelling picture. It suggests that while corrections are a natural part of any market, the foundational elements for a continued uptrend in the Bitcoin cycle remain firmly in place. This perspective encourages a long-term view, rather than reacting to short-term fear. Conclusion: A Resilient Bitcoin Cycle The latest analysis from CryptoQuant’s Axel Adler Jr. offers a powerful counter-argument to the idea that Bitcoin’s current bull run is over. By focusing on critical on-chain metrics like the short-term holder realized price and the NUPL indicator, he demonstrates that Bitcoin’s foundational support remains strong. The key takeaway is clear: as long as the $107,000 support level holds, the prevailing bullish trend of the Bitcoin cycle is poised to continue. This provides a robust framework for investors to confidently navigate the market, understanding that significant upside potential still exists. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the “short-term holder realized price”? The short-term holder realized price is an on-chain metric that calculates the average price at which Bitcoin was acquired by investors who have held their coins for less than 155 days. It helps identify the cost basis for newer market participants. 2. What does the NUPL indicator tell us about the market? NUPL stands for Net Unrealized Profit/Loss. It assesses the overall profitability of the Bitcoin market by comparing the total unrealized profit to the total unrealized loss across all coins. A positive NUPL indicates that the market is, on average, in profit. 3. Why is the $107,000 level so important for Bitcoin? According to the analysis, $107,000 represents the short-term holder realized price, acting as a crucial support level. If Bitcoin’s price remains above this point, it signals that newer investors are profitable, reducing selling pressure and supporting a continued bullish trend. 4. Is this Bitcoin cycle different from previous ones? While the current NUPL is in the profit zone, it’s at a lower level compared to previous cycle peaks. This suggests the market might not be as overheated or euphoric as in past cycles, potentially indicating more room for sustained growth. 5. What should investors watch for next in the Bitcoin cycle? Investors should closely monitor Bitcoin’s price action relative to the $107,000 support level. A sustained hold above this level would reinforce the bullish outlook, while a decisive break below it could signal a shift in market dynamics.

The license, granted under the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), allows QCP to provide spot and derivatives trading, market making and structured solutions for institutional and professional clients. The firm already holds a Major Payment Institution license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Founder Darius Sit said the Abu Dhabi approval marked a cornerstone in QCP’s global strategy. He also described the Middle East as a vital region for digital assets. Moreover, he noted that the ADGM framework gives institutional clients confidence in both security and regulatory oversight. Strategic Location Positions ADGM As Gateway To MENA And Asia Abu Dhabi has positioned itself as a leading destination for crypto firms.

Since then, it has worked to attract exchanges, custodians, and token issuers. To do so, it relies on strict compliance standards and favorable tax policies. Major investments have reinforced the emirate’s wider push into digital assets. In March, Abu Dhabi’s MGX fund committed $2b to Binance , showing its intent to compete with other global financial centers. Market participants say the combination of clear rules, tax advantages and geographic reach makes ADGM appealing to firms seeking to operate across the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Applicants Face Heavy Costs, Stringent Compliance Demands However, the licensing process is demanding. Applicants face high fees, detailed compliance checks and requirements for robust governance and cybersecurity frameworks. Firms must submit detailed business plans, AML and CFT policies, and evidence of qualified leadership before winning approval. For QCP, the dual licensing in Singapore and Abu Dhabi provides coverage across two established financial hubs. The company says this positioning enables it to bridge liquidity between Asia and the Middle East, while offering clients 24-hour regulated trading. Abu Dhabi Attracts More Crypto Firms Seeking Strong Oversight ADGM’s chief market development Officer, Arvind Ramamurthy, welcomed QCP’s addition. He said the group’s focus on regulatory compliance and digital asset innovation fits the center’s goal of attracting top-tier financial institutions to the region. QCP joins a growing list of firms using Abu Dhabi as a base for crypto expansion. By securing one of the more challenging licenses to obtain, the company has strengthened its credentials in a sector where regulators are demanding higher standards. As global oversight of digital assets intensifies, Abu Dhabi is betting that its combination of progressive regulation and institutional credibility will draw more players like QCP to its shores.

A joint audit , published on Wednesday, confirmed that 99.7% of all Cardano tokens sold pursuant to the voucher program have been successfully redeemed through the on-chain redemptions and Post-Sweep Redemption Project. “The Investigation determined that each of the allegations related to the Topics of Investigation do not have any basis.” Further, the investigations revealed that unclaimed ADA were allocated to Cardano Development Holdings for grants and community initiatives. The investigation was jointly conducted by Input Output Global (IOG), global law firm McDermott, Will & Schulte and the global accounting firm BDO.

It elaborates how the voucher distribution was managed through a structured and secure framework with transactions recorded on-chain. Cardano Misconduct Allegations – Founder Hoskinson’s Promise Fulfilled In May, allegations surfaced against the ecosystem’s founder , Charles Hoskinson, over manipulating the blockchain during the 2021 Allegra hard fork. He was accused of misappropriating over $600 million worth of ADA tokens. Per the accusations, 318 million ADA, valued at around $619 million in 2021, was moved from presale addresses into the Cardano reserves. Additionally, NFT artist Masato Alexander claimed that Hoskinson used a “genesis key” to rewrite the ledger. He argued that most of the original token holders never reclaimed their funds. Hoskinson later promised an audit to debunk claims of misappropriation of $600 million worth ADA. He said that the Cardano Foundation will soon release an audit to counter rising criticisms. He wrote on X at the time that the original token buyers had already redeemed most of the 350 million ADA. In June, Hoskinson said that he received the first copy of the audit report, promising to release more details by mid-August, if there are no delays.

Our Pi network price prediction anticipates the Pi price to reach a maximum level of $0.4232 by 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $4.74. Pi Network, founded by Stanford PhDs Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan, is a social cryptocurrency and developer ecosystem built for accessibility and real-world utility. The Pi Network is entering a crucial stage in 2025 as its ecosystem expands, but market sentiment stays cautious. Pi Coin recently hit an all-time low of $0.3304 on August 26, 2025, months after peaking at $2.98 in February, highlighting its volatile price action within the crypto market. Despite this, the network is moving forward with completing key developments. The Passkey Update introduced Face ID, fingerprint, and device PIN authentication, strengthening security ahead of the long-awaited Mainnet launch. At the same time, Pi Hackathon 2025 opened the door for developers to build real-world services and apps, while early seed investor Ulu Ventures confirmed its backing as an indication of continued confidence in Pi’s future. In this article on Pi Network price prediction, we look at recent trends, ecosystem development, and both technical and fundamental factors that could determine Pi coin value between 2025 and 2031.

PI declined 1.19% in the last 24 hours. The coin faces resistance near $0.38, while support is around $0.32. On September 4, Pi Network (PI/USDT) is trading at $0.3487, marking a 1.19% day decline. The day’s chart captured a high of $0.3587 and a low of $0.3447, while the previous close stood at $0.3522. The token has struggled to hold gains since its sharp spike in May, where it briefly touched levels near $1.80 before sliding into a prolonged downtrend to an all-time low on August 26, 2025. Pi Network 1-day price chart analysis The 24-hour chart shows the Pi Network price trading at $0.3487, marking a 1.19% decline. The daily chart shows the token struggling to sustain upward momentum, with resistance forming around $0.38 and support near $0.32. Price movement has remained weak, with sellers dominating. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 44.30. This places Pi in a neutral zone, leaning slightly bearish as it hovers below the 50-mark. The RSI indicates that buying strength remains limited, with no immediate signs of overbought or oversold conditions. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line stands at 0.0017, while the signal line is at -0.0157. The histogram is at -0.0175, reflecting bearish momentum. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView Pi/USD 4-Hour Price Analysis Pi is trading around $0.3473 on 4-hour chart, showing sideways movement with less strong momentum. The RSI at 45.06 suggests bearish pressure, as buying strength remains subdued. On the downside, support is at $0.34, and a drop below this level could open the way toward $0.32. On the upside, resistance sits near $0.36, and only a decisive breakout above this zone could allow Pi to retest the $0.38–$0.40 range. The MACD line is at 0.0010, the signal line is at -0.0021, and the histogram is around -0.0031, indicating bearish momentum but with weakening strength.

From the Pi price analysis, the coin is likely to continue consolidating between $0.3420 support and $0.3456 resistance in the short term. A breakout above resistance could trigger a way toward $0.351, while a drop below support may cause further downside momentum. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.3610 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly, neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is PI’s price down today? Pi Network (PI) is down today as upcoming token unlocks raise supply concerns, adding to selling pressure in a weak crypto market. Bearish technical factors like broken support levels, oversold RSI, and negative MACD confirm a fragile price action outlook. Broader market fear and low liquidity further weigh on sentiment, leaving investors cautious about Pi’s near-term value. Will Pi Price Reach $5? If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $5 mark. Will Pi Reach $10? Depending on the current market sentiment, the PI price might take several years to reach the $10 milestone. We expect the Pi price to reach $10 by 2033.

Always do your own research when trying to make investment decisions. Pi Historic Price Sentiment PI price history: Coinmarketcap Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi shows sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72 if support at $0.60 holds. At the start of July 2025, Pi Network faces high volatility as massive token unlocks trigger strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458–$0.50 range.

At the same time, Chainlink is showing resilience, with LINK price predictions turning more bullish as whale accumulation grows. Yet, the spotlight is shifting toward Remittix , a PayFi-focused altcoin. With its $23.5 million raise, analysts forecast Remittix could surge 5,000% faster than its rivals. Pi Network Price Prediction Shows Weak Liquidity Concerns Pi Network price today trades at $0.4472, slipping after hitting a short-term peak near $0.4944 earlier in the session. The Pi Network Price Prediction shows that resistance at $0.50 remains unbroken, and without stronger catalysts, momentum is stalling. Community sentiment is split, with some pointing to Pi Coin News around potential listings or ecosystem upgrades, while others highlight low liquidity and speculative trading. Pi Coin Price Prediction models remain cautious, with realistic targets closer to $0.60 by Q4 2025 rather than a surge to $1. Despite Pi Network’s 50M+ user base and its unique mobile mining model, the lack of centralized exchange support continues to weigh heavily on market outlook. Pi Coin Price resilience at $0.42 now acts as support, but analysts argue Pi needs significant adoption news to justify higher valuations. For now, Pi Network News reflects uncertainty, leaving traders eyeing alternatives with stronger fundamentals. Chainlink Price Prediction Sees Cup And Handle Formation Chainlink price today sits near $23 after a recent 17% pullback, but analysts say the correction could be setting the stage for a bigger move. The LINK Price Prediction remains bullish thanks to whale accumulation and shrinking exchange balances, which historically point to strength. Recent Chainlink News shows reserves climbing steadily, removing tokens from circulation and tightening supply. Whales have snapped up nearly 2 million tokens in 30 days, boosting confidence that the Chainlink Price Prediction could target $27 and beyond. Partnerships continue to strengthen the outlook, with LINK News highlighting new integrations such as secure rate feeds and U.S. government data adoption. The cup-and-handle pattern forming on charts further supports upside momentum. Analysts note that a breakout above $27 could unlock targets of $31, making the LINK Price today look like an attractive entry. For now, Chainlink Price resilience is convincing traders that upside remains firmly in play. Analysts Back Remittix As The Next Major Breakout Remittix is quickly separating itself from hype-driven projects by focusing on one of the biggest real-world challenges: cross-border payments. Unlike Pi Network’s speculative climb and correction phases or Chainlink’s slow but steady gains, Remittix is scaling at speed. The project has already raised over $23.5 million with more than 642 million tokens sold at just $0.1030. Investors are betting on its unique PayFi infrastructure to deliver the next wave of adoption.

A recent discovery has sent ripples through the cybersecurity community: hackers are now leveraging Ethereum smart contracts to conceal malicious code. This alarming development introduces a novel method for deploying Ethereum smart contract malware , cleverly bypassing traditional security scans and posing a significant risk to developers and users alike. This isn’t just another virus; it’s a stealth operation using the very backbone of decentralized finance. What is This New Ethereum Smart Contract Malware Tactic? Security firm ReversingLabs recently uncovered this sophisticated technique, shedding light on a new frontier for cybercrime. They found malicious packages embedded within the popular open-source code repository, NPM. These packages, deceptively disguised as simple utilities, contained hidden URLs. When activated on an infected system, these URLs quietly prompted the download of dangerous malware. This method is not merely a simple trick; it represents a strategic and ingenious move by attackers. By embedding malicious elements or their triggers within Ethereum smart contracts, cybercriminals are essentially using the decentralized, immutable nature of the blockchain as a sophisticated hiding place. This makes detection incredibly difficult for conventional security tools that aren’t specifically designed to scrutinize blockchain transactions for such covert operations. The elegance of this approach lies in its ability to leverage a trusted infrastructure for nefarious purposes. Why is This a Game-Changer for Blockchain Security? This technique signifies a notable shift in how cybercriminals operate within the crypto space. While malware previously relied on more direct attack vectors, the use of Ethereum smart contract malware for concealment offers several distinct advantages to attackers: Enhanced Evasion: Traditional antivirus and endpoint security software are typically not configured to scan blockchain data or smart contract code for hidden payloads. This blind spot is precisely what attackers exploit. Increased Persistence: Once a malicious trigger or reference is embedded within an immutable smart contract, it can be highly persistent. The very nature of blockchain, designed for permanence, becomes a liability. False Legitimacy: The association with legitimate smart contracts and open-source libraries can lend an air of authenticity to the malicious activity, making it far harder for unsuspecting users or even automated systems to detect foul play. ReversingLabs aptly described this as a “novel technique,” underscoring its innovative and concerning nature. Developers who frequently integrate open-source packages into their projects are particularly vulnerable. The unsuspecting inclusion of a compromised package could lead to widespread infections, making acute awareness of Ethereum smart contract malware an absolute necessity for anyone involved in blockchain development or digital asset management. How Can We Combat This Emerging Ethereum Smart Contract Malware Threat? Protecting against this advanced form of Ethereum smart contract malware requires a proactive, multi-layered approach and increased vigilance from all stakeholders. Here are critical actionable insights for developers, security teams, and even everyday users: Thorough Code Audits: Always perform in-depth security audits of all smart contracts and open-source libraries before deployment or integration. Never simply trust; verify every line of code and its dependencies for any anomalies. Robust Supply Chain Security: Implement stringent supply chain security practices for all open-source dependencies. Utilize specialized tools that scan for known vulnerabilities, suspicious patterns, and unexpected changes within packages. Behavioral Monitoring and Analysis: Shift focus towards monitoring system behavior for unusual network requests, unexpected file downloads, or suspicious process executions, even if they originate from seemingly legitimate sources. Stay Updated and Patch Regularly: Ensure all software, including operating systems, development tools, and security solutions, are consistently updated to their latest versions. Patches often address newly discovered vulnerabilities. Continuous Developer Education: Invest in educating development teams on the latest threat vectors, including novel blockchain-based attack methods. Understanding the enemy is the first step in defense. This evolving threat highlights the urgent need for continuous adaptation in cybersecurity strategies, especially within the rapidly advancing and complex blockchain ecosystem. The security landscape is dynamic, and our defenses must be equally agile. Conclusion: The emergence of Ethereum smart contract malware as a sophisticated hiding mechanism for malicious code marks a concerning evolution in cybercrime. As our digital landscape continues to intertwine deeply with blockchain technology, the methods employed by attackers become increasingly subtle and harder to detect. Remaining informed, implementing stringent security protocols, and fostering a culture of unwavering vigilance are paramount to safeguarding our digital assets and critical infrastructure from these insidious threats. The ongoing fight against hidden malware requires collective effort, continuous innovation, and proactive measures from every corner of the crypto community. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Ethereum smart contract malware? A1: Ethereum smart contract malware refers to malicious code or triggers that are hidden within or referenced by legitimate Ethereum smart contracts, allowing hackers to bypass traditional security scans and deploy malware onto unsuspecting systems. Q2: How do hackers use smart contracts to hide malware? A2: Hackers embed hidden URLs or other malicious payloads within seemingly innocuous open-source packages that interact with smart contracts. When these packages are used, the hidden elements prompt infected systems to download and install malware. Q3: Why is this new technique difficult to detect? A3: This technique is difficult to detect because traditional security tools are not designed to scan blockchain data or smart contract code for hidden malicious content. The immutable nature of the blockchain also provides a persistent hiding place for these threats. Q4: What steps can developers take to protect against this threat? A4: Developers should perform thorough code audits of all smart contracts and open-source dependencies, implement robust supply chain security, monitor system behavior for anomalies, keep software updated, and educate their teams on new threat vectors. Q5: Are general users at risk from this type of malware? A5: While developers integrating open-source code are directly targeted, general users can be indirectly at risk if applications or services they use incorporate compromised components.

While August brought turbulence and brief outflows, the recovery has underscored the resilience of institutional demand, with products like BlackRock’s IBIT fund continuing to anchor adoption. Yet this institutional wave is not unfolding in isolation. As large funds reinforce Bitcoin’s position, retail investors are beginning to scout for higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities. Among the names drawing attention, MAGACOIN Finance has emerged as a presale that is positioning itself as a speculative complement to Bitcoin’s ETF-driven surge. ETFs Cement Bitcoin’s Role in the Cycle Since their launch, spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted more than $54 billion in inflows, establishing themselves as the backbone of institutional adoption. BlackRock’s IBIT fund alone has surpassed $80 billion in assets under management, becoming the flagship vehicle for traditional investors entering the market. Even August’s mild withdrawals proved temporary, as renewed deposits quickly restored momentum, reinforcing the sense that institutions are tactically buying dips rather than retreating. This consistency is reshaping market dynamics. ETFs are not just drawing liquidity; they are validating Bitcoin’s role as digital gold in institutional portfolios. Analysts suggest that this foundation is why forecasts continue to climb, with the $120,000 target viewed less as a speculative bet and more as a logical extension of structural demand. Price Action and Forecasts for Q4 Bitcoin’s climb to nearly $124,000 in August triggered profit-taking, but technical indicators show the broader uptrend remains intact. Consolidation above the 200-day EMA is strengthening the case for a fresh rally, with short-term forecasts clustered between $117,900 and $122,300. Looking further ahead, analysts see room for $125,000–$130,000 in Q4, especially if ETF participation accelerates. The long-term outlook is equally bullish. Conservative models put 2025 targets in the $145,000–$175,000 range, while more aggressive forecasts stretch toward $181,000–$200,000. Importantly, experts emphasize that ETF flows are functioning as a sentiment barometer: every retracement has been met with renewed institutional buying, while corporates such as MicroStrategy, Trump Media, and Metaplanet have expanded their holdings at support. This pattern has reinforced the perception that Bitcoin’s bull market remains firmly intact. Market Sentiment Turns Decisively Bullish Heading into the final quarter of 2025, sentiment across the analyst community is strikingly positive. CoinPedia’s latest macro outlook observed that “as long as support holds, optimism remains intact… and the odds are very high that consolidation above $108K will lead to a bullish move toward $130K.” Institutional participation through ETFs has become the anchor of this cycle, but high-profile endorsements are also amplifying confidence. Eric Trump, echoing the institutional narrative, has publicly projected that Bitcoin could eventually climb to $1 million, framing it as the digital reserve asset of the future. While such forecasts are at the upper edge of the spectrum, they capture the scale of optimism that is building around Bitcoin as ETF inflows deepen and regulatory clarity improves. Against this backdrop, analysts argue that the foundation for a historic rally is stronger than in any previous cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Retail Counterbalance to ETFs While Bitcoin dominates institutional flows, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out its narrative from a different angle that could deliver 35x ROI to early players. The presale has become one of the cycle’s most discussed retail plays, appealing to investors who believe the most asymmetric returns are found outside regulated ETF products. History suggests that when institutions crowd into Bitcoin, speculative capital often rotates into emerging tokens. MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as the beneficiary of this dynamic, offering exposure to a high-risk, high-reward story built on timing and community momentum. For investors balancing portfolios, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly seen not as a rival to Bitcoin but as a complement — the retail-driven counterpart to the institutional ETF wave. Conclusion Bitcoin’s ETF-fueled rally has reestablished it as the anchor of the crypto market, with inflows surpassing $1.2 billion and analysts targeting $120,000 as the next milestone. The message is clear: institutions are here, adoption is accelerating, and price action reflects unprecedented demand. But alongside this institutional story sits a retail one. MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the counterpoint, a presale token thriving on community enthusiasm and speculative appetite. For investors weighing the best strategies heading into Q4, the dual narrative is compelling: Bitcoin is defining the institutional era, while MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver the kind of breakout performance that only retail-driven cycles can produce.

The formation begins with corrective waves labeled A through E, covering the first half of 2025. Following this, the chart introduces a bullish five-wave impulse sequence, starting when XRP hit its all-time high of $3.65 in July, before retracing and entering another consolidation phase . Dark Defender’s analysis suggests that this consolidation phase is forming Wave 2. Wave 2 is often a corrective pullback before Wave 3, which is the strongest Wave in the cycle. Dark Defender’s chart suggests that Wave 3 could reach as high as $15. Wave 4 is also corrective, but preserves most of the profit made in Wave 3, before the final climb in Wave 5. The chart shows Wave 5 targeting $18.22, which sits at the Fibonacci 361.8% extension level. Notably, Dark Defender has constantly reiterated this target , and despite XRP’s recent pullback, he is confident that the asset can reach this level. Key Levels to Monitor Several levels are highlighted on the chart as reference points for this trajectory. At the lower end, the $1.88 mark, labeled as the 161.8% Fibonacci extension, establishes a strong base. The $3.33 level serves as a trigger, with a breakout above it expected to accelerate XRP’s momentum.

This isn’t just another corporate deal; it involves a lawmaker stepping in to tackle delays and investor concerns. Let’s dive into why this development is so significant for the digital asset landscape. What’s Behind the Binance Gopax Acquisition Delay? Min Byung-deok, a prominent lawmaker and chairman of the ruling Democratic Party’s Digital Asset Committee, is scheduled to meet with Richard Teng, the CEO of Binance, next week. The core of their discussion will revolve around the significant delay in Binance’s efforts to acquire South Korean exchange Gopax. This delay is directly linked to a pressing issue: the repayment of debt to victims of Gopax’s GoFi staking service. Unfortunately, Gopax has been unable to repay both principal and interest to its GoFi investors. This unfortunate situation stems from the 2022 bankruptcy of its operating partner, Genesis Global Capital. The ripple effect of Genesis’s collapse left GoFi investors in a precarious position, awaiting resolution. Binance’s proposed acquisition was seen as a potential lifeline for Gopax and its affected users. However, the process has faced unexpected hurdles, leading to frustration among investors and prompting legislative intervention. Why is This Binance Gopax Acquisition Meeting So Important? This upcoming meeting is critical for several reasons. Firstly, it highlights the growing regulatory scrutiny on cryptocurrency exchanges, especially when investor funds are at risk. A lawmaker’s direct involvement underscores the gravity of the situation and the government’s commitment to protecting its citizens. Secondly, the resolution of the Binance Gopax acquisition is vital for the stability and trust within the South Korean crypto market. A successful acquisition could pave the way for Gopax to fulfill its obligations to GoFi investors, restoring confidence in the platform and the wider ecosystem. Key issues at stake include: Investor Protection: Ensuring GoFi victims receive their owed funds. Market Stability: Preventing further disruption in the South Korean crypto market. Regulatory Clarity: Setting precedents for future acquisitions and operations of global exchanges in the region. Binance’s Reputation: A successful resolution could strengthen Binance’s standing in a key Asian market. The outcome of these discussions could set a significant precedent for how global crypto giants navigate local regulatory frameworks and address past financial challenges. What’s Next for the Binance Gopax Acquisition and GoFi Victims? The meeting between Lawmaker Min and Binance CEO Teng is expected to be a pivotal moment. While specific details of the discussions remain confidential until the meeting, the focus will undoubtedly be on finding a concrete path forward.

Market watchers are showing interest in XYZVerse (XYZ), hinting at a possible huge price jump. This buzz grows as major names like XRP and Solana (SOL) are expected to reach new peak prices. Fresh data suggests XYZVerse could outpace them both. XRP (XRP) Source: TradingView XRP keeps hovering between $2.67 and $2.98 after a rough week that shaved 4.72% off its tag. The slide now sits at 7.86% for the month, yet the coin remains 18.65% up from half a year ago. Momentum cooled, but bulls are still circling. Short term signals stay mixed. Price hugs the 10-day average at $2.85 while the 100-day line at $2.81 rises gently. RSI stands at 44.10, near neutral but leaning weak. Stochastic sits at 20.81, hinting oversold. MACD keeps a tiny positive line, suggesting bears lack full control. If buyers defend $2.56, a break above $2.98 could rush toward the first wall at $3.19, a jump of about 8%. Clearing that zone opens $3.51, roughly 18% above now. Failure to hold $2.56 risks a slide to $2.24, about 15% down. Expect choppy trade with a slight upward tilt. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Hits the $15M Milestone XYZVerse ($XYZ), recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, is drawing significant attention thanks to its standout concept. It is the first ever meme coin that merges the thrill of sports and the innovation of web3. Unlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse offers real utility and a clear roadmap for long-term development. It plans to launch gamified products and form partnerships with big sports teams and platforms. Notably, XYZVerse recently delivered on one of its goals ahead of schedule by partnering with bookmaker.XYZ, the first fully on-chain decentralized sportsbook and casino. As a bonus, $XYZ token holders receive exclusive perks on their first bet. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.005, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.01. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $15 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $20 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors are rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price, and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Solana (SOL) Source: TradingView Solana moved in a tight $184.88-$217.32 range this week and still closed with a 1.72% gain. The token slipped under its 10-day average of $209.18 yet stays above the 100-day line at $204.55, showing short-term cooling while the broader trend stays up. Momentum tools sit low, which often signals sellers are tiring. Zoom out and the picture brightens. SOL jumped 21.76% in the past month and 48.21% over 6 months, outpacing most large caps. The rise lost speed only in the last few sessions, letting buyers regroup near the mid-200 area. Volume holds steady, so a single sharp move could set the next leg. Traders watch $233.88 as the first ceiling. A break there would open room toward $266.33, roughly 23% above today’s top tick. Failure to clear $217 could drag price to support at $169.01, about 10% below the week’s floor, with deeper protection near 136.57. Given the longer climb and modest near-term pullback, odds still lean to an upside test before any larger slide. Conclusion XRP and SOL are good, but first all-sport memecoin XYZVerse now leads the 2025 bull run, targeting 20,000% gains by merging GameFi, media partnerships, and passionate sports fandom.

Key Takeaways: Etherealize raised $40M to accelerate Ethereum’s adoption by traditional finance. The funding comes amid a $1.2B ETH accumulation by public firms, signaling growing institutional interest. The firm will build infrastructure for tokenized asset settlement and Ethereum-based financial tools. The raise, led by Electric Capital and Paradigm , aims to deepen institutional understanding of Ethereum and accelerate its adoption across traditional finance. The funding round arrives during a pivotal week for Ethereum, with public firms collectively adding over $1.2 billion worth of Ether (ETH) to their treasuries, a surge that underscores growing institutional appetite for the asset. Etherealize Aims to Bridge Ethereum and Wall Street Etherealize, launched in January with backing from the Ethereum Foundation and co-founder Vitalik Buterin, is designed to bridge the gap between Ethereum’s complex ecosystem and the financial world’s demand for clarity, tools, and regulation-ready infrastructure. Co-founder Grant Hummer previously noted that despite Ethereum’s presence in crypto ETFs, many institutions still lack the fundamental knowledge needed to engage meaningfully with ETH. The $40 million will fund new tools and platforms tailored to institutional workflows. Etherealize plans to build infrastructure for private trading and settlement of tokenized assets, including a settlement platform for tokenized bonds and other fixed income products. The firm is positioning itself at the intersection of crypto-native innovation and enterprise-level finance, hoping to deliver scalable solutions for firms seeking exposure to Ethereum’s capabilities. “Over the past decade, Ethereum has gone from an experiment to the world’s most battle-tested, open financial network,” said co-founder Danny Ryan, adding that the new capital will help “upgrade institutional finance to modern, safer, globally accessible rails.” ETHEREALIZE'S NEXT CHAPTER We were born as a marketing and BD arm for Ethereum. Today, we're excited to announce that we’re expanding our mission: Etherealize is building for the next era of finance—where Wall Street merges with Ethereum. (1/12) pic.twitter.com/mlmqBDmAHH — Etherealize (@Etherealize_io) September 3, 2025 The raise comes as Ethereum sees renewed momentum among public companies. The Ether Machine, a crypto treasury firm planning a public listing, led this week’s accumulation with a 150,000 ETH buy , valued at $654 million. Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion Technologies, Ethereum’s largest corporate holder, added another $65 million in ETH on Wednesday alone, per data from Arkham. Other firms followed suit. Sharplink Gaming and Yunfeng Financial disclosed ETH purchases worth $176 million and $44 million, respectively. Joseph Lubin Predicts 100x ETH Surge Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin believes ETH could rally 100x or more over time , calling it Wall Street’s future infrastructure as TradFi shifts toward decentralized finance. In an X post, Lubin said Ethereum will replace many siloed systems at institutions like JPMorgan and become the backbone for financial services, staking, and smart contract execution. Backing the bullish stance of Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, Lubin stated he’s “100% aligned” with Lee’s view that Ethereum could flip Bitcoin in network value. He compared the moment to 1971 when the U.S. dollar left the gold standard, signaling a tectonic shift in financial architecture led by Ethereum. Likewise, Lee has predicted that Ethereum will rally in the near term to $5,500 , with an ambitious year-end target of $12,000. During his August 26 guest appearance on the Amitis Investing program, Lee disclosed that institutional Wall Street sentiment toward Ethereum has shifted dramatically following the U.S. Senate’s passage of the GENIUS Stablecoin legislation . Lee emphasized that Ethereum is the foundational blockchain infrastructure for traditional finance (TradFi), currently supporting over $145 billion in stablecoin supply.

By press time, somETHing was trading at $0.03214, reflecting a 32.97% increase over the past day. During the same timeframe, the token’s trading volume spiked to $218,600, a notable jump from its typically low activity, with a market capitalization of $1.3 million. somETHing one-day price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Despite the surge, the token remains highly illiquid, with only 461.2 units traded and no unique traders, buyers, or sellers recorded. Why somETHing is pumping The sudden pump is in part linked to an X repost by Buterin of a July 31 post from Marius van der Wijden, a prominent figure in the Ethereum ecosystem. In the post titled “Believe in somΞing,” he shared an introspective message about his journey with the network as it marked its 10th anniversary. Vitalik Buterin’s repost of post on somETHing. Source: X Wijden’s post, which Buterin amplified, reflects on his journey since Ethereum’s inception in 2015. He highlighted his role in the Ethereum Foundation and his contributions to the network’s development, including the successful execution of ‘The Merge’ upgrade in 2022 . Notably, the post’s nostalgic tone and emphasis on Ethereum’s decentralized ethos seem to have resonated with the community, drawing attention to somETHing. Overall, the lack of sustained trading activity suggests speculative hype around Buterin’s repost drives the pump more than genuine demand. This phenomenon is not uncommon in the crypto space, where a single endorsement from a high-profile figure like Buterin can trigger notable short-term price movements.

Price Analysis,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/09/bitcoin-btc-nears-bottom-again-where-will-it-bounce-back-price-analysis,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) latest rally failed to make a higher high and now the price is heading back to the local bottom at around $107,000. Is this a sign that the bears are now fully in control, or is this just bottoming price action playing out? One thing is for sure in the Bitcoin price action, and that is the bulls are just not turning up in order to get behind any kind of definitive trend change. Yes, the $BTC price did manage to escape from the descending channel that had been corralling the price down since 15 August, but the breakout was relatively weak, and now the falling price is not that far from the initial breakout level. $BTC breakout rally rolls over Source: TradingView In the 4-hour chart above it can be seen how the $BTC price stopped short of the higher high at around $113,500 and limply and obligingly rolled over. It now remains to be seen how far down this current corrective wave will take the price. The Fibonacci levels can possibly give some clues as to where this descent will stop. The price is currently battling to hold the 0.382 Fibonacci, but it looks as though this might fail. The most likely levels to stop the rot are lower down, with the 0.618 or the 0.786 being the favourites. If the price falls beyond all of the Fibonacci levels, the top of the descending channel would probably coincide with the $107,000 local bottom and would possibly act as a last ditch support. The thesis now (until proved otherwise) is that the bottom is probably in, although a further dip to $105,000, or even to $100,000 could really help to shake out any weak hands that are left. Back to the thesis, it might be expected that the $BTC price chops sideways from here and that some more price structure is laid down at these levels. The shorter term Stochastic RSI indicators have a fair way to come back down, and as they do so the much more influential weekly Stochastic RSI can continue to find its way to the bottom. 0.618 Fibonacci still perfect support on the daily Source: TradingView In the daily time frame it can be observed that the 50 SMA (blue line) is turning over, and the 100 SMA (green line) could be next. Further down, the 200 SMA is continuing to rise, and could act as support in the eventuality that the price falls to this level. The price has possibly just been rejected for the third time at the 100 SMA, so it is to be wondered if $BTC will come down, at least to the 0.618 Fibonacci level (taken from the entire $98,000 - $124,000 move). Fighting off the tendency to be bearish here, the positives are that the $BTC price has broken out of the descending channel, the 0.618 Fibonacci is holding support beautifully, and the Stochastic RSI indicators on this time frame are still climbing. Important support structures in the weekly time frame Source: TradingView Finally, in the weekly time frame we continue the theme of the Fibonacci extension levels. This time the Fibonacci levels are taken from the very top of the 2021 bull market, to the absolute depth of the ensuing bear market. This provides the levels in the chart above. It can be seen how accurately the price comes back down to the earlier Fibonacci levels once it has passed one and has risen to the next level. In the current price action it can be noted that if the bears do force the price down from here, it could go all the way back down to retest the 1.618 Fibonacci at $102,000. At the same time, the 50-week SMA (blue line) is rising and could also receive a retest once again as it did on a few occasions earlier in this bull market. This next couple of weeks could give a clearer picture of which way this is going to go. That said, if the price does come down to the region of $102,000 and does retest the 50-week SMA, the resulting bounce could take the $BTC price up towards the 2.618 Fibonacci at $155,000.

Imagine a future where current encryption, the very backbone of cryptocurrencies, could be vulnerable. This isn’t science fiction anymore, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is now reviewing a proactive plan to tackle this looming threat head-on. What is This Vital Quantum Computing Security Proposal All About? A comprehensive Post-Quantum Financial Infrastructure Framework (PQFIF) has been officially submitted to the SEC’s dedicated crypto task force. This isn’t just another document; it’s a strategic blueprint. The framework underscores the critical need for new regulations and a structured, systematic approach to protect digital assets from the formidable challenges posed by advanced quantum computing capabilities. It’s about building a future-proof foundation for the entire financial system. The core idea behind the PQFIF is foresight. Rather than waiting for quantum computers to become powerful enough to break existing cryptographic standards, this proposal advocates for immediate action. It suggests a phased transition to quantum-resistant algorithms and a re-evaluation of how digital assets are secured across the board, significantly enhancing quantum computing security . Why is Quantum Computing a Game-Changer for Crypto? For those unfamiliar, quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in computational power. Unlike traditional computers that process information in bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers use “qubits,” which can be both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This allows them to solve certain complex problems exponentially faster. Shor’s Algorithm: This quantum algorithm, if fully realized, could efficiently break widely used public-key cryptography, including RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). These are fundamental to securing blockchain transactions and digital signatures. Grover’s Algorithm: While not breaking encryption outright, Grover’s algorithm could significantly speed up brute-force attacks, making current symmetric encryption methods much less secure. The potential impact on blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies is profound. If the cryptographic foundations of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets were compromised, it could lead to widespread theft, loss of trust, and market instability. Therefore, addressing quantum computing security is not merely an academic exercise, but an existential imperative for the crypto space. How Does the Proposed Framework Enhance Quantum Computing Security? The PQFIF isn’t just about identifying problems; it’s about offering solutions. It champions a multi-pronged strategy to bolster quantum computing security : New Regulations: Establishing clear, enforceable rules for financial institutions and crypto platforms to adopt post-quantum cryptographic standards. This ensures a consistent level of protection across the ecosystem. Structural Approach: A coordinated effort to upgrade infrastructure, from hardware to software, incorporating quantum-resistant algorithms. This involves collaboration between regulators, industry leaders, and academic researchers. Research & Development: Encouraging continued innovation in post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to stay ahead of evolving threats. The goal is to develop and deploy cryptographic primitives that can withstand quantum attacks. By proactively integrating these measures, the framework aims to ensure the long-term integrity and resilience of digital assets. It seeks to instill confidence in investors and users that their holdings will remain secure, even as quantum technology advances. What Are the Challenges in Implementing This Critical Protection? While the proposal is a crucial step forward, implementing such a sweeping change won’t be without its hurdles. The transition to a post-quantum financial infrastructure is complex and will require significant effort. Technical Complexity: Migrating existing systems and developing new ones with quantum-resistant cryptography is a massive undertaking. It demands specialized expertise and careful planning. Cost Implications: The financial investment required for upgrades, research, and workforce training will be substantial for both public and private entities. Standardization: Achieving global consensus on post-quantum cryptographic standards is essential for interoperability and widespread adoption. Without unified standards, fragmentation could weaken overall security. Resistance to Change: Any major shift faces inertia. Educating stakeholders and demonstrating the urgency of the threat will be key to overcoming resistance. Overcoming these challenges will require strong leadership from the SEC, sustained industry collaboration, and a clear roadmap for implementation, especially concerning quantum computing security . What’s Next for Digital Asset Protection? The submission of the PQFIF to the SEC Crypto Task Force marks a pivotal moment. The SEC’s review process will be critical in shaping the future of digital asset security. This proposal could pave the way for a new era of proactive cybersecurity measures, ensuring the continued growth and stability of the crypto market. For crypto projects and investors, this highlights the importance of staying informed and preparing for potential shifts. Understanding the implications of quantum computing security will become increasingly vital. As regulators and industry work together, we can anticipate a more resilient and secure digital financial landscape. A Future-Proofed Crypto Ecosystem with Enhanced Quantum Computing Security The proposal to the SEC is a clear signal that the digital asset space is maturing, addressing not just current but future threats. By embracing advanced quantum computing security measures, we can safeguard the revolutionary potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology for generations to come. This proactive stance ensures that innovation can thrive without being undermined by emerging technological challenges.

PCHAIN được xem là một altcoin đột phá trong lĩnh vực Real World Asset (RWA), đang làm rung chuyển thị trường bất động sản toàn cầu trị giá hàng nghìn tỷ USD. Khi Dogecoin tiếp tục leo thang ổn định và Cardano liên tục vượt qua các ngưỡng kháng cự quan trọng, PropiChain đang nổi lên như một dự án mà các nhà đầu tư săn lùng lợi nhuận khổng lồ không thể bỏ qua. Hãy cùng khám phá lý do vì sao viên ngọc ẩn này được dự đoán sẽ vượt mặt các đối thủ ngay đầu năm 2025. Dogecoin và Cardano: Vị thế hiện tại Dogecoin đã thể hiện khả năng chống chịu ấn tượng và tiếp tục nằm trong nhóm tiền điện tử hàng đầu theo vốn hóa thị trường. Những bước tiến gần đây, bao gồm tích hợp mới và việc được các thương hiệu lớn chấp nhận, đã giúp Dogecoin có vị thế tăng trưởng bền vững. Tuy nhiên, sự phụ thuộc quá nhiều vào yếu tố đầu cơ và tiện ích hạn chế khiến nhiều nhà đầu tư tìm kiếm các altcoin có nền tảng vững chắc hơn. Tương tự, Cardano cũng là một trong những đồng coin nổi bật, với những cải tiến đáng kể về khả năng mở rộng blockchain và tính tương tác. Giá Cardano gần đây đã ghi nhận dòng vốn lớn từ các tổ chức, cho thấy nhu cầu ngày càng tăng đối với hệ sinh thái của nó. Thế nhưng, quỹ đạo tăng trưởng của Cardano vẫn còn khiêm tốn so với tiềm năng bùng nổ của PropiChain – một dự án được thiết kế để mang lại giải pháp thực tế và lợi nhuận vượt trội. Điều gì khiến Bitcoin Hyper trở nên nổi bật? Bitcoin Hyper là một altcoin được xây dựng để mang lại trải nghiệm đột phá trong thế giới tiền điện tử. Dự án kết hợp công nghệ blockchain, AI và Web3 để mở rộng tiềm năng của thị trường tài sản kỹ thuật số, đồng thời tạo ra nhiều cơ hội sinh lời thực tế cho nhà đầu tư. Không giống như các dự án chỉ dựa vào đầu cơ, Bitcoin Hyper giải quyết những thách thức thực tế, khiến nó trở thành lựa chọn hấp dẫn cho những ai tìm kiếm giá trị dài hạn. Vấn đề mà Bitcoin Hyper giải quyết Thị trường tiền điện tử truyền thống thường gặp phải các rào cản: mức vốn đầu vào cao, thiếu minh bạch và khó tiếp cận toàn cầu. Bitcoin Hyper loại bỏ những trở ngại này thông qua: Sở hữu dạng token: Nhà đầu tư có thể tham gia với số vốn nhỏ, thay vì cần khoản tiền lớn ban đầu. Phân tích bằng AI: Công cụ AI nâng cao giúp đánh giá giá trị tài sản, phân tích xu hướng thị trường và hỗ trợ ra quyết định đầu tư. Minh bạch trên blockchain: Đảm bảo giao dịch an toàn, không thể thay đổi, loại bỏ nhu cầu qua trung gian. Các tính năng khiến Bitcoin Hyper khác biệt Token hóa giá trị: Bitcoin Hyper biến các cơ hội đầu tư thành token blockchain, giúp mọi người dễ dàng tham gia thị trường tiềm năng toàn cầu. Ví dụ, với khoản đầu tư nhỏ, bạn có thể sở hữu một phần trong dự án công nghệ đang tăng trưởng và hưởng lợi từ lợi nhuận dài hạn. Công cụ AI thông minh: Tích hợp AI hỗ trợ phân tích thị trường, xác định cơ hội chưa được định giá đúng và đưa ra quyết định nhanh chóng, chính xác hơn. Ứng dụng blockchain: Bitcoin Hyper sử dụng smart contract để tự động hóa quy trình, bảo đảm giao dịch minh bạch và giảm thiểu rủi ro từ bên thứ ba. Kết nối Web3 & Metaverse: Bitcoin Hyper mở rộng trải nghiệm người dùng bằng cách kết nối toàn cầu, đồng thời cho phép tham gia vào không gian ảo để tương tác và khám phá dự án một cách trực quan. Tại sao bây giờ là thời điểm tốt nhất để đầu tư vào Bitcoin Hyper Giá presale của Bitcoin Hyper hiện đang ở mức 0,004 USD, trở thành điểm vào cực kỳ hấp dẫn cho nhà đầu tư. Khi presale bước sang giai đoạn 2, giá sẽ tăng lên 0,011 USD và tiếp tục leo thang ở các giai đoạn tiếp theo. Nhà đầu tư hành động ngay lúc này sẽ nhận được lợi thế early-bird, bao gồm mức giá ưu đãi và cơ hội đi trước thị trường. Việc Bitcoin Hyper được niêm yết trên CoinMarketCap và sở hữu chứng chỉ bảo mật từ BlockAudit càng củng cố uy tín của dự án. Trong khi Dogecoin chủ yếu dựa vào làn sóng đầu cơ và Cardano tập trung vào đổi mới blockchain, Bitcoin Hyper mang đến sự kết hợp độc đáo giữa ứng dụng thực tế và tiềm năng tăng trưởng khổng lồ. Nếu đạt ROI dự đoán 55.000% vào năm 2025, khoản đầu tư 500 USD vào Bitcoin Hyper hôm nay có thể mang lại 275.000 USD. Quỹ đạo này phản chiếu lại những câu chuyện thành công trong quá khứ, chẳng hạn như cú bùng nổ của Dogecoin vào năm 2021, khi chỉ một khoản đầu tư nhỏ đã biến thành số tiền thay đổi cuộc sống. Kết luận Thị trường tiền điện tử luôn biến động mạnh, và nhà đầu tư đang tìm kiếm những dự án vừa có ứng dụng thực tế, vừa có tiềm năng tăng trưởng dài hạn. Trong khi Dogecoin và Cardano vẫn là những lựa chọn an toàn, cách tiếp cận mang tính đột phá của Bitcoin Hyper với AI, blockchain và Web3 đã giúp nó trở thành altcoin đáng chú ý nhất hiện nay. Đừng bỏ lỡ cơ hội sở hữu Bitcoin Hyper ở mức 0,004 USD. Với đợt tăng giá parabol dự đoán vào đầu năm 2025, bạn có thể đầu tư vào một dự án game-changing trước khi nó thu hút sự chú ý rộng rãi.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|ADA|DOGE|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-04 09:17:21

The crypto world is abuzz after Ripple’s slow moves and Bitcoin jitters put the spotlight on new PayFi alternatives. Remittix surfaces in many talks for its clear use case and product momentum. Just days ago, news broke of Remittix’s Q3 beta wallet launch, backed by confirmed centralized exchange listings. That news aligns with heightened investor interest in real-world crypto with low gas fee design. All eyes now watch this DeFi project burning bright on crypto radar. Ripple Price Watch: Can XRP Hold Its Ground? XRP trades near $2.83. A break above $3.50 could revive bullish momentum, but an extended break below $2.80 would raise red flags. Whale activity remains steady. Analysts on X (formerly Twitter) see name recall and regulatory optimism as cushions against volatility in the short term. Others see that the TD Sequential has flashed back-to-back buy signals on XRP. With this in motion, a rebound setup is in play . Remittix: Could This Be The Next XRP A wave of crypto talk now centers on a fresh altcoin called Remittix , which is being called the next XRP. Critically, it offers real PayFi tools: cross-chain transfers, low fees, wallet support for 40+ cryptos and fiat payouts into 30+ countries. Listings are locked in on BitMart and LBank. A $250,000 community giveaway is underway. This isn’t hype, it’s infrastructure meeting adoption. Remittix’s features point to a token built for real use, not hype. Its product approach takes aim at real pain points in global payments. That makes it feel like an evolution of XRP’s remittance mission but with modern DeFi rails and low gas fees. Why Investors Are Talking About Remittix Solving a real-world $19 trillion payments problem Utility-first token powering real transaction volume Security first: audited by CertiK for contract safety Momentum is building ahead of wallet launch Built for borderless payments with global reach Why Buying Remittix Now Could Matter Remittix isn’t just another hype token. It has a living product, firm listing plans, a vibrant community engagement push, and financial backing. The Q3 wallet launch and exchange availability make it more than a concept, it’s an active movement. If you want a crypto with utility, low gas fees, PayFi design and early-stage access before broader attention arrives, the next XRP deserves your watch. With wallet tools coming, listing liquidity on tap and a $250,000 giveaway running, Remittix might just be the next big altcoin to watch and it’s more than theory.

The firm outlined three key focus areas aimed at helping liquidity providers support the broader adoption of tokenized securities. Wintermute explained that its recommendations are intended to offer practical policy guidance for tokenized securities traders and dealers, promoting innovation, safeguarding investors, and advancing blockchain-based development in the U.S Wintermute urges the SEC not to classify key network tokens as securities Wintermute’s submission to the SEC requests regulatory clarity for crypto brokers and dealers, covering account-based trading of tokenized securities, wallet and key management for self-custody, and on-chain settlement options with stablecoins and other assets. The company has also called for DeFi inclusion of tokenized securities, from trading and liquidity pooling to direct lending, and asked that these activities should not be subject to broker-dealer rules or U.S. regulatory reach. Additionally, the company encouraged the SEC to formally state that core network tokens: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and similar assets, should not be classified as securities, since they are central to decentralized systems, despite how they were originally issued. The firm also argued in its response that clearer rules would allow tokenization efforts to grow across multiple asset classes, including equities and ETFs. The RWA tokenization market is close to surpassing $28 billion Real-world asset tokenization received a major lift in the U.S. during the crypto-supportive Trump era. Globally, the sector’s market value is approaching $28 billion, and stablecoin adoption has topped 191 million holders. Dinari even recently earned a broker-dealer license, a first for a tokenized stock trading firm, allowing it to offer tokenized securities. On the other hand, competitors like Kraken and Coinbase are still awaiting approval for their tokenized equities. Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, even claimed their tokenization project is a “huge priority.” As recently reported by Cryptopolitan , Galaxy Digital also broke new ground, enabling tokenization of its SEC-registered GLXY shares on the Solana network. It worked with Superstate to launch a tokenized version of its Class A common stock (GLXY) on Solana. Now, through Opening Bell, Galaxy has become the first publicly listed U.S. company to issue its equity directly on-chain. It is entering the $64.7 billion real-world asset tokenization market. “We’re proud to be working with Superstate to help lay the groundwork for an onchain capital market that bridges traditional equities with next-generation infrastructure,” chief executive Novogratz said in a statement . “Our goal is a tokenized equity that brings the best of crypto – transparency, programmability, and composability, into the traditional world.” Galaxy Digital began considering tokenizing its shares in mid-August, revealing that it had partnered with Superstate to oversee the process. In April, Superstate submitted a letter to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, proposing a framework to bring Wall Street stocks on-chain. DeFi lending protocols are growing due to tokenized assets So far, lending protocols in DeFi have more than doubled their TVL since January, rising from $53B to $127B, according to Binance Research. Analysts have credited the boom to growing institutional use of stablecoins and tokenized RWAs. Binance Research even noted that as stablecoin and tokenized asset adoption accelerates, DeFi lending protocols are increasingly positioned to facilitate institutional participation. The rally was largely fueled by Maple Finance and Euler, up 586% and 1,466% respectively. Additionally, Binance Research noted that DeFi institutional adoption is driven by new offerings like Aave Labs’ Horizon, where tokenized RWAs can be pledged as collateral for stablecoin borrowing. Products like Horizon also seek to open up new liquidity streams and make RWAs productive within the DeFi space. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Traders say it will outpace SHIB with 1500% upside,https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/04/best-cheap-crypto-under-0-05-traders-say-it-will-outpace-shib-with-1500-upside/,"In every market cycle, cheap cryptos under $0.05 have drawn the attention of traders looking for life-changing gains. It only takes one strong performer to turn a modest investment into something remarkable. That is how tokens like SHIB once exploded into the mainstream, despite being built on little more than hype and community momentum. For traders watching what is going on with crypto today, the question is which new project will take that spotlight. The answer for September appears clear: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being positioned as the best cheap crypto to buy right now, with analysts projecting as much as 1500% upside once it launches. The appeal is simple. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still priced at just $0.035 during its Phase 6 presale, giving traders one of the last sub-$0.05 entry points. Unlike many low-cost tokens of the past, it is not relying on hype alone—it is building a decentralized lending ecosystem with utility that will sustain its long-term growth. This blend of affordability and real function is what makes traders confident that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will not just replicate SHIB’s explosive rise but surpass it with utility-driven returns. Presale strength and growing urgency Presales often determine which projects will capture retail momentum, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is showing powerful traction. More than $15.3 million has already been raised, with Phase 6 standing at 32% completion and over 16,000 holders on board. The CertiK audit has been finalized, giving the project a Token Scan score of 95 and adding a layer of reassurance for those entering early. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also reinforcing trust through major community-focused incentives. A $100,000 giveaway is being prepared to reward engagement and grow awareness, while a $50,000 bug bounty program will be implemented to strengthen security. These efforts will show that the project is not only focused on short-term presale excitement but is committed to transparency and reliability as it builds momentum toward launch. Utility beyond hype: why traders expect 1500% What separates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from earlier “cheap coin” explosions is that it will deliver real-world utility from day one. The platform is being designed with structured borrowing and lending mechanics that will give users tools for both yield and liquidity. Its stable rate borrowing will allow predictable loan costs, while liquidation triggers will protect the ecosystem against dangerous volatility. Enhanced collateral efficiency will allow borrowers to extract greater value from their assets, and strict deposit and borrowing caps will ensure liquidity remains protected across the platform. The roadmap is also being executed with speed and focus. Once the token goes live, a beta version of the platform will launch, allowing users to begin interacting with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) immediately. This milestone is critical, as many projects raise capital only to delay delivery for months or years. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will instead put its ecosystem into the hands of users right from the start, which will strengthen both adoption and long-term growth. This is why traders are forecasting a 1500% upside in the coming years. SHIB’s meteoric rise was driven by hype alone, and DOGE delivered gains simply on community culture. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will provide the same kind of affordability that fueled those earlier rallies but will pair it with a DeFi ecosystem that creates sustainable revenue and ongoing demand. That is why this projection is not only bold—it is expected to play out as the platform matures. Conclusion For those focused on crypto investing, the comparison becomes clear. Ethereum and Bitcoin will remain the backbone of the market, and a crypto ETF will bring them further institutional exposure. But retail traders looking for affordable entries that hold life-changing upside will not find those opportunities in established giants. That is why the spotlight is shifting now to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The price under $0.05 will not last much longer, and history has shown that those who secure positions in promising projects at this stage are the ones who enjoy exponential rewards later. Traders searching for the best cheap crypto to buy right now are already choosing Mutuum Finance (MUTM), and by the time the market catches up, today’s entry point will look like the deal of the year.

Some of them include Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Cardano (ADA). Mutuum Finance has entered the sixth presale phase and investors can purchase MUTM tokens at a price of $0.035. The initial investors who have already obtained their tokens will gain the minimum of 200% when the project MUTM will officially start trading. So far, Mutuum Finance has managed to attract more than $15.31 million and more than 16,000 investors. As Cardano (ADA) keep building their ecosystems, Mutuum Finance is generating buzz regarding the next generation of million-dollar opportunities in the blockchain market. Cardano Price projections: Gearing up towards a possible Q4 recovery ADA is already at approximately $0.83, and it is firmly supported at the $0.82 point, during a flat phase. Analysts note the potential breakout should ADA be able to break through between $0.88 and $0.90 and then set the stage to move to $1.00 to $1.20 by year-end. However, longer-term projections differ, with some projects thinking that the ADA may hit as high as $1.20-1.50 or even as high as $2-2.40 by the end of 2025 should the bullish trend persist. Other projections, however, are more conservative, pointing to mid-term projections of between $1.00 and $1.50. Simultaneously, the increased interest of investors is also extending to new DeFi platforms like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Phase 6 Active Mutuum Finance is in its 6th phase of presale, and tokens are currently at $0.35, 16.17 percent higher than the last phase. Having more than 16000 invested stakeholders and almost having raised close to $15.31 million towards the project already, there is evident interest and demand in the market. CertiK Certified The project is transparent and safe. To take the platform’s security further, Mutuum Finance, in collaboration with CertiK, has introduced a USDT Bug Bounty Program worth $50,000 USDT. Reported vulnerabilities are grouped under this program and are characterized as critical, important, minor and occasional. Risk Management & Protocol Security Mutuum Finance has parameters in relation to each asset it supports, which are typically relevant to its risk profile, including supply limits, borrowing limits, and collateral limits. Consequently, the protocol will be resistant to market volatility by overcollateralizing positions, and liquidators will have an incentive to stabilize undercollateralized positions. Deposit and borrowing limits also limit the exposure to risky or non-liquid assets and reduce the risk of insolvency. The collateral utilization limit of high-risk tokens may be very low, whereas correlated assets will be more collateral efficient. Reward $100,000 to Community Building participation Mutuum Finance has declared a $100,000 giveaway as a part of its strategy to create and promote an active user base. Each of ten MUTM holders will be given $10,000 of MUTM tokens to enable newcomers as well as established investors to become a part of, and participate in the development of the project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as one of the best candidates to generate life-altering returns in 2025, competing with developed altcoins such as Cardano (ADA). Having raised more than $15.31 million, 16,000+ investors on board, and Stage 6 tokens valued at $0.035, initial participants will enjoy a minimum 200% gains on launch, and the gains could be even higher as more people sign up. Sign up to the presale before the next stage increase and get the lower entry price.

51174698,https://invezz.com/?p=2860756,1756978200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Major crypto news: popular memecoin gets first ever Nasdaq listing,https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/04/major-crypto-news-popular-memecoin-gets-first-ever-nasdaq-listing/,"In a move that may reshape how traditional finance interacts with meme culture, Bonk ($BONK) has become the first memecoin to secure a Nasdaq listing through its partnership with beverage company Safety Shot (Nasdaq: SHOT). The deal not only highlights the growing mainstream appeal of meme tokens but also sets a precedent for how digital assets can integrate directly with corporate balance sheets. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu once defined the meme coin narrative, Bonk’s Nasdaq debut marks a new chapter in legitimacy. Investors are watching closely to see if this experiment sparks a wave of corporate-crypto crossovers. At the same time, retail-driven projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are drawing attention as the next generation of cultural tokens poised for breakout runs. Bonk’s landmark deal with Safety Shot On August 12, Safety Shot announced it had acquired a 10% revenue-sharing stake in Bonk’s launchpad platform, BONK.fun. The $25 million purchase of BONK tokens was exchanged for $35 million in newly issued convertible preferred shares. As part of the agreement, Safety Shot will rebrand its ticker symbol from $SHOT to $BNKK, signaling full alignment with Bonk’s branding. The move goes beyond optics. For the first time, a U.S.-listed company is directly tying its revenue streams to a memecoin ecosystem. Bonk’s inclusion in Nasdaq isn’t just symbolic—it creates a precedent for revenue-sharing structures that could ripple across both Wall Street and the crypto world. Political ties and market innovation The funding behind the transaction is being facilitated by Dominari, a holding company with ties to the Trump family. This connection has added both political intrigue and investor scrutiny to the deal. By making Bonk part of Safety Shot’s revenue model, the company has placed itself at the intersection of politics, Wall Street, and meme culture, a combination that could either supercharge adoption or attract heightened regulatory oversight. The 10% stake in letsBONK.fun, Bonk’s Solana-based launchpad, ensures token holders are tied directly to corporate performance. If successful, analysts believe this model could be replicated by other projects seeking credibility in regulated markets. While Bonk’s leap into Nasdaq is historic, the spotlight is also turning to emerging tokens that aim to capture retail momentum before institutional eyes arrive. Analysts ranking the best presales in 2025 consistently highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE as the standout pick. Forecasts project up to 43x ROI, making it one of the year’s most ambitious plays. Its presale has already attracted thousands of investors, and allocations are disappearing quickly as demand accelerates. Unlike BONK, which now battles volatility under Wall Street’s gaze, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its growth phase. Early entrants who use the PATRIOT50X code unlock a 50% EXTRA presale bonus, a limited-time incentive designed to reward conviction before broader discovery drives scarcity. For investors, the contrast is clear: Bonk shows how meme coins can gain legitimacy, while MAGACOIN FINANCE demonstrates how they can ignite exponential growth before the spotlight hits. Governance and strategic influence The deal also reshapes Safety Shot’s leadership. Bonk’s founding team, including Mitchell Rudy, known to the community as “Nom”, will join the board of directors, securing 50% board representation. This effectively hands a memecoin community direct influence over the governance of a Nasdaq-traded company. Market reaction has been volatile. Safety Shot’s stock initially dropped by 50%, only to rebound intraday by 37% as traders weighed the risks and potential of this unconventional partnership. Analysts note that this kind of volatility mirrors the very essence of memecoin culture: unpredictable, dramatic, and deeply tied to sentiment. A milestone for memecoins Bonk’s Nasdaq listing isn’t just another partnership, it represents a cultural shift in how meme coins are perceived. By securing revenue-sharing rights with a publicly traded company, Bonk has opened the door for more hybrid models that merge crypto communities with corporate finance. Analysts are cautious but intrigued: if this experiment succeeds, it could legitimize meme coins in ways previously unthinkable. Conclusion The Bonk-Safety Shot deal is a turning point for meme coins, blending Wall Street structure with crypto culture in a way no project has before. Yet while BONK is testing new waters on Nasdaq, retail investors are increasingly focusing on the next breakout candidate. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its projected 43x ROI and presale surge backed by the PATRIOT50X bonus code, is being called one of the best crypto presales to buy in 2025. Together, these two stories illustrate the future of meme coins: one chasing legitimacy on Wall Street, the other igniting grassroots energy with retail.\ To learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, visit: Website: https://magacoinfinance.com Access: https://magacoinfinance.com/access Twitter/X: https://x.com/magacoinfinance Telegram: https://t.me/magacoinfinance The post Major crypto news: popular memecoin gets first ever Nasdaq listing appeared first on Invezz",Crypto|Sponsored,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|BONK|ZRX|MARKET,"{'name': 'Invezz', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",invezz,2025-09-04 09:30:00

It was the first coin accepted by crypto casinos, the default for anonymous betting, and the brand most people still associate with digital money. But in 2025, gambling platforms have moved far beyond BTC. Today, players demand speed, low fees, and flexibility. That’s why other cryptocurrencies—stablecoins and altcoins—are becoming more popular across gambling platforms. And if you want to use them all in one place, Dexsport.io is the venue that delivers. Ethereum (ETH) – The All-Purpose Option Ethereum remains one of the most widely accepted tokens in gambling. It powers countless Web3 casinos and sportsbooks, with seamless integration into wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet. ETH deposits and withdrawals are straightforward, but gas fees can still spike during heavy network activity. ETH is the backbone of DeFi and NFTs, making it easy for players to move funds between casinos, wallets, and staking protocols without leaving the Ethereum ecosystem. Tether (USDT) and DAI – Stability for Serious Bettors Volatility is the biggest drawback of most cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins like USDT and DAI solve this by pegging their value to the US dollar. For bettors, this stability matters: a winning bet shouldn’t be undermined by a sudden 10% market swing. USDT is supported almost everywhere, while DAI stands out as a decentralized stablecoin running on Ethereum and other chains. Stablecoins give players predictable bankroll management and instant cross-platform transfers, with DAI especially appealing to DeFi-first gamblers. TRON (TRX) – The Speed Play TRON has become a favorite in online gambling thanks to its fast transactions and near-zero fees. USDT on TRON (TRC-20) is often the cheapest way to move stablecoins into a sportsbook. Platforms and players love TRON for its efficiency. TRX and TRC-20 USDT provide a cost-effective way to gamble without losing money to transaction costs. WAVAX (Wrapped AVAX) WAVAX brings the speed of the Avalanche blockchain into crypto gambling. It isn’t as widely accepted as ETH or USDT, but it’s gaining traction on newer multi-chain casinos. Near-instant confirmations and low fees make it a solid alternative for players already active in Avalanche’s DeFi ecosystem. Dash and Legacy Altcoins – Still in the Game Older altcoins like Dash continue to have a role in gambling. Dash was built for payments, so it fits naturally into fast, low-fee betting systems. While not as flashy as newer chains, it remains supported at privacy-focused platforms. A proven track record, speed, and a loyal user base keep Dash relevant in crypto gambling. Dexsport: The Platform That Brings It All Together While many platforms simply “accept” crypto, Dexsport is crypto-native. It offers: No KYC, instant access with just a wallet, email, or Telegram 10,000+ casino games plus crash, roulette, and live tables Sportsbook coverage across football, MMA, basketball, LoL, Valorant, CS2, and more Live streaming without deposits Transparency through a live bet desk where anyone can verify activity and results Audited security by CertiK and Pessimistic Bet Smart. Stay Anonymous. Try Real Web3 Betting with Dexsport It also continuously expands its Bitcoin casino, recently adding 5,000 new titles from NetEnt, Pragmatic Play, Evolution, and Play’n GO. With support for 38+ cryptocurrencies across 20 blockchains, Dexsport offers true flexibility—whether you’re betting in BTC, DAI, TRX, WAVAX, BNB, or Dash. Weekly cashback, boosted odds, and freebets add value, but what really sets Dexsport apart is its commitment to speed, privacy, and control. Final Word The days of Bitcoin-only casinos are over. Players want more—and coins like DAI, TRX, WAVAX, BNB, and Dash are stepping up. But instead of juggling multiple platforms, you can find them all in one place: Dexsport. For anyone who wants to gamble with crypto in 2025, Dexsport is where Web3 betting actually lives.

Alt5 Sigma Corporation's $1.5 billion commitment to purchase 7.5 billion tokens at 20 cents each ensures substantial payments to the Trump family, even as public market trading showed modest results compared to initial hype. World Liberty Financial (WLFI) Source: TradingView WLFI has drifted between $0.21 and $0.40 this week, slipping just 0.30% over 7 days. That tiny move hides a stronger pulse over longer spans: the token is still up 14.17% over both the past month and the past half-year, showing buyers have stepped in on dips. The short-term picture looks cautious. The 10-day average at $0.24 now sits under the 100-day mark of $0.28, hinting at soft momentum. An RSI near 39 and a Stochastic reading near 18 point to oversold ground, while the MACD south of zero confirms bears pressing. If sellers hold control, price could revisit the nearest support at $0.1161, a slide of roughly 45% from the upper edge of the current band. Yet that oversold setup can flip fast. A push above $0.40 would aim at the first resistance at $0.49; clearing it opens room to the second ceiling at $0.6825, about 70% beyond today’s peak. The month-long gain and continued higher lows suggest the path of least resistance is still up, but the board shows traders need volume to crack 0.49 and turn WLFI’s cautious climb into a breakout. $XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game. With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project. What sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth. Fueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price: $0.0001 Price Now: $0.005 Next Stage: $0.01 Final Presale Price: $0.02 Following the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries. So far, over $15 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch. Demand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions!

According to Bitcoin financial services firm River, small and midsize businesses across the United States are increasingly reinvesting their profits into the digital asset, creating what analysts describe as a quiet but powerful wave of grassroots adoption. River reported that its business clients are reinvesting an average of 22% of profits into Bitcoin. While real estate firms lead the charge, allocating nearly 15%, other sectors such as hospitality, finance, and software are contributing between 8% and 10%. Even fitness studios, roofing companies, and painting businesses have joined the trend. Small Players, Big Impact Sam Baker, a research analyst at River, said these businesses collectively acquired 84,000 Bitcoin in 2025 alone . This is equivalent to about one quarter of the total holdings currently owned by institutional fund managers and corporate treasuries. “While Bitcoin treasury companies have captured most of the media spotlight, what is often overlooked is adoption by conventional businesses that use Bitcoin to complement their existing business models,” Baker explained in his report. He pointed to improved accounting standards, clearer regulations, and growing institutional acceptance, combined with BTC bull market, as the key drivers of this shift. River’s findings also highlight a significant difference from the 2020–2021 bull cycle, when BTC run to $69,000 was largely fueled by retail investors. This time, Baker said, both businesses and institutions are providing sustained demand, with some Bitcoin ETFs buying ten times more coins than miners are able to produce . Why Small Firms Lead the Charge Interestingly, about 75% of River’s business clients have 50 employees or fewer. Baker argued that smaller firms often find it easier to adopt Bitcoin because they face fewer internal hurdles and less bureaucratic oversight. Larger corporations, particularly those in the S&P 500, tend to avoid Bitcoin due to concerns about norms, shareholder scrutiny, and potential controversy. Still, most firms are approaching cautiously. River’s data shows more than 40% of businesses allocate just 1% to 10% of profits into BTC, while only 10% commit over half of their income. Purchases can be modest: last week, Rhode Island-based Western Main Self Storage bought just 0.088 BTC, worth $9,830, adding to its modest 0.43 BTC stack. Despite the rising trend, Baker noted that the majority of businesses are not yet considering Bitcoin at all, citing “widespread misunderstandings and limited awareness.” The post Small Businesses Quietly Fuel Bitcoin Adoption, Says River appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin News|Bitcoin treasury,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'The Coin Rise', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecoinrise,2025-09-04 09:39:10

Our dYdX price prediction for 2025 expects a maximum price of $3.55. In 2030, we expect the dYdX price to touch $29.58. The dYdX exchange captured significant attention last year. The platform aimed to migrate its existing dYdX tokens from Ethereum to this new mainnet. However, in the fall of 2024, the platform disclosed that it was reducing its workforce by 35%. As dYdX’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does dYdX have the potential to hit the $10 mark soon?” or “Will dYdX ever go up?” or “Where will dYdX be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our dYdX price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency dYdX Token dYdX Price $0.58 (-0.9%) Market Cap $413.34 Million Trading Volume $11.92 Million Circulating Supply 787.63 Million dYdX All-time High $4.53 (Mar 08, 2024) All-time Low $0.4954 (Apr 09, 2025) 24-hour high $0.6 24-hour low $0.58 dYdX price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.584 Price Prediction $ 0.445315 (-25.25%) Fear & Greed Index 55 (Greed) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 6.12% Green Days 14/30 (47%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.631628 200-Day SMA $ 0.61916 14-Day RSI 45.1 dYdX price analysis: dYdX faced a bearish pressure toward $0.58 TL;DR Breakdown: dYdX price analysis shows that dYdX faced a selling pressure around $0.58 Resistance for dYdX is at $0.6036 Support for dYdX/USD is at $0.5698 The dYdX price analysis for 4 September confirms that dYdX faced a drop as it attempted a move below $0.65. Currently, buyers are accumulating heavily, resulting in a consolidation. dYdX price analysis 1-day chart: dYdX price declines toward $0.58 An analysis of the daily dYdX price chart shows the token faced selling pressure after the price attempted to maintain momentum above $0.6. However, bears are now aiming for a consolidation below $0.58. The 24-hour volume surged to $3.11 million, showing a surge in interest in trading today. dYdX is trading at $0.584, declining by over 0.3% in the last 24 hours. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level but trades around 43, hinting that buyers are dominating. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. dYdX/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for an immediate correction The 4-hour dYdX price chart suggests that bears strengthen their position as they aim for a hold of the price below the EMA trend lines. Currently, sellers are holding the price below the EMA20 trend line. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a bearish region at 0.33, showing that short-term sellers are taking a chance to accelerate a downward trend. However, the MACD trend line has formed green candles above the signal line, and the indicator aims for a positive momentum, strengthening long-position holders’ confidence. dYdX technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.60699 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.613157 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.632001 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.648051 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.631628 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.585435 BUY SMA 200 $ 0.61916 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.605852 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.611869 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.623413 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.631191 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.621879 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.622395 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.712527 SELL What to expect from dYdX price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms that dYdX is attempting a dip below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing an upside recovery rally in the coming hours. If dYdX’s price holds momentum above $0.6036, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.6496. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the dYdX price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.5698, beginning a bearish trend to $0.5173. Is dYdX a good investment? The rising institutional demand for dYdX makes it a good investment option. However, dYdX has a short investment history filled with very volatile phases. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX down today? The overall dydx market sentiment is bearish as buyers lost confidence in pushing the price above Fib levels. As a result, sellers are now approaching the $0.58 level to initiate a stronger bearish rally. Will dYdX Recover? If buyers hold above $0.65 level strongly, we might see a strong recovery in the coming hours. What is the dYdX price prediction for 2025? In 2025, dYdX is predicted to reach a minimum level of $3.86. Traders and investors can expect a maximum level of $4.55 and an average price of $3.96 if the bulls show up. Will dYdX reach $10? Depending on market sentiment, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is dYdX a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate dYdX and it faces a rise in global recognition, dYdX has a solid long-term future. It is advised to seek independent professional consultation and investment advice from experts before investing in the crypto market, which has high price volatility. Recent news/opinion on dYdX dYdX has updated its 2025 roadmap, outlining plans to launch a Telegram trading integration as the platform faces declining earnings. According to the roadmap, dYdX plans to roll out a series of software upgrades that include a partner fee share, scale and TWAP orders and designated proposers, targeting the reduction of end-to-end trading latency. dYdX price prediction September 2025 August was a bearish month for dYdX as the altcoin surged toward $0.76 but failed to maintain its buying momentum. As a result, dYdX dropped below $0.6. dYdX’s price might attempt to surge toward $0.75 from its recent low and be pushed further, at least $0.9, if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection by the bearish side, leading to a consolidation around $0.45. dYdX price prediction Minimum price Average price Maximum price dYdX price prediction September 2025 $0.45 $0.75 $0.9 dYdX price prediction 2025 The price of 1 dYdX is expected to reach a minimum level of $0.4 by the end of 2025.

Traders can expect an average price of $6.11 throughout 2026. If the market stays positive, we expect the dYdX price to trade well above $5 by 2027. However, the future market potential for dYdX entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment in long-term holding. dYdX historical price sentiment dydx price history: CoinStats dYdX price started trading in December 2023, hovering below $3.5. In January 2024, the price of dYdX faced a decline as it recorded a low of $2.4. However, in March, the dYdX surged exponentially and touched a high near $4.3. After that, dYdX initiated its bearish rally and hovered around $1 till November. However, dYdX soon recovered following Trump’s victory in the elections, skyrocketing toward $2.6 in December of 2024. Since then, dYdX has been declining and is consolidating below the $1 mark. By the end of April, dYdX price surged toward $0.68. In May, dYdX price surged toward $0.76 but it later declined toward $0.5 in early June. By the end of June, dYdX had declined toward $0.41. In July, the token surged toward $0.7 but failed to maintain buying demand and dropped below $0.6. In August, dYdX again surged toward $0.76 but declined later toward $0.6.",Crypto Price Predictions|dYDX,EN,0,0,TRADING|DYDX|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BUSINESS|WLD|ALTCOIN|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-04 09:40:00

At this point, US Bancorp, which had to stop BTC services during the former SEC administration, which put pressure and sanctions on the cryptocurrency industry, announced that it would restart its crypto services. US Bancorp, one of the five largest commercial banks in the United States, announced that it has relaunched Bitcoin custody services for institutional asset managers, according to Reuters. US Bancorp's move was influenced by Trump's removal of SAB 121, which prevented financial institutions from offering these services, which was passed during the Biden era. The bank had previously planned to offer custody services in 2022 through a partnership with Bitcoin financial services firm NYDIG. However, it halted this initiative after the previous SEC administration announced stricter regulations for crypto custody services. As of 2022, US Bancorp will operate Bitcoin custody through a partnership with crypto firm NYDIG as a sub-custodian. NYDIG will handle physical custody of the underlying asset. “With increased regulatory clarity, we have added Bitcoin ETFs to our product portfolio, allowing us to offer full-service solutions to managers seeking custody and management services,” said Stephen Philipson, head of commercial and corporate banking at US Bank. US Bank recently stated that they are considering adding other cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin to their custody services if they meet the bank's internal standards. *This is not investment advice.

While digital assets often carve their own path, they are not immune to the gravitational pull of traditional finance. Right now, all eyes are on the US Dollar Outlook , a critical barometer for global financial health, as markets brace for pivotal labor market data and the potential for Fed rate cuts . These movements in the forex market trends directly influence investor sentiment, liquidity, and ultimately, the valuations across all asset classes, including Bitcoin and altcoins. For crypto enthusiasts, deciphering these signals from the Federal Reserve and the broader economic landscape is no longer optional; it’s a strategic necessity to navigate the volatility and seize emerging opportunities. Decoding the US Dollar Outlook: What’s Keeping the Greenback Steady? The US Dollar has recently shown a remarkable resilience, often defying expectations of a significant downturn. This steadiness is not accidental; it reflects a complex interplay of factors that position the dollar as a safe haven and a benchmark for global trade. Despite ongoing discussions about future monetary policy, the greenback continues to hold its ground, influencing every corner of the financial world, from commodity prices to cryptocurrency valuations. Several elements contribute to this robust US Dollar Outlook . Firstly, the relative strength of the American economy compared to its global peers often attracts capital, bolstering demand for the dollar. While other major economies grapple with slower growth or higher inflation, the US has frequently demonstrated a more dynamic recovery. Secondly, geopolitical uncertainties worldwide consistently drive investors towards the perceived safety of US Treasury bonds and, by extension, the dollar. When global tensions rise, the dollar typically benefits from flight-to-safety flows. Finally, the lingering expectation of higher-for-longer global interest rates in the US, even if future Fed rate cuts are anticipated, provides a yield advantage over many other developed market currencies. This yield differential makes dollar-denominated assets more attractive to international investors, maintaining a steady demand for the currency. For those in the crypto space, a steady or strengthening dollar can present both challenges and opportunities. A stronger dollar can sometimes act as a headwind for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, as investors might prefer the stability of traditional assets. Conversely, if the dollar’s steadiness is a precursor to a more dovish Fed, it could signal a more favorable environment for crypto later on. Understanding this foundational strength is key to interpreting broader forex market trends . Anticipating Fed Rate Cuts: A Game Changer for Global Interest Rates? The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions are arguably the most impactful drivers in global finance. The prospect of Fed rate cuts has become a central theme in market discussions, with investors eagerly awaiting signals from policymakers. After an aggressive hiking cycle aimed at taming inflation, the Fed now faces the delicate task of balancing price stability with economic growth. The timing and magnitude of these potential cuts will ripple through every asset class, fundamentally reshaping the landscape of global interest rates . Why are these potential cuts so significant? When the Fed lowers its benchmark interest rate, it typically reduces borrowing costs across the economy. This can stimulate spending, investment, and hiring, potentially boosting economic activity. For the crypto market, lower interest rates can make traditional fixed-income investments less attractive, prompting investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets, including digital currencies. This shift in capital allocation can provide significant tailwinds for crypto valuations. However, the path to rate cuts is not without complexity. The Fed’s decisions are data-dependent, meaning they will closely scrutinize inflation figures, employment reports, and other economic indicators before acting. Premature cuts could reignite inflation, while delaying too long could push the economy into a recession. The market’s anticipation of these moves creates considerable volatility in the forex market trends , as traders adjust their positions based on the latest rhetoric and economic releases. Scenario Likely Fed Action Impact on US Dollar Potential Crypto Reaction Strong Economy, Persistent Inflation Delay Rate Cuts, Potentially Hike Stronger (Yield Advantage) Negative (Reduced Liquidity, Risk-Off) Soft Landing, Inflation Cooling Gradual Rate Cuts Moderate Weakening Positive (Increased Liquidity, Risk-On) Economic Downturn, Deflation Risk Aggressive Rate Cuts Significant Weakening Mixed (Initial Fear, Then Liquidity-Driven Boost) This table illustrates the diverse outcomes that could stem from different economic paths and the Fed’s response, directly influencing the US Dollar Outlook and broader market dynamics. The Crucial Labor Market Impact: Why Every Job Report Matters Central to the Federal Reserve’s decision-making process is the health of the labor market. The labor market impact is a critical indicator of economic strength and inflationary pressures. A robust job market, characterized by low unemployment and strong wage growth, can fuel consumer spending and contribute to inflation, potentially delaying Fed rate cuts . Conversely, signs of weakness, such as rising unemployment or slowing wage gains, might provide the Fed with the impetus it needs to ease monetary policy. Upcoming labor market data releases, including the Non-Farm Payrolls report, unemployment rate, and average hourly earnings, are therefore closely watched by traders and analysts globally. These reports offer a snapshot of the US economy’s pulse and can cause immediate, significant reactions across financial markets, including the forex market trends and, by extension, crypto. For instance, a surprisingly strong jobs report could lead to a temporary strengthening of the US Dollar Outlook as markets price in a longer period of higher rates. Conversely, a weak report could trigger dollar selling and a surge in demand for risk assets. Understanding the nuances of the labor market impact is essential for predicting the Fed’s next moves. It’s not just about the headline numbers; factors like labor force participation, industry-specific employment trends, and duration of unemployment also provide valuable insights. Key Labor Market Indicators to Watch: Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP): Measures the number of new jobs created in the US economy, excluding agricultural, government, private household, and non-profit organization employees. A strong NFP suggests economic expansion. Unemployment Rate: The percentage of the total labor force that is unemployed but actively seeking employment. A lower rate generally indicates a healthier economy. Average Hourly Earnings: Tracks the average change in hourly wages for all employees. Rising wages can signal inflationary pressures, influencing the Fed’s stance on global interest rates . Jobless Claims: Weekly data on the number of individuals filing for unemployment benefits. An increase can signal a softening job market. These indicators provide the fundamental data points that shape the Fed’s perspective on when and how to adjust global interest rates , directly impacting the broader financial environment for all assets. Navigating Forex Market Trends: Opportunities and Challenges Ahead The dynamics of the forex market trends are perpetually in motion, driven by a confluence of economic data, geopolitical events, and central bank policies. As the focus shifts to potential Fed rate cuts and the evolving US Dollar Outlook , currency traders and investors are presented with both significant opportunities and inherent challenges. The dollar’s trajectory against other major currencies—such as the Euro, Yen, and Pound—will dictate the relative strength of various economies and influence global trade flows. One key opportunity arises from interest rate differentials. If the Fed begins to cut rates while other central banks maintain or even hike theirs, the yield advantage of dollar-denominated assets could diminish. This might lead to capital flowing out of the US Dollar and into currencies offering higher returns, creating trading opportunities in specific currency pairs. Conversely, if the Fed remains hawkish longer than expected, the dollar could strengthen further, posing challenges for those holding other currencies or assets sensitive to a strong dollar. Challenges in the forex market include increased volatility around major economic data releases, such as the aforementioned labor market reports. Unexpected outcomes can trigger sharp movements, leading to rapid re-pricing of assets. Geopolitical tensions also remain a constant source of uncertainty, capable of altering risk sentiment and driving sudden shifts in currency valuations. For crypto investors, understanding these broader forex movements is crucial because a strong dollar often correlates with a “risk-off” environment, where investors might pull back from speculative assets. Conversely, a weaker dollar in a “risk-on” environment can boost crypto valuations. Actionable Insights for Navigating Forex Trends: Monitor Central Bank Communication: Pay close attention to statements from the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan, and others. Their forward guidance on global interest rates is a primary driver. Track Economic Calendars: Be aware of key data releases, especially those related to inflation, employment, and GDP, as they are immediate market movers. Diversify Portfolios: Consider how currency movements might impact your overall portfolio, especially if you hold international assets or commodities priced in dollars. Understand Intermarket Relationships: Recognize that forex, equities, commodities, and crypto markets are interconnected. A move in one often signals a potential move in another. These insights are vital for anyone looking to make informed decisions in a market increasingly influenced by the interplay of macroeconomic factors and central bank actions, especially regarding the labor market impact on policy. Broader Implications: How Global Interest Rates Shape Your Portfolio The discussion around Fed rate cuts and the US Dollar Outlook extends far beyond just currency markets; it profoundly influences global interest rates and, consequently, every investment portfolio. When the world’s largest economy adjusts its monetary policy, the reverberations are felt globally, affecting everything from sovereign bond yields to corporate borrowing costs and, significantly, the attractiveness of various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. One major implication is the effect on capital flows. Lower interest rates in the US could make other countries’ bonds and equities more attractive if they offer relatively higher yields or better growth prospects. This can lead to capital shifting out of US markets, potentially weakening the dollar and boosting other currencies. Conversely, higher US rates can draw capital in, strengthening the dollar and potentially dampening demand for assets in other regions. This dynamic directly impacts emerging markets, which often face increased borrowing costs and capital flight when US rates rise. For the crypto market, the influence of global interest rates is multifaceted. A low-interest-rate environment typically fosters a “risk-on” sentiment, where investors are more willing to allocate capital to higher-risk, higher-reward assets like cryptocurrencies. This is because the opportunity cost of holding cash or low-yielding bonds increases. Conversely, higher rates can lead to a “risk-off” environment, making safe-haven assets more appealing and potentially drawing liquidity away from crypto. The availability of cheap credit also influences venture capital funding for blockchain projects and the overall growth of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Challenges in this broader landscape include the persistent threat of inflation, which could force central banks to maintain higher rates for longer, and geopolitical instability, which can introduce unpredictable volatility. Investors must consider how these macro forces interact with the specific narratives and developments within the crypto space to build a resilient and diversified portfolio. The intricate relationship between the labor market impact on Fed policy and the subsequent shift in forex market trends creates a complex web of interconnected financial dynamics that demand careful attention. Conclusion: A Pivotal Juncture for Global Markets The current steadiness of the US Dollar, juxtaposed with the intense anticipation of future Fed rate cuts , marks a pivotal moment for global financial markets. The upcoming labor market impact data will serve as critical signposts, guiding the Federal Reserve’s hand and, by extension, influencing the trajectory of global interest rates and forex market trends . For investors across all asset classes, especially in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, understanding these macro currents is not just academic; it’s essential for strategic decision-making. The decisions made in the coming months by central bankers, particularly regarding the US Dollar Outlook , will undoubtedly shape the investment landscape, presenting both formidable challenges and compelling opportunities. Staying informed and agile will be key to navigating these complex waters successfully.

Đặc biệt, meme coin gần đây nổi tiếng nhờ những biến động giá mạnh mẽ, biến những người tham gia sớm thành triệu phú. Shiba Inu (SHIB) từng biến khoản đầu tư khiêm tốn 750 USD thành 1,5 triệu USD. Hai năm sau, Pepe Coin ($PEPE) cũng ghi dấu ấn với đợt tăng trưởng tương tự. Và giờ đây, một cái tên mới đang thu hút sự chú ý của giới đầu tư: Bitcoin Hyper – đồng coin được kỳ vọng sẽ tiếp bước thành công của Shiba Inu và Pepe Coin với tiềm năng lợi nhuận khổng lồ. Shiba Inu (SHIB) năm 2021 Ban đầu, Shiba Inu chỉ là một meme coin ra đời với mục đích vui vẻ như một lựa chọn thay thế cho Dogecoin. Thế nhưng vào năm 2021, SHIB đã có cú bứt phá ngoạn mục, trở thành một trong những đồng tiền điện tử được nhắc đến nhiều nhất trong năm. Nhờ vào sự lan truyền mạnh mẽ trên mạng xã hội, sự ủng hộ của người nổi tiếng và làn sóng tăng trưởng chung của thị trường crypto, giá SHIB đã tăng vọt. Những nhà đầu tư tham gia sớm đã thu về lợi nhuận khổng lồ. Chỉ với 750 USD đầu tư vào đầu năm 2021, bạn có thể mua được hàng nghìn tỷ token SHIB – và đến tháng 10/2021, số tiền đó đã biến thành hơn 1,5 triệu USD khi SHIB tăng hơn 500.000%. Sự bùng nổ này đã khẳng định với cộng đồng tiền điện tử rằng meme coin hoàn toàn có thể mang lại lợi nhuận khổng lồ, qua đó ghi tên Shiba Inu vào danh sách những câu chuyện thành công tiêu biểu trong lịch sử crypto. Sự bùng nổ của Pepe Coin vào năm 2023 Một meme coin khác đã khiến giới crypto chấn động vào năm 2023: Pepe Coin ($PEPE). Ra mắt vào tháng 4/2023, đúng giai đoạn thị trường crypto chìm trong “mùa đông”, Pepe Coin bắt đầu giao dịch một cách lặng lẽ và hầu như không ai ngờ nó sẽ trở thành xu hướng lớn tiếp theo. Chỉ vài tuần sau, token này đã bùng nổ về giá trị. Đầu tháng 5/2023, giá Pepe đã tăng hơn 5.000%. Một số nhà đầu tư sớm còn ghi nhận lợi nhuận khổng lồ lên đến 322.000 lần. Có thời điểm, khối lượng giao dịch của Pepe Coin còn vượt qua cả những meme coin nổi tiếng như Dogecoin và Shiba Inu, đưa vốn hóa thị trường của nó đạt tới 1,5 tỷ USD. Sự nổi lên của Pepe Coin cũng truyền cảm hứng cho nhiều meme token khác như Sponge, Floki Inu, AIDoge và Wall Street Memes, giúp chúng nhanh chóng thu hút sự chú ý. Thành công của Pepe Coin khẳng định rằng meme coin hoàn toàn có thể biến nhà đầu tư sớm thành triệu phú, và cho thấy những token nhỏ, ít được chú ý ban đầu, cũng có thể mang lại lợi nhuận khổng lồ. Bitcoin Hyper : Đồng penny token tiếp theo với tiềm năng tạo triệu phú Những ngày này, tâm điểm chú ý đang dồn vào Bitcoin Hyper – một loại tiền điện tử mới mà nhiều người tin rằng có thể tái hiện thành công của Shiba Inu và Pepe Coin. Với mức giá hiện tại dưới 0,09 USD, Bitcoin Hyper đang được định vị như một cơ hội lớn tiếp theo cho những ai tìm kiếm lợi nhuận có thể thay đổi cuộc đời. Từ bất động sản, nghệ thuật cho đến tài sản trí tuệ, Bitcoin Hyper là một công cụ đột phá giúp mọi người trên toàn thế giới token hóa các loại tài sản thực. Mục tiêu của Bitcoin Hyper là dân chủ hóa việc quản lý tài sản thông qua công nghệ blockchain, từ đó nâng cao tính minh bạch, hiệu quả và khả năng tiếp cận. Không giống như vô số meme coin chỉ dựa vào sự cường điệu, Bitcoin Hyper tạo khác biệt bằng việc tập trung vào token hóa tài sản thực, định hướng cho sự phát triển bền vững lâu dài. Con đường mà Bitcoin Hyper lựa chọn để ra mắt cũng tạo thêm sức hút. Thay vì phụ thuộc vào vốn đầu tư mạo hiểm, dự án đã chọn con đường presale , nhằm duy trì văn hóa community-driven. Presale hiện tại đã hoàn thành 91,44% và đang ở Giai đoạn 7. Trong tổng mục tiêu 16.250.000 USD, các nhà đầu tư đã đóng góp 14.362.724 USD, tương đương 224.027.994 token đã được bán ra. Tương lai tươi sáng phía trước Với mức giá niêm yết dự kiến 0,20 USD, Bitcoin Hyper sẽ được niêm yết trên 3 trong số 10 sàn giao dịch lớn nhất thế giới trong quý I/2025. Bên cạnh đó, việc có mặt trên CoinMarketCap và CoinGecko giúp nhà đầu tư dễ dàng theo dõi sự phát triển của token trước và sau khi niêm yết. Một yếu tố quan trọng khác nâng cao uy tín của Bitcoin Hyper chính là kiểm toán từ Certik, công ty bảo mật blockchain hàng đầu. Báo cáo kiểm toán này mang lại sự đảm bảo mạnh mẽ hơn về tính minh bạch và an toàn của nền tảng. Bitcoin Hyper được định vị để tận dụng thị trường đầy tiềm năng nhưng chưa khai thác hết của token hóa tài sản thực. Giống như Shiba Inu và Pepe Coin, Bitcoin Hyper có thể mang lại mức tăng trưởng lên đến 1.000.000%, mở ra cơ hội sinh lời khổng lồ.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|DOGE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-04 09:47:03

With the SEC facing mid-to-late October 2025 deadlines to approve or reject multiple spot XRP ETF applications, the token could either gain a powerful institutional tailwind or face renewed selling pressure. At the same time, whale flows and infrastructure improvements on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) add further complexity to the near- and long-term outlook. ETF Deadlines: The Regulatory Wildcard The SEC is set to decide on spot XRP ETFs from Grayscale, 21Shares, and others by late October. Analysts place the probability of approval at 70–90%, citing Ripple’s recent legal clarity as a key factor. Approval could potentially unlock $4.3B–$8.4B in institutional inflows, mirroring Bitcoin’s 2023 rally, when the asset surged 120% after ETF approval. Approval would cement XRP’s commodity-like status and open the door to institutional adoption at scale. Conversely, delays or rejections could spark short-term sell-offs, although XRP’s role in cross-border payments and Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin adoption provides a regulatory hedge. Whale Sentiment Swings: A Source of Volatility XRP’s price dynamics remain heavily influenced by its whale cohort. Wallets holding 1M+ XRP control 47.32B tokens (~79% of supply), giving them outsized influence. Exchange inflows recently surged to 260M XRP/day, up from 141M in July, levels that historically precede corrections. Near-term selling could pressure XRP toward the $2.70 support zone, implying a potential 6% downside. Yet there are also signs of institutional alignment: Galaxy Digital added $34.4M in XRP, reinforcing confidence in Ripple’s treasury strategy and the XRPL’s expanding role in CBDC partnerships. Balancing Catalysts and Volatility XRP’s trajectory is delicately balanced between regulatory catalysts and whale-driven volatility. October’s ETF rulings will serve as the immediate make-or-break moment: approvals could fuel a breakout rally, while rejections may trigger retracements toward $2.70. Over the longer term, however, XRPL upgrades, Ripple’s RLUSD integration, and institutional adoption provide enduring utility drivers that extend beyond regulatory headlines. Traders should closely monitor SEC filings and whale flows in the coming weeks, as these factors are likely to dictate whether XRP builds momentum into year-end or retreats before its next major push. Outset PR: Shaping Narratives in Uncertain Markets Just as XRP’s price swings hinge on regulatory outcomes and whale positioning, narratives play a decisive role in shaping sentiment. This is where Outset PR , founded by crypto PR strategist Mike Ermolaev, makes a difference. Outset PR operates like a workshop powered by data, ensuring that every campaign aligns with market fit and context. Media outlets are chosen not randomly, but by metrics such as discoverability, domain authority, conversion potential, and viral reach. Pitches are tailored to each platform’s audience, and timing is carefully mapped to let stories unfold naturally, building trust rather than chasing hype. The firm’s proprietary traffic acquisition system blends editorial coverage with SEO and lead-generation, helping clients achieve reach far beyond standard PR. For example, ChangeNOW expanded its customer base by 40% through a campaign amplified with Google Discover distribution while Step App saw engagement surge in the US and UK, coinciding with a 138% FITFI token rally. For projects navigating regulatory catalysts, technological upgrades, or whale-driven volatility, Outset PR provides C-level clarity. Its data-led, boutique approach ensures communications don’t just generate visibility but also engineer trust and measurable impact, turning uncertainty into an opportunity to lead the conversation.

The financing would position the firm among the most valuable AI startups, doubling its June valuation of $7.8 billion. Former DeepMind and Meta researchers founded the two-year-old French AI firm. It develops open-source large language models (LLMs) and Le Chat, an AI chatbot designed for the European market. Mistral AI emerges as Europe’s fast-growing startup Bloomberg reported that the current round of financing positions Mistral as one of Europe’s most valuable tech startups. In June, Mistral AI partnered with Nvidia to build AI data centers in France. The collaboration aimed to utilize Nvidia’s GPUs to develop the data center and expand into cloud services. Cryptopolitan reported that the French AI startup will build an AI cloud platform powered by 18,000 Nvidia GPUs and utilize its LLMs. Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang announced the deal during his keynote at the GTC event in Paris. He emphasized the importance of AI data centers to Europe’s technology future. The latest funding round marks Mistral’s most significant raise since mid-last year, following a growing trend of multiple investments in European AI startups. In Q1 of 2025, European AI funding increased by 55% compared to last year. Also, during the same quarter, 12 startups graduated to unicorn companies worth over $1 billion. AI Magazine featured the top ten startups in Europe in April. The list reflected the region’s growing AI ecosystem. It highlighted Aleph Alpha of Germany, which develops multilingual LLMs, and TechWolf of Belgium, which focuses on AI-powered HR solutions. It also listed Mistral’s AI model, Mistral Large, available on Snowflake Data Cloud for customers to use with their enterprise data to build applications quickly. Apple held internal talks with Mistral AI and Perplexity about acquiring the technology to strengthen its Siri AI platform. CEO Tim Cook pointed out the firm plans a sizable acquisition to accelerate the development of on-device and cloud AI. Mistral AI rises from $2.7B to $14B in just two years Mistral’s value has grown fast over the past two years. In 2023, they received funding valued at $2.7 billion. Last month, Mistral AI sought to raise $1 billion in fresh financing, aiming for a $10 billion valuation. Abu Dhabi’s MGX backed the funding round to support the commercial rollout of its AI chatbot Le Chat and build new LLMs. Now, the new $14 billion valuation shows how much interest and demand there is for Mistral’s AI technology on a global scale. The French AI startup has built its AI models around an open-source approach, setting it apart from many industry rivals. The firm releases its LLMs to everyone. Developers and businesses worldwide can explore and build upon the technology without restrictive licensing requirements. The firm aims to democratize access to AI tools and ensure companies can integrate the system t o lo cal needs. Rival Chinese firm DeepSeeK adopted a similar mechanism, releasing its models open to the public. Mistral’s CEO, Arthur Mensch, acknowledged DeepSeek’s decision to open-source in February. In his interview with Business Insider, Mensch mentioned that he views DeepSeek as the Mistral of China. He added that it is a great moment to open-source their models and allow participation to build on top of each other. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

51174583,https://timestabloid.com/?p=81577,1756980000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Bitcoin (BTC) Dips to $108,824, Analysts Say Alternative At The Moment May Be a $0.035 DeFi Gem With 55x Room",https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-btc-dips-to-108824-analysts-say-alternative-at-the-moment/,"Bitcoin (BTC)’s recent dip to $108,824 has reignited market anxiety and once again raised the question of whether the world’s most dominant crypto still offers the explosive growth that retail investors are chasing. Analysts agree that Bitcoin (BTC)’s long-term role as a store of value will not change, but its pace of growth has slowed, leaving many to consider whether holding BTC through cycles of modest gains makes sense when stronger upside lies elsewhere. For traders focused on immediate opportunities, the spotlight is shifting to DeFi projects with lower entry costs and greater potential for exponential growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming the prime example. At a presale price of just $0.035, it is being called the DeFi gem with 55x room for growth. This projection does not come from speculation alone but from carefully designed mechanics that will generate sustainable demand and establish a revenue-driven protocol right from the start. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Presale Urgency Creates Rare Entry Investing in crypto often comes down to timing, and the presale stage is providing one of the last windows to secure Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at a true ground-floor price. Phase 6 is currently live at $0.035, with $15.3 million already raised, 16,000+ holders onboarded, and 32% of its 170 million token allocation secured. Confidence is further strengthened by a CertiK audit delivering a Token Scan Score of 95 and a Skynet Score of 78, numbers that few early-stage projects achieve. Urgency is building fast because only one phase remains before the price jumps 15%. That move will make this the last chance for traders to buy under $0.05 before broader market attention floods in. As the crypto fear and greed index reflects shifting sentiment, smart investors will not ignore such a rare chance to access a token at this price level with these fundamentals. The projected 55x growth is tied directly to Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s architecture. The reserve factor will direct a portion of borrower interest into the protocol treasury, creating a recurring source of revenue. Liquidation penalties will also flow back into the system, ensuring that even distressed market conditions translate into positive inflows for MUTM holders. On top of this, carefully designed deposit and borrow caps will help prevent systemic risk, creating stability that encourages large-scale participation without exposing the protocol to dangerous imbalances. These revenue streams and safeguards will ensure that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just another presale hype cycle but a sustainable ecosystem capable of rewarding early backers for years to come. Growth Catalyst Beyond Presale Crypto predictions for the coming cycle emphasize that real adoption will define the winners. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will deliver on this front immediately with a beta launch aligned with its token listing. This timing will mean that users are not just buying into a promise but into a functioning ecosystem from day one. The project’s Layer-2 integration will deliver faster transaction speeds and reduced costs, solving a major challenge for DeFi protocols operating on congested chains. This efficiency will drive adoption at scale and position MUTM as a practical platform for both retail and institutional users. The upcoming stablecoin will add another critical layer, providing stability and utility that encourage long-term usage within the ecosystem. Exchange visibility will accelerate growth further. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to list expectedly on Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, Kraken, and MEXC, giving it immediate access to global liquidity and investor attention. This lineup of top-tier exchanges ensures that once the presale concludes, MUTM will not remain a hidden gem but will instead be placed directly in front of millions of traders worldwide. When compared to Bitcoin (BTC), the contrast is clear. BTC’s price action will remain tied to gradual cycles of institutional accumulation and macroeconomic factors. Traders seeking fast ROI will not find it in an asset already valued in six figures. By contrast, another token with structural revenue mechanics, a functioning roadmap, and expected exchange exposure represents the exact kind of asymmetric opportunity that drives life-changing returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not asking traders to wait years for progress. Its mechanics will start generating revenue, its protocol will be live at launch, and its listings will put it on the global stage right away. For retail investors who missed the early days of Bitcoin (BTC), this represents the fresh entry point they have been waiting for. In a market shaken by Bitcoin (BTC)’s dip, traders searching for the smartest alternative will recognize where the 55x upside lies. The DeFi gem priced at $0.035 is set to capture the momentum, and the shift from stagnation to growth will be led by Mutuum Finance (MUTM).

The Next Crypto to Explode? The Fed Just Dropped a Hint September 4, 2025 • 10:00 UTC The US Federal Reserve is hosting a landmark payments innovation conference this October, spotlighting the convergence of DeFi with traditional finance.

In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $100K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Click to learn more about Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin. Its goal – to bring Bitcoin’s blockchain to modern standards. This means compatibility with dApps, smart contracts, and seamless DeFi programmability for developers.

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis After three consecutive green closes over the last three days, Bitcoin is in the red today, currently down about 1%. Although degens might expect cryptos to keep pumping, that’s not really how bull runs work. As Michael Saylor just said, ‘ Bitcoin is a Marathon, Not a Sprint. ‘ A solid leg-up, especially after a rebound, often comes with pullbacks and retests, and that’s exactly what Bitcoin could be doing right now. This week, $BTC broke out of a falling wedge pattern, which many believe could mark the start of its rebound and charge toward new all-time highs. And here’s the good news: according to this pattern, the move after a breakout is usually equal to, or greater than, the maximum width of the consolidation zone. That target works out to nearly $125K. Strong technicals, combined with growing expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut this month, set the stage for ‘digital gold’ to not only reclaim its ATHs but also push beyond them. Bitcoin Mining Companies Boost Production Due to Increased Demand: This Could Rally Bitcoin and Bitcoin Hyper’s Presale September 4, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Riot Platforms and CleanSpark, two Bitcoin mining companies, have boosted crypto production last month due to increased demand. For instance, Riot Platforms mined 477 $BTC and sold 450 in August , with current holdings of over 19,309 $BTC (+92.7% in the last year alone). CleanSpark, on the other hand, mined 657 $BTC and sold 544.5 , up 37.5% from last year. And this is when Bitcoin mining underwent a spike in difficulty in 2025 (+44.9% since 2024). This can only mean one thing – Bitcoin demand has skyrocketed, which is plain to see from institutions gobbling up $BTC constantly. Bitcoin is up by 95% in the last year, and long-term holders aren’t giving up the fight despite the current market slump. Investors are more interested in crypto presales than ever before due to this bullish confluence. Probably the most viral presale now is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , which plans to revolutionize Bitcoin’s chain with dApps, smart contracts, and ecosystem upgrades for modern DeFi demands. Bitcoin Hyper is close to $14M – here’s how to buy $HYPER before the next price increase. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Surges as US Bank Returns to Crypto September 4, 2025 • 10:00 UTC After a long pause due to regulatory uncertainty, US Bank has reignited its Bitcoin custody services, marking yet another major shift in how traditional finance views crypto. But while top US banks are just dipping their toes back in, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is already building the next evolution of Bitcoin itself. Currently in presale, $HYPER is the native token powering Bitcoin’s first true Layer 2 network. It enables fast, low-cost $BTC transactions, staking, and d’apps via the Solana Virtual Machine for unmatched speed and scalability.

Researchers say the method lets attackers hide behind blockchain traffic that often looks legitimate, making detection far more difficult. New Attack Vector Surfaces According to digital asset compliance firm ReversingLabs, two packages uploaded to the Node Package Manager (NPM) repository in July were found to use this method. The packages, “ colortoolsv2 ” and “ mimelib2 ,” appeared harmless on the surface but contained hidden functions that pulled instructions from Ethereum smart contracts . Instead of directly hosting malicious links, they acted as downloaders, retrieving addresses for command-and-control servers before installing second-stage malware. Lucija Valentić, a researcher at ReversingLabs, explained that what stood out was the hosting of malicious URLs on Ethereum contracts. “That’s something we haven’t seen previously,” Valentić said, adding that it marks a quick shift in the way attackers are dodging security scans. Fake Trading Bots And Social Tricks The incident is not an isolated attempt. Researchers found that the packages were part of a much wider deception campaign, mainly carried out through GitHub. Hackers had built fake cryptocurrency trading bot repositories, filling them with fabricated commits, multiple fake maintainer accounts, and polished documentation to lure developers. These projects were designed to look trustworthy, hiding the real purpose of delivering malware. In 2024 alone, 23 crypto-related malicious campaigns were documented across open-source repositories. Security analysts believe this latest tactic, combining blockchain commands with social engineering, raises the bar for anyone trying to defend against such attacks. Past Cases Targeting Crypto Projects Ethereum is not the only blockchain pulled into these schemes. Earlier this year, the North Korean-linked Lazarus Group was tied to malware that also touched Ethereum contracts, though the approach then was different. In April, attackers spread a fake GitHub repository posing as a Solana trading bot, using it to plant malware that stole wallet credentials. Another case involved “Bitcoinlib,” a Python library meant for Bitcoin development, which hackers targeted for similar purposes. While the specific methods shift, the trend is clear: crypto-related developer tools and open-source code repositories are being used as traps. The use of blockchain features such as smart contracts is only making the problem harder to detect. Valentić summed it up by saying that attackers are constantly searching for fresh ways to bypass defenses. Hosting malicious commands on Ethereum contracts, she said, shows how far some are willing to go to stay one step ahead.

This level is becoming a major talking point for bulls and bears alike. While markets digest the shift, ETF inflows remain steady, fueling optimism for longer-term gains. Amid this backdrop, fresh projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are starting to capture attention as potential breakout plays. Bitcoin Pulls Back and Market Reaction Intensifies The recent Bitcoin pulls back phase has brought mixed reactions. Some traders see it as a healthy Bitcoin correction phase, while others fear it could break down further. Analysts are watching BTC support and resistance levels closely, especially with the $110K area in focus. Several traders on X are already mapping their strategies: Merlijn The Trader sees a bullish crossover forming, targeting $120K+ . Kamran Asghar points out that the trendline retest could ignite a strong rally. Marcus Corvinus warns that heavy bearish candles show buyers losing grip, calling this a turning point. Captain Faibik highlights a falling wedge breakout, predicting $116K. BTC price analysis by Merlijn The Trader These views reflect how volatile sentiment is during such swings. The Bitcoin market reaction to these shifts shows how quickly traders adjust when price tests such a critical level. For many, Bitcoin price analysis today suggests a standoff between cautious bears and aggressive bulls. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Rising Amid ETF Liquidity Flows While all eyes are on Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 , some analysts argue that altcoins could ride the next wave. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the picture. As institutional ETF inflows deepen, capital may start rotating into smaller tokens with strong narratives. The pullback is giving many traders space to evaluate projects with higher upside. Major analysts note that MAGACOIN FINANCE sits in a favorable position to benefit from fresh liquidity. Forecasts hint at strong breakout potential once Bitcoin stabilizes above major zones like the Bitcoin price support zone at $110,000 . For traders looking past Bitcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be a name to watch when the Bitcoin market outlook improves. What This Pullback Could Mean Going Forward The question now is whether traders eye Bitcoin $110K as a firm foundation or just another short-lived stop before deeper losses. If bulls defend this area, a bounce toward $116K–$120K could materialize, supporting a stronger Bitcoin technical analysis 2025 outlook. If not, bears may gain control, testing lower channels and extending the Bitcoin correction phase. For long-term investors, the Bitcoin price prediction 2025 narrative remains alive as institutional flows continue. The future outlook if Bitcoin holds $110K support could bring renewed confidence across the crypto space. And in that scenario, altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE may be among the biggest winners. Final thoughts The Bitcoin pulls back episode is testing nerves but also laying the groundwork for what comes next. With the Bitcoin $110K support zone acting as a key battleground, traders are watching every move and weighing the Bitcoin market reaction carefully. For altcoins, the correction may open doors, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is being mentioned more often as a project with exciting potential in the next wave of growth.

But for investors tracking upside, Remittix is drawing attention with analysts now forecasting 40x gains thanks to strong fundamentals, fundraising, and its upcoming Q3 wallet beta launch on September 15. That combination of infrastructure development and incentive sets Remittix apart from both Solana and XRP when choosing a top opportunity in late 2025. Here is how each project stacks up. Solana Stays Near $210 Ahead of Alpenglow Boost Solana currently fetches around $209 to $210, up 2 to 3% in the last day and 7% over a week as its Alpenglow upgrade adds buzz around faster finality and better scalability. Trading volume has surged, reflecting renewed investor interest in Solana’s ecosystem growth. While Solana retains smart contract leadership, its upside remains tied to external catalysts, not necessarily standalone execution. XRP Holds Ground as Speculation Meets Technical Pressure XRP is holding around $2.82 with tight ranges, supported by steady whale bids and speculation about a potential ETF. Turnover stays strong, suggesting the market’s attention hasn’t wandered. Analysts warn that unless Ripple delivers a breakthrough on the regulatory or utility front, XRP’s rally potential may remain limited or capped around the $3.50 mark. That tension stands in contrast with Remittix’s active product rollout strategy. Remittix Forecasted To Deliver 40x Gains in Coming Months Remittix is capturing attention by promising practical upside, where Solana depends on network upgrades and XRP relies on regulatory momentum. Analysts now forecast Remittix could deliver as much as 40x gains, grounded in tangible utility, not speculation. Remittix has sold over 642 million tokens, is priced at $0.103, and has raised over $23.5 million. It secured a BitMart listing after passing $20 million, followed by LBANK beyond $22 million, and is now preparing for a third CEX listing. That trajectory shows execution and investor confidence in action. Here are five compelling reasons Remittix is emerging as the standout pick: Solving a real-world $19 trillion payments problem Wallet beta launches September 15 Mass market appeal beyond crypto insiders Built for adoption, not speculation Deflationary tokenomics designed for long-term holder value That combination of groundwork, momentum, and built-in excitement positions Remittix to outperform in ways Solana and XRP currently cannot. Remittix Rises as The Clear 40x Contender Solana benefits from technical upgrades and developer strength, and XRP holds speculative upside on ETF chatter, but neither currently offers the same catalyst-rich path as Remittix. With a real product calendar, a $250,000 giveaway, and strong capital backing, Remittix stands poised for growth. Its projected 40x gains are grounded in infrastructure and community, giving it a compelling edge over Solana and XRP as investors look for serious returns before year’s end.

Alors que le Bitcoin stagne et que l’Ethereum subit une pression croissante de ses Layer 2, une poignée de projets attirent toute l’attention. Les investisseurs cherchent de la performance, et le marché ne manque pas de candidats prêts à bondir. Les signaux se multiplient : afflux de capitaux vers les préventes, hype communautaire, partenariats en cours, et tokenomics conçus pour accélérer la traction. Trois altcoin s sortent du lot ce mois-ci : Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), Maxi Doge ($MAXI) et Snorter Token ($SNORT) . Chacun joue sa propre carte mais tous partagent un point commun : un potentiel explosif qui pourrait bien marquer l’automne 2025 . Marché crypto : pourquoi septembre 2025 est un mois décisif Le décor est posé pour un réveil des altcoins . Entre taux qui s’assouplissent , banques centrales moins agressives et cadres réglementaires plus lisibles , l’appétit pour le risque revient. Les capitaux commencent à tourner du “grand public” (BTC/ETH) vers des projets plus agiles, et ça se voit : volumes en hausse , flux sur CEX/DEX qui s’épaississent, préventes qui bouclent des montants record et des communautés qui s’enflamment. Les investisseurs cherchent du levier d’innovation (scalabilité, L2, RWA, AI), pas seulement du beta marché. Bref, on assiste à une vraie rotation : de la prudence vers la performance, du “store of value” vers l’ utilité et le narratif . Attention toutefois : ce contexte porteur reste sensible au macro . Si le ton monétaire se durcit à nouveau, la fête peut s’interrompre aussi vite qu’elle a commencé . Les altcoins visent de nouveaux sommets historiques Pour de plus en plus d’analystes, certains des meilleurs altcoins flirtent à nouveau avec leurs plus hauts historiques . Le cocktail est clair : adoption qui déborde du cercle crypto et appétit spéculatif qui grimpe . Cela se voit partout avec les caps qui gonflent , des carnets d’ordres plus épais et les communautés en ébullition sur X et Telegram. Ce mélange traction réelle + FOMO crée un setup idéal pour des cassures d’ATH . Bref, quelques projets se retrouvent dans la zone parfaite pour surprendre le marché, pas seulement sur un coup d’éclat, mais parce qu’ils alignent narratif crédible, liquidité au rendez-vous et engagement massif . Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) : le Layer 2 qui muscle Bitcoin Bitcoin Hyper ne veut pas détrôner Bitcoin, il veut lui coller un turbo . Pensé comme un Layer 2 adossé au réseau Bitcoin, il embarque la Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) pour déployer des smart contracts rapides et peu coûteux . Concrètement, ça rend Bitcoin programmable et scalable : DeFi, paiements instantanés, NFT, tout en s’appuyant sur la sécurité du protocole d’origine. Côté chiffres, la presale a déjà levé plus de 12,7 M$ , avec un prix autour de 0,0128 $ par token. L’offre totale est limitée , de quoi nourrir l’effet rareté, et les fonds sont répartis de façon claire entre développement, sécurité, marketing et liquidité pour poser des bases solides. La différence de $HYPER , c’est son hybride gagnant : la stabilité de Bitcoin + l’ agilité de Solana. Dans un marché qui cherche des projets utiles, tenables et bien exécutés, Bitcoin Hyper fait figure de candidat sérieux pour l’altcoin season 2025 . Achetez maintenant $HYPER ! Maxi Doge ($MAXI) : le meme coin affuté qui mise sur sa communauté Maxi Doge s’impose comme l’un des meme coins les plus attendus de 2025 , mais il ne se limite pas à surfer sur la hype. L’univers est musclé et décalé mais pas que, il est aussi pensé pour fédérer une communauté ultra-active. Avec une offre totale fixée à 200 milliards de tokens , sa distribution est claire : 25 % en mise initiale, 20 % pour les récompenses communautaires, 30 % pour le marketing, 15 % en staking/airdrops et 10 % pour la liquidité . En presale, le prix tourne autour de 0,0012 $ , et le projet a déjà levé près d’un million de dollars , preuve d’une traction solide et un rêve pour beaucoup. Il ne faut pas miser que sur l’humour bien sûr, Maxi Doge offre aussi des outils financiers concrets : un staking à rendement élevé, des airdrops réguliers et une stratégie marketing massive pour soutenir la croissance. Son véritable atout ? L’équilibre entre fun et utilité . Là où de nombreux memecoins s’essoufflent après quelques semaines, $MAXI veut s’inscrire dans la durée grâce à une vision structurée et une communauté engagée. Achetez maintenant $MAXI ! Snorter Token ($SNORT) : le meme coin qui veut avoir un impact réel Snorter Token ne se contente pas de faire rire : il veut mixer mème et impact . Oui, le ton est décalé, mais la mécanique est carrée : une répartition claire des tokens (marketing, récompenses, gouvernance, partenariats) et un volet dédié à des initiatives caritatives et communautaires . Ici, l’humour sert un projet qui cherche à peser dans le réel. Côté chiffres, la presale a déjà dépassé le million de dollars , avec un prix à quelques fractions de centime . La roadmap est détaillée et mesurable , avec des jalons lisibles, de quoi parler à la fois aux fans de mèmes et aux profils qui veulent un cadre plus durable. Dans un marché saturé de tokens éclair, $SNORT veut prouver qu’on peut allier fun et sérieux et créer de la valeur qui tient dans le temps . Une approche qui gagne du terrain, surtout quand l’ altcoin season remet la lumière sur les projets capables de livrer, pas juste d’amuser. Achetez maintenant $SNORT ! Conclusion Septembre 2025, ça crépite côté altcoins et au milieu de cette agitation : Bitcoin Hyper (Bitcoin dopé, programmable), Maxi Doge (communauté soudée, staking malin) et Snorter Token (humour + impact réel). Reste le vrai crash-test : tenir après la hype et transformer l’instantané en valeur qui dure.",Altcoins|altcoins,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ALTCOIN|BTC|SOL,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-04 10:01:27

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-warns-xrp-holders-your-holding-is-about-to-explode-heres-why/,"XRP has struggled to hold momentum in recent weeks, consolidating near the $2.8 level after a series of market corrections. Despite short-term weakness, some traders are beginning to look toward longer timeframes for signals of a potential breakout. One of the most notable perspectives came from Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a market analyst on X, who shared a chart suggesting that XRP could be on the verge of a major move. In the tweet, Steph stated that XRP is on the verge of a major price explosion. He shared a weekly chart predicting a steep price increase over the next year. The chart highlights XRP’s consolidation phase , which the asset has struggled with since early August. However, the analyst showed that the asset was consolidating around a crucial support level, and its decline in early September caused it to test that support. WARNING: You’re #XRP is about to explode! pic.twitter.com/fxNUPBcnQu — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 3, 2025 XRP’s Next Target Steph’s chart suggests that XRP could bounce off this resistance and experience a massive rally in the final months of 2025. According to the chart, the digital asset is heading toward the $8 to $13 range, which would place XRP in the double-digit range for the first time. For many investors, the timing of this outlook is significant. XRP has recently been under pressure, losing ground alongside other major cryptocurrencies amid broader market uncertainty. Institutional liquidations, reduced on-chain activity, whale sell-offs , and macroeconomic factors such as U.S. interest rate policy have weighed on sentiment. Against that backdrop, a chart calling for an aggressive rally stands in sharp contrast to the prevailing caution in the market. Steph’s analysis appears rooted in the longer-term technical structure of XRP, preceding these bearish developments. The chart suggests that the consolidation period near $3 is a base rather than a ceiling. If this interpretation holds, the coming few months could see XRP transition from stagnation into a rapid expansion phase. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Will XRP Reach Double-digit Targets? The implied move to the $8 to $13 range would represent a several-fold increase from current levels, positioning XRP among the strongest performers in the digital asset space if it materializes. While some investors are skeptical, other experts have predicted that the digital asset can reach double-digit prices . While technical projections are not guarantees of future price movement, Steph’s analysis is grounded in sound principles, and a sustained move higher from this level would strengthen the case for a breakout.

51174744,https://bitzo.com/2025/09/cardano-ada-breaks-below-critical-support-levels-as-altcoin-dominance-weakens,1756980166,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/51174744.jpeg,Cardano (ADA) Breaks Below Critical Support Levels as Altcoin Dominance Weakens,https://bitzo.com/2025/09/cardano-ada-breaks-below-critical-support-levels-as-altcoin-dominance-weakens,"Cardano (ADA) slipped further into bearish territory after breaking below its 30-day SMA, triggering algorithmic sell signals and sparking renewed downside pressure. The technical breakdown comes amid weakening sentiment across the altcoin sector, as Bitcoin dominance rises to 57.73% and liquidity dries up for mid-cap tokens. With altcoin investors showing caution ahead of looming U.S. regulatory decisions, ADA’s trajectory will hinge on whether it can hold above critical Fibonacci support zones. Technical Breakdown Triggers Exits ADA’s breach of key moving averages reinforced bearish divergence on the charts. The MACD histogram flipped negative (-0.0103), confirming momentum loss, while the RSI (49.41) remains neutral but leaves room for further downside. Technical traders likely exited positions as ADA lost momentum. The next significant support lies at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level ($0.82795). A close below $0.81 could set the stage for a deeper drop toward the 78.6% Fibonacci level at $0.776. Altcoin Market Rotation The broader market context further explains ADA’s weakness. The Altcoin Season Index fell 3.7% in 24 hours to 52, signaling reduced investor appetite for mid-cap assets. Meanwhile, Bitcoin dominance climbed to 57.73%, adding pressure to altcoins. Source: coinmarketcap ADA’s -1.41% daily decline outpaced the total crypto market’s -0.06% move, underscoring sector-specific headwinds. Caution ahead of U.S. regulatory updates — particularly surrounding stablecoin legislation — may also be curbing altcoin liquidity, weighing on ADA’s outlook. Consolidation or Breakdown Ahead? ADA’s decline reflects a confluence of technical breakdowns, waning altcoin dominance, and shrinking liquidity. While no fundamental negatives have emerged from the Cardano ecosystem itself, the lack of strong bullish catalysts leaves ADA exposed to broader sector caution. If Bitcoin dominance continues to climb, ADA could remain under pressure, with $0.81 serving as the immediate battleground. A break below that level risks triggering deeper downside toward $0.776, while stabilization above $0.82795 support could open the door to a consolidation phase. Outset PR Crafts Strong Narratives When Markets Weaken Just as ADA faces the challenge of sustaining confidence amid sector-wide caution, crypto projects in similar positions must communicate resilience even when market sentiment is fragile.

HYLQ pokazuje, jak łączyć DeFi z rynkiem giełdowym",https://bitcoinist.com/ether-machine-nasdaq/,"Ether Machine szykuje się do debiutu na Nasdaq. HYLQ pokazuje, jak łączyć DeFi z rynkiem giełdowym Ether Machine jest coraz bliższe debiutu na giełdzie Nasdaq, co ma nastąpić jeszcze w 2025 roku. Spółka zgromadziła już niezbędne miliardy dolarów w rezerwach Ethereum i budzi duże zainteresowanie inwestorów instytucjonalnych. IPO Ether Machine wpisuje się w trend “crypto summer”, a więc rosnącego zainteresowania inwestorów instytucjonalnych i detalicznych aktywami opartymi na blockchainie. W tym kontekście należy też wspomnieć o kanadyjskiej spółce HYLQ Strategy Corp (HYLQ), gromadzącej ekspozycję na natywny token $HYPE. Ether Machine przed debiutem na Nasdaq Spółka Ether Machine jest obecnie coraz mocniej rozpoznawalnym podmiotem w branży krypto. Wszystko ze względu na strategię, która polega na gromadzeniu rezerw kapitałowych w kryptowalucie Ethereum, a więc drugiej najpopularniejszej walucie cyfrowej na świecie. Portfel firmy liczy już ponad 2 miliardy dolarów. Ponadto w sierpniu zakończyła się runda finansowania, która przyniosła spółce 654 mln USD w $ETH . Jeżeli wszystko pójdzie zgodnie z planem, debiut Ether Machine na Nasdaq nastąpi w czwartym kwartale 2025 roku. Będzie to wynik połączenia ze spółką celową typu SPAC. Już teraz można powiedzieć, że będzie to jeden z największych debiutów na amerykańskim parkiecie w historii sektora kryptowalut. IPO Ether Machine wpisuje się w falę wejść na giełdy firm związanych z blockchainem i aktywami cyfrowymi. Symboliczny krok dla całego sektora DeFi Nie będzie to zwykła premiera, ale sygnał dla rynku, że projekty DeFi zaczyna traktować się jak pełnoprawne spółki technologiczne. To przykład, że takie firmy mogą pozyskiwać miliardowe środki i konkurować o uwagę inwestorów instytucjonalnych. Ether Machine potwierdza, że zdecentralizowane finanse nie są już niszą, ale regularnie budują swoją pozycję i odważnie wchodzą do głównego nurtu Wall Street. Jeszcze do niedawna projekty DeFi kojarzyły się głównie z aplikacjami, które działały poza tradycyjnym systemem giełdowym i były dostępne głównie dla entuzjastów kryptowalut. Natomiast wejście na amerykański parkiet tak dużej spółki sprawia, że sektor DeFi staje się częścią głównego nurtu finansów. To potwierdzenie, że DeFi to już nie tylko eksperyment. Wręcz przeciwnie – to coraz bardziej dojrzałe projekty, które przyciągają miliardowe inwestycje i spełniają wymogi regulacyjne. Z pewnością włączanie tego typu spółek do obrotu giełdowego otwiera drzwi kolejnym podmiotom z sektora blockchain. Natomiast Ether Machine nie będzie spółką, która przeciera szlaki w tej kategorii. Już teraz wskazać można na spółki Galaxy Digital, MicroStrategy czy HYLQ Strategy Corp. Pierwsza działa jak bank inwestycyjny skoncentrowany na krypto. Dwie kolejne gromadzą ekspozycję na określone aktywa krypto, odpowiednio Bitcoina i token $HYPE z ekosystemu Hyperliquid. Kup HYLQ HYLQ Strategy Corp – kanadyjska odpowiedź na rewolucję HYLQ Strategy Corp (HYLQ) to spółka notowana na Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE). Firma wybrała model działania przypominający MicroStrategy, polegający na gromadzeniu przede wszystkim ekspozycji na token $HYPE z ekosystemu Hyperliquid. Inwestorzy nie muszą zakładać portfela krypto i inwestować w $HYPE. W zamian mogą kupić akcje HYLQ. W ten sposób pośrednio uczestniczą w rozwoju projektu DeFi bez konieczności samodzielnego obrotu kryptowalutami. HYLQ jest więc pomostem pomiędzy światem zdecentralizowanych finansów a tradycyjnym rynkiem kapitałowym. Inwestor może handlować wyłącznie akcjami na giełdzie i w ten prosty sposób uzyskuje ekspozycję na innowacyjny token $HYPE. Dzięki temu sektor DeFi jest dostępny dla znacznie szerszego grona uczestników rynku. $HYPE to natywna kryptowaluta zdecentralizowanej giełdy Hyperliquid, która jest oparta o własny blockchain i mechanizm order book. Nie trzeba tutaj kont niezbędnych w przypadku na przykład giełd Binance czy Coinbase. Wystarczy zalogować się portfelem i można handlować instrumentami pochodnymi opartymi na kryptowalutach. Wszystkie operacje są zapisane w blockchainie, dlatego inwestor zachowuje pełną kontrolę nad swoimi aktywami. Dowiedz się więcej o HYLQ Dlaczego inwestować w HYLQ, a nie bezpośrednio w $HYPE? Pod kątem rentowności większe zyski może przynieść inwestycja w token $HYPE z ekosystemu Hyperliquid. W ostatnich miesiącach kryptowaluta notuje spektakularne wzrosty, dużo większe niż akcje HYLQ. Jednak wielu inwestorów wybiera spółkę notowaną na CSE. Wszystko dlatego, że zyskują ekspozycję na $HYPE w regulowanym otoczeniu giełdowym, bez potrzeby zakładania portfeli kryptowalutowych czy korzystania z platform DeFi. Największym atutem inwestycji w akcje HYLQ jest bezpieczeństwo i wygoda. Spółka podlega nadzorowi regulacyjnemu i obowiązkom sprawozdawczym. Kurs akcji jest dużo stabilniejszy od altcoinów, których cena zmienia się dynamicznie w zależności od popytu, podaży i kondycji całego rynku krypto. Ponadto dla inwestorów instytucjonalnych i funduszy inwestycyjnych bezpośredni zakup tokena byłby niemożliwy ze względu na regulacje funduszy czy banków. Dlatego, mimo że kurs HYLQ nie rośnie równie dynamicznie, jak sam $HYPE, spółka łączy DeFi z tradycyjnymi inwestorami. To rozwiązanie wybierane zwłaszcza przez inwestorów ceniących bezpieczeństwo, którzy chcą mieć udział w potencjalnym wzroście wartości Hyperliquid, ale preferują klasyczne instrumenty giełdowe. Kup HYLQ Co lepsze dla inwestorów? Mimo że Ether Machine dopiero chce zadebiutować na rynku, a HYLQ Strategy Corp jest już spółką notowaną na giełdzie, oba podmioty łączy ten sam cel – zbliżenia zdecentralizowanych finansów do tradycyjnych rynków kapitałowych i otwarcia ich na szerokie grono inwestorów. HYLQ jest przykładem, że tradycyjne giełdy mogą współistnieć z dynamicznym światem DeFi. W zamian inwestorzy zyskują więcej możliwości inwestycyjnych. Mogą ulokować środki w bardziej ryzykowne altcoiny lub postawić na bezpieczniejszą formę, czyli akcje spółek notowanych na giełdzie.

Here's What You Need to Know…,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/research-firm-reveals-hidden-danger-in-ethereum-eth-heres-what-you-need-to-know/,"While Ethereum (ETH) has been one of the main focuses of the cryptocurrency market lately, researchers have revealed the hidden danger in ETH. Research firm ReversingLabs said hackers have found a new way to hide malware in Ethereum smart contracts, Coindesk reported. ReversingLabs researchers have uncovered two malicious NPM packages that use Ethereum smart contracts to hide malicious code, allowing the malware to bypass traditional security checks. These are the “colortoolsv2” and “mimelib2” packages, and they were uploaded to the widely used Node Package Manager repository in July, ReversingLabs researcher Lucija Valentić noted in the report. Valentic said: “While they may seem like simple utilities at first glance, in practice they were exploiting Ethereum’s blockchain to hijack hidden URLs that directed compromised systems to download second-stage malware. By embedding these commands within a smart contract, attackers disguised their activities as legitimate blockchain traffic, making detection even more difficult. This is something we haven't seen before. What is new and different is the use of Ethereum smart contracts to host URLs containing malicious scripts and download second-stage malware.” *This is not investment advice.

51178413,574114,1756986446,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51178413.jpeg,Best Cryptos to Buy as ChatGPT Predicts $400 Solana By Year’s End,https://bitcoinist.com/best-cryptos-to-buy-chatgpt-predicts-400-solana-by-year-end/,"With gains of over 2,500% in just the past three years, there’s hardly a token more deserving of a seat at crypto’s headquarters than Solana ($SOL). And it offers more than just raw gains. Thanks to its unique Proof of History design, low costs, and comparatively simple user experience, Solana has emerged as the go-to hub for meme coins, NFTs, and on-chain trading apps. Naturally, a crypto with both groundbreaking utility and market hype is destined for a bright future. But just how high can Solana’s price climb in 2025? To find out, we turned to ChatGPT, one of the most powerful AI tools available right now. Here’s the kicker : ChatGPT swam through a sea of crypto-related information, including price charts, corporate buys, important announcements, and even online chatter, to arrive at a lofty $400 target. Read on as we unpack the AI’s Solana price prediction, the top factors driving the token’s growth, and the best cryptos to buy now to ride this potentially massive rally. Why $SOL Could Reach $400 in 2025? Ever since hitting a low of $95 in April, $SOL has been in an upward trend. Slowly but surely, it climbed into the $200-$220 zone, but has repeatedly failed to break past it. The reason? A strong upward-sloping resistance line that has capped Solana’s run-up on multiple occasions. That said, ChatGPT noted that the token has now grappled with this resistance four times in the past month and is gearing up for a fifth attempt – one that could finally see it break through. The best part? Because this all-important resistance has already been tested multiple times, the odds of Solana breaking past it are now higher than ever. It’s currently trading around $208 . Anticipating a breakout, ChatGPT measured the width of the consolidation zone (blue box) and mapped it on top of the breakout level to project Solana’s next target: $400. In addition to strong technicals, Solana is also set to receive a massive boost from the upcoming ETF approval and a potential Federal Reserve rate cut. According to Polymarket, the odds of a SOL ETF being approved in 2025 and a rate cut in September stand at >99% and 95% , respectively – both extremely bullish for Solana. It’s also worth noting that large corporations like Bit Mining , DeFi Development Corp , and Sharps Technology have scooped up significant amounts of Solana in recent weeks. This kind of institutional accumulation is a major bullish signal, as it shows confidence from deep-pocketed players who are not only betting on Solana’s long-term fundamentals but also soaking up available supply, thereby increasing scarcity and setting the stage for higher prices. With that in mind, here are the best altcoins to buy right now to capitalize on the Solana frenzy. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Telegram-Based Trading Bot for Sniping Liquidity in New Meme Coins If $SOL comes anywhere close to its predicted potential this year, chances are it could also send Snorter Token ($SNORT) – the best Solana meme coin currently in presale – straight to the moon and beyond. That’s because Snorter is the only crypto project right now aiming to tackle the problem of whale dominance in Solana’s meme coin trading space. At the moment, big-money players armed with advanced trading tools and algorithms scoop up nearly all the liquidity in newly listed meme coins, leaving retail participants with little to no share of those early meme coin pumps. Snorter’s new Telegram trading bot changes the game by letting you place buy/sell orders in advance. It then automatically executes those trades the moment liquidity arrives, undercutting institutional traders and restoring parity. Even better, you don’t have to worry about jealous traders you outrun, thanks to Snorter’s airtight security stack. It includes protections against rug pulls, honeypots, front-running, and even sophisticated sandwich attacks. Buying $SNORT further unlocks a bunch of exclusive perks, including: No daily sniping limits Advanced analytics for better trading decisions Reduced trading fees: just 0.85% compared to 1.50% charged to non-holders Staking rewards, currently yielding an impressive 125% 1 $SNORT is currently priced at just $0.1033, and the project has in total raised over $3.7M so far. According to our $SNORT price prediction , the token could hit $0.94 by the end of 2025 alone – a whopping 800% gain from current levels. Visit Snorter Token’s official website for more information. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Powering a New Crypto Wallet That’s Both Secure & User-Friendly Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is also likely to see a huge surge in popularity – and therefore price – alongside the growth of Solana and the broader crypto market. Why? Because it’s the native cryptocurrency of Best Wallet , a new free crypto wallet that’s not only super-secure but also incredibly easy to use, making it an ideal choice for both experts and beginners. As a top non-custodial wallet , no one but you can access your private keys. That means your funds remain fully under your control and safe from malicious intervention. And it doesn’t stop there. Best Wallet comes with robust safeguards against scams, hacks, and phishing sites, plus top-tier 2FA options, including biometric login. Best Wallet is also redefining usability with its unique Presale Aggregator section, which lets you buy the best crypto presales directly within the app. While other wallets force you to visit external presale sites, connect your wallet there, and then return to authorize the transaction, Best Wallet makes the entire process seamless, simplifying the way you spot and buy under-the-radar presale gems like no other. Why buy $BEST ? A potential 2,323% ROI by the end of 2026, according to our $BEST price prediction Voting rights on key platform decisions Reduced trading and gas fees Staking rewards, currently offering 86% Early access to new meme coins in presale Currently in presale, $BEST has already gathered a brain-melting $15.5M in early investor funding, and each token is available for just $0.025585. Check out Best Wallet Token’s official website to learn more. 3. Comedian ($BAN) – Viral Meme Coin Preparing for a Massive Rally Comedian ($BAN) , like Unstable Coin ($USDUC), relies more on virality and the crypto community’s blessings than on intrinsic value, a game-changing mission, or staking mechanisms. Based on the controversial art piece featuring a banana taped to a wall, $BAN has ridden the traction created by the debate around modern art: whether it’s revolutionary or just plain stupid. The token is already up over 59% in the last month, but that could be just the start of a far more explosive rally. According to classic technical analysis, $BAN has only just begun its breakout after escaping a long-drawn descending triangle pattern – a harsh consolidation phase that lasted more than nine months. If this pattern plays out, $BAN could be headed to $1.419360, representing an eye-popping 1,300% gain from its current price of $0.1009. Final Thoughts With Solana poised for a run-up to $400 (a 92% move from current levels) in the weeks ahead, the stage is set for low-cap, high-upside Solana coins to rocket to the moon. When we asked ChatGPT about its top crypto picks right now, the AI quickly pointed us toward Snorter Token ($SNORT) , Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , and Comedian ($BAN). That said, kindly remember that crypto investments are highly risky due to the market’s volatility and uncertainty.

The asset trades below $4,500 resistance as smaller whales buy, but stronger momentum may require more. BitMine and new wallets bought $349M ETH, showing strong interest despite slower ETF inflows. Market Caught Between Two Whale Groups Ethereum’s price is being shaped by diverging whale behavior. Wallets holding over 10,000 ETH, referred to as mega whales, played a major role in the August rally. On-chain data shows these wallets added more than 2 million ETH during that time. Their activity has now slowed, with no significant accumulation seen in recent weeks. In contrast, wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH have resumed buying. After weeks of outflows in July, these large whales have added about 400,000 ETH over the past month. This shift has brought balance to the market, with smaller investors stepping in while the larger ones hold back. $ETH price is now caught between two whale groups and that balance could decide the next market move. Mega whales (10k+ ETH) drove August’s rally with more than 2M ETH added, but their buying has stopped. Large whales (1k–10k ETH), after weeks of selling, have turned back… pic.twitter.com/tOWqX8DUj0 — Cas Abbé (@cas_abbe) September 4, 2025 ETH Price Trading Below Key Resistance The price of Ethereum was $4,420 at the time of writing. Trading volume in the last 24 hours stands at $31.6 billion. ETH is up 1% on the day but remains down 4% over the past week. Cas Abbé noted that, “$ETH price is now caught between two whale groups and that balance could decide the next market move.” If smaller whales continue to buy and mega whales stay quiet, the price may hold, but upward momentum could weaken. A return of larger buyers could support another rally. Abbé also pointed out recent whale activity across the network. BitMine Digital acquired more than 14,000 ETH, worth $62.4 million. At the same time, three new wallets purchased 65,662 ETH through FalconX, totaling $287 million. “ETF inflows have definitely slowed down for $ETH but whales are still buying non-stop,” he shared. Interestingly, these transactions suggest ongoing interest from large players, even as institutional inflows ease. Whether this buying will be enough to push ETH above its current resistance remains uncertain. Key Levels to Watch According to Lennaert Snyder, Ethereum failed to break through the $4,500 resistance. This level remains the barrier for bullish continuation . He also pointed out that long entries should be considered only after clean reversals from lower support. $ETH rejected key $4,500 resistance as posted yesterday. Congrats to everyone who took the short! $4,500 remains the level to gain for bullish continuation. Longing Ethereum at lower support after reversals only. Remember, losing support triggers continuation shorts. pic.twitter.com/Gr3xlzJnnt — Lennaert Snyder (@LennaertSnyder) September 4, 2025 Support zones to monitor include $4,274 and $4,213. A move below these levels may trigger further downside. Additional support sits near $4,080 and in the $3,900–$3,600 area. The price action around these levels will help determine ETH’s short-term direction.

It’s teamed up with Indomobil Group, one of Indonesia’s largest companies, to launch an educational portal for students. The program will allow up to 50,000 Indonesian students to verify their qualifications and pay for courses onchain. Founded in 1976, Indomobil Group is best known for its vehicle manufacturing, but it has its finger in many pies through the various publicly traded companies it oversees. Given its status within Indonesia, the company is understandably eager to demonstrate its ability to innovate and to embrace emerging technologies – particularly when there’s a direct benefit for Indonesian families. Optimizing Education Onchain The solution that Indomobil and Space and Time are developing takes full advantage of SXT Chain, including utilizing the network’s native token to pay for educational courses. The addressable market for this is huge, running to hundreds of millions of Indonesians, even if a modest 50,000 students have been targeted initially. While students who participate in the program will need to have a modicum of knowledge of how blockchain works, this shouldn’t prove an obstacle: Indonesia is the third-largest crypto market by user base , where primary use cases – aside from trading – include DeFi and remittances. If the Indomobil program proves a success, education can be added to that list. As for Space and Time , whose infrastructure the pilot is being built upon, it adds another string to their bow. The blockchain for ZK-proven data is geared towards enterprise and AI use cases, but as the Indomobil collaboration shows, it can equally be purposed for initiatives such as education that carry an element of social good. As Jusak Kertowidjojo, President Director of Indomobil Group concludes, “We’re pleased to leverage Space and Time to support a model that reduces friction for students and families while improving how payments are managed across the system.” Learning Levels Up On the one hand, Indonesia boasts a highly tech-savvy population of over 270 million and smartphone penetration is high. But on the other hand, it has the fourth-largest unbanked population in the world, which can be attributed to factors including its challenging and remote island geography. One of the ways in which lack of access to banking affects millions of Indonesians is when it comes to education. In order to get their children into higher education, families must typically pay cash to local schools, which passes the funds on to education providers via intermediaries. It’s a framework that’s ripe for disruption, if only to help Indonesian families save money and their progeny to start learning more quickly. Blockchain is ideally suited to disintermediation, allowing funds to be sent directly to educational bodies from student families. But there’s also another blockchain property that also lends itself well to this particular program: transparency. The solution being developed by Space and Time and Indomobil will provide a transparent record of payments and course completion as well as qualifications – which should prove invaluable once students seek to gain their first foothold on the employment ladder.

An address widely linked to Tron (TRX) founder Justin Sun has recently moved a substantial sum of digital assets, catching the eye of on-chain observers. This movement involves 50 million WLFI tokens, valued at approximately $9.12 million, and has sparked considerable discussion within the crypto community. What’s the Latest on This Crucial Justin Sun Crypto Transfer? According to findings from the reputable on-chain analysis firm Onchain Lens, the funds were directed to a brand new address. This firm also suggested that these assets are likely destined for the HTX exchange. Such large-scale movements are always closely monitored, as they can often signal upcoming strategic shifts or market activities. The asset in question, WLFI, has seen some volatility following the news. CoinMarketCap data indicates that WLFI is currently trading at $0.1804, experiencing a notable drop of 20.98% over the past 24 hours. This immediate market reaction underscores the influence of prominent figures like Justin Sun in the crypto space. Why Are Justin Sun’s Crypto Transfers Always Under the Microscope? Justin Sun is a well-known figure with significant holdings and influence across various blockchain projects, including Tron and the HTX exchange, where he serves as an advisor. Therefore, any major Justin Sun crypto transfer naturally draws intense scrutiny from investors, analysts, and the broader crypto community. Observers often look for clues within these transactions: Market Sentiment: Large transfers can sometimes precede major market events or indicate a change in strategy by a whale. Exchange Activity: Deposits to exchanges might suggest an intent to sell, providing liquidity, or participating in exchange-related activities. Ecosystem Health: Such movements can also be part of broader ecosystem rebalancing or support initiatives for specific projects. Understanding the Impact: What Does This Mean for WLFI and HTX? The transfer of 50 million WLFI, worth over $9 million, is not a trivial sum. For WLFI, the immediate 20% price decline suggests that market participants are reacting cautiously, possibly fearing a potential sell-off if the funds are indeed deposited to an exchange like HTX. For HTX, the potential deposit could represent increased liquidity or a strategic move related to the exchange’s operations. Given Sun’s close ties to HTX, such a transfer might be perceived as an internal asset management decision rather than a typical user deposit. However, the exact purpose remains speculative until further confirmation emerges. The Power of On-Chain Analysis in Tracking Crypto Whales This event highlights the invaluable role of on-chain analysis firms like Onchain Lens. Their ability to track and interpret transactions provides a layer of transparency in an otherwise pseudonymous market. By analyzing wallet addresses and transaction patterns, these firms offer crucial insights into the movements of large holders, often referred to as “whales.” Such transparency is vital for: Detecting potential market manipulation. Understanding market dynamics and liquidity flows. Informing investment decisions by providing early signals. The ongoing monitoring of significant transactions, like this recent Justin Sun crypto transfer , helps to keep the community informed and allows for more educated speculation about future market trends. In conclusion, the recent $9.1 million Justin Sun crypto transfer of WLFI tokens to a new address, potentially linked to HTX, is a noteworthy event that has already impacted WLFI’s market price. While the precise intentions behind this massive movement remain unconfirmed, it underscores the critical importance of on-chain analysis in deciphering the actions of influential figures within the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape. Staying informed about these developments is key for anyone navigating the digital asset markets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Justin Sun?

Speaking at the European Systemic Risk Board conference, Lagarde warned that multi-issuance schemes allow EU and non-EU entities to jointly issue fungible stablecoins while only EU operations face regulatory requirements. Euro Stablecoins Struggle as Dollar Dominates Global Markets The warning comes as euro-backed stablecoins capture merely 0.15% of the $230 billion global market, with USD-pegged tokens accounting for 99% of stablecoin capitalization. Sources: ECB ECB advisor Jürgen Schaaf had previously cautioned that widespread adoption of dollar stablecoins could weaken European monetary control and financial sovereignty. Lagarde identified critical vulnerabilities in the current MiCA implementation, where investors would naturally prefer to redeem stablecoins in jurisdictions with the strongest safeguards during crisis periods. EU-held reserves may prove insufficient to meet concentrated redemption demand, which creates systemic risks reminiscent of traditional banking liquidity mismatches. The ECB chief demanded European legislation ensure multi-issuance schemes cannot operate without robust equivalence regimes in other jurisdictions and safeguards for asset transfers between EU and non-EU entities. Her intervention follows mounting pressure to accelerate digital euro development after the United States’ comprehensive stablecoin legislation, the GENIUS Act . ECB advisor warns Europe risks losing monetary sovereignty as euro-denominated stablecoins capture just 0.15% of $230 billion global stablecoin market. #Europe #Stablecoin https://t.co/ztXdNdvv1C — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 29, 2025 MiCA Loopholes Create “Path of Least Resistance” for Financial Risk Lagarde used a submarine metaphor to emphasize how financial risks seek the easiest routes through regulatory gaps, regardless of technological innovation. “ Without a level global playing field, risks will always seek the path of least resistance ,” she stated at the Frankfurt conference. The specific vulnerability involves multi-issuance arrangements where EU-licensed entities and offshore partners jointly issue interchangeable stablecoins. MiCA requirements apply only to European operations , resulting in asymmetric regulatory coverage within single-token systems. During market stress, investors would logically concentrate redemption requests in EU jurisdictions where MiCA prohibits redemption fees and mandates par value redemptions. However, Lagarde highlighted that reserve allocation may not match this redemption flow pattern, potentially triggering liquidity shortfalls. Banking groups already face consolidated liquidity requirements that ensure reserve availability across all operational levels through net stable funding ratios and liquidity coverage standards. Stablecoin multi-issuance schemes will replicate identical risks without equivalent regulatory oversight. The European Commission previously clarified that companies could treat tokens as fungible across jurisdictions if EU-licensed entities participate. However, the ECB warned that this approach risks undermining EU strategic autonomy by allowing non-EU redemption pressure to drain European reserves. Lagarde emphasized that regulatory principles remain constant despite technological evolution. “ The categories of risk they create are not new. They are risks long familiar to supervisors and regulators ,” she noted regarding stablecoin innovations. Digital Euro Acceleration Targets US Stablecoin Dominance Challenge European officials accelerated digital euro planning after Trump signed the GENIUS Act, establishing comprehensive dollar stablecoin regulations. The swift US action unsettled EU policymakers who had pursued more cautious development approaches for their central bank digital currency project. Current debates center on whether digital euros should operate on public blockchains , such as Ethereum, or private, ECB-controlled ledgers. Public blockchain advocates argue for broader circulation possibilities, while critics cite concerns about privacy and transaction exposure risks. European officials are fast-tracking the digital euro, weighing Ethereum or Solana, as pressure mounts to keep pace with US progress in digital currencies. #DigitalEuro #ethereum #Solana https://t.co/vMzIfEMIdu — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 22, 2025 Some policymakers believe that open blockchain digital euros could strengthen the currency’s reach beyond European borders. At the current speed of growth, dollar stablecoin integration into mainstream payment systems by Visa and Mastercard already threatens European financial control. Major US retailers, including Walmart and Amazon, are exploring stablecoin adoption for high-volume transactions, which means some payment flows may occur outside traditional banking infrastructure. Notably, Deutsche Bank, Galaxy Digital, and Flow Traders launched EURAU as Europe’s first MiCA-compliant euro stablecoin . However, its impact remains minimal given current market scale disparities. Lagarde concluded that international cooperation remains indispensable for effective regulation while maintaining that traditional risk management principles can address emerging challenges through updated application methods.

While it has since recovered, the subsequent change in crowd sentiment around the asset may open up a potential buying opportunity. Hidden Buying Opportunity While retail traders have historically fueled short-term price moves with bouts of “greed” (overwhelming bullish commentary leading to pullbacks) and “fear” (bearish commentary sparking rallies), the latest data by Santiment flagged the most bearish crowd sentiment in five months. With a bullish-to-bearish commentary ratio of just 1:5:1, ADA sentiment has flipped sharply negative compared to its usual optimism. Interestingly, this contrarian setup has already aligned with ADA rebounding 5%, climbing from $0.78 to $0.819 in a span of two days. Santiment explained that prices often move against retail expectations. As such, when impatient traders sell off during downswings, larger stakeholders tend to accumulate, which helps in fueling recoveries. For patient holders and dip buyers, ongoing retail pessimism could prove to be a positive signal for further upside. This sentiment coincides with technical signals pointing to renewed strength. Bullish Setup for Cardano A popular analyst ‘Crypto King,’ pointed out that ADA is currently shaping a bullish pattern. His analysis found that the token is currently trading in an ascending channel pattern, with price action steadily climbing toward resistance levels. The key takeaway is that ADA looks primed to make a quick move past the $1 mark if momentum continues. The price could also be drawn toward higher levels with the next zones of interest appearing around $1.20 and $1.40. ADA has also triggered a buy signal on the TD Sequential, an indicator for spotting trend reversals. This development means that bearish momentum may be fading, which could potentially set ADA up for a fresh leg higher if buying pressure builds. Meanwhile, analytics platform TapTools observed that ADA has quietly outperformed several major cryptocurrencies over the past 90 days, as it delivered a gain of more than 25%. This performance puts it ahead of Dogecoin (DOGE), Sui (SUI), Bitcoin (BTC), and Tron (TRX) during the same period.

The decline's become a little more pronounced since midnight UTC, with a drop of about 0.9%. For the broader market, the CoinDesk 20 Index has fallen 1.3% since midnight, with all but one component heading south. XRP (XRP) is the only token in the green, and that's up less than 0.1%. The negative sentiment is echoed in the options and perpetual futures markets. Perpetual funding rates have dropped and put options, or protection against price declines, dominating over calls. More than $4.5 billion in options is set to expire on Deribit on Friday, alongside the U.S. jobs report for August. ""Open interest is tilted toward puts, with notable clustering around the $105,000 to $110,000 strikes, suggesting downside protection remains a key theme,"" the derivatives exchange said in a post on X. Derivatives Positioning BTC derivatives positioning has cooled, activity is still there however, with momentum and directional conviction looking muted rather than stagnant. Open interest in perpetual futures across major venues has dropped from the recent peak near $33 billion to about $30 billion. At the same time, the three-month annualized basis keeps compressing to roughly 5%–6% across Binance, OKX and Deribit, leaving the carry trade only marginally profitable. Options data is sending mixed signals. While the upward-sloping implied volatility curve suggests the market expects long-term volatility to be higher than short-term, other metrics point to a more immediate bearish outlook. Specifically, the 25 delta skew continues to be either flat or slightly negative, with traders paying a premium for puts over calls to gain downside protection. This short-term bearish sentiment is contradicted by 24-hour put call volume, with calls (63%) dominating options contracts for BTC. Funding rate APRs across major perpetual swap venues are little changed around 4%-6% annualized, according to Velo data. Hyperliquid is the only exchange with a rate higher than 6% for BTC, reflecting a pocket of stronger long-term interest relative to other exchanges. Overall, funding dynamics suggest a stable market with isolated signs of froth, rather than broad directional conviction. Coinglass data shows $225 million in 24-hour liquidations, with a 50-50 split between longs and shorts. ETH ($65million), BTC ($46 million) and others ($19 million) were the leaders in terms of notional liquidations. The Binance liquidation heatmap indicates $110,250 as a core liquidation level to monitor, in case of a price drop. Token Talk By Oliver Knight Donald Trump-linked DeFi token word liberty financial (WLFI) slumped to a record low $0.174 on Thursday as the token's popularity begins to fade just days after its trading debut . The 21% daily drawdown can be attributed to a number of factors, notably the fact that some token holders are still in profit after purchasing during the token sale. These holders will be tempted to lock in their profits as hype around the project fades. One trader made $250 million after buying $15 million during the sale, another lost $2.2 million after going long on WLFI futures. While WLFI is linked to the U.S. president, in terms of development and innovation, there's nothing obvious to differentiate it from the thousands of other DeFi-themed tokens. As a result traders may be inclined to jump ship until they see development of the project. ""WLFI team, stop sleeping and start taking action. The community is already angry, at least don’t lose the last remaining investors,"" one holder wrote on X . The chart looks eerily similar to the TRUMP memecoin that was released in January. After a period of initial upside, TRUMP lost 89% of its value and daily volume dwindled from $39 billion on opening day to just $210 million in the past 24 hours. In an attempt to quell the selling pressure, the project revealed on X that WLFI held by the team would not be sold on the open market, stating that every token in the treasury would be subject to governance and not the team's discretion. The tweet failed to stem the decline, and prices continued to tumble shortly after.

The pattern comes from monitoring Coinbase, which represents U.S. action and Asian activity on Binance. Bitcoin has been experiencing volatility recently, with significant price movements that have seen its value surpass $111,000. Usually, these price actions are triggered by whales, but analysts now claim things have changed now that institutions have gotten involved. What is influencing BTC’s recent price movements? In the past, whales and ETF flows contributed largely to BTC’s price movements, but in recent months, that has changed, with the price action now determined more by regional liquidity. According to a CryptoQuant report, on-chain and exchange data have revealed a new pattern that involves Asia sparking the initial move, while the U.S. decides whether it lasts. The analysts monitored activity on two exchanges, Coinbase and Binance, with Coinbase representing U.S. action and Binance signaling Asian activity. Outflow from Coinbase Prime is a classic signal of U.S. institutions transferring BTC into custody—long-term accumulation. The Coinbase Premium Index (CPI), which tracks the price gap between Coinbase (USD) and Binance (USDT), confirms this theory because when it stays positive, U.S. demand usually leads the momentum. Also, it has been historically proven that rallies that coincide with a positive CPI tend to stick. Binance flows are different as they tend to reflect Asian retail and trading activity, with heavy inflows often preceding sell pressure, while outflows suggest dip-buying. The Korea Premium Index (KPI)—famously called the “Kimchi Premium”—is the CPI’s counterpart and captures local sentiment. Moderate readings (+1% to +3%) show healthy demand, while levels above +5% often mark speculative overheating and short-term tops. When these metrics are overlaid with price, a tug-of-war emerges. As such, analysts have observed that when CPI and KPI flash green simultaneously, global demand is synchronized and rallies explode. However, when U.S. players take profits while Asian traders keep buying, the dynamic shifts across time zones, creating volatility and sharp swings. Essentially, this means Asia often lights the fire, but America decides whether it turns into an inferno. For a rally to happen in Q4, the Coinbase Premium will have to turn decisively positive while Asia continues to absorb supply. Otherwise, we may be in for more bearish price action. Cooling BTC demand or non-stop accumulation? Bitcoin currently trades under $112K, and has been consolidating between $104K and $116K with the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) showing investors accumulated in the $108K–$116K range, filling the air gap. The volatility is on the rise, forcing many to wonder if this is the start of a bear market or just a short-term contraction. According to Glassnode, the recent price action highlights constructive dip-buying but does not rule out further contraction. Short-term Bitcoin holders in profit chart. Source: Glassnode Data also shows that while short-term holder profitability dropped sharply to 42% during the selloff, it has rebounded to 60% which leaves the market neutral but fragile, with renewed momentum only guaranteed should the price reclaim $114K–$116K. At the same time, off-chain sentiment is cooling. Futures funding has remained neutral but vulnerable, while ETF inflows have declined sharply. Bitcoin ETF flows were primarily directional spot demand, while Ethereum flows reflected a mix of spot demand and cash-and-carry arbitrage. So, have we entered a bear market? Not exactly. BTC will need to reclaim the $114K–$116K level to restore broad short-term holders’ profitability and strengthen the bull case. However, if the worst happens and a breakdown below $104K happens, we could see a repeat of prior exhaustion phases, with a potential downside toward $93K–$95K. Get seen where it counts.

The token is consolidating between $0.82 and $0.90, with analysts predicting it still has a higher room to grow. The ADA price forecast shows a possible push to $1.20 in the coming weeks. However, the token, like the rest of the crypto market, will have to break the bear pressures keeping the price under. Alongside ADA, MAGACOIN FINANCE is also earning analysts’ spotlight as a hidden gem crypto to watch in 2025. Latest ADA Price Action Cardano has traded sideways after a volatile August, holding firm near $0.82. Early September forecasts place ADA in the $0.80–$0.83 zone, supported by a rising channel and falling wedge pattern. The Cardano price prediction shows RSI hovering around 44–47, signaling neutral momentum before a possible breakout. Analyst Insights and Key Levels Experts agree ADA needs to break $0.88 to confirm a bullish rally. Short-term targets sit at $1.05, while upside projections stretch to $1.20–$1.23 if momentum continues. On the downside, support at $0.78 is preventing deeper pullbacks. Institutional interest, ETF filings, and ADA whale buying reinforce long-term optimism. Upcoming events such as the Chang hard fork and Leios CIP upgrades also add strength to the ADA price forecast 2025, boosting scalability narratives that attract developers and investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Hidden Gem Crypto in Focus While Cardano gathers momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing market attention as one of the best altcoins to watch. Analysts describe it as a breakout altcoin project that will remain relevant into the future. Investors who have been in the market understand that the real value is in hidden gem cryptos with long-term potential . Part of the factors driving MAGACOIN FINANCE’s upward push is its cultural appeal and transparent governance model. The project has earned a reputation as one of the safe bets for crypto investors in 2025. With demand surging and thousands of investors buying daily, analysts predict MAGACOIN FINANCE could hit $5 by the end of 2026. For smart investors, that is a clear signal to get in before the market does. Bottom Line Cardano’s resilience despite the bear market continues to excite its holders. Now with the ADA price forecast predicting a possible upside push in the coming weeks, the token is clearly one of the undervalued gems to accumulate as the market recovers.

Specifically, the average monthly returns show that XRP could even record double-digit gains. Average Monthly Returns Point To Notable Gains For The XRP Price Cryptorank data shows that the XRP price has historically recorded an average monthly return of 13.8% in September. This suggests that the altcoin could again record positive returns this time around, especially as it looks to reclaim the psychological $3 level. Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that the altcoin has closed the last three Septembers in the green. Related Reading: Is XRP A Meme Coin? Analyst Reveals How Whales Are Playing The Game In September 2022, the XRP price recorded a gain of 46.2%, its largest over the past 4 years. It also saw an increase of almost 8% in September 2023. The altcoin has so far recorded a gain of nearly 3% this month and looks on course to replicate its historical positive performance in September. Notably, there are bullish fundamentals that could spark a run for the XRP price. This includes the projected 25 basis points (bps) rate cut that the Fed is expected to make at the September 17 FOMC meeting. There is currently a 99.7% chance that the Fed will make this cut, according to CME FedWatch data. A Fed rate cut is bullish for altcoins, including XRP, as it could lead to increased risk-on sentiment among investors and cause more liquidity to flow into these assets. Meanwhile, the XRP ETFs are expected to receive the SEC’s nod in October, and given the market’s forward-looking nature, the XRP price could rally in anticipation of this occurrence next month. The ETFs are expected to attract new capital into the altcoin’s ecosystem. XRP Eyes Rally To $3.40 In an X post, crypto analyst Egrag Crypto predicted that the XRP price could rally to around $3.40. He noted that with the altcoin currently trading at around $2.877, all eyes are on how it will perform around this level. If XRP closes above $3.077, the analyst stated that it could increase the chance of breaching the $3.40 mark.

His accompanying chart showed that XRP could claim this $6 range this month. Meanwhile, in another X post, Egrag Crypto said that the range of $3.077 to $3.13 is a key area, as a strong close above it with high volume could pave the way for the next move. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.85, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

For those searching for the next crypto to explode, it is no longer about hype or ambitious roadmaps alone. What separates true contenders is real adoption and measurable progress. Some projects are already delivering value before listing on exchanges, while others have cemented their place through loyal communities or infrastructure that powers billions in transactions. BlockDAG, SHIB, DOGE, and TRON stand out in 2025 because they are producing results rather than promises. BlockDAG (BDAG): Strongest Candidate for the Next Crypto to Explode BlockDAG is proving that success does not have to wait until a mainnet goes live. Its biggest advantage lies in the X1 Miner App, now boasting more than 3 million global users. Anyone can earn BDAG daily with a single tap, eliminating the need for costly mining rigs or technical expertise. The app uses a Proof-of-Engagement model, rewarding people for consistent interaction, referrals, and learning modules in the built-in Academy. This system shifts focus from energy consumption to active participation, creating broader accessibility. Many are already earning up to 20 BDAG each day without upfront expenses. What makes BlockDAG even more compelling is its presale performance. With more than 25.9 billion BDAG sold and $395 million raised, momentum is undeniable. To mark the countdown to the BlockDAG Deployment Event, the presale transitioned to a final $0.0013 price until October 1, offering investors one last straightforward chance to join. Additional proof points include $7.8 million in miner hardware sales and 19,594 miners sold, showing real demand across its ecosystem. Unlike projects that rely on speculation after launch, BlockDAG is creating tangible results now. With its mix of accessibility, adoption, and fundraising strength, it makes a strong case as the next crypto to explode in 2025. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Meme Coin Building Real Substance Once seen as a meme-driven project, Shiba Inu has been adding new layers of value. The release of Shiba Hub, a platform linking SHIB to decentralized applications and NFT services, is giving users more ways to interact within its ecosystem. On-chain data supports this progress. Wallet activity has climbed steadily, and the SHIB burn rate increased after a recent upgrade, which helps reduce supply. As of late August, SHIB trades around $0.000022, reflecting a 15 percent rise in one month. Both retail communities and some larger market players are paying closer attention again. Its Layer 2 network, Shibarium, continues to expand with active development and integration. Dogecoin (DOGE): Community Strength Keeps It Alive Dogecoin has shown remarkable endurance over the years. After dipping below $0.10 earlier this summer, DOGE rebounded and now trades around $0.118. Renewed mentions from Elon Musk and a test integration with X (formerly Twitter) have fueled fresh interest. While it lacks frequent technical upgrades, its status as the original meme coin still carries weight. Several retail outlets and online platforms have reintroduced DOGE as a payment method, citing ease of use and name recognition. The broader market backdrop also works in its favor. When conditions turn uncertain, traders often rotate back to coins with strong liquidity and loyal communities. TRON (TRX): Utility Driving Global Adoption TRON has become one of the most widely used networks for stablecoin transactions, particularly in Asia and Africa. Its low fees and reliable infrastructure support more than $60 billion in USDT transfers each month, a figure that continues to hold strong. TRX is priced around $0.088, holding support after gaining 12 percent in August. Beyond the price, TRON’s ability to attract DeFi developers sets it apart. Even as newer blockchains struggle to onboard projects, TRON’s reliability and cost efficiency keep builders engaged. Regular updates from Justin Sun and consistent activity from TRON DAO maintain visibility. While it may not generate the same hype as meme coins, its infrastructure role makes it essential in emerging markets. Looking Past the Launch The idea that value must start after a token lists on exchanges is being challenged. BlockDAG’s X1 App shows that traction can begin well before trading begins, giving it an edge in building early conviction. At the same time, SHIB and DOGE continue to prove the staying power of meme coins when combined with active communities and growing utility. TRON’s role in global payment flows demonstrates why infrastructure projects still matter. Together, these four projects highlight different paths to success, but all share one quality: they are proving their worth through real action. For those seeking the next crypto to explode , this is where the strongest signals are appearing in 2025.

51178881,https://timestabloid.com/?p=81692,1756987252,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Trending Crypto News: Solana Aims for $223, Chainlink Breaks Out, & BlockDAG’s Bold $600M Presale Gains Speed",https://timestabloid.com/trending-crypto-news-solana-aims-for-223-chainlink-breaks-out/,"Crypto sentiment is warming up again, and a few names are commanding the spotlight. Solana is pressing toward a new resistance level. Chainlink is showing signs of a breakout after clearing a key neckline. And then there’s BlockDAG(BDAG) , a Layer 1 upstart aiming to raise $600 million through retail alone, a move that’s shaking up traditional funding models in the blockchain space. While Solana and Chainlink rely on technical setups and trading activity, BlockDAG is gathering momentum from the ground up. With over $391 million already secured and more than 30 batches sold, its model is fast earning it a spot among the top trending crypto projects of the year. Solana Price Forecast: Momentum Points to a $223 Test Solana (SOL) has seen impressive movement, reaching $211 before pulling back slightly. On-chain signals suggest there’s still gas in the tank. One whale moved 20,000 SOL, which is roughly $4 million off Kraken and into DeFi platforms, later shifting funds to OKX. That kind of strategic movement implies long positioning rather than panic exits. Futures open interest has climbed to $12.9 billion, and the long/short ratio of 1.02 shows bulls holding the line. Technical signals echo this sentiment. The Directional Movement Index (DMI) just showed a bullish crossover, and the Relative Vigor Index (RVGI) is pointing higher. Both suggest upward momentum could stick. Still, exchange inflows have reached a three-month high, often a warning sign of profit-taking. Analysts suggest that if SOL maintains strength, a test of $223 could happen before month’s end. If pressure mounts, however, a retracement to $186–$190 is on the table. LINK Technical Analysis: Bullish Pattern Puts $56 in Play Chainlink (LINK) continues to push higher, rising 3.3% over the last week and trading above $25. Volume is backing the move, with over $1.16 billion in 24-hour trades, a number that shows sustained trader interest. The standout signal? A clean breakout above an inverse head-and-shoulders neckline at $22. This pattern often precedes major upward runs, and analysts now point to targets near $38.50 in the short term, and as high as $56, a price last seen during its 2021 surge. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains at 63, showing strong momentum without being in overbought territory. Meanwhile, open interest in derivatives markets has climbed to $1.82 billion. All of these factors indicate that traders aren’t just watching LINK, they’re positioning for more upside. Chainlink’s growing presence in real-world asset integration and decentralized data infrastructure only strengthens its case in this rally. Why BlockDAG’s $600M Push Could Redefine How Crypto Projects Launch BlockDAG is gearing up for a defining milestone with its Deployment Event in Singapore, a launch crafted to highlight its independence and momentum. Instead of tying its visibility to outside platforms, the team has taken charge by creating its own flagship gathering, positioning BlockDAG as a project that controls its own narrative. Partnering with Coinstore, a leading global exchange, the event will showcase BlockDAG’s hybrid technology, growing ecosystem, and rapidly expanding community. More than a simple product reveal, this Deployment Event represents a bold statement: BlockDAG is ready to scale on a global level. By demonstrating adoption, innovation, and market readiness in one cohesive platform, the team is signaling confidence in its ability to lead the next phase of blockchain growth. As they put it, “We own the spotlight,” a clear reflection of their determination to set the pace as deployment draws near. To complement this milestone, BlockDAG has introduced a special presale price of $0.0013 per BDAG, replacing its former bonus-based system with a flat-rate model designed for fairness and simplicity. This limited offer will remain valid for 30 days leading up to deployment, giving both early and new investors a final opportunity to secure allocations before BlockDAG’s official launch. By eliminating tiered bonus structures, the project ensures transparency and equal access across the board, while avoiding last-minute speculation that often disrupts presales. With more than $395 million already raised and a community of over 3 million miners, BlockDAG is proving it can deliver scale before launch. The Deployment Event will mark the start of its next growth era, merging visibility, adoption, and opportunity into one defining moment. Final Word Solana continues to hold strength on its charts, with the $223 target still in play. However, rising exchange inflows suggest many traders may be preparing to secure profits. Chainlink, meanwhile, has delivered a convincing breakout supported by technical setups and growing optimism, but its movement still mirrors the trading cycles seen in previous bull runs. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is breaking from the pattern. Its funding model targets $600 million raised directly from the community, avoiding the heavy reliance on venture capital that shapes most launches. Its presale framework prioritizes everyday participants with clear, accessible opportunities, rather than limiting early gains to insiders. Even before listing, BlockDAG’s developer ecosystem is already active, building dApps and tools that will run on its hybrid DAG + PoW infrastructure. Currently available at a special $0.0013 limited-time presale rate, BlockDAG offers one of the most attractive entry points before launch. With a confirmed listing target of $0.05, this pricing creates exceptional upside potential. Early participants from Batch 1 at $0.001 have already seen gains of 2,900%, and now newcomers can still lock in massive growth as the deployment phase approaches. In a market where community-backed initiatives are gaining real traction, BlockDAG is positioning itself as more than just another presale. With capital, adoption, and development all advancing ahead of launch, it’s emerging as the project setting the benchmark. For those scanning the top trending crypto opportunities of 2025, BlockDAG is shaping up not just as a contender, but potentially the new standard.

A Eurozone central bank digital currency (CBDC) could provide business continuity in the event of a cyberattack on banks or other payment providers, Cipollone said at the European Parliament in Brussels on Thursday. ""If a cyberattack caused the outage of a bank’s own app, but the bank’s backend services were still functioning, customers would still be able to access their accounts with that bank through the ECB’s digital euro app,"" he said. Furthermore, if a digtal euro app had offline functionality, it could provide a failsafe for users during a power outage that takes regular methods of payment offline. ""Cash is our only true fallback...but as society increasingly moves away from cash, and as cash itself may be difficult to access in emergencies, we need to complement it with a digital version,"" Cipollone added. The ECB, like its counterparts in almost every other economy around the world, has been exploring the possibilities of a digital version of its currency for a number of years . Among their motivations are addressing the competition provided by stablecoins and non-bank payment services such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal and so on.",Policy|Digital Euro|CBDC|Euro|European Union|EU|Outages|News,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|FIAT|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-04 12:04:17

According to the analysis, XRP is consolidating within a descending wedge, a well-known bullish pattern, and a breakout could unlock one of the largest upward moves the token has seen in years. Technical Setup: Wedge Pattern Points to a Breakout The chart shared by CryptoSensei highlights a descending wedge formation that has been compressing XRP’s price action over the past several months. Typically, descending wedges signal exhaustion in selling pressure and precede upward breakouts when supported by rising volume. On XRP’s daily and four-hour charts, the wedge is nearing its apex, creating the conditions for a decisive move. If XRP breaks above the upper boundary with convincing volume, historical charting suggests a rally into the $4.50 to $5.20 range is possible. However, traders remain cautious, as weak or “thin” breakouts often collapse back inside the pattern before real momentum builds. #XRP chart signals a run toward $5?! with a spot ETF on the horizon! pic.twitter.com/6P9O9KV5VE — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) September 3, 2025 Current Market Position and Price Levels As of report time, XRP is trading at $2.84, which leaves about 76% upside to reach the $5 target outlined in CryptoSensei’s chart. XRP recently dropped from the $3 mark after weeks of consolidation, and technical analysts now point to $3.10 as the immediate resistance to clear. Beyond that, the next key hurdle is around $3.65 — the token’s newly set all-time high from July 2025 — before the projected $5 region comes into play. Overcoming this multi-level resistance will require substantial buying power to achieve such a large move. ETF Filings Provide a Fundamental Catalyst Powerful fundamental developments reinforce the bullish technical structure. Over the past weeks, six asset managers have filed amendments for their proposed spot XRP ETFs, while Grayscale submitted an entirely new application. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to deliver its decisions on these applications in October. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Adding to the optimism, the SEC recently issued procedural guidance that streamlines ETF reviews, suggesting a more favorable regulatory climate for digital asset investment products. If one or more spot XRP ETFs are approved, institutional participation and retail demand could significantly expand liquidity and drive the kind of volume needed to validate a wedge breakout. Ripple’s Legal Clouds Lift, Clearing the Path Another factor bolstering confidence in XRP’s outlook is the resolution of Ripple’s long-standing legal battle with the SEC. After years of uncertainty that weighed heavily on XRP’s U.S. market presence, both Ripple and the SEC withdrew their appeals in August 2025 . This closure eliminates a major overhang and opens the door for broader institutional adoption in the U.S. Balancing Hype With Realism While CryptoSensei’s chart provides a disciplined technical argument for XRP reaching $5, it is not a guaranteed outcome. Breakouts must be confirmed by strong, sustained volume, and the token will need to overcome multiple resistance levels along the way. Investors need to prepare for potential market swings, volatility, and retests triggered by ETF news and announcements. In summary, XRP sits at a critical junction. With a bullish wedge pattern aligning with upcoming ETF decisions and a cleared legal landscape, the $5 target is within the realm of possibility. But as always in crypto, confirmation — not speculation — should guide trading decisions. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

CEO Brian Armstrong revealed on Wednesday that more than 40% of the company’s code is now generated by AI, and he expects that figure to reach 50% within a month. “Obviously it needs to be reviewed and understood, and not all areas of the business can use AI-generated code. But we should be using it responsibly as much as we possibly can,” Armstrong wrote on X. He also shared a chart showing that the percentage of AI-generated code at Coinbase has more than doubled since April. The remarks come shortly after Coinbase announced plans to transform its workforce into “AI-Natives,” underscoring that it does not intend to replace its 4,200 employees with automation but rather equip them to work more efficiently with AI. AI Reshaping Engineering Culture Armstrong has been vocal about pushing engineers to embrace AI tools such as Copilot, Claude Code, and Cursor, which are now widely used across Coinbase’s engineering teams. He said the shift has allowed individual engineers to refactor, upgrade, and build new codebases in days—tasks that would have previously taken months. The CEO has also taken a tough stance against employees resistant to change. In a recent podcast appearance, Armstrong revealed he dismissed engineers who could not provide valid reasons for avoiding AI after he posted a company-wide mandate on Slack requiring its adoption. Despite concerns that AI will replace human jobs , Coinbase’s strategy suggests the opposite. The company sees AI as a way to streamline operations, improve productivity, and accelerate innovation rather than cut headcount. Coinbase Continues Hiring Coinbase is actively expanding its workforce even as much of the crypto sector remains cautious about hiring. According to its careers page, the firm has around 350 job openings, nearly half of which are engineering-related. Of those, 93 are back-end engineering roles, many of which explicitly mention AI in the job description. Customer experience roles account for the largest share of non-technical positions, with 56 openings currently listed. Although large-scale layoffs in crypto have slowed , recruiters note that hiring conditions remain tighter than in previous years. Some attribute this to AI drawing talent and investment away from traditional roles. Coinbase appears to be positioning itself at the forefront of the shift, betting that deep integration of AI will give it a lasting competitive edge.

This move marks a pivotal moment for investors seeking regulated and accessible pathways into the burgeoning cryptocurrency market. It offers a fresh opportunity to diversify portfolios with established digital assets and emerging technologies. Unlocking Investment Opportunities with Crypto ETPs on SIX Swiss Exchange For many, navigating the complexities of direct cryptocurrency investment can be daunting. This is where Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) become incredibly valuable. An ETP is a type of security that tracks an underlying asset, index, or financial instrument, trading on an exchange like a stock. Bitwise’s new listings on the SIX Swiss Exchange, a globally recognized platform, provide institutional and retail investors with a familiar and regulated structure to gain exposure to digital assets. The five new Crypto ETPs introduced by Bitwise are: Bitwise Core BTC ETP: Offers direct exposure to Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Bitwise ETH Staking ETP: Provides exposure to Ethereum and includes staking rewards, adding an income-generating component. Bitwise SOL Staking ETP: Similar to the ETH ETP, it offers exposure to Solana and its staking yield. Physical XRP ETP: Gives investors direct, physical exposure to XRP. Bitwise MSCI Digital Asset Select 20 ETP: A diversified product tracking the performance of a broad index of leading digital assets. These products are designed to simplify investment in the crypto space, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative world of blockchain. Why are Crypto ETPs Gaining Traction Among Investors? The increasing demand for Crypto ETPs isn’t surprising. They offer several compelling advantages over direct ownership of cryptocurrencies. Firstly, they provide a regulated investment vehicle, which can offer greater security and oversight compared to unregulated exchanges. This is particularly appealing to institutional investors and those new to the crypto market. Moreover, these ETPs offer diversification benefits. Instead of picking individual coins, investors can access a basket of digital assets, as seen with the Bitwise MSCI Digital Asset Select 20 ETP. This approach helps spread risk across a wider range of cryptocurrencies, potentially reducing volatility. The inclusion of staking ETPs for Ethereum and Solana is another innovative feature. Staking allows participants to earn rewards by locking up their cryptocurrencies to support the network’s operations. The Bitwise ETH and SOL Staking ETPs enable investors to potentially benefit from these rewards without the technical complexities of setting up and managing their own staking operations. This passive income potential makes these products particularly attractive in today’s market. Navigating the Digital Asset Landscape with Bitwise’s Crypto ETPs Bitwise’s strategic listings on the SIX Swiss Exchange underscore a growing trend: the institutional adoption of digital assets. As the cryptocurrency market matures, traditional financial infrastructure is increasingly adapting to accommodate these new asset classes. This integration is crucial for the long-term growth and stability of the crypto ecosystem. While the benefits are clear, investors should always consider the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Even with regulated products like Crypto ETPs , prices can fluctuate significantly. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the risks involved and aligning investments with personal financial goals is essential. Bitwise, with its expertise in digital asset management, aims to make this journey smoother for investors. The Bitwise MSCI Digital Asset Select 20 ETP is particularly noteworthy for its diversified approach. It offers exposure to a curated selection of leading digital assets, providing a comprehensive entry point into the broader market rather than focusing on a single coin. This strategic offering reflects a sophisticated understanding of investor needs in a rapidly evolving sector. Summary: A New Era for Crypto Investments The listing of five new Crypto ETPs by Bitwise on the SIX Swiss Exchange represents a landmark achievement. It significantly enhances accessibility and regulation for investors looking to participate in the digital asset revolution. From direct Bitcoin exposure to diversified baskets and staking opportunities, these products offer a robust framework for integrating cryptocurrencies into traditional investment portfolios. This development solidifies the position of digital assets as a legitimate and increasingly integral part of the global financial landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are Crypto ETPs? A1: Crypto ETPs (Exchange Traded Products) are financial instruments that track the price of one or more cryptocurrencies. They trade on traditional stock exchanges, offering investors regulated and often more convenient access to digital assets without directly owning the underlying cryptocurrency. Q2: Which specific Bitwise Crypto ETPs were listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange? A2: Bitwise listed five products: the Bitwise Core BTC ETP, Bitwise ETH Staking ETP, Bitwise SOL Staking ETP, Physical XRP ETP, and the Bitwise MSCI Digital Asset Select 20 ETP. Q3: What is the significance of listing these ETPs on the SIX Swiss Exchange? A3: The SIX Swiss Exchange is a highly reputable and regulated stock exchange. Listing ETPs there provides institutional-grade access and regulatory oversight, which can increase investor confidence and facilitate broader adoption of digital assets within traditional finance. Q4: How do staking ETPs work, and what are their benefits? A4: Staking ETPs, like the Bitwise ETH and SOL Staking ETPs, allow investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies that use a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Beyond price appreciation, these ETPs aim to capture staking rewards, offering a potential income stream without the technical complexity of direct staking. Q5: What is the Bitwise MSCI Digital Asset Select 20 ETP? A5: This ETP is designed to track a diversified index of the top 20 leading digital assets, offering investors broad exposure to the cryptocurrency market rather than focusing on a single asset. It’s a way to gain diversified access to the digital asset ecosystem. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

Are you closely watching the cryptocurrency market? If so, you’re not alone. The latest insights from Glassnode, as highlighted by Cointelegraph, deliver an urgent Bitcoin price drop warning that has investors on edge. This analysis suggests that if Bitcoin fails to hold a crucial support level, we could see a significant correction. Let’s dive into what this means for your portfolio and the broader market. What’s Behind the Urgent Bitcoin Price Drop Warning? Glassnode’s recent report points to a concerning scenario for Bitcoin. The core of their analysis is a critical support level at $104,000. Should BTC break below this point, the digital asset could potentially plummet to as low as $93,000. This isn’t just a random prediction. Such a correction would align with historical patterns. Bitcoin has often experienced similar downturns after breaching a previous all-time high, only to retrace before finding stronger footing. Understanding these historical precedents is crucial. It helps us anticipate potential market movements and prepare for various outcomes, even a sharp Bitcoin price drop . Navigating Key Bitcoin Price Levels: $104K and Beyond Currently, Bitcoin is trading within a defined range, fluctuating between $104,000 and $116,000. This range is vital for traders and investors to monitor closely. While short-term holders have seen their profitability recover recently, Glassnode notes a distinct lack of clear signals indicating a robust bullish trend reversal. This absence of strong positive momentum keeps the market in a state of cautious anticipation. Key Price Levels to Watch: $104,000: This is the immediate and critical support level. A sustained breach here could trigger the forecasted Bitcoin price drop . $114,000 – $116,000: Moving above this resistance zone would significantly strengthen the bullish case, potentially signaling a healthier upward trend. Broader Market Signals: Why the Bitcoin Price Drop Threat Looms Beyond the immediate price levels, broader market indicators also paint a picture of uncertainty. Futures funding rates, which reflect the cost of holding long positions, currently remain neutral. However, a decline in demand could quickly push these rates downwards, adding pressure to the market. Another significant factor is the performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs. These exchange-traded funds were a major catalyst for the previous rally, attracting substantial institutional capital. Unfortunately, inflows into these ETFs have slowed sharply, removing a key demand driver from the market. This combination of neutral funding rates and reduced ETF interest suggests a cooling off period, making the market more susceptible to a sudden Bitcoin price drop if sentiment shifts negatively. What Should Investors Do Amidst Bitcoin Price Drop Concerns? In times of market uncertainty and potential price corrections, informed decision-making is paramount. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Continuously monitor reports from reputable analytics firms like Glassnode and stay updated on market news. Review Your Portfolio: Assess your risk tolerance and consider rebalancing your portfolio if a significant Bitcoin price drop could impact your financial goals. Set Alerts: Utilize price alerts for key support and resistance levels ($104K, $114K-$116K) to react promptly to market movements. Understand Stop-Losses: For traders, setting appropriate stop-loss orders can help mitigate potential losses if the market moves against your position. While the prospect of a Bitcoin price drop can be unsettling, it also presents opportunities for long-term investors to accumulate assets at lower prices. Patience and a well-thought-out strategy are your best allies. The Road Ahead for Bitcoin The current market environment for Bitcoin is undeniably complex, with significant support levels under scrutiny and broader market signals indicating caution. Glassnode’s analysis serves as a crucial reminder that while Bitcoin’s long-term potential remains strong, short-term volatility and potential corrections are always part of the journey. Staying vigilant, understanding the technical indicators, and keeping an eye on institutional flows will be key to navigating these challenging times. Whether Bitcoin holds $104,000 or experiences a deeper correction, being prepared is the ultimate advantage in the dynamic world of crypto. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the critical support level for Bitcoin according to Glassnode? A1: Glassnode identifies $104,000 as the critical support level for Bitcoin. If BTC breaks below this point, it could trigger a deeper correction. Q2: How low could Bitcoin fall if the $104,000 support fails? A2: According to the analysis, Bitcoin could fall to as low as $93,000 if the $104,000 support level fails. Q3: What historical pattern is this potential drop linked to? A3: This potential correction aligns with historical patterns where Bitcoin experiences downturns after breaking a previous all-time high before finding new support. Q4: What other market indicators are signaling caution? A4: Besides the critical price levels, neutral futures funding rates and a sharp slowdown in inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs are also signaling broader market uncertainty and caution. Q5: What resistance level should Bitcoin overcome for a bullish reversal? A5: A sustained move above the $114,000-$116,000 resistance zone would be needed to strengthen the bullish case and signal a more robust upward trend. Q6: What should investors do during this period of uncertainty? A6: Investors should stay informed, review their portfolios, set price alerts for key levels, and understand the use of stop-loss orders to manage risk effectively.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/trading-volumes-rise-on-us-based-cryptocurrency-exchanges-here-are-the-details/,"In the crypto market, USD-backed exchanges saw a significant recovery in trading volume last month. Total volume on platforms offering direct trading in USD pairs and stablecoins like USDT and USDC reached $279 billion. Trading Volume Increases on USD-Backed Crypto Exchanges: US Investors Re-Active While market leaders Crypto.com, Coinbase, and Kraken maintain their strong positions in USD-based trading pairs, smaller exchanges have also begun to share in this increase. Although US users face restrictions on many global platforms, they still account for over 10% of global trading volume, highlighting the influence American investors have on the market. Meanwhile, recent announcements by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regarding regulations on offshore exchanges have raised expectations that American users will regain access to platforms like Binance. This prospect highlights the $850 billion in monthly volume currently inaccessible to US investors on Binance and Bybit. Speculation has also impacted decentralized exchanges. The price of the HYPE token has fallen on expectations that US investors will regain access to Binance. This development demonstrates that Binance's influence in global markets is felt even in regions where it doesn't operate. According to experts, Binance's possible return to the US market could seriously shake the current market balance. *This is not investment advice.

This move involved transferring a staggering 33,884 Ethereum (ETH), valued at approximately $148.6 million, directly to Coinbase Prime. Such large-scale institutional movements often signal potential shifts in market dynamics, leaving many to wonder about the intentions behind this significant transaction. What Does This BlackRock ETH Deposit Signify for the Market? Reported by Lookonchain, citing data from Arkham, this substantial BlackRock ETH deposit occurred approximately two hours prior to their announcement. For those tracking institutional crypto movements, deposits of this magnitude to exchanges are typically interpreted as a preparatory step for potential trading activity. However, the implications can be varied: Potential Selling Pressure: The most common interpretation is that the institution might be preparing to sell a portion of its holdings, potentially increasing supply on the market. Portfolio Rebalancing: BlackRock, managing trillions in assets, might be rebalancing its extensive investment portfolios, adjusting its exposure to Ethereum based on strategic decisions. Liquidity Provision: Alternatively, the funds could be moved to provide liquidity for other institutional clients or to facilitate internal trading strategies, rather than an outright sell-off. This particular BlackRock ETH deposit has captured significant attention due to the sheer volume and the prominent name associated with it, highlighting the growing influence of traditional finance in the crypto space. How Does Institutional BlackRock ETH Deposit Impact Ethereum’s Price? At the time of this significant transfer, Ethereum (ETH) was trading around $4,410.3, showing a modest increase of 0.78% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. While the immediate price impact of this specific BlackRock ETH deposit wasn’t dramatic, institutional actions like these can certainly influence market sentiment over time. Consider these key aspects: Market Perception: Large deposits can sometimes create a perception of impending sell-offs, potentially leading to short-term price volatility as traders react. Long-Term Confidence: Conversely, the continued and visible involvement of major players like BlackRock in the crypto space can bolster long-term confidence in digital assets such as Ethereum, signaling maturity and adoption. Transparency and Analysis: The ability of platforms like Lookonchain and Arkham to track and report these movements provides crucial transparency, allowing the community to analyze and understand the actions of large holders. Understanding these dynamics is vital for anyone following the crypto market, as institutional flows increasingly dictate broader trends. BlackRock’s Broader Crypto Strategy and This ETH Deposit BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has been increasingly active and vocal in the cryptocurrency sector. Their ventures include successful applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs and various blockchain initiatives, signaling a growing institutional acceptance and integration of digital assets. This recent BlackRock ETH deposit aligns with a broader trend of traditional finance entities exploring and integrating cryptocurrencies into their extensive offerings. It’s not just about a single transaction; it’s about the bigger picture of how institutions are shaping the future of finance. Their participation lends credibility and attracts further capital into the ecosystem, but also introduces new dynamics and influences to an evolving market. As such, every move by a titan like BlackRock is scrutinized for its potential ripple effects across the digital asset landscape. The substantial BlackRock ETH deposit to Coinbase Prime serves as a powerful reminder of the increasing institutional presence in the cryptocurrency market. While the exact intentions behind this $148.6 million move remain speculative, it undeniably highlights the ongoing integration of digital assets into mainstream financial strategies. As more traditional financial giants engage with crypto, their actions will continue to be a focal point for investors and enthusiasts alike, shaping the market’s trajectory and overall sentiment. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Coinbase Prime? Coinbase Prime is an integrated platform designed for institutional investors, offering advanced trading tools, custody services, and prime brokerage features for digital assets. Why are deposits to exchanges considered significant? Large deposits to exchanges are often interpreted as a precursor to potential selling or active trading.

While specific large deposits of ETH are closely watched, their overall engagement with digital assets has been growing. How does institutional activity affect crypto prices?

This demand has raised questions about ADA’s future price. Readers are eager to know which digital assets are poised for growth. The unfolding events could lead to significant shifts in the crypto arena. Cardano Eyes Resistance as it Struggles in Current Range Source: tradingview Cardano (ADA) is trading between seventy-six and eighty-nine cents. It's facing some pressure as it moves closer to its resistance level of ninety-seven cents. The coin has been fluctuating, showing a small loss over the week but an increase for the month. The short-term trends suggest that Cardano may struggle to break higher, as its movement averages stay flat and RSI signals it's not oversold. If Cardano breaks ninety-seven cents, it might aim for over a dollar, offering a rise of around twenty-three percent. However, slipping below its support level of seventy-three cents could bring more dips. The market's cautious, watching these key levels. Conclusion The call for a “no confidence” vote has cast a spotlight on ADA's leadership and could influence its market perception. If the vote leads to significant changes, it might boost investor confidence. Otherwise, prolonged disputes could harm ADA's price. The result of this situation will be crucial in determining ADA's future performance. Monica Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

51181767,https://cryptonews.com/?p=418508,1756992150,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/51181767.jpeg,"RedStone to Acquire Credora, Debuts First Oracle-Powered DeFi Risk Ratings",https://cryptonews.com/news/redstone-to-acquire-credora-debuts-first-oracle-powered-defi-risk-ratings/,"RedStone , one of DeFi’s fastest-growing oracle networks, said it will acquire Credora, an on-chain credit-rating platform backed by Coinbase Ventures, S&P and HashKey, in a deal subject to approval. In a press release shared with CryptoNews the firm said the combined product will operate as “Credora by RedStone” and, according to the companies, will introduce the industry’s first oracle-powered risk-rating framework for assets and yield strategies across decentralized finance. The integration aims to give protocols and allocators a single pipe for real-time prices and real-time risk. Company data cited by RedStone indicates DeFi strategies carrying a rating—such as Morpho Vaults—have grown as much as 25%faster than unrated peers, suggesting measurable user demand for standardized risk signals. Deal Details and Product Scope Credora’s ratings methodology is built for crypto markets, assessing collateral composition, liquidity, volatility, governance parameters and market structure. RedStone said it will feed those risk metrics alongside its price oracles, creating a unified interface for protocols to query both price and risk in one call. RedStone explains its feeds have recorded no historical mispricing events, positioning data integrity as a selling point for institutions evaluating on-chain exposure. “This acquisition allows RedStone to expand services for DeFi protocols and users. Today, Credora is the leading DeFi ratings provider, widely used in Morpho and poised to expand across the broader lending ecosystem,” Marcin Kazmierczak, RedStone co-founder, told me. “Ratings are a natural extension of our services: we gather and deliver data on-chain, and transparent ratings transform it into actionable intelligence.” Why It Matters for DeFi DeFi lacks a common language for risk. Traditional ratings firms built models around corporate and sovereign debt; those frameworks often miss crypto-native dynamics like composability, cross-chain bridges and programmatic liquidations. The companies say “Credora by RedStone” is designed for these mechanics, with a Consensus Ratings Protocolintended to update as collateral mixes and liquidity conditions shift. By surfacing standardized scores next to live pricing, lending markets could tune parameters dynamically—for example, adjusting loan-to-value caps, interest bands or reserve factors as underlying risks change—rather than relying on static assumptions or informal heuristics. Institutional Angle Institutional interest in on-chain assets is widening—from stablecoins and tokenized bonds to private credit and reinsurance structures—raising the bar on risk transparency. The firms position the tie-up as a step toward a crypto-native analogue of S&P or Moody’s, with transparency and on-chain verifiability as core design principles. “We’ve always believed that risk transparency is the cornerstone of sustainable DeFi,” Darshan Vaidya, Credora’s founder, said. “Joining forces with RedStone allows us to scale this mission globally for institutions and individuals alike.” Next Steps and Launch Timeline The transition to Credora by RedStone is under way. The companies plan to re-launch public ratings and ship API integrations so risk scores can propagate through RedStone’s feeds to protocols already using its oracles. Credora co-founders Darshan Vaidya and Matt Ficke will join RedStone as strategic advisors to support integration and adoption. If completed, the deal would give on-chain markets a dual lens—price and risk—baked into the data layer, with the goal of making risk management a default feature of DeFi infrastructure rather than an afterthought.

Detailed Insights into Polygon (POL)'s Market Position Polygon's trading activity has surged, indicating an imminent breakout. With a noteworthy 14% increase over the past week, the token moved closer to the $0.29 resistance level, bolstered by a 70% jump in daily trading volume to $705 million. This heightened activity underscores a bullish sentiment in the market, driven by robust participation from both retail and institutional sectors. Currently, the token exhibits a strong support base at $0.26, suggesting a potential for sizable gains if it can surpass the $0.29 threshold. This scenario is reinforced by a notable breakout from a symmetrical triangle pattern, a classic bullish signal in technical analysis. Although optimistic, market analysts caution that failing to breach this resistance could lead the token back into a period of consolidation, potentially dampening the current momentum. Stability and Challenges: Litecoin (LTC)'s Market Review Despite recent market fluctuations, Litecoin continues to demonstrate resilience, maintaining its position above the critical $108 support level. The current trading price hovers at $108.57, with the token experiencing modest day-to-day volatility, shown by its daily Average True Range (ATR) of $5.80. The technical indicators for Litecoin, however, are mixed. With an RSI index at 42.87 and a bearish MACD, there's a hint of short-term pressure. Yet, the token's position above its 200-day SMA at $98.25 offers a silver lining, suggesting an underlying bullish trend that could prevail with strengthened buying activity. Further institutional interest and potential ETF discussions also paint a positive outlook for Litecoin, possibly driving its price towards the $190-$200 range in the medium term, provided it sustains the $108 base. BlockDAG's Strategic Moves and Market Impact BlockDAG has stirred the market with its impressive $396 million presale and strategic miner shipments, setting a robust precedent for future growth.

Even as ADA has rebounded about five percent from its late-August lows, on-chain analytics firm Santiment says the asset’s typically optimistic retail crowd has swung to its most negative stance in five months. In an X post accompanying its sentiment chart, the firm wrote: “Cardano has quietly seen its normally optimistic crowd start to turn bearish. After the lowest sentiment recorded in 5 months, $ADA’s price is +5%. Patient holders and dip buyers during this three week downswing should root for this trend of bearish retailers to continue.” Santiment framed that shift in classic contrarian terms. “Prices typically move the opposite direction of the crowd’s expectations. When small traders sell off their bags out of impatience and frustration, it is generally the key stakeholders who accumulate and drive up prices again,” the post added. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Redemption Controversy Over? Hoskinson Shares IOG Audit Results The graphic shared by the firm plots ADA’s price against a running ratio of bullish versus bearish social commentary and annotated three distinct phases over the past month: an early-August “greed” spike where the bullish-to-bearish ratio surged to roughly 12.8:1 and was followed by a pullback; a mid-August “fear” pocket near 2.0:1 that preceded a rally; and, most recently, the most bearish reading in five months around 1.5:1, coinciding with ADA’s +5% bounce. The sequencing in Santiment’s chart supports the firm’s message that outsized crowd optimism or pessimism frequently appears near short-term inflection points. The short-term price path into that rebound has been marked by a three-week downswing that began around August 14. Cardano Faces Decision Zone Independent market analyst Quantum Ascend ties the bounce to a clearly defined higher-time-frame structure. Posting a daily ADA/USD chart, the analyst wrote: “ADA Respecting a channel on the high time frame dating back to early June. Higher Highs, Lower Lows. Short-term decline dating back to August 14 channeling as well. Price Currently sitting atop the .382 Fib at $0.82. Cardano’s decision point appears near, but we still need to be looking to the Macro. Regardless, I’m very bullish long-term.” Related Reading: Cardano Founder Says Chainlink Quoted Them An ‘Absurd Price’, Here’s Why In Quantum Ascend’s view, ADA is tracking an ascending channel that has contained price action since mid-June. The short, blue corrective channel from August 14 sits inside that broader up-channel and has carried price back to the lower end of the channel as well as a Fibonacci retracement cluster derived from the June–August advance. The analyst’s chart places the 0.382 retracement near $0.821, which has acted as first support and the immediate “decision point.” Below that, the same mapping highlights the 0.309 retracement around $0.762 and the 0.236 near $0.702 as deeper pullback areas inside the macro structure. Overhead, the analyst’s levels mark successive checkpoints at the 0.5 retracement near $0.879, the 0.618 near $1.043, the 0.702 around $1.083, the 0.786 near $1.151, and the 1.0 extension around $1.326—levels that also align with prior supply pockets and the upper boundary of the ascending channel later in the quarter. At press time, ADA traded at $0.8177.

Key Takeaways: Wintermute urges the SEC to exclude network tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum from securities laws. The firm warns that misclassifying these tokens risks stifling innovation and could push blockchain activity offshore. Wintermute calls for clear rules to support DeFi alongside centralized platforms, emphasizing the need for balanced regulation. In formal feedback submitted to the SEC , Wintermute argued that “network tokens,” such as Bitcoin and Ether, are integral to the functioning of decentralized networks and should not be regulated under securities laws. The firm said these tokens act as technical building blocks rather than investment instruments. Wintermute Warns SEC: Mislabeling Tokens Could Kill Innovation Treating network tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum as securities, Wintermute warned, would misapply existing laws and risk stifling innovation. “Such misclassification risks stifling innovation and driving blockchain development and trading activity outside of US markets,” Wintermute wrote in its letter. It added that even if network tokens are later traded for profit or used in fundraising, they still do not meet the legal definition of a security. Wintermute likened network tokens to assets such as commodities, collectibles, and real estate, goods that may be purchased for speculative purposes but are not inherently securities. The firm also welcomed SEC guidance that excluded stablecoins, memecoins, and staking services from the securities label, and called for similar treatment of network tokens. The company further pressed the SEC to create a regulatory environment that allows decentralized finance (DeFi) to grow alongside centralized platforms. 3. We also ask for clarification on the jurisdiction of the SEC We request that the SEC clarify that network tokens are not securities, which make up most of the market for crypto assets, as it has done for other types of crypto assets In addition, we seek clarification to… — Wintermute (@wintermute_t) September 3, 2025 “Clear guidance across these areas will keep US markets competitive, encourage continued dialogue with regulators, and create optimal conditions for adoption and innovation to thrive,” Wintermute stated. Wintermute’s comments follow its recent expansion push in the US, including a $112 million acquisition of QCEX, a CFTC-licensed exchange. The firm appears to be laying the groundwork for deeper engagement in regulated markets, while pushing for frameworks that accommodate decentralized models. With the SEC continuing to scrutinize crypto markets, Wintermute’s request underscores the industry’s ongoing demand for clarity, before more projects and capital flee to friendlier jurisdictions. Trump Administration Pushes Pro-Crypto Agenda The Trump administration advanced its pro-crypto agenda with a series of policy and regulatory moves. President Trump signed an executive order urging regulators to remove barriers that prevent 401(k) plans from including alternative assets such as cryptocurrencies. If implemented, the reforms could allow millions of Americans to allocate retirement funds to Bitcoin and other digital assets through regulated channels. Trump also nominated economist Stephen Miran , a digital asset advocate, to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, signaling continuity in his administration’s pro-crypto stance. In a separate executive order, Trump moved to end “debanking” practices that target lawful crypto firms. The Blockchain Association praised the measures as a “historic shift” that would expand consumer choice, empower wealth-building, and reduce operational barriers for blockchain businesses.

The video attached to the tweet showed the interviewer asking Fink directly whether BlackRock would consider launching another ETF, specifically mentioning XRP. The interviewer noted that the firm already has an Ethereum ETF approved and proceeded to ask, “How about XRP? Can you answer that?” In response, Fink said, “I can’t.” He smiled while answering, but did not provide further clarification. While the comment was brief and non-committal, the lack of a direct denial has drawn speculation about whether BlackRock is considering such a product. BlackRock CEO – Larry Fink indirectly confirms the launch of a SPOT #XRP ETF! pic.twitter.com/6QUOi6BWdx — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) September 4, 2025 Garlinghouse Declines to Confirm Talks The video shared in the tweet also included a separate interview segment featuring Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. In that exchange, Garlinghouse was asked if Ripple was in talks with large issuers, specifically BlackRock, regarding an ETF. He responded, “Well, I’m not going to comment on that.” Garlinghouse then acknowledged that BlackRock had made some public statements on the matter but stopped short of offering specifics. He added, “We think it makes sense for the XRP community overall.” His statement did not confirm any developments but indicated that Ripple views the prospect of such an ETF positively if it were to materialize. Social Media Reactions Following the video, several X users commented on the potential implications. One user, Tgully, remarked , “1700 NDA’s baby,” referencing the large number of reported non-disclosure agreements Ripple has engaged in over the years. Another user, identified as Crypto boy, reacted by saying , “It is coming. Let’s gooo,” expressing optimism about the possibility of a spot XRP ETF being introduced. The reactions suggest that a portion of the online community is interpreting both Fink’s and Garlinghouse’s refusal to give direct answers as a signal that discussions may be ongoing behind the scenes. However, neither BlackRock nor Ripple has confirmed any official steps toward launching such a financial product. Context of ETF Interest BlackRock has played a central role in the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the United States, helping pave the way for broader institutional participation in digital assets. The possibility of expanding this model to include other cryptocurrencies, including XRP, has been a recurring topic among market participants. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While the video clips do not provide definitive evidence of BlackRock’s plans, they have reinforced ongoing speculation that the firm could eventually consider XRP as part of its ETF lineup.

Recently, a notable event involving the NEIRO token has captured the attention of investors and analysts alike. Trend Research, identified as the largest holder of NEIRO, executed a substantial deposit to various exchanges. This action raises important questions about market stability and the future trajectory of the NEIRO token. What Just Happened with the NEIRO Token? Today, Trend Research made a significant transaction, depositing 324.7 million NEIROETH, valued at an impressive $22 million, to major cryptocurrency exchanges. These platforms include well-known names like Bybit and Gate.io, as reported by AmberCN. This move is particularly impactful because Trend Research remains the dominant holder of the NEIRO token , currently possessing 346 million NEIROETH. This substantial amount represents 34.6% of the token’s entire supply. To put this into perspective, imagine a single entity holding over a third of all shares in a publicly traded company. Their actions would undoubtedly influence market sentiment and price. The same principle applies to the cryptocurrency market, especially concerning a token like NEIRO. Understanding Trend Research’s Influence on NEIRO Token Trend Research’s position as the largest holder of the NEIRO token grants it considerable influence over its market. When such a large quantity of tokens moves to exchanges, it typically signals one of two things: a potential intention to sell, or a strategic move for liquidity provision. Either scenario can have profound effects on the token’s price and market perception. Key aspects of their influence include: Market Liquidity: Increased tokens on exchanges can boost liquidity, making it easier for others to buy and sell. Price Impact: A large sell-off could lead to price depreciation, while a strategic deposit might not immediately trigger a dump. Investor Confidence: Such large-scale movements can either reassure or alarm investors, depending on the perceived intent. Why Would a Major Holder Move NEIRO Token to Exchanges? The reasons behind Trend Research’s decision to deposit such a large sum of NEIRO token to exchanges are speculative, but several common motivations exist for major holders: Potential motivations include: Profit-Taking: If the token has seen significant gains, a holder might deposit to realize profits. Portfolio Rebalancing: Adjusting holdings to manage risk or allocate capital to other assets. Providing Liquidity: Making tokens available for specific trading pairs or market-making activities, which can sometimes stabilize prices. OTC Deals: Preparing for over-the-counter (OTC) sales that bypass direct exchange order books but still require tokens to be accessible. Without an official statement from Trend Research, the exact intent remains unclear. However, the market will certainly react to the increased supply on exchanges. Immediate Impact on NEIRO Token Market Dynamics The immediate aftermath of such a large deposit of NEIRO token often involves heightened volatility. Traders and algorithms monitor these movements closely, and their reactions can quickly sway prices. A sudden increase in available supply on exchanges, particularly from a dominant holder, can create selling pressure. However, it is crucial to remember that deposits do not always equate to immediate sales. Sometimes, tokens are moved in anticipation of future events or for specific strategic purposes that might not directly lead to a price crash. Investors should watch trading volumes and price action on Bybit, Gate.io, and other platforms where NEIRO is traded. What Should NEIRO Token Holders Do Next? For existing or potential NEIRO token holders, staying informed is paramount. This event serves as a reminder of the importance of due diligence in the crypto space. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Price & Volume: Closely track the price movements and trading volumes of NEIRO on major exchanges. Research Further: Look for any official announcements from Trend Research or further reports from reputable crypto news outlets. Assess Risk: Re-evaluate your risk tolerance and portfolio allocation concerning NEIRO. Diversify: Ensure your portfolio is diversified to mitigate the impact of significant movements in any single asset. In conclusion, Trend Research’s deposit of $22 million worth of NEIRO token to exchanges marks a significant event that warrants close observation. While the exact intentions are not yet public, such a large movement from a major holder will undoubtedly influence market dynamics. For investors, understanding these shifts and reacting with informed decisions is key to navigating the often-unpredictable cryptocurrency landscape. Stay vigilant and make sure your investment strategies are robust. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the NEIRO token? A1: The NEIRO token is a specific cryptocurrency. While details on its exact utility or project are not provided here, it is a digital asset traded on various cryptocurrency exchanges. Q2: Who is Trend Research in relation to NEIRO token? A2: Trend Research is currently the largest known holder of the NEIRO token, possessing 34.6% of its total supply, making their actions highly influential on the token’s market. Q3: What does it mean when a large holder deposits tokens to exchanges? A3: It typically means the holder intends to make those tokens available for trading. This could be for selling, providing liquidity, rebalancing a portfolio, or preparing for an OTC deal. Q4: How might this deposit affect the NEIRO token’s price? A4: An increase in available supply on exchanges, especially from a major holder, can create selling pressure, potentially leading to price volatility or depreciation. However, the actual impact depends on whether the tokens are sold and market demand. Q5: What exchanges were involved in this NEIRO token deposit? A5: Trend Research deposited NEIROETH to exchanges including Bybit and Gate.io, as reported by AmberCN. If you found this analysis helpful, consider sharing it with your network!

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), often referred to as the “central bank of central banks,” is reportedly positioning XRP as part of its global settlement infrastructure. This move signals a level of institutional acknowledgment far beyond retail speculation, highlighting XRP’s growing relevance in the mainstream financial ecosystem. XRP, Ripple’s digital asset, enables near-instant, low-cost cross-border payments, far outpacing traditional systems. Its efficiency has attracted financial institutions seeking alternatives to legacy rails. With the Bank for International Settlements’ involvement, XRP is gaining institutional credibility, positioning it as a serious contender for global financial infrastructure rather than just a speculative crypto asset. X Finance Bull highlights that BIS recognition signals a major institutional shift toward blockchain integration. With its liquidity, scalability, and regulatory alignment, XRP is positioned to help central banks and top financial institutions achieve faster, cheaper, and more transparent settlements, bridging traditional finance with decentralized technology. Market behavior reflects growing institutional confidence. While retail traders chase price swings, central bank interest highlights XRP’s real-world utility and long-term potential. Analysts note that institutional adoption could fuel substantial demand, positioning XRP as a cornerstone of future global finance rather than just a speculative asset. XRP Eyes Critical Reversal as Bulls Defend $2.77 Support XRP is showing signs of cautious optimism as it continues to hold above the $2.77 support level, according to crypto pundit Degram. XRP is currently trading within a falling channel, exhibiting choppy price action around the midline. This pattern indicates indecision among traders, with neither buyers nor sellers fully in control. However, technical observers note that the repeated defense of key support signals that buyers are prepared to step in and prevent a sharper decline. Degram added , “XRP is holding above the $2.77 support level while trading inside a falling channel, showing repeated choppy movement near the midline. A sustained move above $2.90 would confirm bullish momentum and target the 3.20 resistance.” However, the crypto pundit cautioned that a drop below $2.77 could quickly negate the bullish scenario, reintroducing downside risk and possibly triggering further selling pressure. Therefore, bulls need to continue defending the $2.7 to $2.8 zone, with XRP’s present price standing at $2.85. Conclusion XRP’s positioning by the BIS as a potential global settlement infrastructure represents a pivotal moment for both the digital asset and the broader crypto ecosystem. Institutional-level recognition highlights its utility, scalability, and legitimacy, setting the stage for wider adoption and integration into mainstream financial systems. On the other hand, XRP’s current trading behavior highlights a delicate balance between risk and opportunity. Holding above $2.77 demonstrates buyer commitment, while a breakout above $2.90 would validate bullish momentum and target $3.20. Conversely, failure to defend this support could reopen the path to further downside.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MACROECONOMICS|TRADING|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-04 13:35:35

This move, focused on firms acquiring cryptocurrencies to inflate their stock prices, signals a crucial shift. It’s an urgent response to evolving market dynamics, setting new expectations for transparency and investor protection. This increased Nasdaq crypto scrutiny is set to redefine how businesses approach the volatile yet alluring crypto market. What’s Driving This Nasdaq Crypto Scrutiny? Nasdaq’s enhanced oversight isn’t arbitrary; it stems from a growing concern over certain company practices. Reports suggest that some listed firms have been raising capital specifically to purchase cryptocurrencies, seemingly to artificially boost their stock valuations. This strategy raises red flags regarding market manipulation and investor risk. The exchange aims to ensure that capital raised through traditional means is used for legitimate business operations, not speculative crypto investments that could jeopardize shareholder value. This proactive stance reflects a broader industry trend towards greater accountability in the digital asset space. Investor Protection: Safeguarding shareholders from potentially risky or opaque investment strategies. Market Integrity: Maintaining trust and fairness in the stock market by preventing artificial price inflation. Regulatory Alignment: Adapting to the complex and rapidly changing landscape of cryptocurrency regulations. New Rules: Shareholder Approval for Crypto Purchases One of the most impactful changes emerging from this Nasdaq crypto scrutiny is the requirement for shareholder approval. The Information reported that Nasdaq has started demanding some companies secure explicit shareholder consent before issuing new stock to fund cryptocurrency acquisitions. This is a significant hurdle. Previously, such decisions might have been made solely by company management. Now, shareholders will have a direct say in whether their company uses capital for crypto investments. This introduces an additional layer of governance and transparency, ensuring that major financial decisions align with investor interests. For companies considering such moves, this means a more rigorous process. They must now present a clear case to their shareholders, outlining the rationale, potential benefits, and risks associated with using company capital for crypto purchases. This new requirement underscores Nasdaq’s commitment to robust corporate governance. How Will This Impact Altcoins and Mainstream Adoption? The implications of increased Nasdaq crypto scrutiny extend beyond individual companies. The Information suggested that this move could significantly slow the pace at which altcoins enter mainstream financial markets. Why? If public companies find it harder to use newly raised capital for altcoin purchases, the institutional demand for these digital assets might decrease. This could, in turn, affect their liquidity and price stability. While it doesn’t halt altcoin adoption entirely, it certainly adds a layer of caution for publicly traded entities. This development might encourage a more measured, long-term approach to crypto integration rather than opportunistic, short-term plays designed purely for stock boosts. It forces companies to think critically about the strategic value of crypto assets, rather than viewing them as quick stock price catalysts. Navigating the Evolving Landscape: Actionable Insights For companies currently listed on Nasdaq or those aspiring to be, understanding this enhanced Nasdaq crypto scrutiny is vital. Here are some actionable insights: Prioritize Transparency: Clearly communicate any crypto-related strategies to investors and stakeholders. Seek Shareholder Mandate: If considering significant crypto investments, proactively engage with shareholders for approval. Strategic Rationale: Develop a robust business case for any crypto acquisitions, demonstrating how they align with core business objectives and long-term growth, rather than just short-term stock price boosts. Compliance First: Ensure all activities comply with Nasdaq’s evolving rules and broader financial regulations. This shift emphasizes that while innovation is encouraged, it must occur within a framework of responsible corporate governance and investor protection. Companies that adapt effectively will be better positioned for sustainable growth in both traditional and digital markets. A New Era of Accountability for Crypto Investments Nasdaq’s intensified crypto scrutiny marks a pivotal moment for the intersection of traditional finance and digital assets. By demanding greater transparency and shareholder approval, the exchange is reinforcing its commitment to market integrity and investor confidence. This isn’t a rejection of cryptocurrencies but rather a mature approach to integrating them responsibly into the public market framework. Companies must now navigate this landscape with careful consideration, ensuring their crypto strategies are sound, transparent, and ultimately, beneficial for their shareholders. This era calls for thoughtful integration over speculative haste. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Nasdaq’s primary concern with companies buying crypto? Nasdaq is primarily concerned about companies raising capital specifically to purchase cryptocurrencies in an effort to artificially boost their stock prices, which can create risks for investors and impact market integrity. 2. What new requirement has Nasdaq imposed on some companies? Nasdaq has reportedly required some companies to secure explicit shareholder approval before issuing new stock to buy cryptocurrencies. 3. How might this affect altcoins? This increased scrutiny could slow the pace at which altcoins enter mainstream markets by reducing institutional demand from public companies that find it harder to fund such purchases. 4. Does this mean Nasdaq is against cryptocurrency? Not necessarily. It suggests Nasdaq is taking a more cautious and regulated approach to how public companies engage with cryptocurrencies, prioritizing investor protection and market transparency rather than outright banning crypto involvement. 5. What should companies do to comply with this new scrutiny? Companies should prioritize transparency, proactively seek shareholder approval for significant crypto investments, develop a clear strategic rationale for any crypto acquisitions, and ensure all activities comply with Nasdaq’s evolving rules and financial regulations.

According to data from the Ethereum Validator Queue, 833,141 ETH, worth $3.6 billion at current market prices, is pending entry into staking as of Thursday. The estimated wait time is 14 days and 11 hours. A validator queue is the waiting list for participants who want to become validators to secure the network while earning staking rewards. Queue numbers remain positive despite weekly decline Charts tracking entry and exit queues show that in the week starting August 29, the exit queue was at 1.05 million ETH, but has since declined steadily, falling to 831,053 ETH by September 3, nearly 25% less. Ethereum Validator queue numbers. Source: Validatorqueue On the entry side, after dipping early in the period, volumes surged to 860,000 on September 2, the highest level recorded since September 2023, following the Shanghai upgrade. The numbers went up by about 15% compared to Monday, and has settled around 833,000 ETH. Wait exit processing times fell from nearly 19 days on August 29 to about 14 days by September 4, a 26% downtick. Entry wait times followed a similar trajectory, slipping from more than 13 days on August 29 to just under 14 days at the latest count, ignoring a temporary spike to nearly 15 days recorded on Tuesday. Validator exits do not necessarily mean the token is in a bear phase. Many validators locked Ether at far lower prices when ETH traded between $1,000 and $2,000. Judging from today’s market value that has exceeded $4,400, some participants are unstaking to take profit or in layperson’s terms, sell for gains. Secondly, ETH holders were required to stake a minimum of 32 ETH to become a validator. Institutions are now merging into validator slots of 2,048 ETH, which requires closing smaller positions before redeploying. The trader also mentioned that rotation into liquid staking tokens has made exiting validators move funds into derivatives such as stETH, rETH or platforms like Ether.fi and EigenLayer, mostly for liquidity and restaking opportunities. ETH price in consolidation phase after ATH Ether traded at $4,420 at the time of this publication, with daily gains of 1% but a weekly decline of about 4.6%. Trading volume in the last 24 hours reached $31.6 billion, slightly going up by a meager 0.4%, which could mean that holders are unsure whether they should keep or sell tokens. Market observers suggested that smaller buyers have been accumulating coins while whales remain on the sidelines. Without renewed participation from bigger players, there could be a ceiling that will cap its upside momentum. According to data from SoSoValue, netflows into Ether-based exchange-traded funds on Wednesday were on the red side, with institutions counting $38.24 million outflows. BlackRock’s ETHA fund had the only and by far the largest withdrawal at $151.4 million. Meanwhile, other asset managers like Fidelity registered $65.7 million inflows in its ETH product, while Grayscale and Bitwise recorded $26.5 million and $20.8 million respectively.

This decline in Bitcoin has made investors nervous, and they are wondering whether there will be a further decline. While $100,000 and below are among the predictions at this point, K33 Research stated that the decline could continue below $100,000. Speaking to The Block, K33 Research analyst Vetle Lunde said that tariff pressure and US economic data could lead to a price drop in Bitcoin in September. Lunde stated that this decline would be a buying opportunity, and that attractive entry levels for Bitcoin could emerge in the support areas around $101,000 and $94,000. On this point, Lunde noted that September was Bitcoin's weakest month historically, with new macro risks from tariffs and US data threatening a downside squeeze. “The cryptocurrency market entered a period of volatility in September due to US tariffs, slowing economic indicators and seasonal factors. Since 2011, Bitcoin's average September return has been -4.6%, making it the only month with a negative average return. Lunde argued that Bitcoin's long-term upward trend remains unchanged despite the short-term bearish expectation.

This monumental milestone for IBIT BTC holdings signals a new era of institutional confidence in Bitcoin, grabbing headlines and sparking conversations across the financial landscape. It is not just a number; it represents a significant shift in how traditional finance views and engages with digital assets. What Does This Monumental Growth in IBIT BTC Holdings Mean for Bitcoin? Reaching over three-quarters of a million Bitcoin in its reserves, BlackRock’s IBIT is demonstrating unparalleled success in the nascent spot Bitcoin ETF market. This rapid accumulation of IBIT BTC holdings is far more than just a tally; it is a powerful indicator of several key trends: Institutional Validation: Major players like BlackRock are not just dipping their toes; they are diving deep. This signals strong institutional trust in Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Increased Accessibility: The ETF structure makes it easier for traditional investors, who might be wary of direct crypto ownership, to gain exposure to Bitcoin through regulated channels. Market Demand: The sheer volume of inflows into IBIT reflects a robust and sustained demand for Bitcoin exposure, particularly from larger investment vehicles. This achievement firmly positions IBIT as a dominant force, influencing market sentiment and potentially paving the way for further institutional adoption. How Has IBIT Achieved Such Rapid Accumulation of Bitcoin? The journey to accumulating such substantial IBIT BTC holdings has been swift and strategic. BlackRock, a financial behemoth, leveraged its extensive network and expertise to launch a product that resonates with a broad spectrum of investors. Unlike direct Bitcoin purchases, which can involve navigating exchanges and managing digital wallets, IBIT offers a familiar, regulated investment vehicle. Investors can buy shares of IBIT through their traditional brokerage accounts, benefiting from the security and oversight typically associated with traditional financial products. This ease of access, combined with BlackRock’s reputation, has attracted significant capital. The fund essentially buys and holds physical Bitcoin on behalf of its shareholders, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without the complexities of direct ownership. Furthermore, the competitive fee structure and strong marketing efforts have undoubtedly contributed to IBIT’s impressive growth trajectory, drawing in both retail and institutional capital at an accelerating pace. What Are the Broader Implications of Growing IBIT BTC Holdings? The continued expansion of IBIT BTC holdings carries significant implications for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. On one hand, it reinforces Bitcoin’s status as a mainstream asset, potentially reducing its historical volatility as more stable, long-term capital enters the market. This institutional embrace could also spur innovation in other digital asset sectors. However, this growth also presents potential challenges. A concentration of Bitcoin in a few large ETFs raises questions about centralization and its long-term effects on Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos. Moreover, while ETFs offer convenience, investors should remember that they are still exposed to Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility. Understanding the underlying asset’s risks remains crucial. Actionable Insight: Investors and enthusiasts should closely monitor the net inflows and outflows of major spot Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT. These metrics provide valuable insights into prevailing market sentiment and the pace of institutional integration. Keep an eye on regulatory developments as well, as they can significantly impact the future landscape of crypto investments. In conclusion, BlackRock’s IBIT reaching over 750,000 BTC in its holdings is a landmark event. It underscores the accelerating mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin and highlights the powerful role that traditional financial institutions are now playing in the digital asset space. This achievement not only validates Bitcoin as a serious investment but also sets a new benchmark for institutional engagement, promising an exciting, albeit evolving, future for the crypto market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is BlackRock’s IBIT? BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is a spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) that allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency. It holds actual Bitcoin on behalf of its shareholders. Why are IBIT BTC holdings significant? The rapid growth of IBIT BTC holdings to over 750,000 BTC is significant because it demonstrates strong institutional demand and validation for Bitcoin. It also provides a regulated and accessible pathway for traditional investors to enter the crypto market. How do spot Bitcoin ETFs affect the broader crypto market? Spot Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT can increase market liquidity, attract new institutional capital, and enhance Bitcoin’s legitimacy as an asset. This can lead to greater price stability and wider adoption, but also raises questions about centralization. What are the risks associated with investing in Bitcoin ETFs? While Bitcoin ETFs offer convenience, they are still subject to the inherent volatility of Bitcoin’s price. Other risks include regulatory changes, potential for market manipulation, and the operational risks associated with managing the fund. Will other institutions follow BlackRock’s lead in accumulating Bitcoin? Given the success of BlackRock’s IBIT and its substantial IBIT BTC holdings , it is highly probable that other financial institutions will continue to explore and launch similar Bitcoin-related investment products, further integrating crypto into traditional finance.

51182521,574398,1756993663,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51182521.jpeg,Dati On-Chain Mostrano che Oltre la Metà dell’Offerta di Ethereum è Detenuta da Soli 10 Indirizzi,https://bitcoinist.com/dati-on-chain-mostrano-che-oltre-la-meta-dellofferta-di-ethereum-e-detenuta-da-soli-10-indirizzi/,"In un nuovo post su X , la società di analisi on-chain Santiment ha evidenziato come i diversi asset dell’ecosistema Ethereum si confrontano tra loro in termini di concentrazione dell’offerta nei 10 wallet principali. Dal grafico condiviso da Santiment, visibile nell’ultimo post, emerge la tendenza di questo indicatore per otto criptovalute negli ultimi mesi. Secondo i dati, il 51% dell’offerta di Ethereum è detenuta dai 10 wallet più grandi della rete. Questo valore è superiore alla maggior parte degli altri token basati su ETH presenti nella lista. Le due criptovalute che superano Ethereum in questa metrica sono Shiba Inu (SHIB) e Uniswap (UNI) . UNI è solo leggermente sopra ETH con il 52,2%, mentre SHIB è molto più concentrato, con il 62,3% della sua offerta nelle mani dei 10 portafogli principali. In generale, quando l’offerta di una criptovaluta è concentrata in poche mani, questo non è considerato un segnale positivo, perché bastano pochi attori per muovere il mercato. Rischi della centralizzazione dell’offerta Oltre agli effetti sul mercato, la centralizzazione dell’offerta può indebolire anche la sicurezza della rete. Ethereum utilizza un meccanismo di consenso chiamato Proof-of-Stake (PoS) . In questo sistema, i validatori (“stakers”) devono bloccare una quota di ETH per avere la possibilità di aggiungere il prossimo blocco alla blockchain. Quanto maggiore è la quota di un validatore, tanto maggiori sono le probabilità di essere scelto. Se un singolo validatore supera il 51% dell’offerta , in teoria potrebbe avere il controllo totale sulla blockchain. Questo tipo di rischio non esiste su Bitcoin, che utilizza il Proof-of-Work (PoW) . Qui i miner competono tra loro con la potenza di calcolo. Anche in PoW, però, se un attore riuscisse a controllare oltre il 51% delle risorse computazionali, potrebbe influenzare la rete a suo piacimento. Considerando che Ethereum ha solo 10 detentori che controllano il 51% dell’offerta, un attacco coordinato è teoricamente possibile, sebbene le probabilità siano piuttosto basse. Tuttavia, il fatto che token come ETH, SHIB e UNI siano così concentrati in poche mani è un aspetto da monitorare. Al contrario, alcuni token dell’ecosistema mostrano una distribuzione più equilibrata: USDC (28,6%) , DAI (31%) e Chainlink (31,5%) , valori più “sani” rispetto a questa metrica.",Uncategorized|Ethereum,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|SHIB|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-04 13:47:43
51182611,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=199658,1756993811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/51182611.jpeg,Revolutionary Step: Circle Integrates Native USDC on Plume Network,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/circle-native-usdc-plume/,"BitcoinWorld Revolutionary Step: Circle Integrates Native USDC on Plume Network The cryptocurrency world is constantly evolving, and a recent announcement from Circle, the issuer of USDC, marks a truly revolutionary step forward for the industry. Circle has confirmed its support for Plume Network, a blockchain specifically designed for regulatory-compliant real-world assets (RWAs). This pivotal move enables the seamless deposit and withdrawal of native USDC directly on Plume, fundamentally transforming how these assets can be managed and transacted. What is Plume Network and Why Does it Matter for RWAs? Plume Network stands out in the blockchain landscape by focusing exclusively on real-world assets. Think of RWAs as tangible or intangible assets from the traditional financial world, such as real estate, fine art, or even intellectual property, that are tokenized and brought onto a blockchain. Plume’s core mission is to provide a secure and compliant environment for these assets. The network prioritizes regulatory adherence, making it an attractive platform for institutions and businesses looking to leverage blockchain technology without compromising on legal frameworks. By bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi), Plume aims to unlock vast new opportunities for liquidity and investment in tokenized assets. How Does Native USDC on Plume Revolutionize Asset Management? The integration of native USDC on Plume Network brings several significant advantages. Native USDC refers to the version of USDC that is directly issued on a specific blockchain, rather than being bridged from another network. This direct issuance enhances security and reduces reliance on complex bridging mechanisms. Here’s how this integration creates a more efficient and compliant ecosystem: Seamless Transactions: Users can now deposit and withdraw USDC directly on Plume, simplifying the process for engaging with RWA-backed tokens. Enhanced Liquidity: By providing a stable, widely accepted digital dollar, native USDC boosts liquidity within the Plume ecosystem, making it easier to buy, sell, and trade tokenized assets. Regulatory Compliance: Circle’s reputation as a regulated financial technology company, combined with Plume’s focus on compliance, offers a robust framework for managing RWAs. This helps instill greater trust among institutional investors. Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) V2 Support: The inclusion of Circle’s CCTP V2 allows for secure and efficient transfers of USDC across different blockchain networks. This means greater interoperability for RWAs hosted on Plume, connecting them to a broader DeFi landscape. This development is not just about a new token listing; it’s about establishing a more robust and interconnected financial infrastructure for the future of tokenized assets. What are the Wider Implications for the RWA Ecosystem? The introduction of native USDC on Plume could significantly accelerate the adoption of real-world assets on blockchain. Institutions often seek stability and regulatory clarity, both of which are strengthened by this partnership. The ability to transact with a trusted stablecoin like USDC directly on a compliant RWA-focused chain removes many barriers to entry. This move fosters greater confidence, potentially attracting more traditional financial players into the digital asset space. It also paves the way for innovative new financial products and services built around tokenized assets, from fractional ownership of high-value items to more efficient collateralization in lending protocols. What’s Next for Native USDC and RWA Innovation? The path ahead for native USDC and RWA innovation is brimming with potential. As more real-world assets are tokenized, the demand for stable, compliant, and liquid settlement layers will only grow. Circle’s partnership with Plume positions both entities at the forefront of this emerging sector. While the benefits are clear, challenges remain, including ongoing regulatory evolution and the need for broader industry standardization. However, with initiatives like this, the future of a more integrated and efficient global financial system, powered by blockchain and tokenized assets, looks increasingly promising. In conclusion, Circle’s support for native USDC on Plume Network is a significant milestone. It promises to enhance the liquidity, efficiency, and regulatory compliance of real-world assets on the blockchain, paving the way for a more integrated and accessible financial future. This partnership underscores the growing maturity of the crypto ecosystem and its increasing convergence with traditional finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‘native USDC’ mean? A1: Native USDC refers to the version of the USDC stablecoin that is directly issued on a specific blockchain network, like Plume, rather than being transferred or ‘bridged’ from another chain. This ensures greater security and direct integration. Q2: What are Real-World Assets (RWAs) in the context of blockchain? A2: Real-World Assets (RWAs) are tangible or intangible assets from the traditional financial world (e.g., real estate, commodities, stocks, intellectual property) that are represented as tokens on a blockchain, allowing for fractional ownership, easier transfer, and increased liquidity. Q3: How does Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) V2 benefit this integration? A3: CCTP V2 enables secure and efficient transfers of USDC between different blockchain networks. For Plume, it means that native USDC can be moved to and from other supported chains seamlessly, enhancing interoperability for tokenized RWAs. Q4: Why is regulatory compliance important for RWA blockchains like Plume? A4: Regulatory compliance is crucial for RWAs because these assets are tied to existing legal frameworks and often involve institutional participants. A compliant blockchain ensures that transactions and asset management adhere to legal standards, fostering trust and enabling broader adoption by traditional finance. Q5: What are the main benefits of having native USDC on Plume Network? A5: The main benefits include enhanced liquidity for RWA tokens, simplified deposits and withdrawals, improved security through native issuance, and strengthened regulatory compliance, making the RWA ecosystem more attractive to a wider range of investors and institutions. Q6: Is this integration only for institutional investors? A6: While Plume’s focus on compliance and RWAs naturally attracts institutional interest, the increased liquidity and efficiency brought by native USDC can benefit all participants in the RWA ecosystem, including retail investors interested in fractional ownership of tokenized assets.

This opening snapshot provides valuable insights into current investor sentiment, which often has ripple effects across various asset classes, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. What’s Behind the Mixed Opening of U.S. Stock Indexes? The three major U.S. stock indexes presented a varied picture right out of the gate. The S&P 500, a broad indicator of large-cap performance, saw a modest gain of 0.13%. Similarly, the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.26%, signaling strength in growth sectors. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 significant American companies, experienced a slight dip of 0.15%. This divergence suggests that investors are not uniformly optimistic or pessimistic. Instead, they are carefully picking and choosing, reacting to a complex interplay of economic signals and corporate news. Understanding these movements is crucial for anyone monitoring financial health. Why Does This Mixed Performance Matter to Investors? When U.S. stock indexes show mixed signals, it can create a nuanced environment for investors. It highlights sector-specific strengths and weaknesses rather than a broad market trend. For instance, the Nasdaq’s rise often indicates confidence in tech and innovation, while a Dow dip might reflect concerns about traditional industrial giants or broader economic headwinds. Consider these implications: Sector Rotation : Funds might be shifting from one industry to another as investors re-evaluate opportunities. Economic Indicators : Investors are actively digesting recent economic data, such as inflation reports or employment figures, which can influence different sectors in unique ways. Monetary Policy Expectations : Anticipation of future interest rate decisions from the Federal Reserve can heavily sway market sentiment, impacting various companies and sectors differently. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights for Your Portfolio In times when U.S. stock indexes are not moving in lockstep, it’s natural to wonder how to position your investments. While this article focuses on traditional stocks, the underlying principles of market analysis are often transferable, even for those deeply invested in digital assets. Here are some actionable insights: Diversification is Key : Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio across different asset classes and sectors can help mitigate risks when certain areas underperform. Stay Informed : Keep a close eye on economic news, corporate earnings reports, and global geopolitical events. These factors significantly influence market direction and investor sentiment. Long-Term Perspective : Short-term market fluctuations are a normal part of investing. Adopting a long-term investment strategy often helps ride out daily market noise and capitalize on broader growth trends. Risk Assessment : Regularly review your personal risk tolerance and adjust your portfolio accordingly. Your investment strategy should always align with your financial goals and comfort level with risk. The mixed opening of U.S. stock indexes today serves as a reminder of the intricate dynamics at play in global financial markets. While some sectors show resilience, others face headwinds, reflecting a period of careful assessment by investors. Whether you’re tracking traditional equities or the burgeoning crypto space, understanding these fundamental market movements is essential for making informed decisions. Staying agile and well-informed will undoubtedly be your greatest asset in navigating these fascinating times. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when U.S. stock indexes open mixed? When U.S. stock indexes open mixed, it means that not all major indexes (like the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones) are moving in the same direction. Some might be up, while others are down, indicating varied investor sentiment across different market segments or sectors. Q2: How do the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones differ? The S&P 500 is a broad market index tracking 500 large U.S. companies. The Nasdaq Composite is heavily weighted towards technology and growth companies. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tracks 30 large, publicly owned companies and is a price-weighted index, making it less broad than the S&P 500. Q3: Can mixed stock market openings affect cryptocurrency prices? Yes, traditional stock market movements, especially those of U.S. stock indexes, can often influence cryptocurrency prices. While crypto markets operate 24/7, a significant shift in traditional market sentiment (positive or negative) can lead to correlated movements as investors reallocate capital or react to broader economic outlooks. Q4: What should investors do during periods of mixed market performance? During mixed market performance, it’s often advisable for investors to focus on diversification, stay informed about economic and corporate news, and maintain a long-term perspective. Avoiding impulsive decisions and regularly reviewing one’s risk tolerance are also key strategies. Q5: Where can I find reliable information on U.S. stock index performance? Reliable information on U.S. stock index performance can be found on reputable financial news websites, official stock exchange sites, and through financial data providers. Always cross-reference information from multiple trusted sources. Did you find this analysis of the U.S. stock indexes helpful? Share your thoughts and insights with your network!

Analysts argue that Ethereum’s expanding role in decentralized finance could allow it to outperform traditional assets, with some forecasting it among the best crypto to buy for 15x ROI in 2025. Alongside this, investors are also turning to presale opportunities, including MAGACOIN FINANCE , a new altcoin that is gaining strong momentum. Ethereum Staking Demand Outpaces Traditional Finance The Ethereum validator exit queue peaked at just over 1 million ETH on Friday as the asset maintained its price gains, and selling pressure and profit-taking increased. This is only natural, considering that Ether has more than doubled in price in a little over two months after spending a couple of years in the doldrums. The big increase in the exit queue led to a lot of FUD about a massive Ether sell-off and price crash, but this is unfounded mainly because the entry queue for staking has also surged. The entry queue reached its highest level since 2023 on Sunday, at 787,255 ETH, worth approximately $3.4 billion, according to ValidatorQueue. However, it was pointed out that ETH in the entry queue has already been purchased, so its impact on spot prices has been seen, whereas the Ether in the exit queue has yet to be processed by markets. There are currently around 35.7 million ETH staked, worth a whopping $157 billion and representing almost 30% of the entire supply, so the ecosystem is more than stable. Rising Altcoin Presale Opportunity for Investors While Ethereum leads institutional interest, analysts are also pointing to MAGACOIN FINACE as part of the best new altcoins to buy 2025 . Positioned as one of the top altcoins gaining momentum , it has begun attracting significant attention from both retail investors and crypto whales. Many Investors highlight that crypto whales buying MAGACOIN FINANCE are showing conviction similar to early-stage Ethereum accumulation. Analysts believe its growth potential could complement Ethereum’s long-term story, with some categorising it alongside the best opportunities to consider in the same 15x ROI investment conversation.

With the market flooded with options, selecting the right combination can be challenging. To this end, Finbold turned to OpenAI’s latest artificial intelligence platform, ChatGPT-5 , to identify two cryptocurrencies with the potential to turn a modest $100 investment into $1,000 by 2026. XRP One contender is XRP . Unlike many cryptocurrencies that rely solely on retail speculation, ChatGPT noted that XRP is already experiencing real-world adoption through partnerships with major players such as Santander. At the same time, the removal of its regulatory overhang in the United States has added further momentum, with legal clarity paving the way for a potential spot exchange-traded fund ( ETF ). According to the model, an ETF approval would be a watershed moment, opening the door for institutional capital and retirement funds to flow into XRP, significantly expanding its market presence. By press time, XRP was trading at $2.83, down 0.8% in the past 24 hours and almost 6% over the past week. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Solana (SOL) Another promising asset identified by the AI tool is Solana ( SOL ). Positioned as a viable alternative to Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana already supports decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, NFTs, and payments. It has also attracted integrations with global companies like Visa, Shopify, and Helium, signaling adoption across both consumer and enterprise sectors. Additionally, the upcoming Firedancer upgrade is expected to further enhance Solana’s performance by reducing congestion and cementing its position as one of the most scalable networks in the industry. Similarly, if regulators approve a Solana ETF, the resulting wave of institutional inflows could push its valuation to new highs, similar to the surges seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum. At the time of reporting, SOL was trading at $207.39, down 1.8% in the past day and almost 3% over the past week. SOL seven-day price chart.

This significant announcement, reported by Reuters, signals a potential shift from previous enforcement-heavy approaches. What’s Driving This Shift in Cryptocurrency Regulations ? This new agenda from the SEC is more than just a minor adjustment. It includes crucial rules related to how cryptocurrencies are issued and sold. Moreover, it actively considers allowing these digital assets to be traded on established national securities exchanges and alternative trading systems (ATS). Interestingly, Reuters highlighted that this deregulatory stance sharply contrasts with the crackdown measures seen under the previous administration. It aligns with President Donald Trump’s campaign promises, indicating a strategic move to foster a more open environment for digital innovation. Adding to this momentum, the SEC had previously collaborated with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Together, they announced a policy aimed at permitting spot cryptocurrency trading through registered exchanges, further demonstrating a coordinated effort towards clearer, more permissive cryptocurrency regulations . Unlocking Potential: The Benefits of Relaxed Cryptocurrency Regulations The proposed easing of cryptocurrency regulations could usher in a wave of positive changes for the entire digital asset ecosystem. Here are some key benefits: Increased Market Access: Allowing cryptocurrencies on national exchanges could significantly broaden their reach, making them accessible to a wider pool of institutional and retail investors. Enhanced Innovation: Clearer rules can reduce regulatory uncertainty, encouraging developers and entrepreneurs to build new projects and technologies within the crypto space. Greater Investor Protection: Trading on regulated exchanges often comes with stronger safeguards, potentially offering more protection for investors compared to less regulated platforms. Economic Growth: A more accommodating regulatory environment can attract investment, create jobs, and foster a competitive advantage for the U.S. in the global digital economy. Legitimacy and Adoption: Eased regulations could further legitimize cryptocurrencies as a mainstream asset class, accelerating their adoption by traditional financial institutions and the public. Are There Any Hurdles to Easing Cryptocurrency Regulations ? While the prospect of relaxed cryptocurrency regulations is exciting, the path forward isn’t without its challenges. Implementing these changes effectively will require careful consideration and robust oversight. Regulators will need to strike a delicate balance between fostering innovation and mitigating risks such as market manipulation, fraud, and money laundering. Crafting clear, enforceable guidelines that adapt to the rapidly evolving nature of digital assets will be crucial. Furthermore, the market itself may react to these changes with increased volatility as new capital flows in and new trading mechanisms are established. Stakeholders across the industry will need to adapt quickly to the evolving landscape. Your Next Steps: Navigating the New Landscape of Cryptocurrency Regulations For individuals and businesses involved in the crypto space, understanding these proposed changes to cryptocurrency regulations is paramount. Here are some actionable insights: For Investors: Stay informed about which assets might be listed on national exchanges. Research the implications for liquidity and security. For Developers and Projects: Review the new guidelines for issuance and sale. This could open new avenues for fundraising and market entry. For Businesses: Assess how these regulatory shifts could impact your operations, compliance requirements, and growth strategies. Stay Updated: The regulatory environment is dynamic. Continuously monitor official announcements from the SEC and CFTC. This proposal represents a significant turning point, potentially reshaping the future of digital finance in the United States. It suggests a future where innovation and regulation can coexist more harmoniously, paving the way for unprecedented growth. The SEC’s move to ease cryptocurrency regulations is a powerful signal of intent. It reflects a growing recognition of digital assets’ importance and their potential to integrate into the broader financial system. While the full impact will unfold over time, this proposal certainly sets the stage for an exciting new chapter in the world of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is the SEC proposing regarding cryptocurrency regulations ? The SEC is proposing to ease rules related to the issuance and sale of cryptocurrencies. They are also considering allowing them to be traded on national securities exchanges and alternative trading systems (ATS). Q2: How does this proposal differ from previous stances on cryptocurrency regulations ? This deregulatory stance marks a notable contrast to the more stringent, enforcement-focused measures of the previous Biden administration. It aligns with campaign promises to foster a more open environment for digital assets. Q3: What are the potential benefits for the crypto market from eased cryptocurrency regulations ? Potential benefits include increased market access, enhanced innovation, greater investor protection through regulated exchanges, and overall economic growth for the digital asset sector. Q4: When could these changes to cryptocurrency regulations take effect? The proposal is currently in the announcement phase. The exact timeline for implementation will depend on public comment periods, further regulatory processes, and potential legislative actions. Did you find this article insightful?

In the clip, Eric Trump delivers a bullish outlook on digital assets, declaring that cryptocurrencies are set to go “parabolic.” He pointed to a surge in institutional interest, noting that even traditional banking giants once skeptical of crypto are now moving aggressively into the sector. Trump highlighted how figures like JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon have shifted from dismissing crypto to embracing digital assets. He also referenced BlackRock, Charles Schwab, and U.S. states such as Texas that have begun incorporating Bitcoin into legislation and balance sheet custody. According to Trump, these moves are creating “cracks in the dam” that will ultimately unleash a wave of adoption. Why XRP Holders Are Paying Attention While Trump’s remarks focused heavily on Bitcoin, XRP supporters view such endorsements as bullish signals for the broader crypto market. The XRP Army argues that as institutional and sovereign players normalize digital assets, projects designed for cross-border payments, such as XRP, could benefit significantly. WOW! LISTEN TO WHAT ERIC TRUMP SAYS: „CRYPTOCURRENCIES IS GOING TO BE PARABOLIC!“ WE ARE SO EARLY, #XRP HOLDERS pic.twitter.com/9GN8QrCLy3 — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) September 4, 2025 This enthusiasm comes at a crucial moment for XRP . With recent regulatory hurdles easing and relistings on major exchanges restoring liquidity, the community believes XRP is positioned to ride the momentum of broader crypto adoption. Trump’s comments are therefore interpreted as validation that mainstream finance and politics are beginning to recognize the inevitability of digital assets. Broader Market Context Eric Trump’s comments also coincide with the growing involvement of the Trump family in the digital asset space. He and his brother have been tied to American Bitcoin, a company focusing on mining and Bitcoin treasury operations. These ventures, alongside bullish public statements, have fueled speculation that capital inflows will not only strengthen Bitcoin but also spill into the wider crypto ecosystem. For XRP investors, this matters because market cycles have historically shown that once Bitcoin secures institutional legitimacy, capital often trickles into altcoins with strong utility cases. XRP’s use in payments and settlement gives it a narrative advantage if adoption broadens beyond Bitcoin. Community Reactions The XRP Army quickly amplified Amelie’s post, celebrating Trump’s statement as a turning point for digital assets. Many influencers tied the comments to XRP’s legal clarity and improving market structure, suggesting that the coin is now more primed than ever for a rally. Excitement ran high across social platforms, where the clip was shared with speculation that XRP could be among the biggest beneficiaries of renewed institutional momentum. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Balancing Hype with Reality Despite the enthusiasm, analysts caution that political endorsements and headline-grabbing statements alone cannot sustain market growth. Liquidity, adoption by financial institutions, and continued technical development remain critical. For XRP, the path forward depends on whether increased institutional interest in crypto translates into real-world use of Ripple’s technology and deeper integration in global payment flows. Final Thoughts Amelie’s repost of Eric Trump’s remarks captured more than a soundbite — it underscored the shifting sentiment toward digital assets at the highest levels of finance and politics. For the XRP Army, it serves as both validation and motivation. While excitement is warranted, long-term success will depend on tangible adoption, institutional confidence, and the utility that projects like XRP bring to the evolving financial system.

Company invested $713M in Toncoin, targeting 5% of total supply. Telegram integration gives public investors access to TON ecosystem. TON Strategy Announces $250M Share Repurchase Program TON Strategy Company (formerly Verb Technology Company Inc.) announced that its Board of Directors unanimously approved a share repurchase program of up to $250 million. The program allows the company to repurchase shares on the open market or through other legal means in accordance with applicable law. The initiative aims to enhance shareholder value and net asset value per share (NAV), particularly during periods of high market volatility. The company's executive chairman, Manuel Stotz, noted: “We maintain a disciplined capital allocation strategy and seek to use the balance sheet to enhance shareholder value by growing NAV per share. If the stock trades at a premium to NAV, the company may consider issuing new shares to purchase TON coins. At the same time, if the stock trades at a discount, the company may repurchase its own shares. The repurchase program provides us with a tool to do so.” Ticker Change and Toncoin Focus The company changed its name and Nasdaq ticker to TON Strategy Company (TONX) on September 2, 2025, marking a key milestone in its transition to a strategy focused on Toncoin (TON). The company previously invested $713 million in Toncoin and announced plans to control more than 5% of the coin supply, positioning itself as a public treasury fund for TON. TON Strategy emphasizes its mission to accumulate Toncoin and give public investors access to support the TON ecosystem, which is integrated into Telegram and serves over 1 billion monthly active users. Telegram Integration and Institutional Support Stotz previously stated: “Telegram is the best messenger for the growing global crypto community, and TON is the currency that powers its ecosystem. Permanent capital instruments are especially suitable for long-term investments in TON, which not only has the potential for value growth but also brings returns from staking.” In August, TON Strategy completed a $558 million private placement with participation from over 110 institutional and crypto-focused investors, including Kingsway Capital, Vy Capital, Blockchain.com, Ribbit Capital, and others. These moves position TON Strategy as a leading public treasury fund for Toncoin, offering investors exposure to the growing TON ecosystem while leveraging disciplined capital allocation to enhance shareholder value.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TON|REGULATION|BUSINESS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-04 14:09:22

Both the daily and 4-hour charts show mixed signals, with momentum slowing but buyers still trying to push the price back higher. Meanwhile, funding rates provide interesting insight into market sentiment, hinting at leverage positioning among traders. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily chart, BTC has broken down from its ascending channel and is currently testing the $110K level from below, after slumping below it last week. The breakdown from the channel and failure to reclaim higher levels shows a loss of momentum after months of steady gains. The RSI remains weak near 45, reflecting subdued buying pressure and indecision among market participants. The 100-day moving average is also nearby, aligning with the $110K zone, making this level a critical battleground. If buyers fail to reclaim this range, the next support lies around $104K. On the other hand, reclaiming $110K would signal renewed bullish strength, potentially opening the door to retest the $124K all-time high. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin recently broke out of a descending channel, showing that short-term selling pressure has eased. It was followed by a rejection at the $113K level, sending the price back toward the $110K–$109K support band. The RSI is hovering slightly above 50, suggesting a neutral bias with room for either continuation higher or renewed weakness. As long as the $110K level holds, bulls may attempt another push toward the $113K and $117K highs. However, a decisive drop below $110K would likely invite sellers back in, with the $104K fair value gap as the next logical target. Sentiment Analysis Funding Rates Funding rates across exchanges show that leverage remains tilted positive, though not at the extreme highs seen during previous peaks. This suggests that while long traders are still dominant, the market is not yet in a euphoric or overheated phase. Sustained positive funding means bulls continue to pay shorts, which could add pressure if the price consolidates for too long. Interestingly, despite Bitcoin’s strong run earlier this year, funding rates have calmed significantly compared to the spikes seen in early 2024 and 2025. This indicates that speculative momentum has cooled, and accumulation may be underway rather than aggressive chasing. If funding rates remain moderate, it could provide a healthier foundation for the next impulsive move.

According to Goldman analysts, including Samantha Dart, the scenario would trigger a surge in inflation, collapse long-term bonds and equities, and utterly weaken the dollar’s position as the world’s reserve currency. “But in contrast, gold is a store of value that doesn’t rely on institutional trust,” Samantha said. Goldman analysts ran many models and outlined three potential paths. First is a base case of $4,000 per ounce by mid-2026, second is a more severe “tail-risk” setup that puts the price near $4,500, and third (the most extreme scenario) is where just 1% of privately held U.S. Treasuries , roughly $850 billion, moves into gold, sending the price close to $5,000. At press time, the spot price of gold is around $3,540, down slightly from a recent record of $3,578, per data from Bloomberg . Trump moves against Fed, investors pile into metals Behind the scenes, the Federal Reserve is under fire. President Donald Trump, now back in the White House, has been working to tighten his grip on the central bank. His latest move is an effort to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook , triggering concern across financial markets about the future of monetary policy. The Goldman Sachs report didn’t detail these developments but dropped at a time when Trump’s pressure campaign is escalating. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde also weighed in, saying a loss of independence for the Fed would pose a “serious danger” to the global economy. Her remarks added to fears that political interference could distort decision-making inside the most powerful central bank in the world. Gold has already risen more than 33% this year, outperforming nearly every other major commodity. According to the report, titled “Diversify Into Commodities, Especially Gold,” the metal is Goldman’s top pick for long-term exposure. “We estimate that if 1% of the privately owned U.S. Treasury market were to flow into gold, the gold price would rise to nearly $5,000 an ounce, assuming everything else constant,” the analysts wrote. Silver still lags, but upside potential remains While gold has been dominating headlines , silver has rallied 40% year-to-date, but it still trades well below its 2011 high of $50 per ounce. The gold/silver ratio, which currently stands at 86, is another red flag. Back when silver last hit $50, the ratio was closer to 32. That gap suggests silver might have more room to run. Technical indicators support both metals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for gold is above 68, and for silver, it’s also high, but both are still below the 83 and 88 thresholds hit during past bull runs. The upcoming Fed decision is being watched closely as the next major trigger that could send these levels even higher. Macro trends are also fueling momentum. Falling interest rates, a weaker U.S. dollar, and massive global debt are pushing investors toward assets that don’t depend on yield. With banks expected to cut rates, capital is moving away from cash and bonds into what investors see as safer, longer-term value. Another factor is psychological. For silver, clearing the $50 line could bring in tons of retail buyers and short-term traders, since that level has acted like a ceiling for literally over a decade. Breaching it will likely trigger a new phase of speculative interest. As of now, the Bybit x FXStreet TradFi Report gives gold a medium-term target of $4,000 by year-end, a 14% gain from current prices. Silver, if it breaks that $50 level, could quickly become the center of attention.

Smart Yield Coin (SYC) has already raised over $115,000 in its presale, drawing attention as analysts compare its potential alongside Solana price prediction trends and XRP’s market swings. With practical utilities, real-world payment integration, and a clean audit, SYC is shaping up as the hidden gem investors don’t want to overlook. HashKode audit boosts confidence in Smart Yield Coin While Solana and XRP continue to dominate headlines as two of crypto’s most recognized names, analysts are beginning to point toward Smart Yield Coin (SYC) as the underdog worth watching. Unlike projects fueled by hype, SYC is built on tools that provide usability and rewards. Its Hold-to-Earn model offers passive income without long lockups, while AutoMine turns unused internet bandwidth into tokens. On top of that, the AI Gas Prediction tool reduces fees by up to 50%. Smart Yield Pay bridges crypto with real-world spending, enabling users to use debit and credit cards across 900+ currencies and earn cashback in SYC. Additional features like Smart Swap for cross-chain transfers and CoinSight AI for analytics strengthen the ecosystem. Confidence soared after HashKode’s ERC20 audit cleared all flagged issues. With $115,000 already raised in Stage 1 at $0.015 and a limited 100 million tokens available, SYC is building strong momentum. Can Solana overcome resistance and push higher? Solana has bounced back impressively, recovering from $126 to trade at $203.95. Analysts monitoring Solana’s price prediction trends note its ability to remain stable above the $190–$200 support zone. The SOL chart shows steadily higher lows and strong buying interest despite earlier congestion and fee concerns. Source Recently, bulls managed to drive the token up to $218 before resistance slowed the pace. If Solana can maintain its footing above $190, a fresh push toward $220 looks likely, with some Solana price prediction forecasts even suggesting a climb to $250 in the short term. A slip under $190, however, may test buyer confidence. For now, momentum favors the bulls, with sentiment leaning toward continued upside. XRP volume drops, but recovery potential remains XRP has been moving through a mix of highs and lows in recent weeks. After sliding to $1.90 in June, the token staged a strong rally to $3.66 in July before cooling off to its current $2.80. The XRP chart shows a resistance around $3, while $2.70 has developed into a vital support level with traders paying keen attention. Source With trading volume easing, market sentiment leans cautious, but analysts believe that staying above the $2.70 range could pave the way for a rebound toward the $3.20–$3.50 range. On the other hand, a drop below support might trigger another test of $2.50. Much like Solana, XRP’s short-term outlook depends heavily on how it performs at these critical levels. Smart Yield Coin poised to outshine With over $115,000 raised at $0.015 in Stage 1, Smart Yield Coin is carving its own lane in a market where Solana and XRP dominate discussion. Yet, unlike the volatility tied to Solana price prediction headlines or XRP’s swings, SYC offers real-world tools and a limited supply that could quietly help it surpass both giants in the long run.

This imbalance means locked supply keeps growing, reducing ETH available for trading and creating upward price pressure. According to Ethereum Validator Queue, a total of 833,141 ETH are currently waiting in the staking queue with an estimated processing time of 14 days and 11 hours; meanwhile, the amount of ETH entering the queue has surpassed the amount exiting the queue (823,789 ETH).… pic.twitter.com/Imia2NrglU — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) September 4, 2025 The massive 14-day backlog shows that staking demand far outpaces network capacity, which points to validators’ confidence in ETH $4,500 breakout. Validator Supply Shortage Prime ETH For $4,500 Breakout Since Ethereum shifted from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) , staking activity has grown rapidly. However, the price impact wasn’t immediate because macro conditions (Fed hikes, risk-off markets) overshadowed fundamentals. But since the Shanghai/Capella Upgrade (April 2023), staking surged as new validators joined. ETH rose from $1,800 in April to ~$2,100+ within weeks. Historically, validator supply shortages always result in bullish momentum in ETH price, which this time around could trigger the $4,500 Ethereum breakout to new all-time highs. For better context, in PoS networks like Ethereum, validators replace miners (who uphold the PoW like in Bitcoin), and they do so by staking ETH to secure the network, validate transactions, and propose new blocks. In return, they earn staking rewards (in ETH), meaning if they act dishonestly, they risk losing part of their stake (slashing). Data from Glassnode also shows that ETH supply on exchanges continues to reach record lows as institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity, and treasury companies like Bitmine and Sharplink Gaming are stacking billions of Ether. Particularly from mid-July through August, ETH saw the largest accumulation in history as mega whales (10k+ ETH) drove the rally with net inflows peaking at 2.2M ETH ($10 billion). Source: Glassnode Moreover, Ethereum Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) shows a clear divergence in spot flows between spot activity and the derivative market. Per the data, while there is spot demand in ETH, derivatives-led speculation has been moving price more than conviction-driven spot. It all depends on what is driving price. Even though there is spot demand in ETH, derivatives-led speculation has been moving price more than conviction-driven spot.

Mike Zaccardi, financial analyst at Fundstrat Insights, also shared that ETH is cooling off in the last 10 days, but the overall consolidation looks constructive. In a chart shared with Fundstrat CIO Tom Lee, Zaccardi revealed a resurfacing Wyckoff accumulation pattern that formed when Ethereum did a 54x out of its last base ($90 → $4,866). Yes https://t.co/GAiSfWGwTt — Thomas (Tom) Lee (not drummer) FSInsight.com (@fundstrat) September 4, 2025 According to him, the current ETH rally is about to get wild because “the bigger the base, the bigger the breakout.” Similarly, Fundstrat Head of Technical Strategy Mark Newton sees $9k ETH by January 2026, according to his implied ETH fair value based on the ETH/BTC ratio. Moreover, Bitmine Chairman Tom Lee argues that the tailwinds of tokenizing and AI should propel ETH/BTC to ATH and beyond. In an X discussion with OpenAI’s Sam Altman, where the AI founder talked about how LLMs are making social interaction “dead,” Lee added that Altman is revealing the urgent need for a “proof of human” in an increasingly agentic world. To me, seems like @sama telling us we need “proof of human” in an increasingly agentic world PS: $ETH is at the center of that solution (among others) https://t.co/rFhyeoU01f — Thomas (Tom) Lee (not drummer) FSInsight.com (@fundstrat) September 4, 2025 Lee asserts that ETH, being a decentralized blockchain network that can issue a unique identity for users, is at the center of the solution to the AI rot (among other possible solutions). This aligns with what Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin recently revealed in his thesis that ETH will 100x from current price levels with the potential to flip Bitcoin’s monetary base. Can ETH Supply Shortage Push Price Above $4,680 Resistance? On the technical front, the Ethereum 4H chart highlights a battle between a strong demand zone around $4,195–$4,277 and overhead resistance near $4,680. Price is currently testing the mid-range at $4,345, with the RSI sitting at 41, reflecting weak momentum but not yet oversold. The structure suggests that as long as ETH holds the demand zone, buyers have a chance to drive a recovery. Source: TradingView/ BayirKurdu A reclaim above $4,400 would confirm strength and open the path toward $4,500 and ultimately the $4,680 resistance.

The platform, which has reached a major milestone with $17 billion in tokenised RWAs recorded on-chain, announced the move on Thursday, Sept. 4. According to R3, the goal of launching a traditional finance-decentralised finance bridge on Solana is to bring the next trillion dollars worth of regulated assets on-chain. Solana blockchain key to R3’s tokenization quest As the global tokenized assets market grows, an increasing number of crypto native and mainstream companies look to seize on the opportunity with key solutions. On Thursday, R3 revealed its plan with a Solana-based bridge designed to enhance liquidity, transparency and efficiency in traditional financial markets. The platform targets bringing financial instruments like bonds, real estate and commodities on-chain. With over $17 billion in tokenized real-world assets, R3 boasts an achievement that emphasises its leadership in enterprise blockchain solutions. The company has already made forays with its Corda platform, which is widely adopted by financial institutions for secure and scalable asset tokenisation. Now R3 has also launched R3 Labs, a platform aimed at further accelerating the convergence of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralised finance (DeFi). “For over a decade, we’ve helped institutions navigate the complexities of going on-chain. R3 Labs is the next step in accelerating that transformation. Permissionless infrastructure delivers liquidity, composability, and unstoppable innovation – and we’re making it easier for institutions to access it confidently and securely,” Richard G. Brown, chief executive officer of R3 Labs, said in a statement. R3 Labs will utilise the high-performance Solana blockchain, which is known for its low transaction costs, to create cohesive bridges for asset transfers and cross-chain functionality. This move is designed to enable institutional players to tap into DeFi’s innovative financial products while maintaining the regulatory compliance and security standards required in TradFi. To support the tokenization process as well as enhance connectivity between centralized financial systems, R3 will develop tools, protocols and infrastructure. Why choose Solana? By choosing Solana, R3 is aiming to capitalise on its scalability, which is capable of processing thousands of transactions per second and its growing ecosystem of DeFi applications. This initiative will drive broader adoption of blockchain technology in global finance, offering institutions new opportunities to optimise operations, the firm noted. David E. Rutter, Founder and CEO of R3, commented, “The launch of R3 Labs is a significant milestone in our mission to reduce friction around tokenization and help bring the next trillion dollars of institutional assets onto public blockchains.” Solana currently ranks as the sixth largest cryptocurrency ecosystem in the market, boasting a total value locked of over $11.5 billion in DeFi. Nearly $500 million worth of RWAs is currently on-chain on Solana.

Lai apturētu kritumu diagrammā, World Liberty Financial komanda ir iesniegusi priekšlikumu, kas, ja tiks pieņemts, paredz 100 % no WLFI protokola īpašumā esošās likviditātes (POL) gūtajiem maksājumiem piešķirt WLFI atpirkšanai un sadedzināšanai. Tas ir gudrs gājiens, un, ja priekšlikums tiks pieņemts, tas nozīmē, ka par katru darījumu World Liberty Financial platformā apgrozībā būs mazāk WLFI žetonu, tādējādi samazinot piedāvājumu un radot mākslīgu deficītu. Šobrīd lielākā daļa reakciju uz priekšlikumu šķiet ir “PAR” WLFI kriptotokenu atpirkšanu un sadedzināšanu. Ir uzskaitītas vairākas alternatīvas, piemēram, komisijas maksu saglabāšana kases operācijām vai komisijas maksu sadalīšana starp kasi un sadedzināšanu. Priekšlikums joprojām ir spēkā, un nav norādīts datums, kad tas beigsies, bet laiks ir ļoti svarīgs World Liberty Financial komandai, jo tai ir jārīkojas ātri, lai mainītu WLFI tokenu likteni. Vai padziļināta PENGU un PUMP cenu dinamikas analīze varētu norādīt, kur WLFI sasniegs zemāko punktu? Gan PENGU, gan PUMP, kad tika laisti tirgū, cieta no līdzīgas cenu dinamikas. No 2025. gada janvāra līdz aprīlim PENGU cena kritās par vairāk nekā 90 %, un daudzi tirgotāji izbaudīja Pudgy Penguins tokena neveiksmi. No aprīļa līdz jūlijam PENGU piedzīvoja strauju kāpumu, pieaugot par vairāk nekā 1000 % no 0,0038 USD līdz 0,042 USD. No tā izlaišanas brīža 2024. gada decembrī PENGU bija nepieciešami četri mēneši, lai sasniegtu zemāko punktu, pirms sāka savu atgriešanos. No otras puses, PUMP, šķiet, joprojām atrodas apgrieziena vidū, jo tas tika izlaists mazāk nekā pirms diviem mēnešiem. Dienu pēc izlaišanas jūlijā tā cena sasniedza augstāko punktu 0,0067 ASV dolāru apmērā, bet pēc tam kritās līdz 0,00228 ASV dolāriem, kas ir aptuveni 65 % vērtības samazinājums. Fakts, ka līdz šim PUMP ir piedzīvojis īsāku kritumu nekā PENGU, varētu liecināt par labvēlīgākiem tirgus apstākļiem salīdzinājumā ar laiku, kad tika uzsākts PENGU. Pretējā gadījumā tas varētu nozīmēt, ka PUMP vēl nav sasniedzis savu zemāko punktu, lai gan analītiķi prognozē, ka 4. ceturksnis kriptovalūtu tirgos būs optimistisks. Jebkurā gadījumā WLFI kriptovalūtas turētāji to negribēs dzirdēt, bet, visticamāk, tokenam priekšā ir vismaz daži grūti mēneši, kuru laikā tā vērtība varētu samazināties vēl vairāk, pirms izveidosies patiesais zemākais punkts. Snorter Token ($SNORT) sasniedz 3,7 miljonu dolāru iepriekšpārdošanas finansējumā – labākais septembra darījums? Kamēr WLFI kriptovalūta turpina katru dienu sasniegt jaunas zemākās cenas, Snorter Bot (SNORT) ir ieguvis 3,7 miljonus dolāru savā pašreizējā ICO. Snorter Token ir daudzķēžu Telegram tirdzniecības platforma, kas ne tikai ļauj lietotājiem atrast nākamo 1000x dārgakmeni, bet arī tiek palaista ar savu pašu SNORT žetonu, kas ir pilns ar lietderīgām funkcijām un ir obligāts jebkura ķēdes tirgotāja portfelī. Tirgotāji gūs labumu no konkurētspējīgām tirdzniecības komisijas maksām, kas ir tikai 0,85%, kas padara to par lētāko variantu tirgū, zemāku nekā konkurentiem, piemēram, Trojan, BONKBot, Maestro un Banana Gun jau no paša sākuma. Kopš tā sākotnējā monētu piedāvājuma (ICO) uzsākšanas Snorter Bot ir piesaistījis vairāk nekā 3,7 miljonus dolāru, kas atspoguļo spēcīgu investoru pieprasījumu pēc projekta, kas apvieno mēmu monētu pievilcību ar praktisku lietderību. Lai gan Snorter Token sākotnēji būs pieejams tikai Solana tīklā, tas ir izstrādāts, ņemot vērā daudzķēžu iespējas, un ir plāni laikus atbalstīt Base, Ethereum un citas ievērojamas blokķēdes. Latvijas investori, kas vēlas gūt pasīvos ienākumus no saviem SNORT iepriekšpārdošanas turējumiem, var ieķīlāt savus žetonus, lai iegūtu iespaidīgus 125% APY. Tas sniedz tirgotājiem lielisku iespēju gūt pasīvos ienākumus, gaidot Snorter Bot ICO noslēgumu.",Altcoin News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TOKEN SALE|ZRX|ETH|SOL,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-04 15:29:56

According to River, a crypto financial services firm, a steady trickle of purchases from small and mid-size businesses has built a quieter, yet meaningful, layer of demand. Growing Role Of Smaller Players Reports show businesses bought roughly 84,000 BTC in 2025. That total equals about a quarter of what big institutional funds and corporate treasuries hold. Real estate companies lead among River’s clients, with nearly 15% putting profits into Bitcoin . Hospitality, finance and software firms follow in the 8%–10% range. Even fitness studios, painters, roofers and religious nonprofits have joined in. Most Companies Keep Allocations Modest Based on River’s data , more than 40% of businesses set aside between 1% and 10% of profits for crypto. Only 10% invest more than half their net income. Many buys are small. Western Main Self Storage in Rhode Island, for example, recently added 0.088 Bitcoin — about $9,830 — bringing its total to 0.43 Bitcoin. These small purchases are repeated across many sectors, and together they add up. Business owners are investing 22% of their profits into bitcoin. Our new report shows how in 2025, businesses are adopting bitcoin faster than ever. Link below in the pic.twitter.com/Gs9r6LDHxA — River (@River) September 3, 2025 Knowledge Gaps In The Middle Of Adoption A major obstacle appears to be simple awareness. A recent survey found only 6% of Americans knew Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million. Another poll showed 60% of people saying they “don’t know much” about the asset. Based on these results, River’s Sam Baker says companies often never reach a point of careful review. In plain terms: many businesses aren’t rejecting Bitcoin after study; they’re simply not familiar enough to evaluate it. Why Smaller Companies Move Faster River’s report also notes that 75% of its clients have fewer than 50 employees. Without layers of committees or lengthy board approvals, owners and controllers can act quickly. That structural flexibility helps explain why small companies are more likely to experiment with Bitcoin than large public firms. Committee-based decision-making, peer pressure and reputational caution keep most S&P 500 companies on the sidelines for now. Market And Regulatory Shifts Support Uptake According to Baker, clearer accounting rules, firmer regulatory signals and wider institutional acceptance have lowered some barriers to adoption. At times this cycle, spot Bitcoin ETFs have been buying supply at a pace up to ten times miners’ production, which helped push prices higher. Those market dynamics, combined with the steady corporate buys, have supported Bitcoin’s run. Business adoption looks cautious and deliberate. Most companies are making small, controlled bets rather than bold allocations. Still, the cumulative effect of thousands of modest purchases is notable — and it has helped shape demand this cycle in ways that weren’t present in past bull runs.

Tokens fully backed by U.S. securities with instant transfers and liquidity. DeFi integration allows staking, loans, and collateral use for tokenized shares. Ondo Finance Launches Global Tokenized Market Ondo Finance announced the launch of Ondo Global Markets, a platform providing investors outside the U.S. with 24/7 access to tokenized stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the Ethereum blockchain. This is the largest tokenized securities launch in history, offering over 100 stocks and ETFs, with plans to expand to more than 1,000 by the end of the year, subject to jurisdictional restrictions. Additionally, tokenized Ondo Finance shares will soon be available on BNB Chain, Solana, Ondo Chain, and other platforms, according to the company. “What stablecoins did for the dollar, Ondo is doing for securities,” the company said. Ondo Finance tokenized shares are fully backed by the underlying assets — U.S. securities held with registered broker-dealers. Tokens can be issued, redeemed, and transferred 24/7, while redemptions and minting occur during market hours to maintain liquidity. Key Features of Ondo Tokenized Shares The company highlighted four key features of its model: Wide range of assets – from Apple and Tesla stocks to bond ETFs Liquidity matching – token prices reflect underlying asset values without significant slippage Institutional protection – daily reserve verification by an independent agent with legally formalized rights for token owners DeFi integration – tokenized shares can be used as collateral, in loans, or other protocols For example, by buying a tokenized Apple share (AAPLon), investors effectively receive the equivalent of a real share held by a regulated custodian. Dividends are reinvested in additional shares after applicable taxes are withheld. “We believe that tokenization only makes sense when it makes assets usable in DeFi while maintaining the liquidity and security of traditional markets. That’s tokenization done right,” Ondo Finance said. Expanding DeFi and Financial Services Ondo Global Markets aims not only to expand access to investment but also to lay the foundation for new services, including margin borrowing, staking, and on-chain asset management. Ondo’s immediate plans include launching Ondo Chain, a layer-one blockchain specifically designed for real-world assets (RWA), enabling additional use cases for tokenized stocks and bonds such as lending, staking, and cross-chain solutions. This launch is a major step toward Ondo Finance’s vision of Wall Street 2.0, combining traditional financial markets with public blockchain innovation.",News|Announcements,EN,0,0,ONDO|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-04 15:33:27

This makes it easier than ever for businesses to move money with stablecoins - faster, cheaper, and without the usual hassle of building infrastructure or managing compliance from scratch. Stablecoins have earned the title of ‘the first blockchain application to find product-market fit’. Today, all finance is ‘fintech’ in the traditional sense. The next evolution of finance involves stablecoins and blockchain rails, and there is virtually no modern fintech company in 2025 without a stablecoin strategy. Recent research by Coinbase Institutional forecasted a $1.2 trillion stablecoin market as the most probable outcome by 2028 (up from ~$270 billion at the time of writing). Fireblocks’ State of Stablecoins 2025 survey reinforces this trajectory, with 49% of global institutions already using stablecoins for payments and another 41% in pilot or planning stages. Clearly, stablecoins’ ability to move money at internet speeds without intermediaries and bottlenecks caused by manual processes is how money would eventually flow across continents. Businesses cannot participate in a stablecoin future with legacy spreadsheet-driven infrastructure. They need networks and rails that are easily integrable, compliant, and globally connected. That is exactly what Transak and Fireblocks deliver together. As one of the first payment providers for Fireblocks’ stablecoin-powered infrastructure, Transak delivers developer-friendly fiat-to-stablecoin rails with liquidity, localized payment methods (cards, bank transfers, virtual bank accounts), and a multi-layer compliance and KYC stack . Used by 450+ leading Web3 platforms and over 10 million users, Transak has processed more than $2 billion in fiat-to-crypto volume, with nearly 30% through stablecoins . Until now, institutions scaling stablecoin payments have faced fragmented provider discovery, one-off technical integrations, and complex compliance requirements. By connecting to Transak through Fireblocks, institutions gain: Direct integration : connect instantly via Fireblocks Console or API, without additional custom development Regulatory confidence : multi-layer KYC, AML, and sanctions screening built into every transaction Global reach : coverage across 64+ countries and multiple local payment methods Adaptability : infrastructure designed for today’s fiat-to-stablecoin ramps and evolving needs like NFT checkout, token-based commerce, and new regulatory frameworks “Joining the Fireblocks Network for Payments means institutions can now access Transak’s fiat-to-stablecoin infrastructure with the speed, compliance, and reach they expect — without the drag of fragmented integrations,” said Siraj Uddin , COO at Transak. “This milestone strengthens our mission to make global value transfer seamless and accessible.” Fireblocks is a trusted enterprise-grade infrastructure platform that powers the digital asset economy, including exchanges, custodians, banks, wallets, fintechs, and Web3 applications. Having already secured over $10 trillion in digital asset transfers across 120+ blockchains, Fireblocks is now extending this infrastructure to stablecoin payments. The Fireblocks Network for Payments is designed to accelerate institutional adoption of stablecoin-based money movement. It unites on/off-ramps, stablecoin issuers, liquidity providers, and local payment rails into one open and interoperable network spanning 100+ countries and 60+ currencies . By joining the Network, Fireblocks’ 2,400+ participants can now connect directly to Transak , unlocking seamless access to global on/off-ramps , NFT checkout , token listing, and Web3 payments infrastructure. “Stablecoins create the opportunity to unify global payment rails, but institutions need more than interoperability — they need scale, trust, and compliance built in,” said Michael Shaulov , CEO and Co-Founder of Fireblocks . “By bringing Transak into the Fireblocks Network for Payments, we’re delivering that missing layer: a secure, neutral network that allows stablecoin payments to flow seamlessly across borders and regulatory frameworks, giving institutions the confidence to operate globally from day one.” With Transak as part of the Fireblocks Network for Payments, institutions gain a ready-made path into stablecoin payments, while Fireblocks strengthens its role as the backbone of compliant, global digital asset flows. About Transak Transak is the payments infrastructure for stablecoins and crypto. With its Virtual Account APIs and compliance-ready rails, Transak enables apps to onboard users, facilitate cross-border payments, and support multi-party payment flows, natively within their platforms. Integrated by 450+ apps and used by over 10 million users globally, Transak powers fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat transactions through bank transfers, cards, local payment methods, and stablecoins.

Zuflüsse in Milliardenhöhe und die Hoffnung auf ETFs stärken den Kurs. Experten erwarten einen langfristig positiven Ausblick mit großem Wachstumspotenzial. Ethereum rückt erneut in den Mittelpunkt der Finanzwelt. Immer mehr Großanleger und institutionelle Investoren setzen auf die Blockchain. Mit massiven Kapitalzuflüssen, wachsendem Vertrauen und neuen Projekten wie Pepenode entsteht ein spannender Mix aus Stabilität und Innovation. Dieser Artikel erklärt die wichtigsten Entwicklungen in klarer Sprache und zeigt, warum viele Experten Ethereum vor einem großen Ausbruch sehen. Ethereum-Wale kaufen massiv ein In den letzten Monaten haben große Ethereum-Besitzer, die sogenannten Wale, ihre Bestände deutlich ausgebaut. Laut Analysen stieg das Volumen bei Adressen mit 1.000 bis 100.000 ETH um 14 Prozent. Dieser Trend fällt in eine Phase, in der Ethereum deutlich besser abschneidet als Bitcoin. Während ETH eine Rendite von 132 Prozent erreichte, konnte Bitcoin nur um 34 Prozent zulegen. Anleger sehen darin ein starkes Signal, dass Vertrauen in Ethereum wächst. The number of Ethereum Whales is dropping! Yes, that’s right — as ETH rises, both the amount and the share of supply held by the largest addresses have been falling day by day. But before you say “that’s bearish,” remember: the same thing also happens with Bitcoin. On-chain… pic.twitter.com/WRBlDY68LV — Joao Wedson (@joao_wedson) August 18, 2025 Das bedeutet aber auch, dass neben den sogenannten Walen auch die “Haie” jetzt zuschlagen. Haie werden Investoren genannt, die nicht die größten aller Wallets besitzen, aber gemeinsam einen Großteil der Marktkapitalisierung ausmachen. Auch die Kursbewegungen bestätigen diese Entwicklung. Innerhalb von 24 Stunden legte ETH zuletzt um 0,9 Prozent zu und erreichte 4.422 US-Dollar. Analysten sehen die Verschiebung von Kapital aus Bitcoin in Richtung Ethereum als wichtigen Faktor. Diese Umschichtung zeigt, dass Investoren Ethereum zunehmend als attraktives Investment bewerten. Institutionelle Zuflüsse stützen den Kurs Neben den Walen strömt auch institutionelles Kapital in das Ethereum-Netzwerk. Allein in den vergangenen drei Monaten wurden 9,9 Milliarden US-Dollar an Nettoströmen gemeldet. Dazu kamen in nur einer Woche weitere 6,7 Milliarden US-Dollar in Stablecoins. Diese Zahlen zeigen, dass Ethereum von einer breiten Basis getragen wird. Sie stärken die Liquidität und das Fundament der Blockchain. In August, #ETH ’s biggest holders moved in opposite directions. Mega whales (10k+ $ETH ) drove the rally with net inflows peaking at +2.2M $ETH (30d), but their accumulation has now paused. Meanwhile, large whales (1k–10k $ETH ), after weeks of distribution, are back in… pic.twitter.com/vuDxopPVzV — glassnode (@glassnode) September 3, 2025 Besonders der Bereich DeFi profitiert von diesen Entwicklungen. Immer mehr Anwendungen kehren vom Layer-2-Bereich zurück ins Ethereum-Mainnet. Experten sehen in der Sicherheit und Reife der Blockchain klare Vorteile. Institutionelle Anleger bewerten Ethereum dadurch als stabile Plattform für den Einsatz in großem Maßstab. Ethereum bleibt Favorit der Institutionen Branchenkenner heben hervor, dass Ethereum die erste Wahl für große Investoren ist. Gründe dafür sind die technische Reife, ein erfahrenes Entwicklerteam und ein hohes Maß an Sicherheit. Diese Faktoren machen Ethereum zu einer stabilen Basis für institutionelle Projekte. Auch die Aussicht auf Ethereum-ETFs sorgt für wachsende Nachfrage. Analysten betonen, dass ein regulierter Zugang neue Investoren anziehen könnte. Die Kombination aus Technologie und möglichem regulatorischem Rückenwind verstärkt den positiven Ausblick. Starke Treasury-Aktivitäten signalisieren Vertrauen Nicht nur Wale und Institutionen investieren massiv. Auch die Krypto-Treasury-Aktivitäten rund um Ethereum nehmen zu. Am 2. September konnte Ether Machine 654 Millionen US-Dollar einwerben. Bereits zuvor wurden 800 Millionen gesammelt, darunter eine riesige Einzahlung von 169.984 ETH. Solche Summen sind ein klares Signal an den Markt. Sie zeigen, dass selbst Branchen-Insider und Gründer langfristig Vertrauen in Ethereum haben. Kapitalströme dieser Größenordnung bestätigen Ethereum als festen Bestandteil im digitalen Finanzsystem. Makroökonomische Faktoren als Rückenwind Das globale Wirtschaftsumfeld unterstützt zusätzlich die positive Entwicklung. Experten erwarten eine mögliche Zinssenkung der US-Notenbank im September. Niedrigere Zinsen erhöhen die Risikobereitschaft von Anlegern und begünstigen digitale Assets wie Ethereum . Ein weiterer Faktor ist das regulatorische Klima in den USA. Vor allem Projekte mit funktionierendem DeFi-Ökosystem profitieren von dieser Entwicklung. Ethereum gilt hier aufgrund seiner Nutzung und Infrastruktur als klarer Gewinner . Experten erwarten baldigen Ausbruch Viele Analysten sehen Ethereum vor einem großen Schritt nach oben. Tom Lee von Fundstrat verweist auf die vierjährige Konsolidierung als Basis für den nächsten Anstieg. Solche Phasen haben in der Vergangenheit starke Kursgewinne ausgelöst. Nach der Wyckoff-Methode spricht vieles für einen baldigen Ausbruch. Auch wenn die Zuwächse nicht so stark ausfallen wie in früheren Rallys, rechnen Experten mit deutlichen Gewinnen in den kommenden Monaten. Ethereum könnte damit eine neue Preisdynamik starten. Pepenode bringt frischen Wind in den Markt Während Ethereum wächst, entstehen auch neue spannende Projekte. Eines davon ist Pepenode, das Mining und Gamification verbindet. Statt teurer Hardware beginnt jeder Besitzer mit einem virtuellen Serverraum. Dieser lässt sich ausbauen und optimieren, sodass ein spielerisches „Mine-to-Earn“-Erlebnis entsteht. Das Projekt schafft damit ein Ökosystem, das nicht nur vom Kaufen und Halten lebt, sondern echte Aktivität belohnt. Das Projekt belohnt nicht nur das Halten des Tokens, sondern echte Aktivität. Leaderboards, Belohnungen und flexible Node-Verkäufe sorgen für Dynamik. Schon in der Presale-Phase winken hohe Staking-Yields. Damit verbindet Pepenode Spaß, Strategie und Rendite – und wird zum Geheimtipp unter den Memecoins. Jetzt rechtzeitig einsteigen und PEPENODE im Presale kaufen. Hinweis: Investieren ist spekulativ.

The probe is being led by federal prosecutors who are using grand juries to collect evidence tied to Cook’s properties in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta, Georgia, according to The Wall Street Journal . The investigation started after Bill Pulte, who was picked by President Donald Trump to lead the Federal Housing Finance Agency, filed two criminal referrals accusing Lisa of mortgage fraud . Trump is using those claims to justify removing her from the Fed board. He wants her seat so he can replace her with someone loyal. “We’ll have a majority very shortly,” he told reporters last month while discussing the board. Lisa’s attorney, Abbe Lowell, didn’t give a statement. The Justice Department also refused to comment. But court filings reveal Lisa’s position: she believes Trump made up the charges just to clear her out and install a replacement. She filed a lawsuit last month saying his move to fire her was illegal, arguing that he invented a fake reason to fill the seat and push his political agenda. She’s asking for an emergency order to stop him from removing her while the case moves forward. Lisa Cook files lawsuit to block Trump from replacing her The White House says firing Lisa is legal under the Federal Reserve Act, which allows the president to remove a Fed governor “for cause,” and Trump’s administration insists they’re acting within those powers. But Lisa’s legal team countered last week that she never committed fraud and is being targeted to break the Fed’s independence, with the real goal being to oust Powell. The next board meeting is scheduled for September 16, and if Lisa is gone by then, Trump’s people will hold the majority. But it doesn’t even matter, because Powell is cutting rates regardless. At the center of the allegations is Lisa’s handling of three mortgage applications. The first two involved homes in Ann Arbor and Atlanta. Both were marked as her primary residence in loan documents filed in 2021. That’s not automatically illegal; some lenders allow it under certain conditions, but Pulte claims she used that status to get lower interest rates that are only meant for buyers who live in the homes they purchase. The third property, a condo in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was listed as a second home, but Lisa was earning rental income from it during the same time. Pulte says the Cambridge loan also broke rules because the terms required the property to be primarily used by the owner, not rented out. Still, the loan didn’t explicitly ban renting. Lisa hasn’t denied collecting income from it, but she maintains that she didn’t do anything wrong. Ed Martin runs DOJ probe amid wider Trump push into Fed The criminal investigation is being led by Ed Martin, a senior official at the Justice Department. Attorney General Pam Bondi put him in charge of probing mortgage fraud by public officials. Ed briefly served as interim U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., in the early months of Trump’s return to office. But he never got Senate approval. Republicans blocked his confirmation after he supported people charged in the January 6 Capitol riot. Lisa isn’t the only Trump rival facing this kind of legal pressure. The same mortgage-fraud claims are being used against New York Attorney General Letitia James and California Senator Adam Schiff, both loud critics of the president. The Lisa investigation looks like part of a wider pattern: federal action against people seen as political threats. The odds of prison time for mortgage fraud in America are kinda super slim though. In the entirety of last year, only 38 people got sentenced for federal mortgage fraud out of literal thousands, and the average sentence was just 14 months, according to data from the Sentencing Commission. Also, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported in 2023 that roughly one-third of single-family home investors lie about living in the homes they buy to get better deals. But proving fraud means proving intent, so yeah, Lisa’s defense hinges on the argument that even if there were mistakes on paper, she never meant to mislead anyone.

Recently, ETH Strategy , a prominent treasury protocol, announced a substantial ETH acquisition that has observers buzzing. This move underscores the protocol’s commitment to expanding its leveraged exposure to Ethereum, a core principle of its operational model. What is ETH Strategy and Its Latest Acquisition? ETH Strategy functions as a specialized treasury protocol, providing users with leveraged exposure to Ethereum. This means it aims to amplify potential returns from ETH price movements. The protocol achieves this through carefully managed treasury operations, which include the strategic buying and holding of Ethereum. The latest announcement confirms ETH Strategy has purchased an additional 233 ETH. This significant acquisition was made at an average price of $4,480 per ETH, representing a considerable investment. Following this purchase, the protocol’s total holdings have now reached an impressive 12,040 ETH. This expansion demonstrates a clear bullish outlook and a proactive approach to market positioning. Understanding Leveraged Exposure and Its Impact Leveraged exposure in cryptocurrency involves using borrowed capital to increase potential returns from price movements. While offering higher gains, it also carries increased risks. Protocols like ETH Strategy manage this through structured treasury operations, aiming to optimize exposure while mitigating downside potential. This strategy allows participants to gain more significant exposure to Ethereum’s performance than through direct, unleveraged purchases. Therefore, the continuous growth of ETH Strategy ‘s holdings directly impacts its capacity to deliver on this core promise, enhancing overall stability and resilience within the volatile crypto market. Growing ETH Holdings: Benefits for ETH Strategy The accumulation of 12,040 ETH in its treasury signals several key advantages for ETH Strategy . A larger treasury provides more robust backing for its operations and leveraged positions. Specifically, increased ETH holdings can lead to: Enhanced Market Influence: A larger stake in Ethereum potentially gives the protocol more weight. Improved Capital Efficiency: Greater reserves allow for more flexible and impactful strategic deployments. Stronger User Confidence: A growing, well-managed treasury can attract more users and investors. This strategic move clearly indicates a long-term vision for growth and dominance in its niche. Navigating the Ethereum Market and Future Outlook The cryptocurrency market is known for price fluctuations. Operating a leveraged exposure protocol like ETH Strategy demands sophisticated risk management. While the recent acquisition showcases confidence, inherent volatility remains. Market conditions can shift rapidly, impacting asset values. However, protocols like ETH Strategy typically employ various mechanisms, such as rebalancing strategies, to navigate these challenges. Their ability to make such large-scale acquisitions suggests a robust framework for handling market dynamics and continuing their growth trajectory. In conclusion, ETH Strategy ‘s latest ETH acquisition of 233 ETH marks another pivotal moment. By bolstering its treasury to 12,040 ETH, the protocol not only demonstrates strong confidence in Ethereum’s future but also reinforces its unique offering of leveraged exposure. This move solidifies its standing and signals a robust path forward in the competitive DeFi landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is ETH Strategy?

Introducing the Grayscale Ethereum Covered Call ETF (ticker: $ETCO ), strategically designed to maximize potential income generation on Ether exposure and distribute dividends biweekly. See important disclosures or learn more here https://t.co/ckGhjxi8qi pic.twitter.com/OzSgKisSHH — Grayscale (@Grayscale) September 4, 2025 In a press release, the firm says ETCO broadens its lineup of income-oriented strategies by writing call options tied to Ethereum exchange-traded products (ETPs). Income Overlay for Existing ETH Exposure “Grayscale Ethereum Covered Call ETF is designed to complement an investor’s existing Ethereum exposure by adding an income component,” said Krista Lynch, Senior Vice President, ETF Capital Markets at Grayscale. The fund is being pitched at investors who want ETH-linked exposure with a systematic cash-flow stream sourced from option premiums. How the Strategy Works ETCO systematically writes call options near prevailing spot levels on ETH-tracking ETPs, collecting premiums intended for regular distribution to shareholders. According to Grayscale’s fund page, ETCO targets biweekly distributions—a cadence already familiar to investors in Grayscale’s Bitcoin covered-call product. As with all covered-call strategies, investors trade a portion of potential upside during sharp rallies for current income and potentially smoother volatility during drawdowns. Part of a Growing Income Suite The new ETF joins Grayscale’s Bitcoin Covered Call ETF (BTCC) and Grayscale Premium Income ETF (BPI), underscoring the company’s push into structured, outcome-oriented products for crypto exposure. BTCC likewise seeks to monetize volatility through option writing and distributes income twice per month, a template ETCO now applies to Ether. Market Context and What to Watch Spot Ethereum ETFs began trading in the U.S. in 2024, opening the door for a wider range of ETH-linked strategies. ETCO arrives as investors increasingly use options-based overlays to shape risk and income profiles in digital-asset portfolios. Key variables to watch include option pricing, realized volatility in ETH markets, and how ETCO’s distributions behave across different market regimes. Investors should note there is no guarantee the fund will meet its objectives and that covered-call approaches cap upside when ETH surges. Ethereum ETFs See $135M Outflows Spot bitcoin ETFs roared back into the spotlight on Tuesday , attracting $332.7 million in net inflows, even as Ethereum funds posted sharp withdrawals. The move suggests a potential rotation back to Bitcoin after Ethereum dominated ETF flows throughout August. According to SoSoValue , Fidelity’s FBTC led the charge with $132.7 million in inflows, followed by BlackRock’s IBIT at $72.8 million. Other issuers, including Grayscale, Ark & 21Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, and Invesco, also logged gains.

According to his chart, XRP is currently trading near $2.877 and is positioned at a decisive level. He emphasized that a close above $3.077 could increase the likelihood of testing the $3.40 resistance, which he identified as an important zone for further bullish momentum. The analysis also indicates that surpassing these levels could set the stage for a potential significant upward movement, with Egrag pointing to a target of $6.129. This projection represents a gain of around 200% from the current price levels. The chart includes Fibonacci extension levels, with the $3.918, $5.568, and $9.228 areas highlighted as possible future targets should XRP maintain strength. #XRP Watch $3.077 – $3.40!: Currently at $2.877, all eyes are on how #XRP will perform around this level.

The price is trading above key moving averages, which he uses to support his bullish case. The immediate goal outlined is for XRP to sustain momentum above $3.077 and then confirm a breakout above $3.40. If XRP achieves these breakouts, the technical projection points to the possibility of rapid upward price acceleration. Egrag labels this scenario as a “200% candle,” referring to the sharp appreciation in a relatively short period once these levels are breached. However, he also reminds viewers in his chart disclaimer that such targets are based on simulations and require careful consideration, as the cryptocurrency market remains highly volatile and not fully regulated. Community Reactions The post drew responses from members of the XRP community , reflecting both optimism and skepticism. One user, JayXRP, expressed hope that XRP could finally break its all-time high, commenting that the XRP community deserves such an outcome. Another user, Vincent, voiced doubts about the likelihood of a 200 percent move, questioning where the necessary liquidity and buying pressure would originate, given what he described as current retail investor behavior. These differing reactions underline the mixed sentiment among market participants, with some anticipating a significant bullish shift if resistance levels are overcome, while others remain cautious about the sustainability of such a move.

A confirmed close above these price markers would be an encouraging technical signal for bulls, potentially aligning with his projection of a 200 percent rise toward $6.129. As XRP continues to trade near critical thresholds, market participants will be closely monitoring whether momentum can build to validate this scenario.

Nasdaq-listed DeFi Development (DFDV) has made headlines with its latest SOL acquisition , further solidifying its position in the digital asset space. This move signals strong confidence in the Solana ecosystem and its future potential. What is Driving This Significant SOL Acquisition? DeFi Development (DFDV), a prominent Nasdaq-listed entity, recently announced a substantial addition to its cryptocurrency portfolio. The company purchased an additional 196,141 SOL tokens at an average price of $202.76. This latest SOL acquisition brings DFDV’s total holdings to an impressive 2,027,817 SOL. This strategic accumulation by DFDV is not a new phenomenon. The company has been consistently building its Solana reserves, indicating a long-term investment strategy. Such large-scale institutional interest often serves as a bullish signal for the underlying asset, attracting more attention from both retail and institutional investors. The Strategic Rationale Behind DFDV’s SOL Acquisition Why is a Nasdaq-listed company like DeFi Development pouring significant capital into Solana? Several factors likely influence this strategic SOL acquisition : Belief in Solana’s Ecosystem: Solana is known for its high throughput, low transaction fees, and robust developer community. DFDV likely sees Solana as a foundational blockchain for future decentralized applications and services. Diversification: While many institutional investors focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum, diversifying into promising alternative Layer 1 blockchains like Solana can offer significant growth potential and risk management. Long-Term Value Proposition: The average purchase price of $202.76 suggests DFDV believes SOL has substantial upside potential beyond current market valuations, viewing it as a long-term store of value or a growth asset. Market Position: By accumulating a large amount of SOL, DFDV enhances its own market influence and potential participation in the Solana governance and staking ecosystem. This calculated move underscores a growing trend where traditional finance companies are increasingly integrating digital assets into their investment frameworks, recognizing their disruptive potential. Solana’s Growing Appeal: Why is SOL a Hot Commodity? Solana has emerged as a leading blockchain platform, often dubbed an ‘Ethereum killer’ due to its impressive technical capabilities. Its appeal lies in: Scalability: Solana can process tens of thousands of transactions per second, significantly faster than many competitors. Low Costs: Transaction fees on Solana are remarkably low, making it attractive for everyday use and high-volume applications. Developer Activity: A vibrant ecosystem of developers is continuously building new DeFi protocols, NFTs, and Web3 applications on Solana. This robust foundation makes it an attractive target for significant institutional investments, such as DFDV’s ongoing SOL acquisition . The platform’s ability to handle high demand without compromising speed or cost is a key differentiator in the competitive blockchain landscape. Navigating Challenges and Unlocking Opportunities with SOL Acquisition While the prospects for Solana appear bright, large-scale crypto investments like DFDV’s SOL acquisition are not without their considerations. Market volatility remains a significant challenge, as cryptocurrency prices can fluctuate dramatically. However, the opportunities are equally compelling: Future Growth: Continued adoption of Solana for various applications could drive significant value appreciation for SOL holders. Ecosystem Participation: Holding a substantial amount of SOL allows DFDV to participate more actively in the Solana ecosystem, potentially through staking, governance, or providing liquidity to DeFi protocols. Technological Advancements: Solana’s continuous innovation in blockchain technology could further enhance its utility and demand. DFDV’s consistent investment suggests a calculated approach to managing these factors, betting on Solana’s long-term success despite short-term market fluctuations. In conclusion, DeFi Development’s latest and substantial SOL acquisition highlights a powerful trend: institutional confidence in the Solana blockchain. By accumulating over 2 million SOL tokens, DFDV is not just making an investment; it is making a strategic statement about the future of decentralized finance and the role Solana will play. This move reinforces Solana’s position as a key player in the crypto space and signals a deepening integration of digital assets into mainstream financial strategies.

A buy of that scale could give Solana the liquidity boost it needs to test higher levels. But despite this headline-grabbing news, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , priced at just $0.0021, is quickly emerging as the true “best crypto to buy” for the next bull run. Institutions eye Solana, but resistance remains heavy Bloomberg’s reporting that top institutions may be circling Solana with a billion-dollar investment has put SOL back in the spotlight. The token’s chart has been pressing against heavy resistance near the $210 zone, a level that has capped rallies multiple times. Analysts suggest a confirmed breakout above $215 could carry momentum to $240 or even $260 in the short term. Adding to the bullish case, Solana’s strength against Ethereum and Bitcoin has improved. On the SOL/ETH chart, the pair is holding above the 200-week moving average, while the SOL/BTC chart stabilizes above 0.0015 support. These signals suggest Solana could be set for capital rotation in its favor. Yet risks remain. Analysts caution that a rejection at $210 could send SOL back to $170 or even $150 to reset momentum. With strong resistance, institutions may provide a spark, but Solana still faces hurdles before entering price discovery again. The rise of Little Pepe (LILPEPE) While Solana wrestles with resistance, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is quietly gaining traction as one of the most exciting tokens of 2025. Currently in its presale at just $0.0021, the project has already raised over $23 million, with 93% of tokens sold in Stage 12. With a total supply of 100 billion tokens and 25 billion allocated to presale, LILPEPE is positioning itself as both scarce and accessible. Unlike other meme coins that live or die by community hype, Little Pepe offers real infrastructure. It is building the world’s first Layer-2 blockchain dedicated entirely to meme coins, combining speed, ultra-low fees, and meme-powered branding. The chain will also feature a launchpad, making it the go-to hub for future meme coin launches. Importantly, LILPEPE will be the only chain where sniper bots can’t operate, ensuring a fairer trading environment for everyday investors. Why LILPEPE could outperform Solana Investors are asking why they should shift attention from a proven chain like Solana to a newcomer like Little Pepe . The answer lies in growth potential. Solana, already a top-10 crypto, may rally 2x or 3x if institutions step in. But LILPEPE, starting below $0.0025, has 50x–100x potential during the next bull run. Backing also matters. The team behind LILPEPE consists of anonymous experts with a track record of success in top meme coins. At launch, the token will list directly on two top centralized exchanges, with plans to secure a listing on the world’s largest exchange soon after. This kind of rollout is rare for new tokens and positions, such as LILPEPE, to capture liquidity quickly. Beyond the token itself, the meme coin culture has shown resilience. From Dogecoin to Shiba Inu, each cycle proves that memes and community are some of the most powerful forces in crypto. LILPEPE blends this energy with real infrastructure, offering the best of both worlds. Final thoughts Solana may capture headlines with its talk of billion-dollar institutional bets, but its heavy resistance levels and mature market cap limit its explosive potential. Meanwhile, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) combines meme-driven energy with true utility, presale momentum, and a token price under $0.0025, an irresistible setup for 2025. Don’t just stand by and observe. Explore the presale now, dive into the project’s roadmap and mission, and hop into the Telegram chat to hear all the news behind what just might be crypto’s frontrunner this year.

The flagship cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $112,600 on Wednesday but lost momentum, ultimately settling at $111,756. BTC is down 1.20% during the ongoing session, as it struggles to stay above $110,000. Analysts have warned that a bear market could be due in October if four-year price cycles are still valid. Bitcoin Dominance Falls To 57% Macroeconomic conditions have boosted altcoins as Bitcoin (BTC) stumbled. According to a report by Binance Research, Bitcoin dominance has dropped to 57%, while Ethereum’s has risen to 14.2%. This suggests a broader rotation towards altcoins, likely due to the anticipation of interest rate cuts in September. Markets view rate cuts as bullish for Bitcoin. However, Binance Research argued that historical data does not support that view, stating that the correlation between Bitcoin’s price and interest rate expectations is low and highly volatile. Binance Research believes the relationship between Bitcoin prices and interest rates is complex. Rate cuts are already priced in; the driver for prices is how market expectations for rate cuts evolve. Bitcoin (BTC) To Beat “Red September” Yet Again Bitcoin (BTC) has broken a three-year streak of negative summer returns. However, it is entering its worst month, often called “red September.” September has delivered the lowest monthly returns for Bitcoin, averaging 3.77% across 12 years from 2013. The record has also seen six consecutive years of losses from 2017 to 2022. However, Bitcoin snapped the losing streak in 2023, and the flagship cryptocurrency has posted gains in September for two consecutive years. BTC closed September 2024 with a gain of over 7%. September is also the weakest month for the S&P 500, with investors adopting a risk-off stance and rebalancing their portfolios heading into Q4. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Register $333 Million In Inflows Spot Bitcoin ETFs started September with $333 million in inflows as investors poured capital into Bitcoin funds. On the other hand, Ethereum ETFs registered substantial outflows after another day of redemptions. Bitcoin inflows were spread across investment products, with Fidelity’s FBTC registering $132.69 million in inflows. BlackRock’s IBIT and Ark 21Shares registered $72 million and $71 million, respectively. Bitwise’s BITB registered $39 million in inflows, while Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust registered $9.32 million and VanECK’s HODL saw $4.69 million in inflows. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has registered a substantial decline during the ongoing session, down 1.48%, trading around $110,087. The flagship cryptocurrency started the week positively, rising 0.92% on Monday and 1.84% on Tuesday to cross $111,000 and settle at $111,247. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as the price crossed $112,000, reaching an intraday high of $112,600 before settling at $111,796. Analysts believe BTC could be entering a bear market as it goes through its latest correction. A bear market could be a possibility if the four-year cycle theory is still valid. Some predictions state that such a scenario could trigger a drop to $50,000. Joao Wedson, founder and CEO of crypto analytics platform Alphractal, stated, “Of course, it would be reckless to assume that Bitcoin has only a little over one month left in this cycle based solely on this chart. Still, I can’t help but think — this could be just enough time for BTC to dip toward the $100K range before rocketing past $140K within the same period. Who would dare to doubt that scenario?” However, Wedson noted that the current cycle is different from previous ones due to the presence of major institutional investors and BTC’s recognition as a major asset class. “The real question is whether this fractal will remain reliable in the face of heavy speculation around ETFs and growing institutional demand.” A US bear market could mark the end of Bitcoin’s bull cycle if it coincides with the flagship cryptocurrency’s bear market schedule. Wedson added, “Personally, I’m eager to see whether the new wave of crypto enthusiasts is right in claiming the 4-year cycle is over and Bitcoin will now rise endlessly — or if 2025 marks the final breath before a sharp correction, with prices possibly sinking below $50K in the 2026 bear market.” BTC registered a sharp drop on Sunday (August 24), falling to an intraday low of $110,635 before settling at $113,478. Bearish sentiment intensified on Monday as the price fell nearly 3% and settled at $110,127. BTC faced volatility on Tuesday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price rose 1.51% to $111,788. BTC was back in the red on Wednesday, dropping 0.48% and settling at $111,253. It recovered on Thursday, rising 1.19% to reach an intraday high of $113,480 before settling at $112,574. Bearish sentiment returned on Friday as BTC fell nearly 4%, losing the crucial $110,000 level and settling at $108,378. Source: TradingView Price action was mixed over the weekend as BTC rose 0.41% on Saturday before dropping 0.53% on Sunday to settle at $108,247. The flagship cryptocurrency started the current week in positive territory, rising 0.92% to reclaim $109,000 and settle at $109,240.

It’s now valued at a commendable $1.44 and, at least for the time being, shows no signs of slowing down. And it’s not the only big mover in the altcoin arena. Pump.fun has jumped by over 10% in the past 24 hours, propelled by a hefty $359.2M in trading volume during the same time period. With more capital flowing into altcoins, now might be the perfect time to explore the next crypto to explode to position yourself for potential gains. Altcoin Market Exceeds 1.6T, Traders Rotate Away From $BTC MemeCore and Pump.fun’s rallies align with broader market trends. With the altcoin market cap above $1.6T , it shows that traders are shifting preference from $BTC – despite it being the world’s largest crypto, currently donning a $110K price tag . Also confirming the altcoin market’s current strength, the Altcoin Season Index (ACI) now sits at 55, up from 43 compared to last month. In fact, crypto analyst ‘Crypto GEMs’ suggests that the altcoin market is on the verge of its biggest breakout to date. On a recent X post , they posted a chart that highlights that altcoins surged 34x in 2017 and 68x in 2021–2022 following long accumulation phases. Now, in 2025, they believe the altcoin sector is about to hit another exciting accumulation period. Their prediction points to a potential 126x rally that could propel the market cap beyond $2.1T. With altcoins poised for even more mighty growth, there may not be a better time to check out top coins with optimal potential. We have high hopes for Snorter Token ($SNORT) , PinLink ($PIN) , and Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – and for superb reasons. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Presale Tops $3.7M as Telegram Bot Launch Nears Snorter Token ($SNORT) has quickly scooped up $3.7M+ on presale, thanks to its role as the backbone of a novel Telegram trading bot. Once launched this quarter, Snorter Bot aims to give you a potent edge in the market by allowing you to execute trades instantly, set strategies, and tap into top market opportunitie All can be achieved through its cutting-edge features, spanning ultra-fast swaps, automated sniping, and copy trading. First, you can anticipate the bot launching on the Solana network as part of its ploy to deliver fast execution with super low fees at just 0.85%. Owing to this, it claims that it’ll override rival bots like Maestro and Trojan. Then, it’ll expand to Ethereum, BNB Chain, and other EVM networks. This way, you’ll be able to capture the hottest crypto opportunities across networks without having to turn to different platforms and tools. Best of all, it promises to achieve all this without compromising security. With built-in MEV protection , plus honeypot and rugpull alerts, you can rest assured that the bot will shield you from malicious activity. To also access premium features, governance rights, and staking rewards (currently at a 125% APY), you can purchase $SNORT on presale for just $0.1033. But don’t wait around. Once the bot officially goes live and expands multi-chain, it’s anticipated to reach a high of $1.92 in 2026. This means that buying in now could potentially deliver an ROI exceeding 1,760% – and that’s not even counting the passive income from staking rewards. 2. PinLink ($PIN) – RWA-Tokenized Protocol Surges 10% Following Hashrate Initiative Teaser $PIN is the foundation of PinLink, a cutting-edge RWA-tokenized protocol that connects AI developers with cost-friendly compute power. Why? To unlock new revenue streams for asset owners. Through ERC-1155 fractionalization, DePin operators can tokenize their assets to raise capital for reinvesting in new infrastructure: expanding compute power, scaling storage, or energy networks. In return, those who invest in these fractions gain access to steady passive income, even if they don’t own DePin hardware. If you’re an AI developer, you’ll likely be interested in PinLink’s marketplace that delivers enterprise-grade compute and storage solutions at discounted rates. $PIN powers the marketplace, enabling transactions, staking, and governance. Additionally, it unlocks dual revenue streams for asset owners. And it doesn’t end there. PinLink is expanding beyond AI compute with HashLink, its new Bitcoin primitive. It’ll enable future hashrate speculation and direct $BTC payouts via Ethereum – another avenue to give you exposure to mining economics without owning traditionally pricey DePin hardware. Following this news breaking out, $PIN rose by over 10% . Now signals an opportune time to purchase the token, available for roughly $0.61 on some of the best crypto exchanges . 3. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Offers 172% Staking Rewards, Eyes Degen Trading Tournaments Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is a meme coin on a mission to dominate the $45.1B dog-themed token niche . As yet another Shiba Inu-inspired coin, it builds on the legacy of the top dogs on the market, $DOGE and $SHIB. But it visually sets itself apart from them, with muscles and a bold heavyweight persona that symbolizes its push toward extreme trading and market strength. Despite its meme coin facade and origins, $MAXI wants to bring more to the arena than just speculation, a bit like $SHIB. But instead of launching a DEX or card game like its predecessor, it’s barking up its own path. Despite only being live on presale thus far, it’s already engaging its community through staking. You can lock up $MAXI to earn daily rewards through smart contract distribution. Right now, its staking APY stands at an eye-catching 172% APY. To top it off, Maxi Doge plans to host contests and reward top ‘ROI hunters’ with prizes. For the time being, the key details remain under wraps. The project also aims to integrate futures platform integrations and host gamified tournaments in the future. Then, it’ll offer you a distinct way to partake in degen-style trading. For more information, check out our review . Considering all the above, it’s no surprise that $MAXI has already raised over $1.8M in presales since launching on July 29, 2025. You can join the action by acquiring $MAXI on presale for just $0.0002555. And there’s no better time to do precisely that; its price will go up tomorrow and is anticipated to break $0.0024 before 2026 gets going. Verdict – MemeCore & Pump.fun’s Rally Sparks Growth for Top Altcoins Hype surrounding altcoins is real, as evidenced by MemeCore and Pump.fun’s surge, plus a rising ASI. If you’re seeking the next 1000x crypto , it might be wise to consider projects with strong utility and community hype, just like $SNORT , $PIN, and $MAXI . Whichever one floats your boat, they each have significant growth potential. Still, only time will truly tell their success. So, as always, DYOR and never invest more than you’d be sad to lose.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-04 15:48:34

For a modest $300 portfolio, investors seeking high-upside opportunities can look to these 3 cryptos cheaper and better than Solana (SOL): Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , Sui (SUI), and Ethena (ENA). Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The cheap meme coin with real utility At the top of the list is Little Pepe (LILPEPE), a project that has quickly captured the attention of crypto investors during its ongoing presale. With 26.5% of its 100 billion token supply allocated to presale buyers, the project has gained significant traction. Stage eleven sold out quickly, and stage twelve, priced at just $0.0021, has already raised $1.15 million in only six days. This momentum has been fueled by confirmed listings on CoinMarketCap and preparation for launch on two top-tier centralized exchanges, with plans to target the largest global exchange shortly after. Such strategic positioning gives LILPEPE a unique edge over other meme coins that often lack clear roadmaps or exchange support. What truly sets LILPEPE apart is its utility. It isn’t just another meme token; it’s the native currency of the Little Pepe Layer 2 blockchain, a next-generation network offering ultra-low fees, lightning-fast finality, and secure transactions. Unlike many Ethereum Layer 2 solutions, Little Pepe adds a cultural twist—blending meme appeal with practical blockchain scaling. Security is also a priority. LILPEPE has already passed a CertiK audit with an impressive security score of 95.49%, making it one of the most trusted meme tokens in the decentralized finance space. This strong foundation, combined with backing from experienced advisors who have worked on successful meme projects before, has positioned LILPEPE as the standout choice. For a small $300 portfolio, LILPEPE offers perhaps the highest upside potential. With its presale price still incredibly low, early buyers are eyeing a rally that could multiply their investment many times over in the coming years. Sui (SUI): A network on the rise Sui (SUI), currently trading around $0.90, is another crypto cheaper and better than Solana (SOL) for investors working with smaller budgets. Its technical indicators point to growing momentum, with a converging triangle pattern on the price chart suggesting an upcoming breakout. Rising trading volume further signals that buyers are accumulating SUI near current levels. Beyond price action, Sui’s ecosystem expansion is fueling confidence. Stablecoin capitalization on the network has surged 60% in the past three months, reaching $515.8 million, a clear sign of increasing usage and trust. With a market cap of $7.15 billion, Sui has significantly more room to grow compared to Solana’s $85 billion valuation. For those with $300 to allocate, Sui offers an appealing mix of affordability, ecosystem development, and technical potential for strong gains in 2025. Ethena (ENA): Technical strength and growing holder confidence Ethena (ENA), priced at about $0.63, is also proving itself as one of the cryptos cheaper and better than Solana (SOL). ENA recently broke through a key resistance level at $0.65, signaling bullish momentum. Technical setups such as Bollinger Bands suggest further upside, with projections pointing to a potential $1.05 price target by the end of 2025, a 67% increase. Another bullish factor is on-chain activity. Over 140 million ENA tokens were withdrawn from exchanges in just four days as of August 22, 2025. This indicates reduced selling pressure and rising confidence among long-term holders. With a market cap of $4.2 billion, ENA has significant room to expand, especially compared to Solana’s current valuation. For investors managing a $300 portfolio, ENA provides an affordable entry point into a token with strong technical indicators and growing adoption. Conclusion Solana remains a major force in crypto, but with its high price and massive market cap, the upside for new investors is limited. For those seeking growth opportunities with a $300 portfolio, Little Pepe (LILPEPE), Sui (SUI), and Ethena (ENA) represent affordable, high-upside options, with LILPEPE standing out as the clear leader among cryptos cheaper and better than Solana (SOL).

We are seeing a notable downturn in crypto stocks , directly linked to new, tighter regulatory measures. This shift signals a crucial moment for companies deeply invested in the digital asset space, prompting many to reassess their strategies and market positions. What’s Driving the Downturn in Crypto Stocks? A major factor behind the recent dip in crypto stocks is Nasdaq’s decision to implement more stringent rules. Specifically, the exchange now requires shareholder approval for any new share issuances used to acquire cryptocurrency. This policy change introduces an additional layer of oversight and bureaucracy for publicly traded companies looking to expand their crypto holdings. Previously, some companies could make these acquisitions with less direct shareholder input. However, the new requirement ensures that investors have a direct say in how company capital is allocated towards digital assets. While intended to boost transparency and protect shareholder interests, this rule has, in the short term, created headwinds for firms heavily invested in the crypto sector. Who’s Feeling the Pinch? Key Crypto Stocks Impacted The impact of these tighter rules is already evident across various crypto stocks . Several prominent players have experienced declines in their share prices, reflecting investor apprehension and the immediate challenges posed by the new regulations. Here are a few examples: MicroStrategy (MSTR): Shares of MicroStrategy, a major corporate holder of Bitcoin, saw a decline of approximately 3% in intraday trading. This reaction underscores the market’s sensitivity to any changes affecting companies with substantial crypto treasuries. Bitmine: This crypto-related company experienced an even sharper drop, with its shares falling by nearly 9%. Such a significant decline highlights the vulnerability of firms whose core business is closely tied to the digital asset ecosystem. Sharplink Gaming: Similarly, Sharplink Gaming also faced a nearly 9% decrease in its share value. This demonstrates that the ripple effect extends beyond pure-play crypto firms to companies with significant exposure or strategic interests in the crypto space. These immediate reactions from the market suggest that investors are carefully scrutinizing the financial implications and operational hurdles that these new Nasdaq rules might present. Why Do These Nasdaq Rules Matter for Crypto Stocks? The updated Nasdaq regulations carry profound implications for crypto stocks and the broader cryptocurrency market. This isn’t just about a temporary dip; it signals a maturing regulatory environment that demands greater accountability and transparency from companies engaging with digital assets. Investors are now looking for clearer governance frameworks. Firstly, the requirement for shareholder approval can slow down the pace at which companies can accumulate crypto. This might lead to fewer large-scale corporate purchases, potentially impacting market demand for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Secondly, it could be seen as a move to safeguard investor capital, ensuring that significant crypto investments align with the company’s overall strategic direction and shareholder consensus. Ultimately, these rules aim to bring more traditional financial scrutiny to the innovative, yet often volatile, crypto sector. Navigating the Future: What’s Next for Crypto Stocks? The current environment presents both challenges and opportunities for crypto stocks . While the immediate reaction has been a downturn, these tighter rules could foster a more stable and trustworthy market in the long run. Companies might need to adapt by developing more robust communication strategies with their shareholders regarding crypto investment plans. For investors, this period emphasizes the importance of due diligence. Understanding a company’s crypto exposure and its compliance with evolving regulations becomes paramount. As the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, companies that embrace transparency and sound governance are likely to build greater investor confidence, potentially leading to a more resilient and sustainable growth trajectory for their crypto stocks in the future. In conclusion, Nasdaq’s new shareholder approval rules have undeniably sent ripples through the market, causing a notable decline in crypto stocks . This development underscores a growing trend towards increased regulatory oversight in the digital asset space. While the immediate impact is a challenge for some, it also represents a pivotal step towards a more mature and transparent ecosystem for crypto-related investments. Companies and investors alike must adapt to these evolving standards to navigate the future successfully.

A1: Nasdaq now requires companies to obtain shareholder approval for new share issuances when the proceeds are intended to purchase cryptocurrency. This adds a layer of governance to crypto acquisition strategies. Q2: Why did Nasdaq implement these new rules? A2: The rules were likely implemented to enhance investor protection, increase transparency, and ensure that significant corporate investments in volatile assets like cryptocurrency have clear shareholder mandate. Q3: Which specific crypto stocks have been most affected?

Q4: How might these rules affect the long-term outlook for crypto stocks? A4: While causing short-term volatility, these rules could lead to a more stable and mature market for crypto stocks in the long run. Greater transparency and investor confidence may attract more institutional capital over time, provided companies adapt effectively. Q5: What should investors consider when looking at crypto-related stocks now? A5: Investors should carefully assess a company’s crypto exposure, its compliance with new regulations, and its overall governance structure.

Attention is on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , an up-and-coming DeFi coin that costs only $0.035. MUTM has over 16,000 investors in its ongoing presale, with more than $15.31 million already committed. With increased institutional attention to the network activity of Solana, market observers are shifting their focus towards Mutuum Finance, and estimates suggest up to 20x returns. Solana (SOL) Aims Higher After Breaking $200 Solana is currently trading at $208.43 which is a strong place above the $200 support level which is a key indicator of a long term bullish trend. As analysts note, this stance positions it to potentially break out, initially to as high as $216 and potentially even higher, such as to $230-250 or higher, should current momentum continue and technical levels be exceeded. This positive sentiment is also supported by on-chain activity and institutional inflows, as an increasing body of technical data indicates a resurgence of confidence in the short-term direction of SOL. Mutuum Finance Presale 6 Mutuum Finance is at Stage 6 of presale and tokens are being sold at $0.035 each. The seventh phase will raise the price by 14.29% to a level of $0.04. Over 16,000 investors have already joined the presale and raised more than $15.31 million in capital. Active engagement like this highlights higher degrees of confidence in the strategic vision of the project and its value proposition within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Creating a Platform that is Secure and Stable The project will be powered by a USD-pegged stablecoin that is being built on ETH chain. This overcollateralized non-algorithmic stablecoin is designed to be stable and secure over the long term and not affected by the same volatility risks as algorithmic stablecoins which may lose their peg when markets are volatile. The Dual-Lending Advantage The first strength of the Mutuum Finance as per the proposed two-Lending model is that the advantages of the ecosystem through the application of the model in the efficient generation of yields with the integration 2 key mechanisms: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and the Peer-to-Peer (P2P). A Long-Term Outlook for DeFi The flexibility and efficiency in this two-way approach give users the ability to comfortably move between conventional direct peer-to-peer modalities and entirely automated smart contract lending. Mutuum Finance is the future of decentralized finance, a safe and institutional-quality solution to the heterogeneity of organization and individual needs, non-volatile in the market, and scalable according to the needs of the clients. Stability and Security Controls Mutuum Finance has also implemented a formal Bug Bounty Program valued at $50,000 USDT in a bounty pool and categorized into four levels of severity critical, major, minor, and low. To demonstrate its commitment to security, community engagement and long-term growth, the platform is also undertaking a community giveaway of $100,000 where 10 investors will be rewarded with MUTM tokens of $10,000. Solana (SOL) is above $200 but more attention is MUTM’s growth potential. Stage 7 tokens will increase by 14.29% to $0.04 Good demand and initial momentum has led to more than 16,000+ investors and over $15.31M raised. Having a dual-lending model, a USD-pegged stablecoin, a $50K bug bounty, and a $100K giveaway, MUTM is set up to have returns of 20x.

Which Smart Contract Giant Offers Better Long-Term ROI?,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/ethereum-or-solana-which-smart-contract-giant-offers-better-long-term-roi/,"The battle between Ethereum and Solana has become one of the most debated topics in the crypto world. Both blockchains have built massive ecosystems, but their approaches couldn’t be more different. Ethereum, the first smart contract platform, has gained institutional trust, and remains the predominant platform for DeFi and NFTs. Solana, in contrast, has soared on the back of speed, low fees, and cultural momentum. The question for investors is not which is the better technology but which one has better long-term ROI potential. At the same time, new projects are emerging, like MAGACOIN FINANCE, that open a third direction for capital flows . Solana: The Speed Challenger Solana has a very different profile. Renowned for its lightning-fast transactions and low transaction fees, it has captured the imagination of younger communities with NFTs, gaming, and social-driven applications. While Solana had network stability issues in the past, there have been recent enhancements that have solidified reliability. With its lean design and cultural adoption, analysts believe SOL is positioned to become one of the top performers in the next bull cycle. It is still more volatile than Ethereum, but that volatility could also translate to higher gains. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Frenzy Intensifies While Ethereum and Solana compete for dominance in the smart contract world, investors are flocking to one promising challenger outside the smart contract conversation. The MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale is heating up fast with the final allocations nearing sellouts, with some estimates suggesting a potential of 65x upside. Retail buyers are building FOMO reminiscent of the earlier days of DOGE and PEPE, while whale activity appears to be the backbone of confidence. Since the successful completion of HashEx and CertiK audits, MAGACOIN FINANCE has acquired a unique seal of credibility, setting itself apart from countless imitators. Ethereum: The Institutional Anchor Ethereum still attracts most of the developers and liquidity. Proof of stake and the rapid growth of layer-2 solutions are changing the scalability of this network. With ETFs giving access to traditional investors, institutional recognition has also risen. Ethereum no longer provides exponential multiples, but it will still exist because of its legacy and strong position. Many people look to ETH as the safe bet that can absorb risk in a volatile market. ROI Tactics in a Changing Marketplace Solana offers growth, Ethereum offers stability, and MAGACOIN FINANCE offers high-risk, high-reward variation for traders who care about ROI. As MAGACOIN FINANCE gets closer to the market, a lot of investors are getting ready by spreading their capital across these layers, using Ethereum to anchor their portfolios, and betting on Solana’s future. The modern crypto playbook is a mix of safety and speculation. It combines a belief in what is already known with a smart bet on the next generation of cultural enablers. In Conclusion Ethereum and Solana will continue to be the cornerstones of the smart contract economy with their unique strengths. Ethereum is a secure and trusted institutional-level protocol, while Solana is fast and agile. However, the 65x upside projections for MAGACOIN FINANCE’s fast-closing presale are making the project one of the most discussed prospects of the year. This trio represents the full spectrum of return on investment (ROI) strategies available to the market today for investors who want to blend stability with breakout potential.

This monumental issuance, reported by the vigilant blockchain tracker Whale Alert, immediately sparked discussions and speculation across the digital asset landscape. What does such a massive injection of the world’s largest stablecoin mean for market dynamics, and how might it influence the broader crypto ecosystem? What Does USDT Minted Truly Mean? To understand the gravity of this news, it is essential to grasp what Tether (USDT) is and how it operates. USDT is a stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. This stability makes it a crucial tool for traders seeking to minimize volatility. When Tether’s Treasury ‘mints’ new USDT, it essentially creates new tokens. This process is usually a response to increased demand from institutional or large-scale investors who wish to convert fiat currency into digital dollars for trading on crypto exchanges. In theory, each newly minted USDT token is backed by an equivalent amount of reserves held by Tether. The recent USDT minted event signifies a substantial increase in the supply of this widely used stablecoin. Why Did Tether Mint 2 Billion USDT? Exploring the Reasons Tether typically mints new USDT in response to market demand. This demand often comes from large traders or institutions looking for liquidity to enter or exit positions in other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. Consequently, the minting process can reflect a growing interest in the crypto market. Several factors could drive such a large-scale USDT minted event: Increased Demand: A surge in demand for USDT from investors wanting to buy other cryptocurrencies. Arbitrage Opportunities: Traders might be using USDT to capitalize on price differences across various exchanges. Market Liquidity: Providing more liquidity to exchanges, enabling smoother and larger transactions. Moreover, Tether often mints tokens in anticipation of future demand, rather than strictly in real-time. This proactive approach helps ensure sufficient liquidity is available on exchanges. How Does This Massive USDT Minting Impact the Crypto Market? The issuance of 2 Billion USDT minted can have several ripple effects across the cryptocurrency market. Historically, large Tether mints have sometimes preceded upward price movements in Bitcoin and other major altcoins. This correlation suggests that new USDT often enters the market to facilitate new purchases. However, it is important to note that correlation does not always imply causation. While some see it as a bullish signal, others view it as a necessary step to maintain market liquidity. The increased supply of USDT means more ‘digital dollars’ are available for trading, potentially making it easier for large investors to make significant moves without causing drastic price swings. Key potential impacts include: Enhanced Liquidity: More USDT means greater ease in trading other cryptocurrencies. Potential for Price Action: If the newly minted USDT is used to buy other assets, it could contribute to price increases. Market Stability: By providing ample stablecoin supply, Tether can help reduce volatility during periods of high trading volume. What Are the Potential Risks and Opportunities with More USDT Minted ? While the infusion of USDT minted tokens can bolster market liquidity, it also brings certain considerations. Critics often raise concerns about Tether’s reserve backing, emphasizing the need for transparency and regular audits to ensure each USDT is genuinely backed by an equivalent dollar amount or other assets. Opportunities: Easier Market Entry: For new investors, having more stablecoin available simplifies entry into the volatile crypto market. Trading Flexibility: Traders can move in and out of positions more efficiently without converting back to traditional fiat. Challenges: Transparency Concerns: Ongoing debates about the full backing and auditability of Tether’s reserves. Centralization Risk: As a centralized entity, Tether’s decisions can significantly influence the broader decentralized crypto market. Therefore, while the increased supply of USDT minted tokens offers immediate benefits for market operations, it also underscores the ongoing need for scrutiny and robust regulatory frameworks within the stablecoin sector. The minting of 2 Billion USDT at the Tether Treasury is a significant event that highlights the growing demand and pivotal role of stablecoins in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It suggests robust market activity and an ongoing need for liquidity. While it can be seen as a positive indicator for market depth and trading efficiency, it also reinforces the importance of understanding the underlying mechanics and potential implications of such large issuances. As the crypto market continues to evolve, stablecoins like USDT will undoubtedly remain a cornerstone of its infrastructure. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the purpose of Tether minting new USDT? Tether mints new USDT primarily to meet market demand from institutional investors and large traders who wish to convert fiat currency into digital dollars for trading purposes on cryptocurrency exchanges. It ensures there’s enough stablecoin liquidity. Is 2 Billion USDT a significant amount to be minted? Yes, 2 Billion USDT is a substantial amount. While Tether has minted large sums before, this particular issuance signifies a considerable increase in the stablecoin’s supply, reflecting significant market demand or anticipated growth. How does Tether ensure that newly minted USDT is backed? Tether states that each USDT token is backed by an equivalent amount of reserves, which include traditional currencies and cash equivalents, and other assets. They regularly publish attestations regarding their reserves, though full audits have been a subject of ongoing discussion. Does a large USDT minting event always lead to a crypto price pump? Not necessarily. While large USDT mints have historically sometimes preceded upward price movements in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, this is a correlation, not a guaranteed causation. The newly minted USDT might be used for various purposes, including providing general market liquidity or facilitating arbitrage. What role does Whale Alert play in reporting USDT minting?

While some analysts opine that the crypto bull run may be over, on-chain data suggests that there is at least one more major leg up ahead for BTC. Bitcoin Bull Market Over? Not Quite According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor CoinCare, as much as 50,000 BTC has been withdrawn over the past two days from crypto exchange Kraken. This was followed by another major withdrawal of 15,000 BTC. The CryptoQuant analyst stated that such significant withdrawals are not something that is typically observed near the peak of a bull market cycle. Instead, at market tops, exchanges witness an influx of BTC or other cryptocurrencies, signalling distribution. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes $150,000 As Binance Illiquid Supply Hits Record Highs Although retail demand for BTC is currently fragile, a few big wallets are still accumulating BTC in large quantities. Past data shows that retail demand for BTC surges rapidly at bull market tops. However, the current tepid demand suggests that BTC has “at least one major leg up ahead.” That said, fellow CryptoQuant analyst caueconomy offered a contrasting take. According to their analysis, major BTC holders continue to reduce their exposure to the digital asset, recently reaching the largest coin distribution in 2025. Notably, BTC whale reserves have tumbled by 100,000 coins in the past 30 days, showing high risk aversion among large investors. As a result, heightened selling pressure has been weighing down on the BTC price, pushing it below $108,000 in late August. The analyst added: At this time, we are still seeing these reductions in the portfolios of major players, which may continue to pressure Bitcoin in the coming weeks. Technicals Point Toward Renewed Strength While BTC whales – investors holding 1,000 to 10,000 BTC – may be reducing their exposure to the cryptocurrency, technicals point toward further room for growth for the leading digital asset by market cap.

Once BTC convincingly pushes above the neckline, it could provide new bullish momentum to the asset. That said, there are some signs of caution. For instance, crypto analyst Doctor Profit recently stated that if BTC fails to defend the $107,000 – $108,000 support level, then it may risk falling all the way down to $90,000. Similarly, a breakdown below the $98,000 level could spell disaster for the flagship cryptocurrency. However, the long-term bull case for BTC remains intact. At press time, BTC trades at $110,460, down 0.9% in the past 24 hours.

This early capital inflows also vividly indicates the high level of confidence represented by retail and institutional investors, making MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the most awaited presales in 2025. With an estimated ROI potential of 11,000% and two independent audits verifying its validity , it’s rapidly becoming the investor’s go-to asset for high-upside projects. Strong Presale Performance The presale has rapidly exceeded the $13 million mark due to an increasing base of verified participants and high-profile investors. Whale activity is accelerated and some buyers have taken out large allocations early. In regards to wallet content, there are some big commitments, such as one transaction of around $133,743,750 (73 ETH) – a testament to belief in the project’s longer-term prospects. The entry window is further narrowing with presale stages selling out rapidly while demand still grows ahead of eventual exchange listings. This outstanding performance has already established MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the top-tier fundraising accomplishments in 2025, further solidifying its status as the best crypto presale in 2025. Security and Ecosystem Development Security and Transparency: MAGACOIN FINANCE prioritizes the security and transparency of its operations. The project also received two independent audits from HashEx and CertiK, two of the most respected blockchain security firms. These audits helped to establish its smart contracts’ legitimacy. This provides an unprecedented level of security to the initial investors in its presale market. Other than security, funds raised are being utilized on development of the ecosystem as well as product development, marketing and future collaborators. Tier 1 exchange listing is another goal of the roadmap that could, presumably, provide liquidity and increased exposure upon the token entering the broader market. By highlighting a consistent system and audited architecture, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself to grow long-term beyond its presale stage. Target Market and Upside Potential Analysts have already labelled MAGACOIN FINANCE as a potential “moonshot altcoin” of 2025, drawing a parallel between its upside and that of early-stage projects like Ethereum. With 11,000% ROI projections circulating, the token is being framed as one of the most ambitious opportunities in the current market cycle. The combination of meme-driven community appeal and a trust-based and security-verified design, create investor excitement. With a strong participation from retail buyers along with whale investors, the pace is picking up as more market participants are seeing the potential for significant returns. Early Investor Advantage Historically, the largest gains in crypto are usually made during presale and early listing phases. With the rapid financing and whale commitments seen by MAGACOIN FINANCE, it’s clear that securing positions before the general listing is critical. Once exchange trading starts, analysts expect liquidity to increase and valuations to go up as more investors enter the broader market. The project already has a large grassroots community of more than 13,000 early supporters. When coupled with dual audits, deflationary token model, and roadmaps for growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE is creating credibility and hype. For early adopters, this is a crucial time to get involved before emerging mainstream adoption pushes the token higher. Conclusion With over $13.5 million raised, over 13,000 investors, and the security verified by HashEx and CertiK, MAGACOIN FINANCE has rapidly become the top crypto presale of 2025. Combined with its presale demand, whale accumulation, and intense roadmap, it’s one of the hottest high-upside plays in the market. As the presale concludes, the gains are continuously reaching higher points and investors have predicted comparable returns to the initial bull run of leading altcoins. For many, MAGACOIN FINANCE is not just another presale but a breakout project that could generate exponential returns in the upcoming cycle.

The AI-powered crypto exchange delivers a high-profile campaign with a total of 900K $WLFI in rewards. During the WLFI Listing Carnival campaign , investors can invite users to reserve, deposit, trade, and invite friends to earn guaranteed, incentive-based token rewards. Listing Carnival Reward Structure Highlights Users who register and deposit $WLFI can access a dynamic prize pool – up to 280K $WLFI – with first-come, first-served portions and lottery winners sharing smaller amounts. Additional $WLFI rewards and airdrops await those meeting trading targets or inviting others to participate. Other prizes in the carnival come when traders accumulate a specific volume of spot or futures trades. All told, over 900K $WLFI is up for grabs, drawing investors just as the Trump family boosts World Liberty Financials public profile. WLFI Draws Eyes — and Headlines WLFI isn’t just any new token; the Trump family backs it and promises to anchor digital finance innovations in the U.S. dollar. One of the key pillars of that idea rests on stablecoins, one of the hottest crypto market sectors this year. WLF launched its $USD1 stablecoin earlier this year to moderate success; it boasts a current market cap of $2.6B, though it lags behind major sector leaders like Tether’s $USDT and Circle’s $USDC. The $WLFI token, originally meant to serve only as a governance token, was made tradable by a community proposal . Only 20% of WLFI tokens, designed to bolster supply discipline, were unlocked at its launch. Since launch, the token price has dived; but no one who follows Trump – or his crypto endeavors – can count $WLFI out completely. The Trump family holds approximately 60% ownership of WLF and receives 75% of token sale proceeds. They received approximately 22.5B $WLFI tokens ; when the token launched, that gave the Trump family over $5B in $WLFI. WLFI’s Volatile Debut WLFI’s public debut triggered excitement – and then concern. The token initially traded above $0.30 It briefly peaked near $0.40, before falling roughly 12–50% After landing in the $0.21–$0.24 range, the token now trades around $0.16 That still gives an estimated market value in the billions . And the project isn’t sitting by idly. In response to downward price pressure, World Liberty burned 47M $WLFI tokens, representing approximately 0.19% of the circulating supply. The move should help to drive scarcity and potentially support token value. Will $WLFI rebound? BingX Listing Carnival Boosts $WLFI Ahead of More Trump Moves The BingX $WLFI Listing Carnival could gain even more steam in the days ahead. Trump isn’t done with $WLFI or crypto; the family plans to launch its American Bitcoin company on the Nasdaq later in September. With that in mind, BingX’s WLFI Listing Carnival capitalizes on one of the most talked-about token launches of 2025. And with so many different ways to grab the $WLFI token – from reservations to trading to referrals – the Listing Carnival is a rare chance to get in on the action early. As always, do your own research – this isn’t financial advice.

For those closely watching the cryptocurrency space, understanding the foundational technologies driving AI, particularly the demand for high-performance GPUs, is crucial. This underlying technological boom directly influences the broader tech landscape, including the potential for major public market debuts. We’ve just received news that could significantly impact the AI Infrastructure sector: cloud provider Lambda may be gearing up for a momentous Initial Public Offering (IPO). Lambda IPO: A New Horizon for AI Infrastructure? The buzz surrounding Lambda, a prominent AI infrastructure company specializing in on-demand GPUs, suggests it might soon join the ranks of publicly traded entities. According to reports, Lambda has engaged top-tier bankers, including Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan, and Citi, for a public listing that could materialize as early as the first half of 2026. This development signals a robust investor appetite for companies at the forefront of the AI revolution, and a potential Lambda IPO would be a landmark event for the industry. Lambda’s business model is straightforward yet critical: it provides access to powerful Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) on demand, essential for training and deploying complex AI models. In an era where computational power is king, Lambda offers the infrastructure backbone that fuels innovation across various AI applications, from machine learning research to generative AI development. The company has already attracted substantial private investment, raising over $1.7 billion in funding, with a significant $480 million Series D round completed in February. Notable investors include Nvidia, a giant in the GPU manufacturing space, along with Alumni Ventures and Andra Capital. The decision to go public reflects not only Lambda’s growth trajectory but also the broader market’s recognition of AI infrastructure as a foundational and lucrative sector. An IPO would provide Lambda with additional capital to expand its operations, acquire more cutting-edge hardware, and further solidify its position in a highly competitive landscape.

This expansion could, in turn, alleviate some of the pressure on GPU supply for various applications, including those within the blockchain and crypto sectors. The CoreWeave Precedent: A Blueprint for Success in Tech IPOs? Lambda is not operating in a vacuum. Its closest rival, CoreWeave , made its public debut earlier this year in March. CoreWeave’s successful IPO likely serves as a significant precedent and perhaps even a catalyst for Lambda’s own public market aspirations. The market’s reception to CoreWeave would have provided valuable insights into investor appetite for specialized AI cloud providers. The fact that another major player in the AI infrastructure space is going public so soon after CoreWeave underscores a broader trend within the Tech IPOs landscape. Investors are increasingly keen to back companies that are directly enabling the AI revolution, recognizing the immense long-term potential of this technology. This trend is distinct from earlier waves of tech IPOs, focusing on the foundational layer of AI rather than just consumer applications. Here’s a brief comparison of these two significant players: Aspect Lambda CoreWeave Primary Business AI infrastructure, on-demand GPUs Specialized cloud provider for AI/ML workloads Reported IPO Timeline H1 2026 (potential) March 2025 (completed) Funding (Approx.) $1.7+ billion Significant, including a $7.5B debt facility in 2024 Key Investors (Lambda) Nvidia, Alumni Ventures, Andra Capital N/A (not detailed in source) Significance Following rival, indicating strong market demand for AI infrastructure Pioneering the public market for AI cloud providers CoreWeave’s journey to the public market has likely paved a smoother path for Lambda, offering a proven model for how investors perceive and value these critical AI enablers. Their respective IPOs are not just about individual company growth but about validating an entire sub-sector of the tech industry. Challenges and Opportunities: What Lies Ahead for AI Infrastructure Companies? While the prospects for companies like Lambda appear bright, the journey is not without its challenges. The AI Infrastructure sector is characterized by intense competition, rapid technological obsolescence, and significant capital expenditure requirements. Staying ahead means constantly investing in the latest GPUs, optimizing data center operations, and innovating in software and services.

Unlike many market forecasts driven by speculation, his perspective is anchored in the technical evolution of the XRP Ledger (XRPL). According to him, a series of upcoming protocol amendments will push institutions to accumulate and lock XRP, shrinking retail availability and creating a powerful scarcity-driven price surge. The Technical Foundation of the Forecast Van Code points to three interconnected amendments that are already progressing through the XRPL’s governance process. These include Credentials, Permissioned Domains, and Permissioned DEXs. Together, they form the infrastructure that will enable banks and funds to interact with the ledger in ways that comply with existing regulatory standards. The Credentials amendment (XLS-70) allows wallets to hold verifiable on-chain identities that prove KYC and AML compliance, ensuring institutional players can safely deploy capital. Permissioned Domains (XLS-80) build on this by creating gated marketplaces where only credentialed wallets may participate, effectively separating regulated markets from the wider retail environment. XRP: The REAL reason why I can forecast a huge XRP pump As you know, I love coding, and love reading about DLT. For me, everything that ha happened for the past few years has lead to this CRITICAL capability. If there was ever a switch that would be flipped, my money… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) September 4, 2025 Permissioned DEXs make it possible for those institutions to operate exclusive trading venues, where stablecoins, foreign exchange pairs, and XRP can be transacted with both liquidity and compliance baked in. Ripple’s documentation confirms these amendments have been included in the most recent rippled v2.4.0 software release, enabling validators to vote them into effect and making the vision technically viable. How Institutions Could Leverage XRP With these upgrades , banks and funds will gain the ability to build regulated corridors for stablecoin settlement and foreign exchange flows directly on the XRPL. To operate these markets, they will need to acquire and hold large XRP reserves, which can then be locked into automated market makers to secure liquidity and generate yield. For Van Code, the significance lies in the shift of XRP from a speculative asset to a structural necessity within financial systems. As more XRP is absorbed into institutional pools, the amount available for retail circulation diminishes, setting the stage for a scarcity squeeze. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Scarcity-Utility Dynamic XRP has long been positioned as a bridge asset for cross-border payments, but the addition of credentials and permissioned marketplaces transforms it into an essential instrument for regulated finance. This dual dynamic of reduced circulating supply and heightened institutional demand creates the conditions for what Van Code describes as a price detonation. In his view, the narrative is not about locking retail investors out but about making the XRP they continue to hold dramatically more valuable as scarcity meets utility. Adoption Timeline and Considerations Despite the strong technical case, Van Code acknowledges that adoption will depend on institutional readiness, custodian services, and regulatory clarity. Several projects are already experimenting with credential-based identity solutions on XRPL, signaling that progress is underway. However, widespread implementation will require coordination across financial institutions, regulators, and infrastructure providers. Final Thoughts Vincent Van Code’s forecast is grounded not in hype but in the tangible evolution of the XRPL. With amendments enabling on-chain identity, permissioned environments, and institutional-grade trading venues, XRP is moving toward becoming the settlement fuel of global finance. If these features gain traction and institutions begin locking XRP into deep liquidity pools, the impact on supply dynamics could be profound. For Van Code, this is the real reason why XRP may soon experience explosive growth. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Stephen Miran, a prominent figure nominated for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, has put forward a controversial stance: he claims that tariffs and inflation are not directly linked. This declaration challenges long-held economic theories and has ignited discussions across various sectors, from policymakers to everyday consumers. Understanding this perspective is crucial for anyone monitoring global economic trends and their potential impact on market stability. What’s the Core of the Tariffs and Inflation Debate? Miran, a former top aide to President Donald Trump, asserted unequivocally that tariffs ""will absolutely not cause inflation."" This statement stands in stark contrast to the conventional economic understanding, which often views tariffs as a tax on imported goods. Typically, these taxes are expected to raise the cost of those goods for consumers or businesses, thereby contributing to inflationary pressures. Miran’s position suggests a different mechanism at play, one that warrants closer examination. For decades, economists have largely agreed that tariffs, by increasing the cost of imported products, inevitably lead to higher domestic prices. This happens as importers pass on the added cost to retailers, who then pass it to consumers. The debate around tariffs and inflation is therefore not just academic; it has real-world implications for household budgets and corporate strategies. How Do Tariffs Typically Impact Prices? Let’s consider the traditional view. When a country imposes tariffs on imported steel, for example, foreign steel becomes more expensive. Domestic steel producers might then raise their prices, knowing their foreign competitors now face higher costs. This ripple effect can spread throughout industries that use steel, from car manufacturing to construction, ultimately pushing up the prices of finished goods. It’s a classic supply-side shock that can fuel inflation. Businesses face a dilemma when tariffs are introduced. They can either absorb the increased costs, which cuts into their profit margins, or they can pass these costs onto consumers through higher prices. Often, a combination of both occurs. This dynamic is a primary reason why many economists warn about the inflationary potential of widespread tariffs. The relationship between tariffs and inflation is often seen as direct and predictable. Stephen Miran’s Unique Perspective: Why No Inflation? So, why does Stephen Miran believe tariffs won’t cause inflation? While he hasn’t provided extensive public details on his full reasoning, potential arguments supporting such a view often include: Market Competition: Domestic producers might choose not to raise prices aggressively, fearing that doing so would invite new competitors or lead to a loss of market share. Currency Fluctuations: A stronger domestic currency could potentially offset the impact of tariffs, making imports cheaper in local currency terms despite the tariff imposition. Supply Chain Adjustments: Companies might adapt by finding new, tariff-free suppliers or by shifting production to avoid the tariffs entirely, thus mitigating price increases. Demand Elasticity: If consumers are highly sensitive to price changes, businesses might be hesitant to pass on tariff costs, opting to absorb them instead to maintain sales volume. Miran’s perspective suggests that the market possesses more adaptive mechanisms than traditionally assumed to prevent tariffs from automatically translating into widespread inflation. This nuanced view challenges the straightforward link between tariffs and inflation , inviting a deeper look into complex economic interactions. Potential Repercussions for Financial Markets and Consumers The implications of Miran’s stance, especially if he were to join the Federal Reserve Board, are significant. The Fed’s primary mandate includes maintaining price stability, meaning controlling inflation. If a key policymaker believes tariffs are not inflationary, it could influence monetary policy decisions, potentially leading to different responses to trade policies. For financial markets, clarity on how policymakers view the relationship between tariffs and inflation is vital. Uncertainty can lead to volatility. Investors and businesses rely on predictable economic frameworks to make decisions. If the prevailing view shifts, it could impact everything from commodity prices to bond yields and stock market performance. Consumers, too, would be directly affected by whether prices genuinely remain stable or rise despite tariff implementations. What Does This Mean for You? This ongoing debate highlights the complexities of modern economics. While Miran’s views are unconventional, they prompt a necessary re-evaluation of how various economic tools interact. Keeping an eye on these discussions helps us understand the broader economic landscape and anticipate potential shifts in policy and market conditions. A Crucial Economic Debate on Tariffs and Inflation Stephen Miran’s assertion that tariffs do not cause inflation is a powerful challenge to established economic thought. This discussion is not merely academic; it has tangible consequences for how we understand price stability, trade policy, and the role of central banks. As the debate continues, it underscores the dynamic nature of economics and the need for continuous analysis of how global factors influence our financial lives. The future trajectory of tariffs and inflation will remain a critical topic for economists and investors alike. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the traditional economic view on tariffs and inflation? The traditional view holds that tariffs, acting as taxes on imported goods, increase the cost of those goods. This higher cost is typically passed on to consumers, leading to an increase in overall prices and contributing to inflation. 2. Why does Stephen Miran believe tariffs do not cause inflation? While Miran’s full reasoning isn’t exhaustively detailed, his perspective may stem from beliefs in market competition, currency fluctuations, supply chain adjustments, or demand elasticity. These factors could potentially mitigate the direct inflationary impact of tariffs by allowing markets to adapt. 3. How might Miran’s view impact the Federal Reserve’s policy decisions? If a Federal Reserve Governor holds the view that tariffs are not inflationary, it could influence the Fed’s approach to monetary policy. This might lead to different responses to trade policies, potentially affecting interest rate decisions and other measures aimed at maintaining price stability. 4. What are the potential effects of tariffs on consumers and businesses? For consumers, tariffs can lead to higher prices for imported goods and potentially domestic alternatives. Businesses might face increased input costs, impacting their profit margins, or they might choose to absorb costs or adjust supply chains to mitigate the effects. 5. Is there historical evidence to support Miran’s claim? Historical data on the relationship between tariffs and inflation is complex and subject to interpretation. Some economists might point to specific periods or circumstances where tariffs had a limited inflationary impact due to other economic factors, while others maintain that the inflationary effect is generally evident. We hope this exploration of Stephen Miran’s views on tariffs and inflation has provided valuable insights.

Recent findings from payment platform Bridge show that stablecoin transaction volume has reached record highs, surpassing $2.5 trillion. Data from Bridge also shows that the total stablecoin supply has reached an all-time high in the past few months, driven primarily by the growth of Tether’s USDT. Additional findings from Chainalysis’s 2025 Global Adoption Index report note that between June 2024 and June 2025, USDT processed over $1 trillion per month, peaking at $1.14 trillion in January 2025. Meanwhile, Circle’s USDC ranged from $1.24 to $3.29 trillion monthly , with particularly high activity in October last year. The Chainalysis 2025 Global Cryptocurrency Adoption Index is L I V E! Here’s a snapshot of what we found: APAC is emerging as the fastest-growing region Eastern Europe countries dominate the index, when adjusted for population Stablecoins are surging globally for a… pic.twitter.com/XGdbscCq48 — Chainalysis (@chainalysis) September 3, 2025 Stablecoin Market Fragmented, But Growth Remains Strong According to Chainalysis, these volumes show the continued centrality of Tether and USDC in crypto market infrastructure. Yet hundreds of other stablecoins are also being leveraged daily. This suggests that while today’s stablecoin ecosystem is expanding, fragmentation remains across the sector. Chainalysis chief economist Kim Grauer told Cryptonews that this divergence may also indicate a shift in how stablecoins are being used. “USDC’s growth appears closely linked to U.S.-based institutional rails and regulated corridors, while EURC’s rise suggests growing interest in euro-denominated digital assets, possibly driven by MiCA-compliant platforms and European fintech adoption,” Grauer said. Source: Chainalysis Expanding on this, Reeve Collins, chairman of stablecoin protocol STBL.com, told Cryptonews that USDT appears to be dominant in emerging markets where it acts as digital cash to provide access to U.S. Dollars. He added that PYUSD uses PayPal’s reach to normalize stablecoins in everyday payments, though adoption remains small. At the time of writing, CoinMarketCap shows that the market capitalization of PYUSD is $1.18 billion. “In this space, liquidity and utility outweigh brand recognition, which is why USDT and USDC continue to lead for now,” Collins said. Interestingly, findings from Chainalysis show that smaller stablecoins like EURC, PYUSD, and MakerDAO’s DAI have experienced rapid growth. The index report shows how EURC grew nearly 89% month-over-month on average, with monthly volume rising from approximately $47 million in June 2024 to over $7.5 billion by June 2025. Findings also show that PYUSD sustained acceleration, rising from around $783 million to $3.95 billion in the same period. Source: Chainalysis Stablecoins For Institutions While rapid growth has become apparent across popular stablecoins, additional use cases are further driving adoption. For example, a Ripple spokesperson told Cryptonews that Ripple USD (RLUSD) is an enterprise-grade stablecoin , designed with regulatory compliance, utility, and transparency. “Unlike stablecoins geared primarily toward retail users, RLUSD has been purpose-built for enterprise utility,” they said. According to Ripple, common use cases for RLUSD include facilitating the instant settlement of cross-border payments, providing liquidity for remittance and treasury operations, seamlessly integrating with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and bridging between traditional fiat currencies and the crypto ecosystem to ensure an efficient transition when on-ramping/off-ramping in crypto. These use cases are important, especially as stablecoins move beyond crypto-native trading tools to mainstream financial infrastructure . This already appears to be the case, as there has been a rise in institutional activity around stablecoins recently. Chainalysis’s index report notes that Stripe, Mastercard, and Visa have all launched products allowing users to spend stablecoins via traditional rails. Platforms like MetaMask, Kraken, and Crypto.com have recently introduced card-linked stablecoin payments. At the same time, traditional financial institutions such as Citi and Bank of America are expanding their offerings and may even launch their own stablecoins soon . Stablecoins For Payments Another interesting use case for stablecoins centers around retail and merchant payments. According to Chainalysis, PYUSD’s recent growth could point to a broader appetite for alternative, highly regulated stablecoins in retail and payment contexts. Also on the merchant side, partnerships between Circle, Paxos, and companies like Nuvei plan to streamline settlement in stablecoins. This isn’t only impacting the U.S. Dr. Sangmin Seo, chairman of Kaia DLT Foundation, told Cryptonews that in regions like Korea, stablecoins for retail payments are quickly gaining traction. “Stablecoin users can purchase merchandise by using tap-to-pay or online stablecoin-enabled payment solutions in Korea,” Dr. Seo said. He further explained that Kaia’s USDT stablecoin has become the main digital currency for the mini decentralized application (dApp) ecosystem within LINE Messenger, a popular messaging app in Asia. “When users enjoy Dapps on their every day messaging app which dominates markets in Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand, they can use Kaia USDT for payments. Kaia USDT is now also available in Visa-enabled tap-to-pay, Oobit, in South Korea, Thailand, and the Philippines. You can travel with the Oobit app to enjoy shopping in these Asian countries.” Challenges May Hamper Adoption, But Innovation Continues Although stablecoin growth is accelerating in different areas, a number of challenges may slow adoption . For instance, Grauer explained that stablecoin usage remains partly discouraged by traditional financial players and regulators who are still more cautious about digital assets more broadly. From a user’s perspective, Grauer thinks that the technology remains partly complex and potentially too intimidating at this point for mainstream adoption. However, as regulatory frameworks mature globally, Grauer is confident that stablecoins will move from a niche financial tool to mainstream financial infrastructure with real-world utility. “The potential is immense, and unlocking this next phase of digital financial innovation can be best achieved with increased regulatory clarity, enhanced user experience, and industry collaboration,” she commented. As for the future of stablecoins, Collins noted that growth is just one piece of the puzzle. “We’re entering Stablecoins 2.0—The first wave digitized dollars, the next wave financializes them. Stablecoins won’t just be passive payment tokens; they’ll unlock yield, governance, and programmability,” Collins said. In order to achieve this, Collins said that a key shift will be to separate principal from yield, so that stablecoin users can spend the dollar while still capturing an income stream. “The challenge, and the opportunity, is to build this in full alignment with emerging stablecoin regulations,” he said.

At the top of its list is crypto clarity, supporting innovation, capital formation, market efficiency, and investor protection. According to SEC Chair Paul S. Atkins, “The agenda covers potential rule proposals related to the offer and sale of crypto assets to help clarify the regulatory framework for crypto assets and provide greater certainty to the market.” Although Spring 2025 has passed in North America, the SEC has borrowed South America’s Spring, which starts this September, to symbolize a new dawn for the crypto industry. Atkins said that the items on the agenda represent the Commission’s renewed focus. Atkins believes that the regulatory agenda dubbed “Spring 2025” is “a new day at the SEC.” The SEC is set to remove some regulations from Gary’s administration The agenda will cover proposed deregulatory rules that would make it easier for businesses to get capital and for investors to go to private firms. This will be facilitated by reducing compliance burdens and facilitating capital formation. The agenda discusses amending existing rules to improve and modernize them, as well as address disclosure burdens. According to Atkins, the new dawn reflects the withdrawal of a host of items from the last administration that do not align with the goal that regulation should be smart, effective, and appropriately tailored within the confines of statutory authority. Atkins said, “A key priority of my Chairmanship is clear rules of the road for the issuance, custody, and trading of crypto assets while continuing to discourage bad actors from violating the law.” The agenda also suggests that the Commission ask the public for their thoughts on revisiting the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT), especially after a recent ruling by the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Market participants and Congress have rightly pushed back on CAT’s seemingly endless cost increases and the risks of storing so much sensitive data together. The crypto market is in the red despite good news Although the SEC has called the month of September Spring, its bad reputation, especially in the crypto market, is still the same. The crypto market is at a standstill with most coins in the red. The market has recorded a 1.58% decline in market cap to 3.8 trillion. This is the opposite of what is expected after the joint statement from the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). According to a press release seen by Cryptopolitan, the SEC and CFTC issued a rare joint statement saying that registered exchanges can now list “certain spot crypto assets.” This brought to a close the uncertainty. This allows mainstream US exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Nasdaq, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) to offer spot trading of crypto assets like Bitcoin. This was a major breakthrough for the industry because for years, the SEC and CFTC were seen as competitors with overlapping jurisdiction in the digital asset space, separately sending mixed signals. Now the SEC and CFTC’s two broader initiatives came together, that is, the SEC’s “Project Crypto” and the CFTC’s “Crypto Sprint”. Both programs aim to modernize US rules while keeping up with fast-moving global markets.

Bitcoin Wallet Moving After 13 Years: From $4,400 to $53 Million According to Onchain data, a total of 81.25 BTC ($9 million) was moved from the wallet in five transactions between 05:36 and 12:29. The wallet last sent 4 BTC ($44) in November 2012, when its 398 BTC balance was worth only $4,400. Over the next 18 months, the wallet received approximately 81 more BTC, with only small transactions occurring thereafter. The BTC in the latest transfers was transferred from the older “16fXT” P2PKH address to the more modern “bc1q” SegWit addresses. According to onchain analytics platform Arkham, the majority of the funds have not yet been transferred elsewhere and are sitting in unidentified addresses. Therefore, the purpose of the transfers and the identity of the wallet owner remain unknown. As of today, with Bitcoin trading at $111,000, the value of these assets has increased 10,000-fold since 2012. The wallet currently holds 398.44 BTC ($44.2 million). Recently, there has been a noticeable increase in activity among legacy wallets known as “Bitcoin OG.” In July, Galaxy Digital sold off 80,000 BTC ($9 billion) as part of its succession planning. More recently, another whale began converting its billions of dollars worth of BTC into Ethereum (ETH). This latest development shows that early-stage investors, who have been inactive for a long time, are starting to play a role in the market again. *This is not investment advice.

This monumental achievement, initially highlighted by CoinDesk, underscores a growing trend of corporate adoption and confidence in the leading cryptocurrency. It’s a clear signal that Bitcoin is increasingly viewed not just as a speculative asset, but as a strategic reserve asset for major corporations worldwide. What’s Driving the Phenomenal Growth in Public BTC Holdings? The journey of Bitcoin from a niche digital currency to a staple in corporate balance sheets has been remarkable. Several factors contribute to this accelerating trend of Public BTC Holdings . Companies are increasingly seeking alternatives to traditional treasury management, especially in an era of persistent inflation and economic uncertainty. Bitcoin offers a unique value proposition as a decentralized, scarce asset with a fixed supply, making it an attractive inflation hedge. Furthermore, the growing institutional infrastructure around Bitcoin, including regulated exchanges, custody solutions, and investment products, has made it easier and safer for public companies to acquire and hold large amounts of BTC. The perception of Bitcoin has evolved, moving from a volatile, speculative investment to a legitimate store of value and a potential long-term growth asset. MicroStrategy’s Bold Bet: A Catalyst for Corporate Public BTC Holdings When discussing Public BTC Holdings , it’s impossible to overlook MicroStrategy (MSTR). This business intelligence firm has become synonymous with corporate Bitcoin adoption, holding an astounding 636,505 BTC. This figure alone accounts for roughly 63.6% of the total Bitcoin held by all publicly listed companies. Under the visionary leadership of Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy began its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy in 2020, positioning the company as a pioneer in this space. MicroStrategy’s audacious move not only provided a template for other corporations but also demonstrated a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s future. Their strategy, which involved using corporate cash reserves and even debt to acquire more Bitcoin, sent a powerful message to the market: Bitcoin can be a primary treasury asset. This bold stance has undeniably influenced other companies to explore their own Bitcoin strategies, contributing significantly to the overall increase in Public BTC Holdings . The Strategic Advantages of Increasing Public BTC Holdings Why are more companies joining the ranks of Bitcoin holders? The benefits extend beyond simply holding a volatile asset. For many, integrating Bitcoin into their treasury strategy offers a multitude of advantages: Inflation Hedge: In an environment where fiat currencies are subject to devaluation, Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins makes it a robust hedge against inflation, preserving purchasing power over time. Portfolio Diversification: Adding Bitcoin can diversify a company’s treasury assets, reducing reliance on traditional financial instruments and potentially enhancing overall portfolio resilience. Long-Term Value Appreciation: Many proponents believe Bitcoin is still in its early stages of adoption and has significant long-term growth potential, offering substantial returns on investment. Innovation and Forward-Thinking Image: Embracing Bitcoin can signal a company’s commitment to innovation and adaptability, appealing to a tech-savvy investor base and a younger demographic. These strategic considerations highlight why the trend of increasing Public BTC Holdings is not just a fleeting fad but a calculated move by forward-thinking corporations. Navigating the Challenges of Corporate Public BTC Holdings While the benefits are compelling, companies venturing into Public BTC Holdings must also navigate a unique set of challenges. It’s not a decision to be taken lightly, and thorough due diligence is essential: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its significant price swings. While this can offer opportunities for growth, it also presents risks to a company’s balance sheet and requires a high tolerance for risk. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Companies must stay abreast of changing laws and compliance requirements, which can vary significantly by jurisdiction. Security Concerns: Holding large amounts of Bitcoin necessitates robust security measures to protect against hacks, theft, and loss. Secure custody solutions are paramount. Accounting and Reporting: The accounting treatment for Bitcoin can be complex, often requiring companies to mark their holdings to market, which can introduce volatility into financial statements. Addressing these challenges requires expert advice, sophisticated risk management, and a clear understanding of the digital asset space. The milestone of Public BTC Holdings exceeding one million Bitcoin is more than just a number; it represents a fundamental shift in corporate finance. It signifies a growing acknowledgment of Bitcoin’s enduring value and its potential to redefine treasury strategies for the 21st century. As more companies witness the pioneers’ successes, this trend is likely to continue, further cementing Bitcoin’s role in the global economy. The future of corporate balance sheets looks increasingly digital. Frequently Asked Questions About Public BTC Holdings Here are some common questions regarding companies holding Bitcoin: Which public company holds the most Bitcoin? MicroStrategy (MSTR) is by far the largest public holder of Bitcoin, with over 636,505 BTC, accounting for a significant majority of all corporate holdings. Why are public companies buying Bitcoin? Companies are acquiring Bitcoin for various strategic reasons, including using it as an inflation hedge, a treasury reserve asset, a diversification tool for their balance sheets, and as a long-term investment with potential for appreciation. Is it risky for companies to hold Bitcoin? Yes, holding Bitcoin comes with risks such as price volatility, evolving regulatory landscapes, and the need for robust security measures to protect against theft. Companies must carefully assess these risks. How do companies account for Bitcoin on their balance sheets? Under current accounting rules (e.g., US GAAP), Bitcoin is often treated as an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life. It is typically recorded at cost and then subject to impairment if its fair value drops below the carrying amount, which can introduce volatility into financial statements.

Paired with other initiatives like ShibBurn and the upcoming election of a Shiba Inu President – a proposal endorsed by the project’s top developers – the stage looks set for the next leg up for SHIB. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB Could Deliver a 119% Gain Once It Steps Out of Consolidation SHIB has been trading in a tight range, finding consistent support around $0.000012 , even as it continues to form a series of lower highs – signaling ongoing price compression and a potential breakout setup. As a result, a descending triangle has formed that could lead to a big explosive move if it can successfully break out. A breakout above $0.00001400 could trigger a sharp rally toward $0.000026 , representing a potential 119% gain in the near term. While momentum indicators still reflect consolidation, the next decisive move will likely set the tone for SHIB’s trajectory in the coming weeks .
