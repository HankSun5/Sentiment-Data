Ethereum and Stellar remain central to the crypto infrastructure. Stellar excels in quick, affordable cross-border payments, while Ethereum anchors DeFi, smart contracts, and staking networks. Together, they bring reliability and widespread utility to the crypto ecosystem. But another name is rising quickly among the top altcoins. BlockDAG’s ongoing presale has already brought in $395 million, with more than 25 billion tokens sold at a standardized price of $0.0013 introduced till the BDAG Deployment Event. This change replaced bonus tiers with a clear flat-rate system to ensure fairness for all buyers. With 3 million users on the X1 app, over 19,000 mining rigs in operation, and a developer network building 300-plus decentralized applications, BlockDAG(BDAG) is proving it has both strong fundamentals and significant momentum. That makes it a serious player among today’s top altcoins with real growth potential. XLM Remains Reliable But Breakout Potential Seems Limited Stellar (XLM) is currently priced near $0.39, driven by its strength in low-cost, real-time international transactions. Its role in serving banks and payment providers has established a track record of dependable use, which continues to lend credibility to the network. Stellar’s global payment utility remains an important piece of the broader blockchain economy. Still, while the technology is sound, the price has struggled to show breakout behavior. Even after climbing more than 300% over the past year, recent performance appears stagnant when compared with other top altcoins. Liquidity is present, yet the potential for rapid gains seems capped. Investors often look to Stellar as a steady part of their portfolio rather than a high-growth vehicle. In comparison to newer projects like BlockDAG, Stellar’s slow and stable profile stands in contrast to the aggressive expansion many are now seeking. It holds value as a trusted platform, but it lacks the explosive momentum that characterizes early-stage projects with big upside potential. Ethereum’s Institutional Strength Drives Price Ethereum remains one of the most dominant forces in crypto, with analysts placing price targets between $7,500 and $12,000. Its momentum is supported by steady staking participation, a leading role in decentralized finance, and a regulatory environment that has grown more favorable in recent months. Institutions continue to increase exposure, adding to Ethereum’s already deep liquidity and reputation for stability. Technically, Ethereum has room to extend its rally if current support zones remain intact. These bullish factors reinforce the view that Ethereum is a core long-term asset. However, its already massive market cap makes explosive short-term returns more difficult to achieve. For those building diversified portfolios, Ethereum remains a cornerstone. But for those looking for the top altcoins with faster growth, smaller cap projects with room to scale like BlockDAG are drawing more attention. Ethereum’s track record offers trust, while BlockDAG offers momentum and untapped upside. BlockDAG’s Ecosystem Expands Rapidly With Real Users, Developers, & Mining Power BlockDAG’s presale success is more than just hype. With over $395 million raised and presale pricing now fixed at $0.0013 following the BDAG Deployment Event, early buyers who entered at launch are sitting on 2,900% ROI. The updated flat-rate model was designed to simplify access and align long-term incentives. Under the hood, BlockDAG runs on a hybrid DAG and Proof of Work model with full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. It processes up to 10,000 transactions per second, supporting developers familiar with Ethereum tools while improving scalability and efficiency. This makes it easy for teams to migrate existing applications, helping grow the ecosystem faster. Adoption metrics are also on the rise. The X1 mining app has 3 million users, and more than 19,000 mining devices across the X10, X30, and X100 series are already active. On the development side, over 4,500 builders are working on 300-plus decentralized applications. These numbers show that BlockDAG isn’t just preparing for launch; it’s actively growing into a full-scale crypto platform. Combining advanced tech, a real user base, and growing developer interest, BlockDAG sets a new bar for what early-stage top altcoins can achieve. Final Take: BlockDAG Gains Ground While XLM & ETH Plateau Stellar offers stability and proven use cases in the global payments space, but its price action shows that its growth may be tapering off. Ethereum continues to dominate the ecosystem with strong fundamentals and growing institutional support, but its massive size limits how quickly it can deliver sharp returns. BlockDAG, by contrast, is moving fast. With $395 million raised and presale pricing at $0.0013 set till the BDAG Deployment Event, the project has aligned transparency with momentum. This new pricing approach reinforces equal opportunity for all participants, replacing bonus-driven confusion with a fair and accessible system. For those exploring the top altcoins with higher return potential, BlockDAG clearly stands out. As the crypto landscape evolves heading into 2025, BlockDAG is not just keeping up, it’s leading the charge.

51149019,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=177364,1756940430,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/51149019.jpeg,Don’t Miss Out: This Crypto Trio Could Explode,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/dont-miss-out-this-crypto-trio-could-explode/,"Crypto thrives on speed and conviction. Every cycle, fortunes are made not just by buying the leaders, but by spotting the tokens on the edge of breakout momentum. With Bitcoin consolidating after pushing beyond six figures in 2025, attention has shifted toward altcoins where upside remains exponential. Analysts reviewing market setups say this rotation is already underway, with capital flowing into projects that can capture both retail excitement and institutional interest. Among the many contenders, three names are repeatedly flagged: Cardano (ADA) for governance-driven stability, PEPE for meme liquidity, and MAGACOIN FINANCE for retail-driven ignition. Each plays a different role, but forecasts suggest one may deliver gains that outshine the others. Cardano: long-term patience Cardano has been building quietly since its inception, focusing on peer-reviewed research and methodical development. This steady approach culminated in the Voltaire upgrade in 2025, introducing on-chain governance and giving ADA holders direct control over treasury spending and network changes. The move put Cardano in a category few can claim—true decentralization at the protocol level. Price action has been less dramatic, but stability has its rewards. ADA currently trades near $0.80 , with analysts forecasting potential highs of $6 by 2026. That represents a meaningful 6-7x return, particularly attractive for investors seeking lower volatility exposure. Yet compared to tokens capable of 20x or 50x surges, Cardano’s ceiling is modest. Its future lies in steady ecosystem growth, not parabolic rallies. PEPE: meme resilience If ADA represents patience, PEPE embodies velocity. Launched in 2023 with little more than a meme and a name, PEPE quickly climbed into the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Despite wild volatility, it remains one of the most liquid meme coins, with trading pairs active across every major exchange. What drives PEPE is not technology but cultural permanence. Memes thrive in attention economies, and PEPE’s simplicity makes it endlessly repeatable across Twitter, TikTok, and Telegram. Analysts believe it could stage another major rally if retail rotates heavily into meme coins, with projections of 5-10x upside by 2026. However, skeptics warn that without new mechanics or innovation, PEPE could face diminishing returns compared to younger cultural tokens designed for the next cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE: the breakout contender While ADA builds patiently and PEPE thrives on recognition, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the cultural ignition point. Its presale rounds have sold out at record speed, drawing thousands of early investors and even whale wallets positioning ahead of listings. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE different is its blend of credibility and virality. Unlike older meme coins that relied solely on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already completed audits by HashEx and CertiK , giving it legitimacy that meme-driven projects often lack. At the same time, it is designed for cultural magnetism, Trump themed branding that is instantly recognizable, meme-ready, and capable of spreading across communities at scale. Analysts forecast MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver up to 45x ROI , citing three drivers: Presale scarcity: allocations are shrinking as rounds sell out faster than expected. Community visibility: its presence across Telegram and X is growing daily, creating viral flywheels. Timing: launching at the start of what some analysts call the “final easy cycle” gives it maximum exposure while still under the radar. For retail traders, the appeal lies in stack psychology. Unlike ADA or PEPE, which require larger allocations to feel significant, MAGACOIN FINANCE lets buyers accumulate millions of tokens at low cost. This creates viral loops of screenshots, memes, and word-of-mouth momentum, the same psychological ignition that once propelled PEPE to the stratosphere. Why timing matters Crypto is unforgiving to latecomers. Investors who entered PEPE or DOGE after mainstream headlines still profited, but their multiples were a fraction of early adopters. The same was true for Solana and even Ethereum. Conviction before consensus has always defined the biggest winners. MAGACOIN FINANCE sits precisely at that juncture today: no longer a whisper, but not yet a mainstream phenomenon. For investors, the question is not whether it can gain traction, it already has, but whether they will act while the presale still offers exponential asymmetry. Balancing strategies Each of these tokens plays a role in portfolio construction. Cardano anchors with governance and credibility. PEPE ensures exposure to meme liquidity and cultural flows. MAGACOIN FINANCE delivers the asymmetric play, designed for viral adoption and exponential upside. Analysts argue that blending all three may offer balance, but for those chasing the highest potential profits by 2026, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the clear contender. Conclusion Cardano will continue its long march toward governance maturity. PEPE will remain a fixture of meme coin culture. Both will reward investors who hold through volatility. But when it comes to transformational upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE, with forecasts of 45x returns, surging presale demand, and Trump themed ignition, emerges as the standout story. For those waiting for mainstream confirmation, history shows the biggest gains may already be gone by then.

51151224,573375,1756940448,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,Ethereum Open Interest Holds Firm at $8.4B: Why Traders Aren’t Flinching Despite Price Pressure,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-open-interest-holds-firm-8-4b-why-traders/,"Ethereum (ETH) has slipped 5.5% in the past seven days, with today’s decline adding another 1.4% as prices struggle near $4,400. Yet, despite the turbulence, derivatives data shows remarkable resilience. According to CryptoQuant, Binance’s Ethereum open interest (OI) has remained steady above $8.4 billion, even after ETH dipped below $4,400 this week. Typically, sharp price pullbacks trigger a significant drop in OI as traders unwind leveraged positions. This time, however, ETH traders are holding firm, suggesting either expectations of a rebound or a lack of conviction in further downside momentum. The moderation in OI contraction , down just 3.4% in 24 hours compared to -6.25% earlier this week, further supports the idea that aggressive deleveraging is losing steam. Ethereum Buyers Absorbing Pressure Despite Negative Flows Market sentiment still leans bearish, with Binance’s Net Taker Volume consistently negative, ranging between -1.08 billion and -1.11 billion. This indicates sellers remain aggressive. However, the fact that OI is holding steady suggests buyers are quietly absorbing pressure rather than retreating completely. Spot market activity adds another layer of optimism. Daily exchange withdrawals have regularly exceeded 120,000 ETH across platforms like Binance and Kraken. Such outflows reduce sell-side liquidity and hint at longer-term accumulation strategies. Whether these flows reflect institutional custodial moves or retail positioning, they tighten exchange reserves and create conditions less favorable for extended sell-offs. A Possible Bear Trap Before “Uptober”? Technically, Ethereum’s chart resembles a bearish head-and-shoulders formation, raising alarms about further downside. Yet, some analysts argue this could be one of the “biggest bear traps” forming in the market. Crypto strategist Johnny Woo pointed to the $3,800–$4,100 range as a key support zone. Should ETH hold above this level, traders sidelined by bearish sentiment may be forced to re-enter at higher levels, fueling an upside reversal. Historically, October has often brought relief rallies, dubbed “Uptober” by traders, suggesting that Ethereum’s current weakness might set the stage for a surprise rebound. For now, Ethereum faces the challenge of shaking off September’s pressure while holding critical support. If buyers continue absorbing sell-side flows and OI stability persists, the stage could be set for a bullish counterattack heading into the final quarter of 2025.

But what I’ve experienced on the ground has always been in stark contrast to the harsh realities of economic data. Today, there are less than 50 unicorn businesses that have emerged from Latin America, a region covering 20 countries and 600 million people. To put that in comparison, its neighbour the United States boasts in excess of 1,200 start-ups valued in excess of $1 billion, and the U.S. has just 40% of LATAM’s population. It’s undeniably true that Latin America has a wealth of resources. Yet, for some reason its entrepreneurial and investment potential has not yet been truly fulfilled. This led us to undertake a detailed study of eight Latin American countries to better understand what is holding the region back, and what can be done to fuel growth. In particular, we explored the role that tokenisation could play in unlocking capital and give the region greater participation in global markets. In our Latin America Market Inclusion Report we spoke to experts across the region including market analysts, lawyers, stockbrokers, and others involved in the regional capital markets, to understand the experience a company faces when seeking to raise capital of $30-$50 million on the region’s public markets. Our analysis identifies a phenomenon of “liquidity latency” in the region, which refers to the obstacles and inefficiencies in traditional LATAM capital markets that have slowed the flow of capital and hindered investment. In particular, we found: Concentrated banking: Before the emergence of alternative and non-bank financial services (fintechs) companies over the last five years, just five banks controlled 70% of bank accounts in Latin America’s main markets. High fees: Such monopolisation has contributed to the world’s highest banking fees – around 17% – unsurprisingly stifling both innovation and capital flow. Bureaucratic and regulatory hurdles: Many major Latin American economies rank poorly on the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business index, with reputations for bureaucratic and regulatory complexities that disincentivise listings and investment. Limited capital market depth: The region suffers from severe underfunding of entrepreneurship and deep pools of capital looking for these opportunities. High startup costs: Raising $30-$50 million can incur average fees of 7%, often higher due to dollar-denominated advisory services and significant pre-issue costs. This added hurdle, combined with regulatory complexity and low liquidity, strongly deters new issuances. Underdeveloped investor ecosystem: Many in Latin America do not, or cannot, engage in financial investment opportunities. For example, less than 2% of Colombia’s population are active stock market investors, and 68% of Latin Americans lack formal financial education. There’s also a heavy institutional bias, with retail investors in Peru paying eleven times more in fees than institutional investors for the same stock. Markets in Latin America have traditionally been ‘exclusive’ in nature and practice; the right to participate was reserved for a privileged few. Barriers range from economic (costs) to social (connections), from access (particularly to international investors), to regulation (cumbersome and often arcane). The societal costs of this situation extend beyond the economic; they include the continued under-representation of certain groups or geographies in the region’s formal economy, the side-lining of under-served communities and demographics, inhibiting their ability to participate or share in the region’s growth. It’s therefore little surprise that liquidity latency is affecting entrepreneurialism, reducing opportunities for business creators and those who wish to invest in them. However, we are beginning to see a marked change with the growth of tokenisation that I believe can help to fire up LATAM’s growth potential. Tokenisation offers issuers cost-efficient access to global liquidity for companies of all sizes and situations. Additionally, it enables investors a much greater degree of flexibility and freedom of use with real-time settlement, 24/7/365 trading and the ability to self-custody assets. In effect, zero barriers to entry for both sides of the transaction – fundraisers and investors. By reducing issuance costs by up to 50%, as little as 2-4% of capital raised, cutting listing times to 60-90 days, and enabling fractional ownership, blockchain-based securities can make investing dramatically more inclusive and efficient. It is of course still early days in fulfilling the potential of tokenisation, but it’s not an exaggeration to say that the financial shift that it represents has given a broader socio-economic chance for the region to overcome historical barriers and drive growth. Tokenisation represents the first genuine opportunity in generations to rethink finance. It lowers costs, accelerates access, and creates a more direct connection between issuers and investors. Tokenisation represents a practical and available solution; reducing barriers to entry for business creators and investors, extending the role and benefits of the market to all sections of society. This is the meaning and aspiration of market inclusion which, for Latin America, couldn’t be more relevant or urgent.

51149037,https://timestabloid.com/?p=81574,1756940577,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Here’s What Is Holding XRP Price Down: It Is Not What You Think,https://timestabloid.com/heres-what-is-holding-xrp-price-down-it-is-not-what-you-think/,"In a recent tweet, crypto commentator Austin Hilton addressed what he views as the primary reasons behind XRP’s current price stagnation. In an attached video, he explained that XRP, despite positive developments surrounding its ecosystem, is being held back by broader economic uncertainty rather than issues specific to the asset itself. Hilton noted that XRP is currently trading at $2.82. While the token is up by 2% over the past 24 hours, it has declined by 2% over the past seven days and recorded a 2 percent drop across the past month. He emphasized that these movements are not the result of negative events directly tied to Ripple or the XRP Ledger. Instead, he argued that the main factor weighing down the price is market-wide uncertainty, particularly related to economic policy and investor sentiment. This is what is holding the XRP price down! And, it is not what you think… pic.twitter.com/fSu9CIfy8I — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) September 2, 2025 The Role of Macroeconomic Uncertainty According to Hilton, uncertainty surrounding U.S. Federal Reserve decisions is central to the lack of momentum in the crypto market. Questions about whether the Fed will reduce interest rates in September or issue additional cuts later this year have created hesitation among investors. He said this uncertainty has locked liquidity and capital on the sidelines, delayed the return of retail investors, who exited in late 2024 and have not yet re-entered in large numbers. Hilton also pointed to tariff-related concerns as another source of uncertainty. Recent court rulings that declared former President Trump’s tariffs illegal, followed by announcements of alternative plans, have added to the unsettled environment. He stressed that such uncertainty is discouraging new investment in digital assets like XRP and other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, which have also been consolidating within narrow trading ranges. Seasonal Trends and Investor Behavior Hilton highlighted that September has historically been one of the weakest months for Bitcoin, and by extension, the broader crypto market. He stated that this seasonal trend could contribute to XRP’s lack of progress in the short term. He added that over the past 44 days, XRP has mostly moved sideways, showing little sign of a breakout due to limited liquidity and investor participation. The consolidation pattern seen across multiple digital assets is, in Hilton’s view, evidence of investors delaying action. Instead of allocating new funds into crypto, many are waiting to see how upcoming economic developments unfold. This lack of investor interest is not unique to XRP but affects the entire market. Outlook for the Coming Months Looking ahead, Hilton suggested that conditions may improve in the fourth quarter of the year, with October through December offering more favorable growth opportunities. He cautioned, however, that further downside for XRP remains possible in the near term, with the price potentially dipping into the $0.50 range if uncertainty persists. Hilton emphasized that the outcome of the Federal Reserve’s upcoming meeting in September will be pivotal. If the Fed does move to lower interest rates, it could restore confidence and unlock liquidity, creating an environment where capital begins to flow back into digital assets. He also underscored the importance of the upcoming U.S. jobs report, which may influence the Fed’s decision and provide additional clarity for investors. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Hilton concluded that the most significant factor limiting XRP’s growth is not related to internal issues within the Ripple or XRP ecosystem but instead to uncertainty in the broader economic landscape. Until greater clarity emerges from the Federal Reserve and related developments related to tariffs, he argued, investors are likely to remain cautious.

The government has quietly allowed private businesses to buy and sell USDT, a stablecoin issued by Tether that mirrors the US dollar, in a bid to keep trade moving and maintain supplies of imported goods ranging from machinery to food. Sanctions shrink Venezuela’s dollar pool For years, Venezuelan companies seeking to import raw materials relied on central bank interventions to access dollars derived from oil exports. But that channel has narrowed as the United States tightened restrictions on the Nicolás Maduro government. Washington last month renewed a limited license for Chevron to ship Venezuelan crude after a three-month pause but prohibited payments directly to Caracas. The move reduced the flow of dollars available in the official exchange market, compounding the squeeze from lower oil shipments. Exports in July fell 10% from the previous month, according to vessel tracking data. The Venezuelan central bank has poured about $2 billion into the currency market in the first seven months of 2025, 14% less than in the same period last year, according to private estimates. “The availability of exchange always has a ceiling,” said lawmaker Orlando Camacho, who leads a guild of medium-sized companies close to the ruling party. With US dollars getting scarcer, businesses have increasingly turned to digital alternatives. Stablecoins flow in the marketplace Since June, the government has been permitted to sell USDT to companies in exchange for bolívars, Venezuela’s battered local currency, according to people familiar with the process. The buyers must hold a government-approved digital wallet, where the crypto is credited before being used to pay suppliers or resold in private transactions. Ecoanalítica, a Venezuelan analyst firm, estimates that businesses bought roughly $119 million worth of cryptocurrencies in July. Analysts expect the figure to rise as sanctions persist and oil inflows remain limited. “When one operation closes, others open,” one businessperson reportedly said regarding the new reliance on stablecoins. Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez has acknowledged the use of “non-traditional mechanisms of management in the exchange market” in recent meetings with business leaders, though she stopped short of naming crypto outright. From failed petro to entrenched Tether The embrace of stablecoins marks a new chapter in Venezuela’s fraught relationship with digital assets. The government launched its own token, the petro, in 2018 to much fanfare, billing it as an oil-backed cryptocurrency that could anchor the economy. It was quietly abandoned after failing to attract users or investors. This time, the state is not pushing its own product but leaning on a dollar proxy that already circulates widely. According to the Financial Times , crypto use across Venezuela surged 110% in the 12 months since mid-2024. Yet Tether itself has faced scrutiny over its role in sanctioned jurisdictions. The company has said it complies with the U.S. Treasury’s list of banned entities and did not comment directly on Venezuelan usage this year. For now, stablecoins offer Caracas a breathing space. By allowing limited, regulated use of USDT, the government can ease pressure on businesses while conserving scarce physical dollars for its own priorities.

According to data from Lookonchain, some of the biggest financial institutions, including Fidelity, Bitwise and Grayscale sold ETH and bought BTC. Inflows into BTC and ETH ETFs. Source: Lookonchain On-chain data shows funds entering BTC ETFs On-chain data has revealed that spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds surpassed Ethereum ETFs as far as investment flows on Tuesday. According to data from Lookonchain , spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $332.7 million in net inflows on Tuesday, led by $132.7 million moving into Fidelity’s FBTC and $72.8 million into BlackRock’s IBIT. Funds from Grayscale, Ark & 21Shares, Bitwise, VanEck and Invesco also saw net inflows yesterday. On the other hand, spot Ethereum ETFs reported a total daily net outflow of $135.3 million, with Fidelity’s FETH recording $99.2 million in outflows and Bitwise’s ETHW recording $24.2 million in negative flows. Analysts believe this shift in fortunes in terms of ETH and BTC ETF inflows suggests institutional investors may be rebalancing portfolios as Bitcoin’s perceived stability becomes more attractive as the market struggles with macroeconomic uncertainties. Things were different in August when Ethereum ETFs outperformed Bitcoin ETFs thanks to their yield-generating capabilities, improving regulatory clarity, and growing corporate treasury adoption. While Bitcoin ETFs saw a monthly net outflow of $751 million in August, Ethereum ETFs saw $3.87 billion flow into the funds during the same period. “In the short term, this could bolster bitcoin’s price support near $108k and reduce selling pressure, though Ethereum’s stronger yield prospects and Digital Asset Treasuries growth may sustain its outperformance into year-end,” Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research said. Large capital continues to flow into Ethereum Even though Ethereum is currently struggling to reclaim the $4,500 mark amid broader bearish action, analysts warn investors against writing it off because large capital continues to flow into the ecosystem. While institutions seem to care more about BTC right now, Ethereum ETFs continue to see daily inflows, and retail investors are treating dips as buying opportunities. Also, late last month, some analysts noted a resurgence of positive sentiment among Ethereum investors on the largest crypto platform, Binance , after fresh data revealed that in less than a week, the number of ETH on the crypto exchange declined by 10% from 4,975,000 ETH to 4,478,000 ETH, particularly between August 23 and 27. Such declines imply that investors are removing ETH from centralized platforms, a behavior historically linked to long-term accumulation and growing confidence. During this period, increased market activity has been driven by rising demand, suggesting a potential supply squeeze that would intensify Ethereum’s next significant price rise. Even as ETFs take a breather, Ethereum is still seeing strong interest from corporate treasuries. These institutions are increasingly choosing long-term investing plans over short-term speculation, which increases the likelihood of ETH resisting significant market corrections. At the time of writing, ETH is seeing some bullish price action and is trading just under $4,500, rounding out a nearly 4% increase in the last 24 hours.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with exciting news! Shares of American Bitcoin (ABTC), a prominent mining firm, recently made an impressive debut on the Nasdaq, capturing significant attention from investors and market watchers alike. This event marks a pivotal moment for the company, signaling strong market confidence in its operations and future prospects. American Bitcoin’s Remarkable Nasdaq Debut: What Happened? On its first day of trading, American Bitcoin saw its stock surge by approximately 17%, closing at a robust $8.04. This initial climb was quite dramatic, with the stock even touching an intraday high of $14 before settling. The successful listing, as reported by The Block, highlights a strong appetite for crypto-related ventures on mainstream financial platforms. What makes this debut particularly noteworthy is the high-profile backing the company enjoys. President Donald Trump’s sons, Donald Jr. and Eric Trump, are key figures associated with the firm. Their involvement undoubtedly adds a layer of intrigue and public interest to American Bitcoin ‘s market performance. Behind the Scenes: How Does American Bitcoin Achieve Efficiency? Eric Trump provided valuable insights into the company’s operational strengths during an interview with Bloomberg. He emphasized American Bitcoin ‘s commitment to efficiency and stability, crucial factors in the volatile crypto mining sector. Here are some key takeaways: Cost-Effective Mining: Eric Trump stated that the company mines Bitcoin at roughly half the current market cost. This significant advantage allows for higher profit margins and resilience against market fluctuations. Stable Operations: The firm prides itself on maintaining stable operations, a critical aspect for long-term success in an industry often characterized by rapid changes. Tangible Asset Backing: Unlike some purely speculative ventures, American Bitcoin ‘s operations are backed by substantial tangible assets. These include data centers valued at hundreds of millions of dollars, providing a solid foundation for its mining activities. This strategic approach to mining and asset management positions American Bitcoin as a serious player in the digital asset space, moving beyond just speculative interest. Understanding the Impact: What Does This Mean for the Market? The successful Nasdaq listing of American Bitcoin sends a clear signal to the broader financial world. It demonstrates that traditional exchanges are increasingly open to embracing companies deeply rooted in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This integration could pave the way for more crypto mining firms and blockchain-related businesses to seek public listings, offering new investment avenues for mainstream investors. Moreover, the valuation of Eric Trump’s stake in the company at approximately $500 million underscores the significant financial potential perceived within the firm. Such valuations can attract further institutional interest and capital into the crypto mining industry, fostering growth and innovation. Investors looking into this space should consider the balance between high-growth potential and the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency markets. However, the operational efficiency and asset backing of companies like American Bitcoin might offer a more stable investment proposition compared to direct crypto holdings. Looking Ahead: The Future Trajectory of American Bitcoin The debut of American Bitcoin on Nasdaq is more than just a stock market event; it’s a testament to the evolving landscape of digital finance. As the company continues its operations, its ability to maintain low mining costs and leverage its substantial asset base will be key to sustaining its growth.

For those tracking the intersection of traditional finance and cryptocurrency, American Bitcoin offers a compelling narrative of innovation and strategic execution. In conclusion, American Bitcoin ‘s impressive Nasdaq debut, fueled by strategic efficiency and significant backing, has firmly placed it in the spotlight.

Bithumb said that its engineers “immediately began system maintenance” after detecting the fault. However, Bithumb “trading services were down for approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes,” the newspaper explained. Bithumb announced September 3 that it would “fully compensate users for losses incurred due to the trading suspension.” The exchange said it now plans to “sequentially review” customer complaints and provide compensation for traders who lost money as a result of the outage. Bithumb said it hopes to complete the review and compensation process in the space of “approximately one month.” An exchange official said a transaction system error caused the problem.

The newspaper said customers had suffered “significant disruption.” This follows major system errors at South Korea’s biggest exchanges during last year’s martial law crisis. Crypto markets experienced turmoil in early December 2024, after former President Yoon Suk-yeol attempted to declare martial law. Some traders responded by selling their crypto holdings, while others attempted to “buy the dip.” The result was a massive and sudden surge of web traffic to major exchanges, with many platforms seemingly unable to take the strain. “Repeated computer outages at major exchanges are fueling investor discontent,” Seoul Kyungjae wrote. The crypto exchange Bithumb has made “significant reductions” to the scale of its crypto lending services amid ongoing concerns from financial regulators. #Bithumb #CryptoRegulations https://t.co/J2iCgMS6Q8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 12, 2025 We Must Improve Legal System, Say Industry Officials Data compiled by the offices of the People Power Party lawmaker Lee Heon-seung has revealed that 89 cases of outages occurred at the country’s five fiat-trading exchanges from 2018 to 2024. Bithumb has experinced 41 of these outages, with its closest rival Upbit experiencing 28 cases. GOPAX has suffered from 11 outages in the period, with Coinone reporting eight cases. Korbit experienced just one system-related outage between 2018 and 2024. Bread prices in Korea have been rising, adding to consumers' financial burden amid the inflation of food prices.

As such, deadlines for reporting damages and compensation methods currently “vary greatly from exchange to exchange.” The newspaper quoted an unnamed South Korean crypto industry official as stating: “The crypto market is highly volatile and operates 24 hours a day. As such, even a few minutes of trading interruption can result in investors making losses. We need to create a streamlined compensation system for damages caused by exchanges’ computer system failures.” Bithumb is aiming to go public on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 2026.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.54 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $5.75. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.8188 Market cap $817.92M Trading volume $150.93M Circulating supply 998.84M WIF All-time high $4.85 on (March 31, 2024) All-time low $0.000023 (November 2023) 24-hour high $0.8245 24-hour low $0.7944 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 7.68% 50-day SMA $0.9575 14-Day RSI 44.78 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 55 (Greed) Green days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $0.7634 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown WIF’s price movement remains capped by the $0.842 resistance level. Momentum indicators suggest neither bulls nor bears currently have clear control. If the bears take control of the market, a retest of $0.749 could happen. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart WIF’s daily chart as of September 3, 2025, shows the token trading at $0.818, down 0.12% and struggling to regain bullish momentum. The price remains trapped below the middle Bollinger Band at $0.842 and well beneath the descending trendline resistance that has capped rallies since late August around $0.85-$0.87. WIFUSDT 1-day chart by Tradingview The MACD hovers right at the zero line with minimal directional conviction, while the histogram shows slight compression, suggesting the bears are losing steam, but bulls haven’t taken control yet. The recent bounce from the $0.749 support level appears to be stalling around current levels, creating a concerning pattern of lower highs that suggests the downtrend from the $0.93 peaks may still be intact. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart shows WIF attempting to establish stability around the $0.81-$0.82 zone with the Alligator indicator displaying mixed signals as the three moving averages converge around current price levels. The green line at $0.806 provides immediate support while the blue line at $0.800 acts as a floor, though the red line at $0.801 suggests the trend remains uncertain. WIFUSDT 4-hour chart by Tradingview Volume at 16.51M shows steady but unspectacular participation, indicating neither strong buying nor panic selling at these levels. The Balance of Power oscillator at -0.50 reveals selling pressure still dominates despite the recent stabilization, suggesting any rallies may face significant resistance around the $0.83-$0.85 zone, where previous support has now turned into overhead resistance. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.7947 BUY SMA 5 $0.8056 BUY SMA 10 $0.8252 SELL SMA 21 $0.8660 SELL SMA 50 $0.9575 SELL SMA 100 $0.9233 SELL SMA 200 $0.7634 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.7907 BUY EMA 5 $0.8004 BUY EMA 10 $0.8203 SELL EMA 21 $0.8566 SELL EMA 50 $0.8991 SELL EMA 100 $0.9046 SELL EMA 200 $1.0029 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? WIF appears caught in a consolidation phase, with the outcome likely determined by whether it can reclaim $0.85 resistance or breaks below the $0.80 support zone. A move above $0.85 with volume could target the $0.90 area, but failure to hold $0.80 would likely send the token back toward the $0.75-$0.76 lows where stronger buying interest previously emerged. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank, and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1.5-$2 by the end of 2025 and about $3.4 to $4.2 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

Mike Liberatore, who joined as chief financial officer in April, exited the company at the end of July, according to reporting from The Wall Street Journal. The reason behind Mike’s departure hasn’t been disclosed, and the company hasn’t issued any public comment. He had barely spent four months at the job, but his name was already tied to some of xAI’s biggest financial plays to date. Mike helped drive a $5 billion debt deal, with Morgan Stanley acting as the main banker. In addition to that, the company raised another $5 billion in equity. Nearly half of that money came from SpaceX, which is unusual for a company that doesn’t usually throw cash into other firms. The sudden departure of Mike during that scale of fundraising has left people wondering what exactly is going on behind the scenes. He also handled physical expansion work for xAI, especially its data center projects. Property filings show he signed off on a deal in mid-July to buy an easement for transmission lines near a shut-down power plant in northern Mississippi. The move is tied to a larger effort to expand in the Memphis area, where xAI has been acquiring space for infrastructure. That purchase ended up being one of Mike’s final acts before walking out. General counsel and senior lawyer both left the same month On August 7, the company’s general counsel, Robert Keele, also exited. He said on X that he was leaving after just over a year to be with his two young kids. But the post didn’t stop there. He pointed out that “there’s daylight between our worldviews” when talking about working under Elon. Then he dropped an image generated by Grok, the company’s own chatbot, when asked, “what’s it like to lead legal at xAI?” The result was a wild-looking guy in a suit shoveling coal, which Robert included in the post without comment. That same week, Raghu Rao, a senior lawyer who handled commercial legal matters, also left the company. xAI hasn’t said anything about his exit either. But the timing lined up almost exactly with both Mike and Robert’s departures, which means three top roles were vacated within weeks. One week later, on August 13, another major name exited. Igor Babuschkin, who co-founded xAI in 2023, said he was leaving to start his own venture capital firm focused on AI safety. Igor previously worked at DeepMind and OpenAI, two of the most well-known names in the space. He said in his farewell post that “catching up to the frontier this quickly hasn’t been easy.” Elon replied to him on X saying, “We wouldn’t be here without you.” Grok went rogue and caused public backlash before more resignations The same month all of these exits happened, Grok, the company’s flagship AI chatbot, created a new wave of trouble. The chatbot is now embedded directly inside X, and it can respond to prompts, generate answers, and create images. Since xAI and X merged earlier this year, Grok has become central to both platforms. In May 2024, Grok posted unprompted replies about a fake narrative involving “white genocide” of non-Black South Africans, even though the users hadn’t asked about anything related. Then in July, the chatbot posted multiple antisemitic statements and violent imagery directed at other users. After those incidents, xAI temporarily pulled Grok off the platform and later issued an apology. According to the engineers, Grok’s behavior changed after the team tweaked its parameters to make it less politically correct. That tweak was what triggered the series of bizarre and offensive outputs. The team didn’t give specifics, but the internal changes clearly did not work as intended. Shortly after the Grok chaos, Linda Yaccarino, the former CEO of X, also resigned. She had been leading the platform but was demoted after the merger with xAI, which left Elon back in full control. In August, she took on a new role as CEO of eMed Population Health, a private health management company.

51150982,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=798849,1756942868,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51150982.jpeg,REX-Osprey converts Solana ETF to tax-efficient structure,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-etf-revamped-for-tax-efficiency/,"REX-Osprey has revamped its Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) to boost investor appeal, with the changes taking effect on September 1. The overhaul aims to improve tax efficiency for holders. The SSK Solana + Staking ETF has converted from a C-Corporation structure to a Regulated Investment Company (RIC). This new archetype eliminates the fund-level taxes and directly distributes earnings to shareholders. The move is significant in streamlining taxation, reducing costs for investors, and consolidating the ETF’s position in a market that is becoming increasingly competitive for crypto ETFs . REX-Osprey ends double taxation with RIC shift The past iteration of the SOL ETF was a C-Corporation (C-Corp). Under that structure, the fund was required to pay federal and state taxes on any income, including stakeholder gains . After paying those taxes, the remainder is distributed to shareholders. In return, investors were required to pay their own taxes on those distributions. This led to double taxation, a major disadvantage relative to most traditional ETFs in the United States. This second layer of taxation gradually eroded overall returns and made the fund decidedly less competitive. REX-Osprey has lifted this onus by moving to an RIC structure. The fund itself no longer pays any taxes. Rather, any taxable earnings or capital gains are rolled through to investors. Each investor subsequently bears tax at their own marginal rate. This arrangement is common to most United States ETFs, whether stock or bond funds. It’s a leveling of the field for the Solana ETF, one in accordance with the industry’s standards. Greg King, the founder and chief executive of REX Financial, described the change as a definite upgrade for investors. He explained that it simplifies the tax situation and allows shareholders to keep more returns. King noted that SSK provides direct exposure to Solana’s spot price while also earning staking rewards, a combination not offered by any other U.S.-listed ETF. He added that investors can track Solana’s performance while benefiting from the additional yield generated through staking. Market commentators agree that eliminating tax inefficiencies will likely make crypto ETFs much more attractive for retail and institutional traders–the Solana Opportunity. Solana, which has staking yield as a significant factor for investors, could be the game-changer needed to start bringing in more inflow for the layer1 protocol. RIC shift puts REX-Osprey ahead as Solana ETF race heats up Part of that is simply the timing of the switch. U.S. regulators are considering several applications for Solana spot ETFs, with numerous issuers filing amendments recently. Analysts say such filings indicate approval may be near. By removing “tax drag,” REX-Osprey’s Solana ETF is better positioned to compete when other Solana ETFs start coming to market. Cheaper costs and more straightforward taxation could appeal to more retail and institutional investors. The SSK ETF is still the only U.S.-listed product tying together spot Solana with staking rewards. This sets it apart from other potential ETFs, which are thought to track only the token’s price. There has been significant investor appetite for exposure to Solana since clicking ‘Launch’ on SSK on July 2, 2025. The fund took 12 trading days to reach $100 million in assets under management (AUM), marking one of the fastest starts for a crypto ETF. According to REX data, AUM had climbed to $212 million by late August. That growth also indicates the investor appetite for Solana and optimism about more ETFs potentially being approved.

Recent data reveals that centralized exchange ETH holdings have fallen to their lowest level since 2022, signaling a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it’s a profound movement of assets that could reshape Ethereum’s future trajectory. Why Are Centralized Exchange ETH Holdings Declining? The numbers speak volumes: Ethereum (ETH) holdings on major centralized exchanges have dropped to a mere 17.4 million, a figure not seen since 2022. This substantial decrease, reported by Cointelegraph based on CryptoQuant data, indicates that approximately 2.5 million ETH has been withdrawn from these platforms over the past three months alone. But what’s driving this exodus? Investor Behavior: Many long-term investors prefer to hold their assets in self-custody wallets, moving them off exchanges to enhance security and avoid potential third-party risks. Staking Opportunities: The rise of Ethereum 2.0 (now the Beacon Chain) and liquid staking protocols encourages users to withdraw ETH from exchanges to participate in staking, earning rewards while contributing to network security. Reduced Selling Pressure: Lower ETH holdings on exchanges often suggest that fewer tokens are immediately available for sale, which can reduce selling pressure in the market. The Rise of Institutional ETH Holdings: A New Era? This decline in exchange ETH holdings isn’t happening in a vacuum. It coincides directly with a growing trend of accumulation by publicly traded companies. These firms are increasingly recognizing Ethereum’s potential as a store of value and a strategic asset. Since the beginning of the year, several companies have publicly announced their plans to acquire and hold ETH, signaling a significant shift in corporate treasury strategies. For example, companies like Sharplink Gaming, Bitmine, Immersion Technologies, and Ethermachine are among those making headlines for their ETH purchases. This institutional interest is not just speculative; it reflects a deeper understanding of Ethereum’s technological advancements, its robust ecosystem, and its role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT sectors. Currently, an estimated 17 publicly traded companies collectively hold over 3.6 million ETH, a testament to this evolving landscape. What Does This Shift in ETH Holdings Imply for Ethereum’s Future? The implications of decreasing exchange ETH holdings and increasing institutional adoption are multifaceted and potentially very positive for Ethereum. When more ETH is moved off exchanges and into long-term holding strategies, it reduces the circulating supply available for immediate trading. This can create a supply shock, especially if demand continues to grow. Consider these potential impacts: Price Appreciation: A reduced supply on exchanges, coupled with consistent or rising demand, typically leads to upward price pressure. Market Maturity: Institutional involvement lends credibility and stability to the Ethereum market, attracting more traditional investors and fostering broader acceptance. Decentralization: While centralized exchanges serve a purpose, the movement of ETH into self-custody and staking pools aligns with the ethos of decentralization, making the network more robust. Long-Term Confidence: Companies choosing to hold ETH on their balance sheets demonstrates a strong belief in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition and its role in the future of digital economies. This trend suggests a maturing market where Ethereum is increasingly viewed not just as a speculative asset, but as a foundational technology and a strategic investment. Looking Ahead: The Evolving Landscape of Ethereum The current dynamics surrounding ETH holdings on centralized exchanges are a powerful indicator of changing market sentiment and investor behavior. As institutional players deepen their involvement and individual investors opt for self-custody and staking, the Ethereum ecosystem is likely to become more resilient and less susceptible to short-term market volatility. This ongoing shift underscores the growing confidence in Ethereum’s utility, innovation, and its long-term potential. It’s a fascinating time to observe the cryptocurrency space, with Ethereum at the forefront of this evolution. The movement of assets off exchanges is a clear signal that many believe in Ethereum’s fundamental value, positioning it for what could be an exciting future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean for ETH holdings to fall on centralized exchanges? A: It means that a significant amount of Ethereum is being moved off trading platforms and into private wallets, staking contracts, or institutional treasuries. This often indicates a preference for long-term holding over short-term trading. Q2: Why are publicly traded companies buying ETH? A: Companies are buying ETH for various reasons, including diversifying treasury assets, gaining exposure to the Web3 and DeFi ecosystems, and recognizing Ethereum’s potential as a valuable, programmable asset with long-term growth prospects. Q3: How does this trend impact Ethereum’s price? A: A decrease in exchange ETH holdings typically reduces the immediate selling pressure and available supply. If demand remains strong or increases, this supply squeeze can contribute to upward price momentum. Q4: Is it safer to hold ETH off a centralized exchange? A: Many argue that holding ETH in a self-custody wallet (like a hardware wallet) offers greater security as it removes the risk of exchange hacks or regulatory actions that could affect your assets. However, it also places the full responsibility of security on the individual. Q5: What is the significance of institutional adoption for Ethereum? A: Institutional adoption brings legitimacy, capital, and broader market acceptance to Ethereum. It signals that traditional finance and corporations are increasingly confident in its technology and long-term viability, which can attract more mainstream investors.

51151431,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=798861,1756943917,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51151431.jpeg,Bank of England deputy signals rates likely to stay high,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bank-of-england-signals-rates-to-stay-high/,"The Bank of England (BoE) is set to maintain a tighter grip on interest rates for longer as the battle against inflation rumbles. Price pressures across the economy are proving more enduring than anticipated, Deputy Governor Clare Lombardelli told lawmakers on Wednesday. Her comments indicated that the bank has little room to reduce borrowing costs further without risking another spike in inflation. Lombardelli’s remarks were echoed by Governor Andrew Bailey, who also reiterated that the central bank is not expected to soon follow up with another cut this year. He said financial markets had “got” the bank’s warning that the cuts would now be slower than many had hoped. The warning marks a sharp change of tone from just weeks ago, when the bank cut its base rate to 4.0% in August, at the end of a difficult 5-4 split vote on the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). The cut was intended to bolster business activity amid signs that the economy’s growth and hiring were slowing. But inflation data has since surprised to the upside, which has caused policymakers to snap to attention. Instead of following through on standard quarterly cuts, as investors anticipated earlier this summer, the BoE indicates that rates may not rise from their current level until deep into 2026. The shift underscores the central bank’s predicament: While inflation has plummeted from the double digits in 2022, it remains above the target and shows signs of sticking, especially in sectors like food, energy, and services. Markets adjust to slower cuts Speaking to Parliament’s Treasury Committee, Gov. Bailey claimed his “message has landed” in financial markets. He reiterated that the path for rates remained lower but would be gradual. Bailey has told MPs there is now much greater uncertainty about how far and fast the Bank might go next. Traders have pared expectations for a further cut in 2025. Futures markets already price in the first move in early 2026, probably in April. That is a dramatic change from earlier summer, when bets were in place on at least one more cut this year. Bailey flagged lingering risks around inflation and the labor market. He said the “risk of inflation has gone up,” though he remains more concerned than some colleagues about softening employment trends. Lombardelli doubled down on that cautious view. She warned lawmakers that the current 4% rate could already be near the neutral level, below which inflation could pick up anew from a tighter labor market and other influences. Inflation continues to run well above the bank’s 2% target. It climbed to 3.8% in July, and is projected to surpass 4% in September. Lombardelli cautioned that elevated food and energy prices fueled inflation and influenced consumer views of future price increases. In her written testimony, she said there were signs that the disinflationary process was losing steam, raising the risk of more prolonged inflation. Monetary policy, she said, may not even be significantly restrictive and, in a hint that she might not follow the central bank to further cuts, observed that history suggests the neutral rate could be at the high end of the 2–4% range. Committee splits over next move The MPC remains split. External member Megan Greene, a hawkish voice, supported Lombardelli’s fears over sticky inflation. Dovish rate-setter Alan Taylor, in contrast, cautioned that the bigger risk is recession. And slow adjustments, he said, threaten to create economic weakness that feeds on itself. Taylor also told lawmakers that the current moment is unusually dangerous and cautioned that if recessionary momentum gathers, it could become much more difficult to end, based on history. The bank says there is no change in rates for now, and signals they will be held at 4% until at least the end of the year. And markets, businesses, and households are bracing for a long, higher-interest-rate slog. The debate within the MPC reflects the currents and cross-currents rippling through the economy: cut too early and you risk reigniting inflation; hold back for too long and you could deepen a slowdown.

Whales purchasing ETH and Solana organizing a crucial governance upgrade points to a rotation into early stage projects. MAGACOIN FINANCE is being touted a 30x ROI crypto. As such, it is attracting attention, similar to the major altcoins. Ethereum: Whales Accumulators Increase Holdings Responding to the market correction over the last week, Ether whales took advantage of the drop to $4,200. The amount of Ether in the queue to be staked has surged to its highest level since 2023 as institutional traders and crypto treasury firms aim to scoop rewards for their holdings. Data from Santiment shows that whale addresses holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH rose by 4% in the past week. Moreover, these big investors have accumulated about 260,000 ETH worth $1.14 billion in the past 24 hours. The blockchain has 35.7 million ETH staked, worth approximately $162 billion, and equating to 31% of the total supply, according to Ultrasound.Money. Solana: Ecosystem Upgrade Strengthens Its Case This Week After a two-week governance process in which more than half of validators cast votes, Solana is set to be upgraded using the Alpenglow consensus protocol. According to the results of the governance process released on Tuesday, more than 98% voted yes to approve the new consensus protocol for Solana, with a 52% stake participating. The Alpenglow upgrade is expected to reduce the transaction finality to 150 milliseconds from more than 12 seconds, significantly overhauling the ecosystem. Solana has consistently made higher highs since early August. This has allowed it to consolidate the support at $185 and allowed buyers to aim for the key resistance at $227. At the time of this post, SOL is found at $210. Low-Cap Rising Star Tipped for 30x ROI One of the best new altcoins to buy 2025 is MAGACOIN FINANCE , a low-cap project that analysts believe could deliver up to a 30x ROI crypto return. With its capped supply, verified audits, and zero-tax trading model, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as more than just a speculative play. Growing evidence of crypto whales buying MAGACOIN FINANCE suggests early institutional-style positioning before its first listings. For investors who missed earlier breakouts like Solana or Avalanche, MAGACOIN offers a sub-$0.01 entry that could prove pivotal in the next altcoin cycle. Final Thoughts: Altcoin Rotation in 2025 Ethereum’s whale accumulation and Solana’s Alpenglow upgrade make them clear candidates for the best crypto to buy this week . But what sets this market apart is the increasing rotation into low-cap gems with potential . MAGACOIN FINANCE, backed by strong audits and community momentum, represents that rising star narrative — the kind of early-stage play tipped for exponential growth. With both established blue-chips and breakout projects showing strength, this week offers investors multiple avenues for exposure.

51151277,https://timestabloid.com/?p=81452,1756944005,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Top Crypto Trends to Watch Closely in September 2025,https://timestabloid.com/top-crypto-trends-to-watch-closely-in-september-2025/,"September 2025 is here, and the crypto market is once again entering a period of shifting momentum. Bitcoin, which had been the star of the first half of the year, is now facing a cooling phase. After slipping below the $110,000 threshold, many traders are bracing for what has historically been a difficult month. This slowdown has prompted retail investors to diversify into new opportunities, with some experts pointing toward projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE as potential long-term winners in a market where fresh narratives are gaining traction. The Shifting Market for Major Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin has entered a rough patch, with September often referred to as “Red September” due to its track record of negative monthly returns. Analysts remain divided: some believe history will repeat itself, while others argue that BTC could defy expectations and mount a rebound if ETF inflows stabilize. Ethereum, on the other hand, has shown more resilience. Its Proof-of-Stake framework continues to attract institutional attention, particularly through spot ETFs that are still drawing significant inflows. At the same time, altcoins like XRP, Polkadot, and Cardano are seeing renewed interest, with Grayscale’s latest filings for single-asset ETFs suggesting that institutional players are widening their scope beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Real-World Assets Take Center Stage One of the fastest-growing areas in crypto is the tokenization of real-world assets ( RWA ). This concept allows physical and intangible assets – such as property, art, and intellectual rights – to be transformed into digital tokens. By doing so, liquidity improves, barriers to entry lower, and investors gain access to markets that were once out of reach. With regulatory clarity improving in multiple regions, RWA projects are expected to be among the strongest drivers of adoption in the coming months. New Crypto Projects While institutional capital flows into majors remain significant, retail investors are increasingly eyeing new projects for exponential returns. MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the most talked-about names in 2025, with analysts noting its potential for massive ROI—some projections estimate gains as high as 7,800% for early participants. Limited access in the presale and accelerating demand have created strong FOMO, echoing the early days of meme coins like Shiba Inu but with a more utility-driven ecosystem. For many investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the type of early-stage entry that could define the next bull market’s breakout success. AI Meets Blockchain The overlap between artificial intelligence and crypto is accelerating. From AI-powered smart contracts to decentralized AI platforms (deAI), this convergence is creating entirely new market sectors. These innovations are not only reshaping automated trading and data analysis but also raising the bar for decentralized apps and governance. Investors are closely following this narrative, as it could unlock some of the most explosive growth opportunities of the next cycle. Meme Coins and Community Strength Meme coins remain as unpredictable as ever, yet their influence on the market is undeniable. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu continue to hold their positions, while new entrants like Pepenode and Snorter are experimenting with novel models. Whether it’s gamified mining or AI-assisted trading, meme coins show that community demand, combined with utility, can keep this sector alive even when fundamentals suggest otherwise. Layer-2 Solutions Drive Adoption Scalability remains a pressing issue for blockchain. Layer-2 solutions are stepping up, particularly those built on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Faster transactions and reduced fees are essential for long-term adoption, and advancements in these networks are critical for DeFi, payments, and gaming applications. Bitcoin Layer-2 protocols are especially notable, aiming to deliver Ethereum-like speed without compromising BTC’s security and decentralization. Conclusion September 2025 highlights the balance between old market patterns and fresh innovation. While Bitcoin battles seasonal headwinds, the rise of tokenized assets, AI integration, and scalability upgrades are creating new opportunities. Projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are gaining momentum as investors search for the next big growth story. As the month unfolds, staying ahead of these trends could make the difference between missing out and capturing early upside in the evolving crypto landscape.

51153572,573295,1756944029,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51153572.jpeg,"No US Bitcoin Reserve Without Japan, Bitwise Exec Argues",https://bitcoinist.com/no-us-bitcoin-reserve-without-japan-bitwise-exec/,"In a CoinStories interview with Nathalie Brunell, Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, argued that US sovereign Bitcoin holdings are a matter of “when,” not “if”—but only via a deliberate, legislated process and likely in concert with key allies. Park stated plainly: “It will be inevitable that governments will buy Bitcoin on their balance sheet. This is something I feel very strongly,” adding that advocates should “be patient” because it is “not likely a rogue decision.” He drew a firm distinction between an executive action and a durable national policy: “There’s a difference between an executive order mandate to buy Bitcoin as a strategic asset versus a congressional mandate,” he said. Executive orders are “volatile” and “can be turned by the next administration,” whereas a legislated strategic reserve “embed[s] the mandate of the people.” Why The US Bitcoin Reserve May Hinge On Japan Crucially, Park framed the US Bitcoin reserve as an allied, not unilateral, project. The United States, he said, operates within an economic “social contract” with partners such as Japan. A surprise US pivot into BTC would risk trust: “It would be a slight betrayal of that social contract if you were to stuff, let’s say, Japan with all your long-dated Treasury bonds and then didn’t give them a heads up and just bought Bitcoin on your own.” As a practical indicator, he flagged Tokyo: “I think Japan is the one you should be paying attention to… Once you start seeing Japan embrace Bitcoin then I do think we’re ready for that dialogue to happen at the country levels.”Park also cautioned that sovereign BTC seen today mostly reflects legal seizures rather than market accumulation. “Most of the core treasury holdings of sovereigns have so far come from seizures or forfeitures,” he said, citing the US and China. He dismissed coercive domestic takings as inconsistent with US norms: using eminent domain against a compliant private entity would cross a line “the US generally is not on that side of history for.” Open-market accumulation at scale, meanwhile, would be price-disruptive. Instead, he pointed to a more American pathway through market structures and public-private alignment: “If you think about the construct of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac… you could still have a private entity that is able to extend credit for the American people,” suggesting that “Bitcoin treasury companies can be… private, yes, but aligned with kind of the national mission.” Park’s monetary rationale threads these points together. Post-2008 policy has elevated “abundant reserves” and technocratic rate-setting, making scarce collateral strategically valuable. Within that context, he said, “Bitcoin is the scarcest, hardest asset known to man and it is the social covenant that I think will supersede the dollar as we’ve known it in a way that hopefully in the future will be synergistic for both American exceptionalism.” Park’s conclusion is exacting rather than speculative: governments buying Bitcoin is “inevitable,” but a US move requires congressional authorization, signaling and coordination with allies—particularly Japan—and institutional mechanisms capable of execution at size without violating core property-rights norms. At press time, BTC traded at $111,103.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|ASIA|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-04 00:00:29

In 2017 it was Ethereum. In 2021 it was Solana. By 2023, meme tokens like SHIB and PEPE stole the spotlight with cultural force. Now, heading into 2025, investors are once again asking the question: which assets will define the next bull run? Analysts say Solana and Avalanche remain top contenders among established Layer-1s. But for those chasing truly asymmetric returns, a different name is dominating presale discussions, MAGACOIN FINANCE, which forecasts suggest could deliver up to 70x upside if momentum holds. Solana: from comeback to ETF buzz Solana has endured one of the wildest journeys of any Layer-1. After suffering major outages in 2021 and 2022, many dismissed it as unreliable. Yet in 2025, Solana has staged a full comeback. With upgrades to stability and throughput, it now processes tens of millions of transactions per day, cementing itself as the fastest high-cap blockchain. Institutional attention is following. Analysts say the prospect of a Solana ETF is real, with asset managers actively engaging regulators. If approved, it could unlock billions in inflows and propel SOL toward new highs. Price targets range from $500–$700 by 2026. For investors, that represents strong growth, but it’s also evidence of Solana’s maturity: the higher it climbs, the harder it is to multiply capital exponentially. Avalanche (AVAX): subnet strength Avalanche carved out its niche with its subnet architecture , customizable blockchains running under a shared security umbrella. This innovation has made it a favorite among developers launching gaming, DeFi, and institutional pilots. AVAX has maintained steady liquidity and remains one of the most active ecosystems outside Ethereum and Solana. Trading near $24 , analysts forecast Avalanche could reach $125-150 in the next cycle. That’s a potential 5-6x gain, attractive for conservative investors. Still, like Solana, Avalanche now resembles a blue-chip: credible, liquid, but not primed for 50x explosions. Where MAGACOIN FINANCE breaks the mold While Solana and Avalanche compete for institutional inflows, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing the imagination of retail investors hungry for transformative upside. Its presale has become one of 2025’s fastest-selling launches, attracting thousands of small buyers alongside early whale wallets. The draw isn’t just hype, it’s design. Analysts describe MAGACOIN FINANCE as a cultural ignition token : Visibility first: built for virality across social platforms, it thrives on memes and identity, not technical complexity. Legitimacy second: completed audits by HashEx and CertiK distinguish it from meme projects that launch without credibility. Scarcity third: capped token supply ensures every round sold out increases demand pressure. This combination is why forecasts project up to 70x ROI . MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned at the perfect intersection of affordability, cultural resonance, and early positioning. Unlike SOL or AVAX, which trade at tens or hundreds of dollars per token, MAGACOIN FINANCE allows retail to build massive stacks at low cost. That psychological appeal, owning millions of units early, has historically powered the largest meme-driven rallies. Complementary roles That doesn’t mean Solana or Avalanche should be ignored. Both are credible, high-performance networks that anchor portfolios with long-term growth. Solana may secure ETF approval, while Avalanche continues to build enterprise relevance. Together, they provide steady appreciation. But for the investors seeking exponential multiples, MAGACOIN FINANCE fills the role Solana once played in 2021: the underdog turned cultural giant. Conclusion Solana has reclaimed its spot as a top Layer-1 contender, with ETF speculation driving price targets toward $700. Avalanche’s subnets continue to attract developers, with AVAX projected to hit $200. Both will likely reward long-term holders. But when it comes to sheer profit potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE , with forecasts of 70x ROI, is increasingly seen as the breakout story. For retail investors, the choice is clear: anchor with blue-chips, but don’t miss the cultural ignition point where exponential upside still lives.

Analyst Gives Answers,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/binance-manipulating-xrp-price/,"In a recent post on X, crypto analyst Pumpius argued that the recent drop in XRP’s price is not natural but the result of deliberate actions by Binance. According to him, the exchange wants to protect its position because the digital currency poses a threat to the system it has built over the years. He says the exchange is doing more than just selling tokens; it is working to hold XRP back. Binance Accused Of Coordinating XRP Price Suppression Pumpius says Binance is not only selling XRP but is also actively manipulating the market around it. He points to sudden drops in liquidity, heavy waves of sell pressure, and red flashes on charts that appear whenever there’s an announcement of positive Ripple news. He claims this is not a coincidence but evidence of coordination and a strategy to keep XRP from breaking out. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Set For Explosive Rally If This Structure Holds The analyst stresses that the real reason Binance targets XRP is that it is different. XRP is not a meme or speculative bet but a payment infrastructure. Pumpius argues it could replace the liquidity pools that Binance has used for years, and if that happens, the exchange’s market-making business could crumble. He also warns that it is not only Binance that is involved. According to him, powerful investors, legacy financial players, and offshore networks all see XRP as a threat. He says that because XRP runs on transparent rails, it could expose money flows they prefer to keep hidden. Therefore, price suppression becomes their primary tool to slow down the process. Why Suppression Could Backfire As XRP Price Fundamentals Strengthen Despite these heavy claims, Pumpius argues that the pressure on XRP may backfire. The crypto expert points to Ripple and its ecosystem, noting that the fundamentals are strengthening every day. New payment corridors are opening in Japan and the UAE. Projects such as DNA Protocol are using the XRP Ledger to anchor IDs and even genetic data. Related Reading: Crypto Adviser For The Ultra Wealthy Tells XRP Investors What To Do As Coins Turn To Real Money Pumpius believes this shows the suppression is artificial. The fundamentals are exploding, he says, while the adverse price action comes from deliberate dumping. He adds that every time Binance sells, more XRP moves into self-custody wallets. Instead of weakening the community, this decentralizes the asset even more. Holders are preparing for the day when real utility drives demand at a scale far beyond speculation. In his view, when that switch flips, Binance’s paper games will be meaningless compared to trillion-dollar settlement flows. He warns that the exchange may think it is winning now, but it’s only exposing the truth about the digital currency. XRP, he says, is not just a trader’s coin. It is the backbone of a new financial order. And according to him, no amount of dumping can stop already living rails.

Their remarks came during a recent episode of the Paul Barron Network podcast, which featured media commentator Zach Rector. Rector highlighted that XRP’s market has displayed unusually high liquidity multipliers, meaning relatively small inflows of capital have historically triggered disproportionately large increases in market capitalization. Using data from Coinglass, he noted that during XRP’s November rally, inflows measured in the tens of millions of dollars coincided with market cap expansions in the tens of billions. Over a 30-day sample, multipliers were observed at ratios ranging from 50-to-1 up to nearly 900-to-1. Based on this pattern, Rector argued that XRP does not necessarily require trillions in new investment to reach $100 per token . Instead, cumulative inflows between $100 billion and $300 billion could be sufficient to drive the asset toward that level. This runs counter to the argument that a $6 trillion market capitalization, implied by $100 XRP given its current circulating supply, makes such a target unattainable. Role of Exchange-Traded Funds The question then turns to where such inflows might originate. Rector pointed to potential exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on XRP as a key driver of demand. He argued that first-year inflows could range from $10 to $20 billion, significantly above JPMorgan’s more conservative estimate of $4 to $8 billion. Other industry leaders share similar optimism. Canary Capital’s CEO, Steven McClurg, recently suggested that up to $5 billion could be invested within the first month of an XRP ETF launch. Rector therefore sees a realistic base case of $20 to $30 for XRP by 2026, with much higher valuations possible if ETF adoption scales over time. Podcast host Paul Barron emphasized that ETFs are only one part of a broader picture. He outlined other developments that could act as price catalysts, including potential U.S. legislation on digital asset market structure and Ripple’s ongoing efforts to secure a banking license . According to Barron, the convergence of these factors could create conditions for XRP to move not only beyond $50 but also approach $100. Even after corrections, he suggested that XRP could hold a higher long-term support range, potentially between $30 and $40. Retirement Funds and Institutional Entry Rector further underscored the role of institutional investors, citing commentary from financial advisor Ric Edelman, who has shifted from a cautious stance to recommending portfolio allocations of 10% to 40% in digital assets. Rector estimated that retirement accounts such as 401(k)s could eventually release between $8 and $12 trillion into crypto markets. If even a fraction of this allocation materialized, XRP could be one of the primary assets to benefit. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 To illustrate his conviction, Rector disclosed that more than 90% of his personal holdings are in XRP. He characterized the asset as a long-term reserve rather than a speculative trade. At the same time, he cautioned that price volatility will remain significant. Gains, he said, can be quickly followed by sharp corrections, and investors should prepare for large swings even in a generally upward trend.

According to the update, the ten largest wallets together account for 62.3% of the total SHIB supply, a share notably higher than that of many other leading Ethereum-based assets. Here are the percentages of supply held by the top 10 largest addresses for ETH-based assets: $SHIB : 62.3% $UNI : 52.2% $ETH : 51.0% $USDT : 40.5% $PEPE : 39.4% $LINK : 31.5% $DAI : 31.0% $USDC : 28.6% Track whale changes here: https://t.co/m99pJbV2cp pic.twitter.com/3vVkx8BYhT — Santiment (@santimentfeed) September 2, 2025 Breakdown of the Largest SHIB Holders Public data from Etherscan provides further detail on these top addresses. The largest single holder is Shiba Inu’s official burn wallet, created when Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin sent over 410 trillion SHIB to the address in 2021. That wallet now contains approximately 410.43 trillion tokens, permanently removing them from circulation. The second-largest address remains unidentified and is believed to be tied to a smart contract or decentralized exchange protocol. It currently stores about 53.37 trillion SHIB, equivalent to more than 5% of the total supply. Several major exchanges also appear among the largest holders of Shiba Inu, with wallets linked to Robinhood , Binance, and Crypto.com collectively managing over 119 trillion SHIB. Robinhood holds around 39.27 trillion tokens (3.92%), while Binance’s Hot Wallet 20 and Binance 28 accounts contain 30.71 trillion (3.07%) and 19.51 trillion (1.95%) tokens, respectively. Meanwhile, Crypto.com controls approximately 29.83 trillion SHIB, representing 2.98% of the total supply. Another unlabelled address, identified on Etherscan as 0xa70…71FA9, is the seventh-largest holder with around 12.04 trillion SHIB (1.2%). The eighth and ninth positions also belong to exchange wallets. Robinhood manages an additional 11.41 trillion SHIB (1.14%), while another Binance account contains 9.04 trillion SHIB (0.9%). The tenth-largest address, whose ownership is unverified but may also be exchange-related, carries 7.65 trillion tokens, or 0.76% of supply. Comparisons with Ethereum and Uniswap Santiment’s report also examined ownership concentration across other major tokens. The top 10 Ethereum wallets control roughly 51% of ETH’s supply, while the leading Uniswap addresses collectively hold about 52.2% of UNI tokens. By contrast, Shiba Inu’s 62.3% concentration among its ten largest wallets represents a higher level of centralization than either Ethereum or Uniswap. Implications of Concentrated Holdings While such a concentration might raise concerns about the potential for price volatility if large holders decide to sell, context is important. The single largest address is the burn wallet, which will never release tokens back into circulation. Additionally, many of the remaining top holders are centralized exchanges that custody SHIB on behalf of thousands of retail traders, rather than individual “whales.” This reduces the likelihood of a sudden mass liquidation event, though the degree of centralization still highlights Shiba Inu’s dependence on a small number of wallets compared to other assets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The latest Santiment data underscores the dominance of the top 10 Shiba Inu addresses, which together hold more than 623 trillion SHIB out of the asset’s initial supply of one quadrillion. Although this concentration places SHIB above Ethereum and Uniswap in terms of top-holder share, the inclusion of a burn wallet and exchange custodians in the list provides some reassurance that the risks of abrupt, large-scale selling are limited.

The latest data from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers a fascinating glimpse, revealing a significant shift. This crucial barometer of market sentiment has just fallen four points, moving from “Greed” to a more balanced “Neutral” territory. This shift, reported by data provider Alternative, signals a noticeable cooling in investor enthusiasm and a potential period of re-evaluation for the market. What Does a Neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index Signal? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index operates on a straightforward scale, where 0 indicates ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 signifies ‘Extreme Greed.’ A reading of 51, as we’ve seen, places it precisely in the middle: ‘Neutral.’ This means the market is currently experiencing a balance between the two extremes. Historically, extreme fear often presents buying opportunities when assets are undervalued due to panic selling. Conversely, extreme greed can signal an overheated market, potentially preceding a correction as assets become overvalued. The current neutral stance suggests neither overwhelming optimism nor widespread panic. Instead, investors appear to be taking a more cautious, wait-and-see approach. This phase can be characterized by reduced volatility and a focus on fundamentals rather than speculative fervor. Understanding this shift is vital for making informed decisions. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? To truly appreciate the insights offered by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , it’s important to understand its sophisticated methodology. This index isn’t based on a single metric but aggregates data from six key factors, each contributing a specific weight to the final score. This comprehensive approach ensures a holistic view of market sentiment. Here’s a breakdown of the components that contribute to the index’s daily calculation: Volatility (25%): This measures current Bitcoin price fluctuations and maximum drawdowns, comparing them to average values over 30 and 90 days. High volatility often signals fear and uncertainty. Trading Volume (25%): Analyzes current market momentum and liquidity. High buying volume in a rising market might indicate greed, while low volume can suggest fear. Social Media Mentions (15%): Scans specific crypto-related hashtags and sentiment on platforms like Twitter. Increased positive sentiment often suggests greed, while negative sentiment points to fear. Surveys (15%): Although currently paused, these polls previously gauged investor sentiment directly, providing a snapshot of public opinion. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increase in Bitcoin’s market cap share often signals fear, as investors might be moving from altcoins to the perceived safety of Bitcoin. A decrease suggests more speculative altcoin interest (greed). Google Search Volume (10%): Tracks search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Sudden spikes in searches for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” could indicate fear, while “how to buy crypto” might suggest rising interest (greed). Navigating the Neutral Zone: Strategic Insights for Investors The current neutral reading of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a unique environment for investors. It’s a time when emotional extremes are less dominant, potentially leading to more rational market behavior. This period offers distinct opportunities for those willing to adapt their strategies. Consider these strategic insights: Reduced Emotional Trading: Neutral sentiment often correlates with less impulsive decision-making, encouraging more rational analysis of market conditions. Consolidation Periods: Markets in a neutral state frequently undergo periods of price consolidation, where assets trade within a defined range. This can be an opportune time for dollar-cost averaging or re-evaluating portfolio allocations. Opportunity for Due Diligence: Without the overwhelming pressure of extreme fear or greed, investors have a clearer headspace to research projects thoroughly, assess their underlying fundamentals, and refine long-term strategies. Vigilance is Key: While neutral, the market can quickly swing. Staying informed about broader macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, and project-specific developments remains crucial for anticipating future shifts. Why This Crucial Index Matters for Your Crypto Journey The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as more than just a daily snapshot; it’s a powerful tool for understanding the underlying psychology driving market movements. By offering a quantitative measure of sentiment, it helps investors gain invaluable perspective and avoid common pitfalls. It highlights the cyclical nature of crypto markets, which often oscillate between periods of intense optimism and profound pessimism. Recognizing these shifts can empower individuals to make more informed, less emotionally driven decisions, potentially avoiding the classic mistake of buying high and selling low. Ultimately, this index encourages a disciplined approach, reminding us that even in a volatile asset class like cryptocurrency, understanding human behavior is paramount to long-term success. The recent shift of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to ‘Neutral’ territory marks a significant moment for crypto investors. It signals a temporary reprieve from the extremes of market emotion, offering a period of relative calm and reflection. While this neutrality doesn’t predict future price movements with certainty, it provides a valuable lens through which to view market psychology and refine investment strategies. Staying informed, rational, and disciplined remains the best approach in this dynamic and ever-evolving landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A: It’s a tool that measures the current sentiment of the cryptocurrency market, ranging from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed), based on various market factors. Q2: How does a “Neutral” reading impact my crypto investments? A: A neutral reading suggests a balanced market without extreme emotional bias. It encourages rational decision-making, due diligence, and can be a period of market consolidation rather than sharp price swings. Q3: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a reliable predictor of price? A: While it reflects market sentiment, it’s not a direct price predictor. It’s a valuable indicator to understand investor psychology, which can influence market trends, but it should be used in conjunction with other analyses. Q4: What factors contribute to the index’s calculation? A: It’s calculated using volatility, trading volume, social media mentions, surveys (historically), Bitcoin dominance, and Google search volume, each with a specific weighting.

This innovative process allows traditional company shares to be represented as digital tokens on a blockchain. Leading this charge is Moonshot, a robust token issuance platform built on the high-performance Solana (SOL) blockchain. They have just launched a groundbreaking service that could fundamentally change how global investors access and trade company stocks. What Exactly is Stock Tokenization, and How Does Moonshot Facilitate It? Simply put, stock tokenization is the conversion of real-world company shares into blockchain-based digital tokens. Each token represents a fractional or full ownership stake in a traditional stock. Imagine owning a piece of a company like Nvidia, Coinbase, or Tesla, but with the added benefits of blockchain technology. Moonshot’s new service makes this possible by: Digitizing Assets: Converting traditional stock shares into digital tokens on the Solana blockchain. Enhanced Accessibility: Providing a platform for users to manage and trade these tokenized assets. Real-World Examples: Initially supporting popular stocks such as Nvidia, Coinbase, and Tesla, giving investors direct access to these prominent companies in a new format. Currently, this service is available in select countries, specifically excluding the United States, due to varying regulatory landscapes. However, its global potential is immense. Why is Moonshot’s Stock Tokenization Service a Game-Changer for Investors? The introduction of stock tokenization through Moonshot offers several compelling advantages that could democratize investment and create new opportunities for investors worldwide. Fractional Ownership: Investors can purchase small fractions of high-value stocks, making expensive shares more accessible to a broader audience. This lowers the entry barrier significantly. 24/7 Trading: Unlike traditional markets with fixed hours, tokenized stocks can potentially be traded around the clock, offering greater flexibility and liquidity. Increased Liquidity: The ability to trade smaller fractions and operate on a 24/7 basis can lead to higher liquidity in the market for these assets. Global Reach: While initial availability is restricted, the underlying blockchain technology inherently supports cross-border transactions, paving the way for a truly global investment landscape. These benefits highlight how Moonshot is not just digitizing stocks but enhancing the entire investment experience. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities in Stock Tokenization While the promise of stock tokenization is vast, it also presents unique challenges, primarily in the regulatory domain. The financial sector is heavily regulated, and integrating blockchain technology with traditional assets requires careful navigation of existing laws and the development of new frameworks. Moonshot, by launching in specific countries and excluding the US, demonstrates an understanding of these complexities. As the technology matures and regulatory clarity emerges globally, we can expect broader adoption. The opportunity lies in creating more efficient, transparent, and accessible financial markets. This innovative approach could redefine how we perceive and interact with traditional investments, blending the best of both worlds: the stability of established companies and the efficiency of blockchain. In conclusion, Moonshot’s launch of its stock tokenization service on Solana marks a significant milestone in the convergence of traditional finance and decentralized technology. By offering a new way to invest in leading companies like Nvidia, Coinbase, and Tesla, Moonshot is not just providing a service; it’s helping to shape the future of global investment, making it more accessible, liquid, and innovative for investors around the world.

The Bank of England stablecoin policy is undergoing a pivotal shift, poised to reshape how these crucial digital assets operate. This move isn’t just a technical adjustment; it’s a strategic decision that could bolster trust and drive innovation within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. What’s Changing with Bank of England Stablecoin Rules? Bank of England Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden recently made an announcement that has caught the attention of regulators and crypto enthusiasts alike. The central bank is set to relax its existing regulatory framework for stablecoins. This relaxation means a crucial change for issuers: they will now be permitted to hold some of their backing assets in short-term government bonds. Breeden explained that the framework, initially published by the bank in 2023, was not entirely suitable for the evolving needs of stablecoin issuers. This acknowledgment highlights the central bank’s adaptability in a rapidly changing financial landscape. The initial vision for stablecoins primarily focused on retail applications, but their utility has expanded significantly. Today, stablecoins are increasingly seen as foundational for settling tokenized securities and other institutional applications. This shift in purpose necessitates a more flexible and robust regulatory approach. The decision by the Bank of England stablecoin policy team reflects a proactive stance to accommodate this evolution, aiming to integrate digital assets more seamlessly into traditional finance. Why is This a Game-Changer for Stablecoins and Digital Finance? This policy adjustment carries substantial benefits for the stablecoin market. Allowing issuers to back their stablecoins with short-term government bonds can significantly enhance their stability and trustworthiness. Government bonds are generally considered low-risk assets, providing a strong foundation for the value of stablecoins. Increased Trust: Backing with government bonds can instill greater confidence among users and institutions, knowing their digital assets are anchored to highly secure traditional instruments. Enhanced Stability: This move helps mitigate risks associated with more volatile backing assets, making stablecoins more resilient to market fluctuations. Broader Adoption: With enhanced trust and stability, institutional players, including traditional financial firms, may be more inclined to adopt stablecoins for various transactions, including cross-border payments and tokenized asset settlement. Regulatory Clarity: Providing clear guidelines on acceptable backing assets offers much-needed regulatory clarity, which is vital for the growth and legitimacy of the digital asset sector. This development positions the UK as a forward-thinking jurisdiction in digital finance. It acknowledges the potential of stablecoins beyond simple retail payments, particularly in the burgeoning field of tokenized securities. Navigating the Future: Potential Impact of Bank of England Stablecoin Policy The implications of this new policy extend far beyond just stablecoin issuers. It signals a broader acceptance of digital assets within the traditional financial system. While the move is largely positive, it also presents new challenges and opportunities. Implementing these changes effectively will require careful coordination between regulators, stablecoin issuers, and market participants. Ensuring robust oversight while fostering innovation will be a delicate balance. However, the proactive approach by the Bank of England stablecoin framework suggests a commitment to finding this equilibrium. This policy could also influence other central banks globally. As jurisdictions compete to become leaders in digital finance, the UK’s pragmatic approach might serve as a model. The shift from retail-focused stablecoins to those used for settling tokenized securities highlights a maturing market perspective, where digital assets are integrated into complex financial operations. What Does This Mean for the UK’s Digital Asset Landscape? For the UK, this regulatory relaxation reinforces its ambition to be a global hub for financial innovation. By creating a more accommodating environment for stablecoin operations, the country can attract talent, investment, and cutting-edge projects in the digital asset space. This isn’t just about stablecoins; it’s about the broader infrastructure for future financial markets. Actionable insights for market participants include closely monitoring the detailed implementation guidelines. Stablecoin projects looking to operate in the UK will find a clearer path to compliance, potentially accelerating their market entry and expansion. This environment encourages innovation while maintaining essential safeguards. The long-term vision suggests a financial system where traditional assets and digital assets coexist and interact seamlessly. The Bank of England stablecoin decision is a significant step towards realizing that vision, paving the way for more efficient, transparent, and resilient financial markets. In conclusion, the Bank of England’s decision to permit stablecoin issuers to hold short-term government bonds as backing assets is a monumental step forward for digital finance. It addresses the evolving landscape of stablecoin utility, fosters greater trust and stability, and solidifies the UK’s position as a leader in cryptocurrency regulation. This forward-thinking approach is set to unlock new opportunities for innovation and integration within the global financial system. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a stablecoin? A1: A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar or a commodity like gold. This stability is usually achieved by backing the stablecoin with reserves. Q2: Why is the Bank of England changing its stablecoin regulations? A2: The Bank of England recognized that its 2023 framework was not ideal for current stablecoin uses, which have shifted from primarily retail applications to settling tokenized securities. Relaxing the rules aims to foster greater stability and facilitate institutional adoption. Q3: What are the benefits of stablecoins being backed by short-term government bonds? A3: Backing stablecoins with short-term government bonds increases their trustworthiness and stability, as these bonds are considered low-risk assets. This can lead to broader institutional adoption and greater confidence in the digital asset market. Q4: How does this impact the UK’s position in digital finance? A4: This move strengthens the UK’s ambition to be a global hub for financial innovation by providing a clearer, more accommodating regulatory environment for stablecoins. It signals a proactive approach to integrating digital assets into the mainstream financial system. Q5: Will all stablecoins be required to hold government bonds? A5: The new policy permits issuers to hold some of their backing assets in short-term government bonds. It does not necessarily mandate that all stablecoins must be exclusively backed this way, but it offers a new, highly credible option for reserve management.

Investors and enthusiasts are keenly observing the Altcoin Season Index , which has seen a notable climb. This index offers a crucial barometer for understanding whether the broader market favors Bitcoin or the myriad of alternative cryptocurrencies, known as altcoins. Recently, the Altcoin Season Index, as reported by CoinMarketCap, jumped seven points in a single day, reaching a score of 56. This significant movement has sparked conversations across the crypto community about what this could mean for portfolios and future market trends. Understanding this index is key to navigating the dynamic world of digital assets. What Does the Rising Altcoin Season Index Signal? The Altcoin Season Index is more than just a number; it’s a powerful indicator of market sentiment and performance. When this index rises, it suggests that a growing number of altcoins are starting to outperform Bitcoin. Specifically, an ‘altcoin season’ is officially declared when 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies – excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins – demonstrate superior performance compared to Bitcoin over a 90-day period. A score closer to 100 indicates a strong altcoin season, while a lower score points towards a ‘Bitcoin season,’ where Bitcoin dominates market gains. The recent increase to 56 means we are moving closer to that 75% threshold, indicating that altcoins are gaining momentum against Bitcoin. This shift can present both opportunities and challenges for investors. Why Are Altcoins Gaining Traction? Several factors can contribute to a rising Altcoin Season Index. These often include: Innovation and Development: Many altcoins are tied to groundbreaking technologies and new use cases, attracting investor interest. Lower Market Cap Potential: Smaller altcoins can offer higher percentage gains compared to Bitcoin, drawing in speculative capital. Sector Rotation: Investors might rotate profits from Bitcoin into altcoins, seeking higher returns once Bitcoin has made significant moves. Broader Market Sentiment: A general bullish sentiment in the crypto market can lift all boats, with altcoins often experiencing more volatile swings. The current climb of the Altcoin Season Index suggests that one or more of these drivers are actively influencing market behavior. It’s a sign that the market is becoming more diversified in its gains, moving beyond just Bitcoin’s dominance. Navigating an Evolving Altcoin Season Index For investors, understanding the Altcoin Season Index can be a valuable tool. When the index is rising, it often prompts a re-evaluation of portfolio strategies. Here are some actionable insights: Research is Key: Focus on altcoins with strong fundamentals, active development teams, and clear use cases. Diversification: While tempting to chase high-flying altcoins, maintaining a diversified portfolio remains crucial to manage risk. Risk Management: Altcoins can be highly volatile. Setting stop-loss orders and not investing more than you can afford to lose are essential practices. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, project updates, and broader economic indicators that might influence crypto prices. A score of 56 is significant, but it’s important to remember that it’s not yet a full-blown altcoin season. The market remains dynamic, and conditions can change rapidly. This is a time for cautious optimism and strategic planning. What’s Next for the Altcoin Season Index? The recent seven-point jump in the Altcoin Season Index indicates a positive trend for altcoins, but the journey to a full altcoin season (75 or higher) is still ongoing. This period can be exciting for investors who are well-researched and prepared to act. It underscores the importance of staying updated on market indicators and understanding the nuances of cryptocurrency cycles. The crypto market is a continuous cycle of innovation and adaptation. The current movement of the Altcoin Season Index highlights the growing maturity and diversification of the digital asset space, offering more opportunities beyond just Bitcoin. By staying informed and strategic, investors can better position themselves to potentially benefit from these evolving market dynamics. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric that tracks whether altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) are outperforming Bitcoin. An altcoin season is typically declared when 75% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? It’s calculated by analyzing the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. The percentage of these altcoins that have outperformed Bitcoin determines the index score. What does an Altcoin Season Index of 56 mean? An index of 56 means that 56% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. While not yet a full altcoin season (which requires 75%), it indicates a significant shift towards altcoin outperformance. How can investors prepare for an altcoin season? Investors can prepare by researching promising altcoin projects, diversifying their portfolios, implementing risk management strategies like stop-loss orders, and staying informed about market trends and project developments. Is a high Altcoin Season Index always a good thing? While a high index can signal opportunities for significant gains in altcoins, it also often comes with increased volatility and risk. It’s crucial for investors to conduct thorough due diligence and manage their risk exposure. Did you find this article insightful?

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin is stuck in a holding pattern near $112,000, according to CoinDesk market data , but the bigger story onchain might be the divide emerging between how investors treat BTC and ETH heading into September. BTC is acting more like a macro hedge, while ETH is being positioned as the real vehicle for upside. That split reflects a mix of policy uncertainty and shifting trader flows. In a recent note, QCP Capital wrote that doubts about the Fed’s independence are keeping term premiums elevated, a setup that weakens the dollar and supports hedges like BTC and gold. But options desks and prediction markets show momentum gathering in ETH instead, where traders see the most potential for a breakout. Flowdesk reported muted implied volatility in BTC despite pullbacks, suggesting positioning rather than speculative bets. Skew remains negative, meaning puts are expensive, but that creates relative value in call structures. ETH risk reversals, meanwhile, have recovered from their recent selloff, indicating renewed demand for upside exposure. SOL options also saw increased activity, with flows skewed to the upside on growing sentiment around its ecosystem and corporate Digital Asset Treasury initiatives. Spot activity rotated into ETH beta names like AAVE and AERO, as well as SOL betas like RAY and DRIFT, showing breadth widening beyond majors. Prediction markets back this rotation theme. Polymarket sentiment reinforces the rotation. Traders expect BTC to stay capped near $120k, while ETH is given a strong chance of breaking $5,000 — a view consistent with its 20% monthly rally and recovering risk reversals. Traders are increasingly treating BTC as a steady macro hedge, while ETH is emerging as the market’s high-conviction upside play into September. Europe-based market maker Flowdesk wrote in a recent Telegram update that activity on the desk remains high, with clients broadly positioned for upside even as macro risks linger and seasonal volatility tends to pick up. The macro backdrop sets the hedge case, trading flows show how positioning is shifting, and prediction markets validate it with real-money bets. Together, they sketch a market where BTC anchors as a governance and inflation hedge, ETH leads on performance, and SOL builds momentum as breadth improves. Market Movements BTC : Bitcoin remains in a consolidation phase around the $110K–112K range, marked by waning short‑term volatility. ETH: ETH is trading near $4400. Its rally is being fuelled by surging institutional interest, especially via ETF inflows, and anticipation surrounding the upcoming Fusaka network upgrade. Price action is supported by strong structural demand as ETH continues to solidify its role in DeFi and smart contracts. Gold: Gold is trading around record highs propelled by expectations of an imminent Federal Reserve rate cut (markets now price in about a 92% chance), weakening confidence in Fed independence, and increased demand from ETFs and central banks acting as conviction buyers. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific stocks climbed Thursday, led by a 0.57% gain in Japan’s Nikkei 225, as Wall Street’s tech rally lifted sentiment despite lingering economic worries. S&P 500: U.S. stocks rose Wednesday as Alphabet gained after avoiding a breakup in an antitrust ruling and investors boosted September Fed rate-cut bets despite fresh labor market concerns.

With Bitcoin now stabilizing under $110,000, many analysts suggest that its best multiples are behind it. While Bitcoin continues to serve as digital gold, it is no longer the only pathway to generational gains. Increasingly, attention is shifting toward altcoins that thrive on cultural momentum and community-driven branding. These tokens often deliver the most dramatic rallies once liquidity rotates from Bitcoin into smaller markets. Among this new class of contenders, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly rising to the top of analyst lists as the project most likely to capture outsized attention in 2025. Bitcoin’s new role Bitcoin has earned its position as the anchor of crypto. It attracts institutions, stabilizes portfolios, and benefits from mainstream trust through spot ETFs. But with growth now measured in billions, the days of huge gains are gone. Analysts expect steady returns, reaching $250,000 over the next cycle, but Bitcoin’s profile has shifted toward preservation rather than aggressive compounding. For risk-tolerant investors, that means the dip-buying mantra must be updated. Instead of asking if Bitcoin dips are worth buying, traders are asking which altcoins will outperform once Bitcoin stabilizes. Liquidity rotation and altcoin breakouts Every cycle shows the same liquidity pattern. First, Bitcoin rallies, drawing institutional inflows and media coverage. Once momentum slows, capital rotates into altcoins. Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche have all benefitted from this rotation in past cycles, while meme tokens like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE became cultural phenomena that dominated retail flows. This rotation is more than speculation, it’s the psychology of markets. Investors start conservative, then chase higher returns as confidence builds. In 2025, analysts say this rotation is already underway, setting the stage for cultural tokens to capture the spotlight once again. MAGACOIN FINANCE: the cultural ignition Unlike Bitcoin, which has matured into a conservative play, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its ignition phase. What makes it stand out isn’t only its affordability but also its ability to capture attention. Its presale rounds have nearly sold out, showing strong grassroots energy. But beyond the numbers, analysts highlight three critical factors: Cultural magnetism – MAGACOIN FINANCE resonates far beyond crypto-native audiences, giving it viral potential. Community loops – early buyers share, meme, and promote, creating visibility that compounds naturally. Whale + retail synergy – large holders are positioning early, but retail accessibility keeps momentum broad. Forecasts frame MAGACOIN FINANCE as a candidate for explosive multiples in 2025, not because of complex infrastructure but because of its ability to dominate the attention economy. Just as SHIB’s branding fueled one of the greatest rallies in history, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly described as the cultural successor to that narrative, only this time, backed by stronger foundations and early sellout momentum. Why retail can’t afford to wait The danger for retail traders is hesitation. By the time a token is trending on major exchanges, whales have already accumulated and are distributing into that demand. This cycle repeated with SHIB, PEPE, and even Solana during its breakout years. MAGACOIN FINANCE sits at the point before mainstream discovery. Analysts warn this is precisely where the most asymmetric returns are made. A token doesn’t need institutional adoption to deliver exponential multiples, it needs visibility, scarcity, and a growing community. All three are in play for MAGACOIN FINANCE heading into 2025. Lessons from past cycles Ethereum’s climb from $100 to $4,900, Solana’s move from $1 to $200, and SHIB’s unimaginable surge all highlight the same principle: conviction before consensus wins. Retail who bought late still profited, but never on the same scale as early believers. Analysts now frame MAGACOIN FINANCE as the clearest echo of those moments—a project where narrative, accessibility, and timing converge. Conclusion Bitcoin dips will always attract buyers, but the dynamics of 2025 demand a broader perspective. Bitcoin offers stability; altcoins offer growth. And among the new wave, MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its cultural resonance, presale momentum, and growing investor base, is being called the breakout contender for the year ahead. For investors deciding whether to buy the dip or chase the next breakout, the answer may lie in both strategies, but history suggests the largest fortunes are built by those who move early into the projects that capture culture as much as capital.

51154519,https://invezz.com/?p=2860688,1756947600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Is the Trump memecoin hype over or is it just starting?,https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/04/is-the-trump-memecoin-hype-over-or-is-it-just-starting/,"Few tokens have captured attention in 2025 like Official Trump (TRUMP). What started as a politically flavored meme coin quickly exploded into one of the year’s most talked-about assets, delivering staggering early gains before retracing sharply. The hype around TRUMP was driven by the intersection of celebrity, politics, and crypto’s meme culture, sparking debates about whether it represents a lasting trend or a fleeting burst of speculation. Today, the conversation is whether the coin’s correction marks the end of its run or simply the pause before another surge. And while TRUMP has dominated recent headlines, investors are also exploring other retail-driven names like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts call a breakout presale contender for 2025. TRUMP’s meteoric rise According to CoinMarketCap data, TRUMP opened the year with a bang. In early 2025, its price spiked above $40, riding a tidal wave of speculative inflows. The token’s rapid ascent was fueled by viral marketing, relentless social media coverage, and traders eager to bet on political narratives. That surge made TRUMP one of the most profitable trades of the quarter, with some early buyers pocketing double- and triple-digit multiples in weeks. But the climb was short-lived. Within weeks, TRUMP fell sharply, sliding under $15 by March and testing investor conviction. By mid-year, the coin stabilized in the single digits, consolidating near the $8–$10 range where it continues to hover as September begins. This trajectory—an explosive launch, followed by steep correction and extended consolidation—is a familiar pattern in the meme coin sector. Analysts caution that volatility will remain extreme, both in potential gains and losses, but many agree that dismissing TRUMP entirely could be premature. Meme coin cycles and precedent History provides clues. Dogecoin was dismissed repeatedly before rallying to tens of billions in value. Shiba Inu delivered a 40,000,000% run after its skeptics had written it off. PEPE, launched in 2023, proved once again how quickly meme tokens can climb from obscurity to top-exchange listings. Each cycle follows a pattern: explosive ignition, brutal corrections, and, for survivors, the chance at renewed momentum once liquidity and community energy align. TRUMP’s ongoing consolidation may therefore represent the typical “middle stage” of the meme cycle rather than the end of its story. The dynamic also highlights a broader truth: meme coins compete not only on narratives but also on timing. While TRUMP reflects the intersection of politics and crypto, another project is quickly establishing itself as the cultural breakout of 2025. Unlike TRUMP, which has already run its first cycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its early accumulation phase. Presale rounds have sold out rapidly, drawing thousands of investors and even early whale-backed inflows. Analysts say this presale-first model could set MAGACOIN FINANCE apart, allowing it to build huge momentum before exposure on major exchanges amplifies liquidity. TRUMP vs the new wave Comparisons between TRUMP and MAGACOIN FINANCE are inevitable. Both are cultural tokens, but their trajectories differ. TRUMP has already tested its hype cycle, with investors now debating if it can stage a second chance. MAGACOIN FINANCE, on the other hand, is being positioned as the fresh face of meme culture, unburdened by political seasonality, and anchored by scarcity, audits, and branding designed for longevity. Together, they reflect the diversity of the meme coin market: political spectacle on one side, cultural ignition with structural credibility on the other. Conclusion The question of whether TRUMP’s hype is over or just starting again depends largely on narrative timing and retail appetite. With prices consolidating near $8–$10 after a spectacular $40 peak, the coin could either reignite or fade into history depending on whether attention returns. For investors chasing meme coin opportunities in Q4 and beyond, the real answer may not be “TRUMP or nothing,” but rather an evolving landscape where new contenders rise to challenge yesterday’s giants – just like MAGACOIN FINANCE.

51153566,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=815250,1756947602,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/51153566.jpeg,"Ethereum Skyrocket Math: Tom Lee Charts Path To $62,500",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-skyrocket-math-tom-lee-62500/,"BitMine chairman Tom Lee has pinned Ethereum’s long-run upside to an explicit ratio framework and a “replacement-cost” lens on global payment rails. In his September 2 “Chairman’s Message,” the Fundstrat co-founder centers the analysis on the ETH/BTC cross and a year-end Bitcoin anchor of $250,000, using a slide-based grid to translate ratio levels into ETH spot targets—and then extends the calculus to a $62,500 scenario if Wall Street’s settlement stack migrates to Ethereum. Why Ethereum Could Soar To $62,500 “The 8-year average Ethereum to Bitcoin ratio is 0.04790 and it’s currently 0.0432, meaning we’re below the long-term average. The all-time high in this ratio was 0.0873,” Lee says. “Of course, it started off higher, but I’m talking about the 2021 all-time high. So, we think that not only should Ethereum recover to the long-term average, it should probably get to the all-time high ratio and arguably exceed it as we start talking about Ethereum acting as the chain for both Wall Street to build its payment rails and the financial system as well as AI.” Related Reading: Ethereum Price Stuck In ‘Loading Phase’, What This Means For The Campaign For $5,000 He then walks through the core exhibit. “So, let’s think about what that means for price. I have a grid here. On the left side is Bitcoin price levels and then going across are various levels of the Ethereum to Bitcoin ratio. Our year-end target—this is from the Fundstrat side—for Bitcoin is $250,000. And if you look at the average, okay, then you can see the range of prices for Ethereum using this ratio and different levels of Bitcoin. And here’s the 2021 high. And as you can see, at a $250,000 Bitcoin, you get to somewhere between $12,000 and $22,000 value per Ethereum token.” The slide shows: if BTC runs to $250K and ETH just trades at the average ratio, it implies ~$12,000; if ETH recovers its 2021 ratio high of ~0.087, that jumps closer to ~$22,000. “But that’s just a ratio recovery,” Lee continues. “If you look at the replacement cost of payment rails and the banking system, that gets you to an implied value of Ethereum of around $60,000. And that puts the ratio at roughly 0.250 Ethereum to Bitcoin ratio. And as you can see, that’s how you get to $62,500 per Ethereum token. So plenty of upside.” Lee frames this ratio-first math within a broader structural thesis that Ethereum is entering a “1971 moment” for finance, as real-world assets are synthesized into on-chain instruments and stablecoins expand as digital base money. The near-term numerical anchor is the 0.0432 ETH/BTC print sitting below the 0.04790 eight-year mean; the medium-term objective is a reversion toward, and potentially beyond, the 2021 high he cites. The grid translates those waypoints into discrete ETH prices at a fixed Bitcoin reference, which is why Lee emphasizes both variables in tandem rather than an ETH-only trajectory. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Latest Rally Fueled By Large-Scale Binance Orders, Analyst Says Beyond the grid, Lee argues that Ethereum captures the greatest share of tokenized financial activity and that its proof-of-stake economics align with how regulated institutions pay for security and uptime today. In his telling, banks and market operators already fund siloed infrastructure stacks; staking ETH to secure common rails could substitute that spend while returning a native yield, an incentive he says pushes the ETH/BTC ratio higher as risk capital and cash flows migrate. This is also where the “replacement-cost” view feeds into the $62,500 outcome: if Ethereum becomes the settlement substrate for payment networks, tokenized credit and equity, and AI-linked data rights, the market should price ETH on the value of the rails it replaces rather than only on historical multiples or cycle heuristics. The message also situates BitMine’s corporate blueprint inside that macro arc. Lee describes BitMine as an Ethereum treasury business built to compound ETH per share through five levers—equity issued above NAV, equity-linked volatility monetization, operating cash flows, staking rewards, and M&A for treasuries near NAV—arguing that proof-of-stake turns an ETH balance sheet into an income-producing infrastructure asset. Lee’s math makes the dependencies explicit: a Bitcoin anchor around $250,000 and an ETH/BTC advance first to the long-term average (~0.048), then toward the 2021 peak (~0.0873), and, in the replacement-cost scenario, to ~0.25. The first two steps imply ~$12,000–$22,000 ETH on his grid; the third defines the $62,500 “skyrocket” case tied to financial-plumbing migration and AI-era settlement on Ethereum. As he puts it: “That’s how you get to $62,500 per Ethereum token.” At press time, ETH traded at $4,377.

What they often fail to build is consistency, a reason for people to return every day and make it part of their routine. BlockDAG’s X1 Miner App has achieved exactly that. More than 3 million people now mine BDAG coins on their phones with a simple daily tap. It looks easy, but the psychology is powerful. The app turns a small action into a habit, shifting casual interest into long-term loyalty. With more than $395 million raised, over 25.9 billion coins sold, and a limited-time price of $0.0013 until October 1; representing a 2,900% surge since Batch 1, the results show that people are not just curious, they are staying committed. As the BlockDAG Deployment Event approaches, BDAG’s switch to a transparent $0.0013 coin rate replaces complex bonus incentives with equal terms for everyone. Turning Routine Taps into Real Engagement The X1 Miner App is built around one simple rule: consistency. Users have a fixed time each day to log in and tap to mine BDAG coins. If they miss it, that day’s chance is gone. This design pushes people to return daily, turning a small action into a reliable habit. Unlike apps that chase attention with complex features, X1 focuses on rewards. The act of mining is fast, but the reward builds commitment over time. Logging in each day becomes automatic, like checking social media or reading news in the morning. This daily pattern keeps people tied to BlockDAG (BDAG) in a way that many projects fail to achieve. Instead of waiting for updates or price changes, users are involved every day. That connection strengthens loyalty and ensures that the community stays active. In the crypto world, consistent participation is rare, but X1 has made it a natural occurrence. By turning activity into a routine, BlockDAG has created something that people return to without hesitation. How Daily Habits Shape Stronger Connections What makes the X1 Miner App powerful is not just the daily tap, but what the tap represents. Each action ties users closer to BlockDAG’s larger plan. The coins mined today will play a role once the mainnet goes live and trading begins across the 20 exchanges already confirmed. This gives daily mining more meaning. People are not just tapping for the present; they are part of a bigger future. The app also connects users to presale updates, referral rewards, and community activities, turning every login into more than just mining. Over time, this builds both habit and identity. Users don’t just collect coins; they see themselves as part of the BlockDAG network. That feeling of belonging keeps people motivated, even outside of mining. With $395 million raised and 25.9 billion coins sold, the growth shows no sign of slowing. The app’s simple design has created loyalty, and loyalty has fueled expansion. This link between habit and growth explains why BlockDAG is gaining global attention. Why the X1 Miner App Builds Loyalty That Lasts Success in crypto depends not only on technology but also on how people engage. If users stop participating, even strong code and design can lose impact. That is why the X1 Miner App is so important; it creates daily consistency at scale. More than 3 million users are not just sign-ups; they are active participants who strengthen BlockDAG every day. This steady involvement builds a base of stability for when the coin launches. With a set launch price of $0.05 and presale access at $0.0013, early buyers already see clear benefits. Yet the bigger value lies in knowing there is a loyal, daily-active community supporting the network. By turning crypto activity into a routine, BlockDAG has built momentum that goes beyond presale hype. This steady engagement lays the path for real adoption and lasting growth, proving that habits can power long-term success. Final Thought: True Power Behind BlockDAG’s Success One tap may feel small, but when millions do it daily, it becomes the pulse of a worldwide network. The X1 Miner App proves that crypto does not have to be complex to be effective. With daily reminders, limited mining windows, and steady BDAG rewards, BlockDAG has built more than a presale; it has built a habit. And in crypto, habits are priceless. The numbers tell the story clearly: over $395 million raised, more than 25.9 billion coins sold, a 2900% surge since Batch 1, and a current price of $0.0013. This shows that people are not just buying; they are actively participating. That level of commitment fuels true growth and makes BlockDAG (BDAG) one of the most closely followed projects of 2025.

Market data reveals that large investors, known as whales, are starting to diversify their holdings into alternative assets as Bitcoin struggles to maintain momentum above key resistance levels. With October historically being a volatile month for crypto, attention is shifting toward projects showing faster growth, stronger communities, and real-world utility. One of the names quietly rising into the spotlight is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Altcoins Gaining Strength As capital rotates, the broader altcoin market is preparing for a wave of new inflows. Ethereum, Solana, and XRP have already seen increased activity in September, supported by institutional investors exploring new opportunities beyond Bitcoin. The narrative is shifting from “store of value” to “what comes next,” and that’s where early-stage projects with sustainable models are starting to thrive. Why Whales Are Watching MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a focal point in this discussion. In just weeks, it has raised significant funding during its presale phases, with each round closing in record time. Analysts compare the current momentum to the early days of breakout tokens that later achieved massive valuations. What makes it stand out is not just the speed of adoption but its real utility-driven roadmap , ensuring long-term growth potential. Early investors have already projected returns as high as 45x , making it a key target for those seeking exponential upside in the next cycle. Rotation Into High-Potential Plays Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s chart patterns suggest that whales are reducing exposure at local tops, redirecting liquidity into opportunities with greater short-term growth potential. Altcoins with high activity levels and strong fundamentals are best positioned to capture this rotation. With upcoming economic events and ETF inflow dynamics still in play, October could serve as the launchpad for multiple breakout rallies. The October Outlook In summary, Bitcoin may still dominate headlines, but the real story this October could be the quiet accumulation of altcoins that offer growth beyond the legacy market leader. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its rapid fundraising success and expanding ecosystem, is increasingly viewed as one of those rare opportunities. As more investors search for the “next big thing,” it’s becoming clear why whales are starting to take notice.

With Bitcoin consolidating around key levels, attention is shifting to altcoins that could deliver outsized returns before the next big pump. Analysts say a handful of tokens are attracting both retail and institutional demand, and for good reason. One of them, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has become a hot topic after its presale nearly sold out, reminding investors of the early days of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin when those who moved quickly saw exponential gains. XRP Eyes a Return to Strength Ripple’s XRP remains a favorite for investors betting on utility and adoption. Its cross-border payment network continues to expand, with growing partnerships in Asia and the Middle East. After recent price pressure, traders are watching whether XRP can reclaim momentum, with forecasts suggesting it could push toward new yearly highs if the market turns risk-on. Solana’s Speed Still a Major Draw Solana (SOL) has recovered from multiple setbacks, proving its resilience in the competitive Layer-1 space. With transaction speeds that rival traditional financial systems and a growing DeFi ecosystem, SOL is seen as one of the strongest contenders for long-term growth. If institutional flows extend beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana could be one of the top beneficiaries. MAGACOIN FINANCE Heating Up While established names dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly building one of the strongest early-stage communities of 2025. Its presale is moving at record speed, with allocations vanishing quickly as whales and retail buyers compete for a spot. Analysts point out that early investors could see as much as 40x returns if MAGACOIN FINANCE mirrors past breakout performances from other meme-powered projects. With a countdown now live and the presale almost sold out, this could be one of the last chances to enter before the next pump phase begins. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Gains Serious Traction Hyperliquid (HYPE) has quickly become a favorite in the decentralized trading space. With near-zero fees and growing daily volumes, the project is winning over traders who demand performance and scalability. As its ecosystem develops, many see HYPE as one of the most undervalued opportunities in the market today. Dogecoin Refuses to Fade Despite new meme coins popping up every week, Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to command loyalty. Its massive community, strong branding, and new use cases in payments keep it relevant. DOGE has historically surprised skeptics, and if history repeats itself, another major rally could be around the corner. Cardano Pushes Toward Long-Term Adoption Cardano (ADA) has taken a slower but steady path, focusing on peer-reviewed development and scalability. With Hydra scaling technology rolling out, ADA is preparing to handle thousands of transactions per second. This foundation could power new adoption in DeFi, identity solutions, and enterprise-level blockchain applications. Analysts suggest ADA could benefit from the next wave of institutional attention, making it a coin to watch in the coming months. Conclusion As Bitcoin holds its ground, the real action could soon shift to altcoins. XRP and Solana are positioning for institutional inflows, Dogecoin and HYPE keep expanding their reach, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting records with its fast-selling presale. With the countdown nearly finished, investors looking for the next explosive opportunity may not want to wait much longer.

BlockDAG (BDAG) has flipped that script. Its X1 App has already reached a level of adoption most Layer-1 projects never achieve, securing millions of users before the mainnet is even live. Today, more than 3 million people mine BDAG directly from their smartphones. No complex setup, no costly rigs, no advanced knowledge, just a simple tap. The X1 App distills blockchain participation into a single habit: tap once a day to mine. Repeated by millions worldwide, that action builds holdings and, more importantly, a culture of accessibility without the barriers of nodes, GPUs, or steep onboarding. The results speak for themselves: over 25.7 billion BDAG coins sold, $395 million raised, and a 2,900% surge since Batch 1. Now priced at $0.03 in Batch 30, BlockDAG is also offering a special flat-rate entry of $0.0013 until October 1st ahead of its $0.05 launch. This isn’t theory, it’s traction, adoption, and momentum happening right now. Making Mining Simple & Accessible for Everyone Most networks attempt to achieve scale by adding servers, enhancing nodes, or refining consensus models. BlockDAG chose another route with its X1 App. Instead of asking users to adapt, it puts the process directly in their hands through their own smartphones: no extra setup, no wallets to install, no costly rigs. Anyone can join in with just a phone tap. The X1 Miner App streamlines the typical hurdles of crypto entry into a straightforward process. Download the app, tap once a day, and you start building BDAG coins. That tiny daily action creates a habit that keeps people engaged over time. Unlike other apps that only simulate mining with animations, the X1 is tied directly to the upcoming BDAG network. Coins gained now will carry over once the mainnet launches. It also runs on a Proof-of-Engagement model. This means real activity counts, not computing power. Whether someone is in New York or Nairobi, they are part of the same system. It proves scale is possible without servers. Worldwide Growth Through Sharing One reason BlockDAG’s X1 App has scaled so rapidly is its ability to grow without relying on heavy marketing campaigns or influencer-driven promotions. Unlike traditional crypto projects that depend on ambassadors to spread awareness, BlockDAG’s expansion comes directly from its users. Every daily tap can spark a referral, a conversation, or a shared link. With a 25% BDAG bonus for referrals, the incentive to spread the word is built into the ecosystem. This organic growth loop has fueled global adoption, including in regions often overlooked by major exchanges or wallet providers. For many, the X1 App is more than just a fun way to mine coins, it’s their first step into digital ownership. The outcome is a community that didn’t wait for launch. They began building holdings during the presale itself. With over 25.7B coins sold and $395M raised, each completed batch has increased value, with Batch 30 now live at $0.03 per coin. To make things even more accessible, BlockDAG has introduced a special flat-rate entry of $0.0013 until October 1st, ahead of the $0.05 launch. This is real-time progress, not promises, a community shaping itself well before the mainnet goes live. BlockDAG’s 3 Million X1 Users Show Real Potential The X1 App proves that mining can be simple, social, and global. More than 3 million people now participate with a daily tap, showing what’s possible when barriers are removed. No costly rigs, no complex setups, just a smartphone. This design makes crypto accessible to anyone, anywhere. Each tap is more than a way to earn coins; it’s proof that people want a clear, easy way to join crypto. While other projects spend years chasing adoption, BlockDAG already shows real scale: $395M raised, 25.7B coins sold, and a 2,900% climb since Batch 1, with Batch 30 now live at $0.03. To make entry even more compelling, BlockDAG has introduced a special flat-rate presale price of $0.0013, valid until October 1st, ahead of its confirmed $0.05 launch. Growth has also been accelerated by the referral system, offering 25% BDAG rewards that encourage users to bring in friends, fueling natural and low-cost expansion. This approach not only drives adoption but also builds a community that’s growing daily. And it’s not just about presale. Coins mined today through the X1 App will migrate to the live BDAG network at launch, ensuring every tap contributes to a future-ready ecosystem. With 20+ exchange listings confirmed and hardware miners shipping worldwide, the focus is now shifting from simply joining to activating adoption at scale. Building Momentum Before Launch Most projects focus heavily on launch day, but BlockDAG (BDAG) has chosen another path. It built its community first and shaped a culture before the mainnet even arrived. The success of the X1 Miner App proves that blockchain does not need to be complex or restricted to a small group. It shows that mining can be as easy as tapping a phone, and that this simplicity can scale up. Right now, 3 million people are already mining. The project has raised $395 million and delivered a 2,900% surge since Batch 1. This progress is not based on promises; it is real and active. One tap at a time, adoption is happening. The only question left is whether you’ll join before the next batch closes.

Buyers can now settle transactions using Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether. The initiative comes through a partnership with Hubpay , a regulated fintech company, which instantly converts digital assets into UAE dirhams before transferring them to the developer’s account. Partnership Targets Global Investors According to company executives, the move is aimed at attracting international buyers who are comfortable using digital assets. RAK Properties is currently developing the Mina Al Arab waterfront community, with more than 800 units expected to be delivered by the end of the year. Rahul Jogani, the firm’s chief financial officer, said the approach aligns with the company’s effort to appeal to “digitally and investment savvy” clients.

Market watchers have described the setup as a way to expand options for foreign buyers without exposing the company to added risk. Profits On The Rise The financials of the company seem to back its growth plans. Reports have revealed that RAK Properties recorded a net profit of AED 160 million during the first half of 2025, up by around 80% from the same period in the previous year. Its capitalization stands at nearly AED 4.7 billion, or about $1.3 billion. Executives attribute the company’s growth to both robust demand in Ras Al Khaimah and its attempts to increase investor access. Bitcoin Adoption Crypto adoption in UAE real estate is not new. Developers like DAMAC and Emaar have already introduced Bitcoin payment options, while Dubai’s land authority has worked with payment firms to process crypto-linked property deals. RAK Properties’ decision adds Ras Al Khaimah to the list of emirates opening up to the practice. RAK Properties’ entry into bitcoin transactions is being framed as part of Ras Al Khaimah’s Vision 2030 goals. By widening the pool of investors who can access property purchases, officials hope to draw more overseas buyers into the emirate’s housing market.

One recurring theme among community members is whether XRP could eventually fund early retirement . The discussion was reignited after King Karan, a veteran crypto investor and Chief Marketing Officer at Monerex, asked followers on X what price level would enable them to step away from traditional employment. The responses revealed a wide spectrum of expectations, ranging from moderate financial targets to highly ambitious projections. Moderate Retirement Targets: $10 to $200 Some participants took a practical approach, identifying price levels that would allow them to meet conventional retirement goals. For example, community member Brian Hassine suggested that XRP reaching $10 would be enough for financial independence. At the current market value of around $2.86 , this would represent slightly more than a threefold increase. For a $1 million retirement target, an investor would need to hold at least 100,000 XRP at that price. Others placed the bar higher. A user identified as Mullen Station explained that a price of $100 would provide the resources necessary for retirement while still leaving the option to work by choice. Similarly, XRPrizot cited £200 as a figure that would secure his financial future, while also noting that even £50 would allow for extended flexibility and time off. These views echo earlier discussions in the XRP community, where some investors outlined strategies such as holding 10,000 XRP in the hope of reaching a $1 million portfolio value if the token climbed to $100. More cautious approaches suggested holding around 60,000 XRP if the price were to reach $50. Ambitious Projections: $500 to $1,000 and Beyond Alongside moderate targets, others entertained significantly higher valuations. Several contributors referenced long-standing community “moonshot” levels such as $589 and even $1,000 per XRP . While often framed as aspirational, these figures illustrate the scale of optimism that still exists among parts of the community. Such projections are not without precedent. Forecasts from platforms like Changelly have suggested XRP could reach $2,400 by 2040, while industry voices, including Jake Claver, have speculated about the possibility of XRP one day trading at $10,000. Under these scenarios, even modest holdings could potentially translate into multi-million-dollar portfolios. Not all community members equated XRP’s success with retirement. Some argued that the asset represents more than a financial exit strategy. Amelia Rosee, for instance, stated that she is more interested in accumulating additional XRP than in planning retirement. Another participant, Gaius, described XRP as a tool for enabling meaningful work rather than a means of leaving the workforce, emphasizing that he does not plan to retire regardless of price appreciation. Meanwhile, a different perspective came from TheKaspaMaxi, who contended that the opportunity to retire on XRP has already passed. According to this view, those who entered the market early may have realized transformative gains, while today’s investors may not achieve the same outcome. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 At a current price of $2.86, XRP remains far from the levels cited by most community members in their retirement scenarios. Still, the conversation highlights the enduring belief within the XRP community that the asset has the potential to reshape personal financial futures. Whether through moderate, ambitious, or philosophical expectations, XRP continues to be viewed not only as an investment vehicle but also as a symbol of possibility for its most dedicated supporters.

The momentum reflects stronger real disposable incomes as inflation cools and a wealth effect from climbing house prices. The Australian Bureau of Statistics will publish July household spending data at 11:30 a.m. in Sydney. On monetary policy, Bullock said the pickup in consumer spending could limit further easing: “If the momentum continues, there may not be many more rate cuts ahead. But it all depends.” RBA holds fire on rates as Bullock flags tariff risks clouding global outlook The RBA cut the cash rate in August for a third time this year to 3.6% and Bullock had signaled previously that several more reductions would be needed to calibrate with the central bank’s goals for employment and inflation. Cryptopolitan recently reported that the RBA cut its main interest rate by a quarter-point, and it is expected to make at least three more cuts by early next year. Unlike other central banks, the RBA moves slowly and relies on data, not market pressure. The bank planned to act cautiously, expecting inflation to remain below 2.6% for 2025 and 2026, before dropping to 2.5% by the end of 2027. Economists and money markets are forecasting the RBA will stand steady later this month before bringing in another rate cut in November. Policymakers will have fresh consumer and business sentiment surveys, up-to-date jobs figures, and August’s monthly CPI to consider before their Sept. 29-30 meeting. Regarding international trade, Bullock noted that the RBA’s worst-case scenario is yet to be seen, as most countries have not retaliated against President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Still, she said it’s still “a bit of a threat.” Australia was hit with the global baseline rate of 10%. “The issue with U.S. tariffs is not just that they’ve risen sharply, but the unpredictability of how they’ll be applied—and not always for trade purposes,” she said. “They’re being used for all sorts of purposes.” As a result, Bullock warned that tariffs remain a big uncertain cloud hanging over the world economy. Bullock pushes RBA tech overhaul as staff adapt to AI-driven transformation Alongside monetary policy concerns, Governor Michele Bullock spotlighted the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) internal modernization drive, noting that staff are “feeling the weight” of its technological transformation agenda. Speaking in Perth on Wednesday, Bullock said using big data and artificial intelligence could reshape policymaking by enhancing the bank’s ability to understand economic conditions, improve forecasting, and support more informed decisions. She acknowledged, however, that employees must integrate these tools while carrying out their regular responsibilities. The governor also said that the RBA has been upgrading the technical underpinning of Australia’s payments and settlement systems. It’s also “fostering a culture of innovation” and “engaging more openly” with external partners, universities, research organizations, and industry experts, to bring diverse perspectives and push its thinking. Bullock said that all this is hard. She noted that she would be dishonest if she didn’t say that the staff are feeling the weight of the heavy change agenda. Still, the anticipated rapid technological change in the years ahead presents exciting opportunities.” Bullock named artificial intelligence, data science, and big data as the areas that could change the RBA. That spans how staff carry out their day-to-day responsibilities, how policymakers evaluate financial stability risks, and the analysis supporting monetary policy.

Imagine a major crypto exchange spending a significant sum on influencing policy right before its co-founders receive a presidential pardon. This isn’t a plot from a thriller; it’s the unfolding story surrounding BitMEX lobbying . According to a detailed report by crypto media outlet Protos, BitMEX, the prominent exchange co-founded by Arthur Hayes, reportedly channeled a staggering $800,000 into BitMEX lobbying activities over a two-year period. This substantial financial outlay occurred remarkably just before its co-founders – Arthur Hayes, Samuel Reed, and Benjamin Delo – were granted a presidential pardon by Donald Trump in March. Citing data from the political donation tracker OpenSecrets, the report indicates that BitMEX engaged the services of lobbying and consulting powerhouse Edelman through one of its subsidiaries. This strategic partnership reportedly began between 2019 and 2021, a timeline that raises eyebrows as it closely followed the indictment of the company and its key figures. Unpacking the Timing: Why Did BitMEX Lobbying Intensify? The timing of BitMEX’s significant lobbying investment is a critical aspect of this story. It’s not everyday that a company facing federal indictment decides to pour hundreds of thousands of dollars into influencing policy makers. Therefore, understanding the context becomes crucial for observers. The contract with Edelman, as highlighted by Protos, was reportedly signed shortly after the company and its co-founders faced legal charges. This suggests a direct correlation between the legal challenges and the intensified BitMEX lobbying efforts, aiming to navigate the complex regulatory landscape or perhaps seek favorable outcomes. Such expenditures often raise questions about the nature of influence in political circles, especially when they precede significant legal developments like a presidential pardon. Was this a proactive measure to shape future legislation, or was there a more direct intent behind the substantial financial commitment? The public naturally seeks clarity on these intricate connections. Beyond the Pardon: Other Connections to BitMEX Lobbying and Political Figures? The narrative surrounding BitMEX lobbying extends beyond just the pardon. Protos also brought to light another intriguing connection: BitMEX’s remarkably swift listing of two meme coins issued by President Trump and the First Lady. This rapid action adds another layer of complexity to the situation. This listing occurred merely one day after their launch, a pace described as notably faster compared to the average four-day listing period observed for other exchanges. This rapid action, coupled with the previous lobbying efforts, paints a complex picture of the exchange’s strategic engagements. Adding another layer to this, Arthur Hayes, in his personal blog, openly praised these meme coins. He even went as far as to suggest that such digital assets could herald a new era of democratized campaign fundraising. This public endorsement, alongside the swift listing, fuels further speculation about the exchange’s strategic alignments. It highlights how deeply intertwined crypto platforms can become with political movements, potentially blurring the lines between business operations and political advocacy. What Does This Mean for Future Crypto BitMEX Lobbying and Regulation? The BitMEX lobbying saga raises crucial questions about the future of cryptocurrency regulation and the role of influence in shaping it. As the crypto market matures, the interaction between exchanges and political bodies is becoming increasingly sophisticated. Consequently, transparency becomes paramount. On one hand, active lobbying can help educate lawmakers about the nuances of blockchain technology and advocate for policies that foster innovation. It can ensure that regulations are well-informed and do not stifle growth within the nascent industry, which is a positive outcome. However, on the other hand, incidents like these can lead to public skepticism and calls for greater transparency. The perception that powerful entities can ‘buy’ favorable outcomes through lobbying could erode trust in both the crypto industry and the political system. It underscores the need for clear ethical guidelines and robust oversight mechanisms to ensure that lobbying efforts serve the public interest rather than merely private agendas. The industry must navigate these waters carefully to maintain its credibility. In conclusion, the report detailing BitMEX’s substantial $800,000 lobbying expenditure prior to its co-founders’ presidential pardon, coupled with the swift listing and endorsement of political meme coins, paints a vivid picture of the intricate relationship between big crypto and political influence. This unfolding narrative serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of transparency and ethical conduct in both the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency space and the halls of power. It prompts a vital conversation about how influence is wielded and perceived, shaping not only the fate of individual companies but the broader regulatory landscape for the entire digital asset industry.

The token is already worth $0.035 in Phase 6 of the presale and will increase by 14.29 percent to $0.04 in Phase 7. Up to date, the project has raised over 15.3 million USD and has received a total of over 16,000 holders taking part in the presale. Even though ADA follows wider market trends, the momentum of Mutuum Finance indicates that investor consciousness is shifting significantly, and the power of decentralized finance projects is increasingly becoming a significant factor to drive Q4 trends. Cardano(ADA) Price News: Flat in the market, although not smooth ADA is trading at $0.7943, which declined by a slight percentage of 2.46 in the last 24 hours. The coin is probing important areas of support around $0.79 and analysts believe that the continuation of this value is essential in order to prevent any further depreciation to $0.75-$0.77. Provided that ADA is able to regain resistance at or about $0.80, then a recovery to $1.00 will be feasible. In the meantime, more general market trends are on the move, and some new DeFi projects are attracting investor attention as well, such as Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Stage 6 Presale FOMO Investors Mutuum Finance is at the Stage 6 stage of presale and tokens are valued at $0.035. In phase 7, the price will be raised by about 14.3 percent to $0.04. It has attracted more than 16,000 early investors and received funding of over $15.3 million as the presale itself has guaranteed the market confidence. Official Bug Bounty Program Mutuum Finance has also launched an Official Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK to promote the discovery and reporting of software vulnerabilities. The reward pool has a total of $50,000 USDT, and payouts are given based on the severity of the vulnerability detected. There are five levels, bugs, one is critical, major, minor, low and all users, the bugs will be dealt with and the security improved. Stablecoin based on Ethereum pegged to USD The project is also building an overcollateralized stablecoin on Ethereum that is pegged to USD. It is CertiK-audited secure and transparent, and provides users with a stable and reliable asset intended to be used in daily life and decentralised applications. The Future of Decentralized Lending The DeFi protocol of Mutuum Finance allows users to manage their funds in the most basic way possible through passive yielding lenders and liquidity mobilizing borrowers who pledge their assets to collateralize portfolios of various assets. Algorithms that adjust the rates achieve maximum capital efficiency and contribute to the long-term ecosystem sustainability. Liquidity and Risk Management The liquidity and the market volatility are taken into account in the protocol to enable the closure of the distress position. The caps and liquidation parameters are used to carry the risk exposure. Stablecoins and ETH are less volatile and thus enable a higher Loan-to-Value ratio, and volatile assets are restricted. Reserve factors are shifted according to asset risk and opportunity to participate in the asset safety is balanced in all types of tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming one of the top DeFi altcoins as Cardano (ADA) prepares to hit new highs in Q4. Stage 6 tokens are valued at $0.035 which will increase by 14.29 to $0.04 in Stage 7, providing Stage 1 investors with good gains. The presale has already brought in 16,000+ holders and raised an amount of $15.3M, which shows increased demand. MUTM would bring together security, innovation, and capital efficiency with a $50K CertiK bug bounty, USD-pegged stablecoin, and a dual P2C/P2P lending model. This is the stage to get tokens before the price rises.

EU lawmakers should intervene if an entity covered by the landmark Markets in Crypto-assets regulation (MiCA) works with a non-EU entity to issue stablecoins, Lagarde said Wednesday at the ninth annual European Systemic Risk Board conference. She said these issuers should be banned from operating in the EU unless there were “robust equivalence regimes” in place in their home markets. She has since argued that these measures, which, she said, introduce a “clear cut off that demonstrates that EU operators are authorized,” should mean that EU investors are not taking on incremental redemption risk and that issuers will be fully reserved by their tokens. “In the event of a run, investors would naturally prefer to redeem in the jurisdiction with the strongest safeguards, which is likely to be the EU, where MiCAR also prohibits redemption fees,” Lagarde said. “But the reserves held in the EU may not be sufficient to meet such concentrated demand.” US stablecoin rules could reshape Europe’s digital currency plans Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies engineered to keep their value, pegging their worth to an underlying asset like the United States dollar or euro. The debate around a digital euro has been ongoing among European Central Bank officials for some time. Still, recent momentum may be driven by the passage of stablecoin legislation overseas, particularly in the U.S. In July, the U.S. Congress approved a law that would provide a regulatory framework for stablecoins, which is likely to help issuers of dollar-pegged tokens. ECB Executive Board member Piero Cipollone warned in April that such policies could have far-reaching implications. “The U.S. government’s policies could potentially result not just in further losses of fees and data, but also in euro deposits being moved to the United States and in a further strengthening of the role of the dollar in cross-border payments,” he said. Global stablecoin race heats up as oversight concerns grow As a law in the U.S. takes one step toward implementation and EU officials ponder how to handle stablecoins, China may also be planning a yuan-backed coin. Reports in August indicated that the Chinese government was thinking about its own stablecoin pegged to its renminbi currency after the slow rollout of a digital yuan. As of Monday, officials had not yet announced whether the country would advance a state-issued stablecoin, as it has been considering doing in response to U.S. efforts to bolster the dollar’s role. Nobel Prize-winning economist Jean Tirole has also cautioned about the “insufficient oversight” of stablecoins, warning that governments could face multibillion-dollar bailouts if the tokens collapse during a future financial crisis. Speaking to the Financial Times, the 2014 Nobel laureate in economics said he was “very, very worried” about the lack of supervision and the risk of a depositor run if doubts were to arise over the reserve assets backing the digital tokens. Stablecoins issued by companies like Tether and Circle, pegged to real-world assets, are poised to grow in popularity following a U.S. law passed in July that allows banks to create their own dollar-linked digital assets. Global stablecoin usage has already climbed to roughly $280 billion, with President Donald Trump advocating for their role as a cornerstone of mainstream finance. While retail users could regard them as “a perfectly safe deposit”, stablecoins could become a source of losses and trigger calls for costly government-led bailouts, said Tirole , a professor at the Toulouse School of Economics. He cautioned that backing stablecoins with U.S. government bonds could become unpopular because of the underlying assets’ relatively low yields. Tirole cited earlier instances when the returns of Treasury debt were low for several years, and payouts after inflation were even struggling. He warned that stablecoin issuers could be lured into the “temptation” to invest in alternative assets that offer higher returns and are riskier. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Verve Technology, a prominent Nasdaq-listed strategic investor, is undergoing a significant transformation. The company has officially announced its rebranding to TON Strategy , signaling a clear and focused direction towards The Open Network (TON) ecosystem. This pivotal shift also comes with an ambitious plan to buy back $250 million of its own shares, underscoring a strong commitment to shareholder value and its renewed strategic focus. What Does This Rebrand to TON Strategy Signify for Investors? The decision to rebrand from Verve Technology to TON Strategy is more than just a name change; it’s a strategic declaration. This move highlights the company’s deepened commitment to The Open Network, positioning itself as a dedicated player in the TON ecosystem. Along with the new identity, investors will see a change in the company’s stock ticker from VERB to TONX, making it easier to identify the company’s primary investment focus. This rebranding: Clarifies Focus: Directly communicates the company’s core investment strategy. Aligns Brand with Vision: Ensures the corporate identity reflects its operational priorities. Signals Commitment: Demonstrates a long-term dedication to the growth and development of TON. For current and prospective investors, this change provides a transparent view into where the company sees its future growth. It emphasizes a strategic pivot, aiming to leverage the potential of the TON blockchain. The Power of the $250 Million Share Buyback: Boosting Shareholder Value Alongside the exciting rebrand, TON Strategy ‘s board of directors has approved a substantial $250 million share buyback program. A share buyback, or share repurchase, is a corporate action where a company buys back its own shares from the open market. This action typically reduces the number of outstanding shares, which can: Increase Earnings Per Share (EPS): With fewer shares, the company’s profit is divided among a smaller pool. Boost Share Price: Reduced supply can lead to increased demand and, consequently, a higher share price. Signal Confidence: A buyback often indicates that management believes the company’s stock is undervalued. Interestingly, TON Strategy has outlined a unique approach: if its share price trades above net asset value following the buyback, it may issue new shares. These newly issued shares would then fund additional purchases of TON, creating a dynamic feedback loop between its stock performance and its core investment in The Open Network. This mechanism showcases a forward-thinking approach to capital allocation. Why the Focus on TON? Understanding TON Strategy ‘s Vision The Open Network (TON) is a decentralized blockchain project originally initiated by Telegram. It boasts impressive scalability, speed, and a growing ecosystem of applications and services, including TON Wallets, decentralized exchanges, and gaming platforms. TON Strategy ‘s intensified focus on TON is a testament to the network’s potential to become a significant player in the broader blockchain landscape. This strategic investment is driven by several factors: Scalability: TON’s architecture is designed for high transaction throughput, crucial for mass adoption. Ecosystem Growth: A rapidly expanding community and developer base are building innovative solutions on TON. Market Opportunity: The potential for TON to capture a significant share of the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 markets is substantial. By aligning its entire brand and investment strategy with TON, the company aims to capitalize on this emerging opportunity, positioning itself at the forefront of this promising blockchain technology. This bold move reflects a calculated risk with potentially high rewards. A Bold New Chapter for TON Strategy The transformation of Verve Technology into TON Strategy , coupled with a substantial share buyback, marks a truly exciting new chapter. This strategic pivot underscores a strong belief in The Open Network’s future and a clear commitment to enhancing shareholder value. As TON Strategy embarks on this journey, the cryptocurrency community and investors will be keenly watching how this focused approach translates into growth and innovation within the TON ecosystem. This bold step is poised to make TON Strategy a key entity to observe in the evolving digital asset space, demonstrating how traditional investors are increasingly embracing the potential of decentralized technologies. The future looks promising for this newly focused entity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main reason for Verve Technology’s rebrand to TON Strategy? A1: The rebrand to TON Strategy is a strategic move to clearly align the company’s identity and investment focus with The Open Network (TON) ecosystem, signaling a deepened commitment to this blockchain technology. Q2: What will be the new stock ticker for TON Strategy? A2: Following the name change, the company’s stock ticker will switch from VERB to TONX. Q3: How does the $250 million share buyback benefit shareholders? A3: The share buyback program aims to reduce the number of outstanding shares, which can increase earnings per share, boost the share price, and signal management’s confidence in the company’s valuation and future prospects. Q4: What is The Open Network (TON)? A4: TON is a decentralized blockchain project known for its scalability and speed, with a growing ecosystem of applications and services. It was originally initiated by Telegram. Q5: Will TON Strategy issue new shares in the future? A5: Yes, the company stated that if its share price trades above net asset value following the buyback, it may issue new shares to fund additional purchases of TON, creating a strategic investment loop.

At the recent Bitcoin 2025 Asia conference in Hong Kong, he predicted that Bitcoin would eventually reach $1m . “Everybody wants Bitcoin. Everybody is buying Bitcoin,” he said. “That’s why I’ve always said Bitcoin is going to hit $1 million. There’s no question.” The company operates roughly 6,000 mining computers sourced from China, equipment now subject to import tariffs under his father’s trade policies. Trump Media Raised $2.5B In May To Acquire Bitcoin American Bitcoin has entered into a $2.1b controlled stock offering with investment banks including Cantor Fitzgerald and Mizuho Securities. The proceeds will be used to acquire more Bitcoin and upgrade mining technology. The company was previously known as American Data Centers but rebranded in March through a joint venture with miner Hut 8. Its strategy mirrors that of MicroStrategy, recently renamed Strategy, which pioneered the model of corporate bitcoin accumulation. MicroStrategy’s market value has risen to about $110b on the back of its $71b Bitcoin holdings. The Trump family has rapidly built a sprawling crypto empire. In May, Trump Media & Technology Group raised $2.5 billion to purchase bitcoin. Their ventures also include a non-fungible token trading card series, two memecoins, and the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF. WLFI Trading Debut Further Expands Family’s Crypto Footprint In August, World Liberty Financial, another Trump-linked group, announced plans to spend $1.5b to buy its own token through a publicly listed company. This week, WLFI began trading. At the end of last year, the president disclosed ownership of 15.75b tokens, a stake now valued at about $3.3b. American Bitcoin’s sharp debut adds to the family’s growing exposure across the digital asset industry. Their crypto ventures have drawn criticism from Democratic lawmakers and ethics experts. Even so, investors rushed into the stock on its first day. As a result, it has become one of the most closely watched debuts of the year.

Nasdaq-listed investment firm Bitmine (BMNR) has once again made headlines with a substantial Bitmine ETH purchase , signaling a powerful vote of confidence in Ethereum’s future. This latest move by a major institutional player is turning heads and prompting discussions across the digital asset landscape. Bitmine’s Latest Strategic ETH Acquisition Just recently, Bitmine completed a massive acquisition of 14,665 ETH, valued at an impressive $65.32 million. This significant transaction, facilitated through Galaxy Digital, was swiftly brought to light by the keen observations of on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa. Such transparency in reporting large-scale movements offers real-time insights into institutional activity. This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a strategic enhancement of Bitmine’s already considerable Ethereum holdings. With this recent addition, the firm’s total ETH portfolio has now swelled to an astonishing 1.87 million ETH, collectively valued at approximately $8.32 billion. These figures underscore Bitmine’s long-term commitment to Ethereum and its belief in the asset’s enduring value. Why Does This Bitmine ETH Purchase Matter? Institutional investments like this Bitmine ETH purchase serve as crucial indicators for the broader market. When a Nasdaq-listed firm allocates such substantial capital to a digital asset, it sends a clear message: Increased Legitimacy: It reinforces Ethereum’s position as a legitimate asset class. Market Confidence: It suggests professional money managers see significant upside potential. Long-Term Vision: Such holdings reflect a belief in Ethereum’s foundational technology and its role in the future of finance. Moreover, the involvement of a reputable entity like Galaxy Digital in facilitating this transaction further solidifies the institutional infrastructure supporting cryptocurrency investments. This growing ecosystem makes it easier and safer for large firms to enter the digital asset space. Bitmine’s Growing Ethereum Stash: A Closer Look Bitmine has been a consistent and significant investor in Ethereum, steadily accumulating the asset over time. Their current holding of 1.87 million ETH represents one of the largest known institutional allocations. This sustained accumulation strategy indicates a deeply researched and conviction-driven approach. The firm’s decision to continue increasing its Bitmine ETH purchase even amidst market fluctuations speaks volumes. It suggests they view dips as buying opportunities and are undeterred by crypto market volatility. For individual investors, observing such sustained institutional interest can provide a sense of validation, though personal research remains crucial. Understanding the Market Impact and Investor Sentiment A large Bitmine ETH purchase can have a ripple effect on investor sentiment. While a single transaction doesn’t dictate market direction, it certainly contributes to a narrative of institutional adoption and growing demand. Positive news from major players can: Boost Retail Confidence: Individual investors often look to institutional moves. Attract New Capital: Other institutions might re-evaluate their crypto strategies. Influence Price Action: Sustained institutional buying pressure can contribute to upward price momentum over time. However, the crypto market remains dynamic, subject to global economic factors, regulatory changes, and technological developments. Institutional buying is one piece of a much larger puzzle. Navigating Volatility: Risks and Opportunities in ETH Investment While Bitmine’s substantial Bitmine ETH purchase paints a picture of confidence, all investors must acknowledge the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency. Ethereum is subject to significant price volatility due to macroeconomic shifts, regulatory uncertainties, and network developments. However, for those with a long-term perspective, these institutional moves highlight potential opportunities. Ethereum’s robust ecosystem, its role in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and Web3, continues to expand. Investors should always prioritize due diligence, understand their risk tolerance, and consider diversification when building a crypto portfolio. Expert Insights and The Future of Ethereum The ability of on-chain analysts like ai_9684xtpa to track and report these large transactions in near real-time is a testament to blockchain’s transparency. This public ledger provides unparalleled insight into significant capital flows, empowering market participants with timely and verifiable information, thus enhancing market efficiency. Bitmine’s consistent and growing Bitmine ETH purchase strategy suggests a strong belief in Ethereum’s future trajectory. As the network evolves with scalability and efficiency improvements, its utility and adoption are likely to grow. Institutional endorsement plays a vital role in this maturation process, paving the way for wider acceptance and integration into the global financial system. In conclusion, Bitmine’s latest $65.3 million Bitmine ETH purchase is far more than just a transaction; it’s a powerful statement. It underscores the growing institutional conviction in Ethereum’s long-term potential, its robust technology, and its pivotal role in the evolving digital economy.

51156068,https://thecoinrise.com/everyones-racing-to-win-free-crypto-in-blockdags-buyer-battles-presale-soars-to-395m/,1756951216,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/51156068.jpeg,"Everyone’s Racing to Win Free Crypto in BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles, Presale Soars to $395M!",https://thecoinrise.com/everyones-racing-to-win-free-crypto-in-blockdags-buyer-battles-presale-soars-to-395m/,"Most crypto presales follow a predictable path: pick a stage, buy some coins, and wait. But BlockDAG throws that routine out the window. Its Buyer Battles feature brings competition into the mix, turning each day into a real-time challenge for anyone participating. Instead of passive buying, users now actively compete for bonus BDAG. Each day, a fixed supply is released, and if there’s any left by the day’s end, the top buyer wins it all for free. That adds strategy, excitement, and unpredictability to every purchase. The format isn’t just fun, it’s working. With $395 million already raised, 26 billion BDAG sold, and 2,900% ROI from Batch 1 to now, BlockDAG has become one of the most talked-about presales of 2025. And with a limited-time offer dropping the price to $0.0013 until October 1, even more eyes are now on the battle board. How BlockDAG’s Daily Leaderboard Keeps Things Moving! Crypto launches often rely on countdowns and forced urgency to hype demand. BlockDAG doesn’t need that. Its built-in rules deliver natural pressure. Miss a day, and the leftover BDAG goes to someone else, no gimmicks, just math. Batch 30 is currently priced at $0.03, but a special cutback until October 1 prices BDAG at $0.0013. With each batch, the price moves up. But the Buyer Battles format means there’s more than just batch pricing at stake. Each day offers a fresh chance to score free coins. Skip the action, and that bonus goes to someone quicker. This setup has fueled ongoing interest. Instead of single-time buyers, BlockDAG is seeing repeat participants trying to time their entries. The numbers speak for themselves: 26 billion BDAG sold, nearly $395 million raised, and more showing up daily. Even smaller buyers can win. Since the scoreboard resets every 24 hours, a smartly timed buy can beat out yesterday’s bigger purchases. That potential keeps buyers engaged, not out of obligation, but because they’re chasing real rewards. Why Buyers Are Eyeing Major Deployment Event BlockDAG is ready to host a major Deployment Event in Singapore. After withdrawing from Token2049 due to local restrictions on presale promotions, the team opted to launch its own flagship event. Additionally, BlockDAG has introduced a new special presale price of $0.0013 per BDAG until October 1. This rate will remain in effect for the final 30 days leading up to deployment. This model is also keeping people engaged longer. Instead of buying once and disappearing, participants return daily to track volume, watch the leaderboard, and test their timing. It becomes part of their routine. And that routine has driven serious results, $395 million raised, 26 billion BDAG sold, and rising. By using mechanics instead of marketing tricks, BlockDAG has created a real-time competition that rewards attention, speed, and timing. It’s not hype, it’s gameplay with real rewards built in. Smart Buys and Big Moves Both Win BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles system gives both daring and consistent participants a shot at big rewards. Every day resets the scoreboard, which means someone new can win without needing deep pockets. If volume dips and timing is right, even a moderately sized buy can walk away with the free BDAG leftover for the day. At the same time, the format still leaves room for bold moves. Big buyers can make a calculated play, drop a high-value purchase during a slow window, and take the win. That’s what makes it more than just a buy-and-hold. It’s a competition where planning, risk, and daily action all matter. With the limited-time $0.0013 offer, the potential gains stretch even further. And this isn’t happening in isolation. BlockDAG has already sold 26 billion coins and collected over $395 million. Plus, with its growing user base, including 3 million X1 app users, there’s a full ecosystem building around this format. This isn’t just about who spends the most; it’s about who’s smart enough to win. Every day brings a new chance, and every action counts. Final Thoughts BlockDAG has introduced something rare in crypto presales: daily interaction that actually matters. Every buy has the potential to win extra BDAG, and every day resets the field. That’s not just engaging, it’s addictive in the best way. With over 26 billion coins already sold, a 2,900% return from the earliest batches, there’s still plenty of action left. With BDAG available at $0.0013 until October 1, it gives new buyers an edge that could be gone any day now. In a space flooded with copycat launches and boring presale mechanics, BlockDAG stands out. It’s turned participation into a daily event, with real upside, visible wins, and a growing global community. This isn’t just about funding the next blockchain; it’s about making every step of the process fun, competitive, and rewarding.

The moves, which continue to draw market attention, come as Bitcoin struggles to keep its price as the bearish market condition worsens. In a noted transfer, a Bitcoin whale shifted more than $3 billion in funds from Bitcoin into Ethereum. As a result, Ethereum price predictions are skyrocketing, as investors weigh the continued whale exodus from Bitcoin into Ethereum. Alongside ETH, analysts point out that the Bitcoin whales are also rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE —an Ethereum-based token gaining traction as a breakout altcoin opportunity to hold for Q4 2025. Whales Fuel Ethereum’s Surge Recent data shows major whale wallets selling BTC and buying ETH in bulk. One address offloaded 22,769 BTC worth $2.59B, picking up more than 886,000 ETH. Another day saw $456M worth of ETH purchased across multiple wallets. One whale even staked $1B in ETH, underscoring long-term conviction. Why the Rotation? Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin recently, rising 25% in August while BTC slipped 4%. Spot ETH ETFs added nearly $3.9B in inflows, signaling strong institutional interest. At the same time, ETH reserves on exchanges are shrinking as investors move coins to private wallets. Coupled with DeFi and NFT growth, ETH’s utility is proving hard to ignore. MAGACOIN FINANCE Grabs Bitcoin Whale Attention On-chain data trackers show Bitcoin whales rotating capital into MAGACOIN FINANCE. The moves into the project come as these traders continue to seek the best crypto investment before the year runs out. The attention from the whales has placed MAGACOIN FINANCE in the emerging altcoin 2025 conversations. While some highlight it as a hidden gem crypto, others point to its solid roadmap and community-driven momentum as factors that make it a long-term opportunity. With market attention now firmly on MAGACOIN FINANCE, analysts’ forecasts say it could deliver an outsized ROI. From current prices, that would make MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the best crypto opportunities to watch in 2025 . Market Impact The whale moves have shaken dominance metrics, with ETH gaining market share as BTC slips. Ethereum briefly hit $4,500 during peak activity, with analysts calling this the first spark of a possible upcoming altcoin season. On-chain trackers confirm whales are steadily selling BTC and stacking ETH, with some now holding more ETH than major corporations. Outlook Market momentum shows Ethereum’s institutional demand will continue to fuel its growth. The bigger question for investors is whether Ethereum will hit $6K as whale and institutional inflow deepen. That remains to be seen. However, with Ethereum-based tokens gaining fast momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned to end the year as one of the best crypto investments in 2025.

American Bitcoin Shares Jump 90% In a press release, Eric Trump, co-founder and chief strategy officer of American Bitcoin, described the listing as a “historic milestone,” emphasizing the company’s mission to integrate Bitcoin into the core of US capital markets. In line with President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto agenda, which has created a more accommodating environment for the growth of digital assets in the country, Eric expressed ambition for the US to lead the global Bitcoin economy. Related Reading: One Major Reason Bitcoin Hasn’t Reached $150,000, According To Trump’s Crypto Advisor Initially launched as a subsidiary of Hut 8, a publicly traded Bitcoin mining firm, American Bitcoin began trading at $6.90 per share following an all-stock merger with Gryphon Digital Mining. The ABTC stock experienced a remarkable surge, rising as much as 90% toward its current record of $14.52 in its first hour of trading, although it later settled to over a 40% increase, trading at $9.21 per share. Asher Genoot, executive chair of American Bitcoin and CEO of Hut 8, stated that the company aims to foster rapid growth in Bitcoin shares by leveraging its mining capabilities and Hut 8’s robust energy and digital infrastructure. Trump Family Expands Crypto Portfolio The listing of American Bitcoin is one of several similar moves by the Trump family in the digital asset space, following the approval of trading WLFI in August and its subsequent debut on exchanges such as Binance. The WLFI token experienced typical market reactions, spiking initially toward a new record of $0.47 before stabilizing close to its listing price between $0.20 and $0.22 for the last few days. According to CoinGecko data, World Liberty Financial has quickly climbed to become the 35th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, reaching a valuation of nearly $6 billion in record time. Related Reading: WLFI: The Next Cult Coin? Analyst Outlines Potential For Explosive Growth Current valuations suggest that their holdings in World Liberty Financial tokens could be worth around $5 billion, positioning them as one of the family’s most valuable assets. The Trump family’s financial interests in the cryptocurrency realm have garnered considerable attention, encompassing a range of projects from World Liberty tokens to a memecoin associated with President Trump himself launched in January. Eric Trump recently remarked that crypto has been “probably the most rewarding venture of my entire life,” reflecting his enthusiasm for the digital currency landscape. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $112,159, marking a modest 1% increase within the last 24 hours. Compared to the cryptocurrency’s record price of $124,100, the current price is 9% lower.

After years of uncertainty, sentiment around adoption and real-world payments is improving. The core question for traders and long-term holders is simple: can XRP finally make a run to 10 dollars in 2025? While Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to pull most of the institutional flow, some investors are diversifying beyond the leaders. That’s why early-stage plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE are getting attention as potential high-upside complements to a portfolio built around top assets. Why XRP Could Target $10 The path to double digits needs three things to line up: stronger liquidity, rising utility in payment corridors, and a supportive macro environment. If capital keeps rotating from majors into high-cap altcoins, XRP could benefit from deeper order books and tighter spreads, which historically supports larger price moves. More banks and fintechs testing tokenization and instant settlement can also lift on-chain activity, a key signal for sustained rallies. What must go right First, momentum from Bitcoin staying strong above six figures tends to expand risk appetite for altcoins. Second, steady growth in cross-border volume would reinforce XRP’s use case and help market price in future demand. Third, cleaner global rules around digital assets would encourage bigger participants to step in, improving liquidity and helping price discovery. The Rising Crypto Star In the middle of all this market action, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been flagged by early adopters as a high-potential bet. Presale allocations have been moving quickly, with growing wallet participation and a community focused on long-term utility, not just hype. The appeal is straightforward: limited early access , ongoing development, and a push to reward holders as the ecosystem expands. For investors building a barbell strategy – established large caps on one side, carefully chosen early-stage tokens on the other – MAGACOIN FINANCE is being watched as a possible breakout . XRP Price Scenarios for 2025 Bullish case: a strong altcoin season, rising payment volumes, and improved exchange liquidity could create the conditions for a breakout toward $10. This would likely need persistent weekly closes at higher highs, consistent volume expansion, and supportive macro headlines. Base case: if adoption and liquidity improve at a steady pace but the market rotates more slowly, XRP could grind into the $6 to $8 range, setting the stage for a later attempt at double digits. Bearish case: if Bitcoin dominance stays elevated or macro risk flares up, XRP might top out between $3 and $5 and wait for a better window. Sharp pullbacks are common in bull markets, so managing entries and avoiding heavy leverage near resistance becomes important. Conclusion A run to $10 is not guaranteed, but for the first time in years the setup looks achievable if utility, liquidity, and market conditions align. For investors who want both stability and shot-at-moon potential, combining a core position in large caps like XRP with a selective early-stage pick such as MAGACOIN FINANCE is one way to play 2025’s bull market.

Spot Crypto Trading Regulations The statement stems from a collaborative initiative between the SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets and the CFTC’s Divisions of Market Oversight and Clearing and Risk as part of the SEC’s Project Crypto and the CFTC’s Crypto Sprint, aimed at streamlining the trading of specific spot crypto asset products. The collaboration aligns with recommendations from the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, which advocates for a coordinated regulatory approach to ensure that the United States remains a leader in blockchain innovation and crypto markets. Key to this initiative is the recognition that existing laws do not prohibit SEC- or CFTC-registered exchanges from facilitating the trading of these spot crypto products. By coordinating their efforts, the two agencies aim to enhance the trading options available to market participants in the US. The joint statement encourages exchanges to engage with SEC and CFTC staff as they prepare to submit necessary registrations and proposals for trading these products. The regulatory framework established by the Commodity Exchange Act requires certain leveraged, margined, or financed retail commodity transactions to be conducted on designated contract markets (DCMs) or foreign boards of trade (FBOTs) registered with the CFTC. However, there is an exception for retail transactions listed on SEC-registered national securities exchanges (NSEs). The divisions have clarified that DCMs, FBOTs, and NSEs are permitted to facilitate the trading of specific spot crypto asset products, which could lead to increased market activity. Enhanced Trading Opportunities Ahead The SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets is ready to assist SEC-registered clearing agencies interested in participating, while the CFTC’s Division of Clearing and Risk is prepared to address inquiries from registered derivatives clearing organizations . Additionally, the statement emphasizes the importance of public dissemination of trade data, which can provide valuable insights to the market. The agencies are committed to fostering fair and orderly markets, believing that transparency and efficient executions will enhance competition and trading opportunities for all participants. A spokesperson for the CFTC told Crypto In America that the agency’s previous enforcement actions, which had sent a clear message that certain innovative activities in the crypto space would face scrutiny. However, the spokesperson asserts that this recent staff statement clarifies that such activities are permissible under current laws and that both agencies are willing to collaborate with registrants to facilitate their market entry.

After nearly 13 years of silence, a massive dormant wallet holding 479 BTC, worth approximately $53.68 million at current market prices, has suddenly sprung to life. This rare occurrence has sent ripples through the crypto community, sparking discussions about its potential implications for the market. What Just Happened? Decoding the Historic Bitcoin Whale Activity The address, which had remained untouched since 2011, executed a small transfer of 0.25 BTC to another wallet just moments ago. While the amount transferred is relatively minor compared to the total holdings, the sheer act of movement after such a long period of inactivity is what makes this event so noteworthy. In the crypto space, a ‘whale’ refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of cryptocurrency, capable of influencing market prices with their transactions. This specific Bitcoin whale activity is particularly intriguing due to the wallet’s long dormancy. Wallets that have been inactive for over a decade are often considered ‘sleeping giants.’ Their awakening can signal various things, from a long-lost owner regaining access to a strategic move by a savvy investor. Why Does Dormant Whale Movement Spark Such Interest? When a long-dormant whale address becomes active, it captures the market’s imagination for several reasons. Firstly, the sheer size of the holdings means that any subsequent large movements could potentially impact Bitcoin’s supply dynamics and price. Secondly, it adds an element of mystery and speculation to the market. Is this a sign of an impending sell-off, or perhaps a consolidation of funds? Historically, significant Bitcoin whale activity has sometimes preceded notable market shifts. While a single transaction of 0.25 BTC is not enough to move the market on its own, it serves as a powerful signal. It tells us that someone with substantial holdings, who has been off the grid for a very long time, is now paying attention. Market Sentiment: Such events can influence investor psychology, leading to increased speculation. Supply Dynamics: If the whale decides to move a larger portion of their holdings, it could affect the circulating supply. Price Volatility: While not immediate, future large transactions could introduce volatility. Is This a Signal for Bitcoin’s Future Price Action? Interpreting the motives behind such a move is challenging. It could be as simple as the owner testing access to their wallet after a long time. Alternatively, it might be the first step in a larger plan, such as consolidating funds across different wallets, preparing for a sale, or even repositioning for a new investment strategy. Some analysts might view this Bitcoin whale activity as a potential bearish signal, anticipating a future sell-off that could depress prices. Others might see it as a neutral event, or even a bullish one, if the whale is simply re-allocating assets in anticipation of further market growth. It is crucial for investors to remember that one whale’s actions do not necessarily dictate the entire market’s direction. However, monitoring these large players provides valuable insight into potential shifts in market sentiment and liquidity. The crypto market is known for its volatility, and the actions of large holders can certainly contribute to this. Navigating the Waters: What Should Investors Watch For? For those closely watching the market, the activation of this dormant wallet serves as a reminder to stay vigilant. While it is impossible to predict the exact intentions of the whale, monitoring subsequent transactions from this address will be key. Any further significant movements, especially larger transfers to exchanges, would warrant closer attention. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor On-Chain Data: Utilize blockchain explorers to track further transactions from the awakened wallet. Observe Market Reaction: Pay attention to how the broader market reacts to any subsequent large whale movements. Avoid Panic: Do not make rash investment decisions based on isolated whale activity. This unexpected Bitcoin whale activity underscores the dynamic and often mysterious nature of the crypto landscape. It’s a fascinating development that will undoubtedly keep the community buzzing. Conclusion The awakening of a 479 BTC wallet after nearly 13 years is a truly historic event in the world of cryptocurrency. While the initial transaction was small, its significance lies in breaking a long period of dormancy, signaling that a major player is back in action. This Bitcoin whale activity offers a captivating glimpse into the potential movements of significant capital and reminds us of the constant evolution and intrigue within the digital asset space. The crypto community will be eagerly watching to see what this long-dormant giant decides to do next. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a crypto whale? A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency, often enough to influence its market price through significant buy or sell orders. Why is dormant wallet activity significant? Dormant wallet activity is significant because it indicates that a large holder, who has been inactive for a long time, is now engaging with their assets. This can lead to speculation about their intentions and potential market impact. Could this whale sell all its BTC? It’s possible, but not guaranteed. The initial small transfer could be a test, a consolidation, or the first step in a larger liquidation. Predicting the full extent of a whale’s future actions is speculative. How can I track Bitcoin whale movements? You can track Bitcoin whale movements using blockchain explorers (like Blockchain.com or Blockchair) by monitoring large transactions from known whale addresses or by using specialized crypto analytics platforms. What does this specific Bitcoin whale activity mean for Bitcoin’s price? While the initial small transfer itself won’t directly impact Bitcoin’s price, it signals potential future movements from a large holder. Any subsequent large transfers, especially to exchanges, could introduce volatility, but it’s not a definitive predictor of price direction.

Navigating the Path to Digital Asset Integration While the benefits of Bitcoin accumulation are clear for many, integrating digital assets into a corporate treasury strategy comes with its own set of considerations.

American self-made millionaire and entrepreneur, Grant Cardone, has successfully sold his opulent Miami mansion in Golden Beach for an astonishing 400 Bitcoin (BTC), equivalent to $43 million. This landmark Bitcoin real estate transaction, reported by Bitcoin News on X, occurred with remarkable speed, finding a buyer within just 72 hours of being listed. It underscores a powerful shift, demonstrating how digital currencies are increasingly becoming a viable and preferred medium for high-value asset exchanges. What Makes This Bitcoin Real Estate Transaction So Significant? Grant Cardone’s recent sale is more than just a headline-grabbing deal; it represents a pivotal moment for the integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance. This particular Bitcoin real estate transaction stands out for several compelling reasons: Unprecedented Speed: Selling a multi-million dollar property, especially one of this caliber, in just 72 hours is exceptionally rare in the traditional market. The use of Bitcoin likely streamlined the transaction process, bypassing some of the typical delays associated with conventional banking systems. Massive Scale: A $43 million property changing hands for 400 BTC highlights the growing confidence in Bitcoin as a store of value and a medium of exchange for substantial wealth. It’s not just small purchases; we are talking about significant capital. Validation for Crypto: For years, skeptics questioned the practical utility of cryptocurrencies beyond speculative trading. This sale offers tangible proof of Bitcoin’s growing acceptance and utility in the luxury asset market, pushing it further into the mainstream. Cardone’s Influence: As a well-known entrepreneur and financial influencer, Grant Cardone’s endorsement of such a transaction lends considerable credibility to the concept of digital asset payments, encouraging others to explore similar avenues. This event signals a maturing market where digital assets are no longer confined to niche tech circles but are actively shaping global commerce. Is Bitcoin Real Estate Becoming the New Norm for Luxury Deals? While Grant Cardone’s sale is a high-profile example, it’s part of a broader trend. The appeal of using cryptocurrencies for high-value purchases, particularly in real estate, is steadily growing. Many believe that Bitcoin real estate transactions offer distinct advantages: Enhanced Efficiency: Cryptocurrency transactions can settle much faster than traditional wire transfers, which often involve multiple intermediaries and can take days, especially for international deals. Reduced Fees: Depending on the platform and network conditions, crypto transactions can sometimes incur lower fees compared to the significant charges associated with large fiat transfers or international banking. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin transcends geographical boundaries, making it easier for international buyers and sellers to conduct transactions without the complexities of currency conversions and cross-border banking regulations. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the challenges. The volatility of cryptocurrencies, for instance, means the value of 400 BTC could fluctuate significantly between the agreement and settlement dates. Regulatory uncertainties and complex tax implications also remain key considerations for anyone venturing into this space. Despite these hurdles, the momentum suggests that crypto-backed property deals are here to stay and likely to increase. Navigating the Future of Digital Asset Transactions For individuals considering entering the world of Bitcoin real estate , whether as a buyer or a seller, several actionable insights are paramount. The landscape is evolving rapidly, and being well-informed is key to success: Seek Expert Advice: Always consult with legal and financial professionals who specialize in cryptocurrency and real estate. They can help navigate the complex tax implications, regulatory requirements, and ensure a smooth, compliant transaction. Understand Volatility: Be prepared for potential price fluctuations. Strategies like locking in the fiat value at the time of agreement or using stablecoins might be considered, though Cardone’s deal was purely BTC. Secure Custody Solutions: Ensure robust security for your digital assets. Whether using hardware wallets or reputable institutional custodians, protecting your Bitcoin is vital. Verify Authenticity: Due diligence is even more critical in crypto transactions. Verify the legitimacy of all parties involved and the authenticity of the digital assets being exchanged.

In a remarkable display of market strength, these exchange-traded funds have recorded significant net inflows for the second consecutive trading day, signaling a growing appetite for institutional exposure to Bitcoin. What’s Fueling the Latest Spot Bitcoin ETFs Surge? On September 3, U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively saw an impressive $301.15 million in net inflows. This figure not only highlights sustained interest but also builds on the momentum from the previous day’s positive performance. It’s a clear indicator that despite market fluctuations, investors are increasingly looking towards regulated vehicles to gain access to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This consistent influx of capital suggests a maturing market. Investors, both institutional and retail, are finding comfort and convenience in the structure offered by these ETFs. It simplifies the process of investing in Bitcoin without the complexities of direct ownership or managing private keys. Which Spot Bitcoin ETFs Led the Charge? The recent inflows weren’t evenly distributed, with some major players attracting the lion’s share of new capital. Here’s a breakdown of the top performers: BlackRock’s IBIT: This fund led by a significant margin, pulling in a massive $290.46 million. BlackRock’s strong market presence and reputation likely contributed to its impressive performance. Grayscale’s Mini BTC: Securing the second spot, Grayscale’s offering attracted $28.83 million in net inflows. This indicates continued interest in Grayscale’s diversified product range. Fidelity’s FBTC: Fidelity’s Spot Bitcoin ETF also saw positive movement, adding $9.76 million. Fidelity remains a strong contender in the evolving ETF landscape. However, not all funds experienced growth. Ark Invest’s ARKB recorded $27.9 million in outflows, demonstrating the dynamic nature of investor preferences and portfolio rebalancing within the sector. The remaining ETFs reported no significant net inflows or outflows during this period. Why Do Consistent Inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs Matter? The sustained positive inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs are more than just numbers; they represent several critical aspects for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem: Mainstream Adoption: These inflows signify growing mainstream acceptance and validation of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Traditional financial institutions are increasingly comfortable offering Bitcoin exposure through regulated products. Market Stability: Consistent demand from ETFs can contribute to greater price stability for Bitcoin. Large institutional purchases can act as a counterbalance to retail market volatility. Liquidity Enhancement: Increased activity in these ETFs enhances market liquidity, making it easier for large investors to enter and exit positions without significantly impacting Bitcoin’s price. Regulatory Confidence: The very existence and success of these regulated products underscore a growing confidence from regulatory bodies, paving the way for further innovation in the digital asset space. This trend suggests a maturing market where digital assets are moving from the fringes to a more central role in global finance. It’s a powerful statement about the long-term potential of Bitcoin. What’s Next for Spot Bitcoin ETFs and the Crypto Market? Looking ahead, the continued performance of Spot Bitcoin ETFs will be a key indicator for the broader cryptocurrency market. While the recent inflows are certainly positive, investors should remain aware of potential challenges: Market Volatility: Bitcoin, like all cryptocurrencies, remains subject to significant price swings. ETF performance can reflect this volatility. Regulatory Changes: Evolving regulatory landscapes could impact the operational framework and investor appeal of these products. Competitive Landscape: As more funds enter the market, competition for investor capital will intensify, potentially leading to fee compression and differentiated offerings. Despite these considerations, the current trajectory points towards a future where institutional participation in digital assets becomes even more entrenched. The accessibility and regulatory oversight offered by Spot Bitcoin ETFs are proving to be powerful catalysts for this evolution. A Compelling Outlook for Digital Assets The recent data from September 3, showing $301.15 million in net inflows for U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs , paints a compelling picture of growing investor confidence and market maturity. Funds like BlackRock’s IBIT are leading the charge, demonstrating the significant institutional appetite for regulated Bitcoin exposure. This sustained interest is a strong testament to Bitcoin’s evolving role in the financial world, pushing digital assets further into the mainstream. As these trends continue, the impact on liquidity, stability, and broader adoption of cryptocurrencies will be profound, marking an exciting chapter for the entire ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions About Spot Bitcoin ETFs Q1: What is a Spot Bitcoin ETF? A Spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Bitcoin. It allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without having to buy, store, or manage the actual cryptocurrency themselves. Q2: Why are these inflows significant? Significant inflows indicate growing institutional and retail investor confidence in Bitcoin as an asset class. They also suggest increasing mainstream adoption and potentially greater market stability and liquidity for Bitcoin. Q3: Which firms are offering Spot Bitcoin ETFs?

Analysts continue to debate whether the long-term Bitcoin price prediction of $ 250,000 remains alive, despite ETF-driven outflows and volatility. Simultaneously, inflows into Ethereum demonstrate a changing institutional preference, raising the debate over Bitcoin versus Ethereum investment. While the majors grab all the headlines, investors are also setting their sights on MAGACOIN FINANCE , a new low-cap altcoin with major ROI potential that has been tipped one of the best new altcoins to buy 2025. Bitcoin’s $250K Forecast Backed by Institutional and Real-World Growth As per the recent data, bitcoin is currently trading at $109,380. In the past 24 hours, the prices of bitcoin have increased with an addition of $2.18 trillion. Moreover, bitcoin has a trading volume of over $66 billion. This has led to the holders suggesting $250k price value could be in place in the coming future. This information and suggestion would be a bolstering value for anyone who is looking to invest in bitcoin. Although the price movement continues to remain in a downward channel pattern, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency is witnessing major changes due to institutional adoption and whale activity. Bitcoin’s utility also continues to expand. The Hong Kong University is trialing a scheme that allows paying tuition with Bitcoin. By collaborating with fintech providers, the service instantly changes BTC to Hong Kong dollars, thus, cutting the cost of transactions and making it easier for students. Experts think similar models can be adopted by other institutions across Asia. If that happens, Bitcoin will not just be seen as an investment, but also as something that can be used practically. This increases its effectiveness as a global medium of exchange. Ethereum Whale Buys $3B — Institutional Shift Signals Momentum A massive crypto investor who possesses more than $11 billion in Bitcoin has moved part of his portfolio towards Ether. Last week, the wallet sold $215 million in BTC to buy 886,371 ETH worth nearly $4 billion now, surpassing corporate holder SharpLink in Ethereum reserves. According to Arkham Intelligence, the whale had been inactive for seven years before returning to the market. In just a week, this wallet accumulates $2.5 billion in Ethereum. At one time, the whale’s Bitcoin wallet was worth over $5 billion. This timing isn’t random. The whale’s activity occurred alongside a larger shift of ETFs. According to SoSoValue, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds registered outflows of $751 million in August, while Ethereum ETFs were $3.87 billion. Early-Stage Altcoin Opportunity With ROI Potential Amid the shifting institutional flows, one rising project drawing attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Positioned as an unique high-growth altcoin , the project has been gaining traction among analysts and retail traders for its scarcity-driven tokenomics and dual-audit verification. Some even point to crypto whales buying MAGACOIN FINANCE in anticipation of its first listings, likening the move to early Ethereum or Solana entry points. With its sub-$0.01 pricing, MAGACOIN is considered by many as a low-cap altcoin with ROI potential , fitting into the broader theme of the best crypto to buy 2025 . Final Thoughts The long-term Bitcoin $250K target remains a cornerstone of many analyst forecasts, reinforced by expanding adoption and consistent whale accumulation. Ethereum, buoyed by $3B in inflows, is also proving its staying power as institutions diversify. Yet, the rise of emerging tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE shows how market participants are blending blue-chip conviction with early-stage bets. For investors looking beyond the giants, the opportunity to capture upside from both ends of the spectrum is becoming increasingly clear.

Recently, Spot ETH ETFs have entered a challenging phase, experiencing net outflows for three consecutive trading days. This trend, particularly evident with BlackRock’s ETHA fund, which saw a staggering $151.56 million withdrawn, is prompting investors and analysts alike to closely examine market sentiment and the future trajectory of Ethereum’s institutional adoption. What exactly is driving these withdrawals, and what could they mean for the broader crypto landscape? Decoding the Recent Spot ETH ETFs Outflows On September 3, U.S. Spot ETH ETFs collectively recorded net outflows of $38.42 million. This figure, while significant, masks a more nuanced picture when we look at individual fund performances. BlackRock’s ETHA fund, a prominent player in the market, was hit particularly hard, accounting for the vast majority of the day’s withdrawals. This substantial outflow from a single fund certainly raises eyebrows and impacts the overall market perception, according to data from TraderT. However, it is crucial to note that not all funds faced the same fate. In a display of contrasting investor behavior, several other Spot ETH ETFs actually attracted new capital. For instance: Fidelity’s FETH secured $65.78 million in net inflows. Bitwise’s ETHW gained $20.81 million. Grayscale’s Mini ETH added $26.55 million. These varied results suggest that while there might be broader market pressures, investor confidence is not uniform across all Ethereum-backed investment vehicles. Some investors are clearly choosing to reallocate their capital within the ETF ecosystem, rather than exiting it entirely. Why Are Spot ETH ETFs Experiencing Withdrawals? Understanding the reasons behind these withdrawals requires a look at several potential factors influencing investor decisions. One primary driver could be general market volatility or a shift towards a more risk-averse sentiment among investors. When the broader cryptocurrency market experiences corrections or uncertainty, investors often opt to secure profits or reduce exposure to more volatile assets like Ethereum. Another significant factor might be profit-taking. Early investors in these Spot ETH ETFs , especially those who entered during periods of lower Ethereum prices, could be cashing out to realize gains. Furthermore, broader macroeconomic concerns, such as inflation trends or interest rate changes, can also impact investment in risk assets. It is also possible that some investors are rotating their capital into other cryptocurrencies or even traditional financial instruments, seeking different opportunities. The divergence in fund performance also suggests a strategic reallocation. Investors might be moving from one ETF provider to another, perhaps based on fees, performance expectations, or liquidity. This highlights that while the headline number shows outflows, the underlying dynamics are complex and multifaceted, impacting the demand for Spot ETH ETFs . Navigating the Future of Spot ETH ETFs and Ethereum What do these recent outflows signal for the future of Ethereum and its institutional investment products? While a third day of net withdrawals is a point of concern, it does not necessarily indicate a long-term decline in institutional interest. The inflows into other funds demonstrate that capital is still flowing into the Ethereum ecosystem, albeit with a redistribution among different products. These trends serve as a crucial indicator of evolving market sentiment. They suggest that investors are becoming more discerning, carefully evaluating their positions in Spot ETH ETFs . The market for these products is still relatively nascent, and such fluctuations are part of its maturation process. For Ethereum, sustained large outflows could potentially exert downward pressure on its price, but the overall resilience and ongoing development of the network remain key factors for its long-term outlook. Investors should continue to monitor not just the aggregate outflow figures but also the individual performance of various funds. This detailed analysis provides a clearer picture of where capital is truly moving and helps in making informed decisions about exposure to Spot ETH ETFs and the broader Ethereum market. In conclusion, the recent three-day streak of net outflows from U.S. Spot ETH ETFs , particularly the significant withdrawal from BlackRock’s ETHA, certainly captures attention. However, the simultaneous inflows into other funds like Fidelity’s FETH and Bitwise’s ETHW paint a more nuanced picture of a dynamic market. This period highlights the complex interplay of investor sentiment, profit-taking, and strategic reallocation within the nascent institutional Ethereum investment landscape. As the market matures, understanding these intricate movements will be vital for all participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Spot ETH ETFs What exactly is a Spot ETH ETF? A Spot ETH ETF, or Exchange-Traded Fund, directly holds Ethereum (ETH) as its underlying asset. This allows investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without directly owning or managing the cryptocurrency themselves, providing a more regulated and accessible investment vehicle. Why are some Spot ETH ETFs seeing outflows while others see inflows? The mixed performance often reflects investor decisions based on various factors such as fund fees, liquidity, provider reputation, or even specific investment strategies. Investors might be reallocating capital from one fund to another within the same asset class, rather than exiting the asset entirely. Does this mean institutional interest in Ethereum is waning? Not necessarily. While some funds experienced outflows, others saw significant inflows. This suggests a potential redistribution of institutional capital among different Spot ETH ETFs rather than a complete withdrawal from Ethereum as an asset class. Institutional interest remains strong, but its allocation can shift. How do these outflows impact Ethereum’s price? Significant and sustained outflows from Spot ETH ETFs can put downward pressure on Ethereum’s price, as it indicates selling pressure from institutional holders. However, the overall impact also depends on broader market sentiment, other buying pressures, and the fundamental developments within the Ethereum network. What should investors consider when looking at Spot ETH ETF data? Investors should look beyond aggregate numbers and examine individual fund flows, volume, and the underlying reasons for movements. Consider the broader market context, macroeconomic factors, and Ethereum’s fundamental developments. Diversification and a long-term perspective are always key. Did you find this analysis insightful?

Breaking news from the dynamic world of cryptocurrency! A significant development has just unfolded, drawing the keen attention of investors and analysts alike. On-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa recently reported a massive NEIRO deposit that has sent ripples through the market. Specifically, two addresses linked to Trend Research, widely recognized as the largest holder of NEIRO tokens, transferred an astonishing 77.9 million NEIRO, equivalent to $6.04 million, to the Bybit exchange. This substantial NEIRO deposit occurred over a mere 20-minute window, immediately sparking intense discussions and speculation across the crypto community. What’s the Buzz About This Huge NEIRO Deposit? The core of this market chatter revolves around Trend Research, an entity well-known for its substantial holdings in NEIRO. When such a prominent player executes a large-scale transaction, the crypto world takes notice. The sheer volume of this particular NEIRO deposit —77.9 million tokens—is what makes it particularly noteworthy. Who is Trend Research? They are identified as the single largest holder of NEIRO, meaning their actions can significantly sway market sentiment and potentially the token’s price. The Specifics: The transfer involved 77.9 million NEIRO, valued at $6.04 million, moved to Bybit. Bybit is a major cryptocurrency exchange, often used for trading and liquidity. Why it Matters: Historically, large deposits of tokens to exchanges are frequently interpreted by the market as a precursor to selling. While this isn’t always the definitive outcome, it’s a strong signal that often leads to increased selling pressure or market volatility. This insight, brought to light by on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa, provides crucial transparency into the movements of significant market participants. Understanding these movements is vital for anyone involved in the NEIRO ecosystem. What Are the Potential Market Implications of This NEIRO Deposit? A NEIRO deposit of this magnitude from the largest holder naturally raises questions about its potential impact on the token’s price and overall market stability. The crypto market is highly sensitive to the actions of whales, and Trend Research certainly fits that description for NEIRO. Here’s a breakdown of what this could mean: Increased Selling Pressure: The most immediate concern is that this substantial NEIRO deposit could be intended for liquidation. If Trend Research decides to sell a significant portion of these tokens, it would inject a large supply into the market, potentially driving down NEIRO’s price due to an imbalance of supply and demand. Heightened Market Volatility: Even the anticipation of a large sell-off can trigger significant price fluctuations. Traders might react by opening short positions or selling their holdings preemptively, leading to increased volatility and rapid price movements in either direction. Shifting Investor Sentiment: Such a move from a major holder can create uncertainty and anxiety among smaller investors. This can sometimes lead to panic selling, as others follow suit, fearing a significant price drop. Confidence in the token might be temporarily shaken. Liquidity Dynamics: While Bybit is a robust exchange, a $6 million deposit of a single token could still influence its liquidity. If a large portion is sold quickly, it could temporarily strain the order books. It is crucial to remember that a deposit does not automatically equate to a sale. However, the market typically interprets such large movements with caution. Navigating the Uncertainty: How Should NEIRO Holders React to This Development? In light of this significant NEIRO deposit , it’s natural for current and potential NEIRO holders to wonder how to best proceed. Prudent decision-making, based on information rather than emotion, is key during such periods of market uncertainty. Consider the following actionable insights: Stay Informed and Monitor Closely: Keep a close eye on NEIRO’s price action and any further on-chain movements from Trend Research. Follow reputable on-chain analysts and news sources for real-time updates. The situation can evolve rapidly. Understand the Broader Context: While a large NEIRO deposit often signals potential selling, there could be other reasons. Trend Research might be preparing for liquidity provision for new decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, participating in staking pools, or engaging in arbitrage strategies. However, given their “largest holder” status, a potential sale remains a primary consideration. Review Your Risk Management Strategy: For those already holding NEIRO, this is an opportune moment to review your portfolio and assess your risk exposure. Consider setting stop-loss orders to protect against significant downside movements, or re-evaluate your position size based on your comfort level with volatility. Avoid Impulsive Decisions: The crypto market thrives on narratives and emotions. Resist the urge to panic sell or make hasty investment decisions based solely on this news. Take time to analyze the situation and consult multiple sources. Re-evaluate Your Investment Thesis: Ask yourself if this event fundamentally alters your long-term investment thesis for NEIRO. Is the project’s technology, adoption, or team still strong? Short-term price fluctuations, while impactful, do not always reflect long-term value. Ultimately, the actions of a single large holder, while influential, should be weighed against the overall health and future prospects of the NEIRO project itself. Conclusion: A Vigilant Approach to the NEIRO Deposit The recent substantial NEIRO deposit by Trend Research to Bybit represents a pivotal moment for the NEIRO community. While the exact intentions behind this $6.04 million transfer remain unconfirmed, its potential implications for market dynamics are undeniable. This event underscores the importance of on-chain analysis in providing transparency and allowing investors to make informed decisions. As the market digests this news, a vigilant and strategic approach is paramount. Investors should prioritize staying informed, understanding the various potential scenarios, and managing their risks effectively. In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, proactive engagement and a clear strategy are your best allies in navigating such significant developments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is NEIRO? A1: NEIRO is a specific cryptocurrency token. Its exact purpose and utility would depend on the project it belongs to, but like other cryptocurrencies, it can be traded, held, or used within its native ecosystem. Q2: Who is Trend Research in the context of NEIRO? A2: Trend Research is identified as the largest individual or institutional holder of NEIRO tokens. Their significant holdings mean their actions can have a notable impact on the token’s market dynamics. Q3: Why is a large NEIRO deposit to an exchange considered significant? A3: When a large volume of tokens is deposited to an exchange, it typically increases the available supply for trading. This is often interpreted as a signal that the holder might be preparing to sell, which could lead to increased selling pressure and potentially a price drop. Q4: Does this NEIRO deposit guarantee a price drop for NEIRO? A4: No, a deposit does not guarantee a price drop. While it often signals potential selling, the tokens could also be moved for other reasons, such as providing liquidity for new products, engaging in arbitrage, or internal rebalancing. However, the market usually reacts cautiously to such large movements. Q5: How can I track large cryptocurrency movements like this NEIRO deposit? A5: You can track large cryptocurrency movements using on-chain analytics platforms and services. These tools monitor blockchain transactions and identify significant transfers by whales or major holders, often providing real-time alerts and insights.

51160067,https://square.htx.com/?p=45946,1756954800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/100/default.png,"Trump-Backed WLFI Lists on HTX, Paving the Way for Inclusive and Compliant Finance",https://square.htx.com/trump-backed-wlfi-lists-on-htx-paving-the-way-for-inclusive-and-compliant-finance-2/,"Panama City, September 43, 2025 – World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a pioneering project backed by the Trump family, officially launched on HTX on September 1. This landmark moment is more than just a token launch—it signals the start of a new chapter in regulated and inclusive crypto finance. HTX became the first major exchange to list WLFI, with spot trading going live at 12:00 (UTC) on September 1. Three Core Pillars Redefine Crypto Finance Rather than being a simple evolution of existing crypto products, WLFI aims to bring “inclusive finance” to the forefront through three key approaches: ● Solving Problems in Traditional Finance : WLFI is dedicated to addressing the long-standing issue of non-transparency in traditional banking. By leveraging blockchain’s open and transparent nature, it ensures that every transaction and decision is clear and traceable. ● Focusing on Marginalized Communities : WLFI’s core mission is to provide users with reliable financial tools while protecting them from the risk of arbitrary account closures by banks, ensuring continuous access to financial services. By prioritizing regions with limited banking coverage and large unbanked populations, WLFI delivers a comprehensive set of practical financial solutions. Compared to traditional financial institutions, WLFI offers greater value through lower fees, higher returns, and a more user-friendly service experience. ● Integrating Crypto Advantages : WLFI merges the benefits of cryptocurrency with the power of self-sovereign assets. This fusion led to the introduction of USD1, a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Upon launch, USD1 quickly became the fastest-growing stablecoin in history. WLFI is developing a robust WLFI App that will offer a variety of financial services. The ultimate goal is to make crypto payments accessible to everyone, everywhere, and to bring crypto finance into the mainstream. HTX: An Incubator and Strategic Partner As a leading global crypto exchange, HTX is more than just the platform for WLFI’s initial launch; it is a full-fledged participant in the project’s development. 1. Premier Platform for Token Launches HTX was the first platform to list USD1 on May 6, 2025, and immediately launched a limited-time zero-fee event for the USD1/USDT spot trading pair to reduce trading costs and significantly boost liquidity. The subsequent listing of the WLFI token reinforced HTX’s position as the primary launchpad. 2. Innovative Mechanisms to Incentivize User Participation On August 8, HTX announced that it had become one of the launch partners for the USD1 Points Program , which incentivizes users to actively participate in the WLFI ecosystem through activities such as trading, holding, and staking USD1. This initiative has boosted USD1’s trading activity, enhanced user loyalty, and transformed participants into active contributors driving ecosystem growth. 3. Events to Boost Ecosystem and User Interests HTX is launching a variety of events to boost the popularity of WLFI, including: Futures Trading Competition: A WLFI futures trading competition running from August 27 to September 3, featuring a prize pool of 10,000 USDT. Points Incentive Program: The USD1 Points Program is fully live, allowing users to earn points through spot trading and on-chain deposits for an enhanced wealth experience. Limited-Time WLFI Earn Carnival: Starting September 1 at 13:00 (UTC), users can subscribe to the WLFI Flexible product and enjoy a 20% APY. More exclusive events will be announced to further boost user activity and engagement. 4. HTX and WLFI Strategic Partnership Drives Project Growth HTX maintains a strong strategic partnership with WLFI, serving as a key platform for its strategic rollout. From promoting USD1 to supporting WLFI’s listing, HTX has actively contributed at every stage. Leveraging its robust platform capabilities, HTX continuously provides technical expertise, market reach, and liquidity resources, strengthening WLFI‘s market edge and accelerating its growth in a competitive crypto landscape. The launch of WLFI signals the emergence of a new financial model, with HTX being an important driving force to transform this experiment into reality. This partnership has the potential to bridge digital assets with traditional political and economic forces, injecting momentum into the global financial landscape and guiding crypto finance into a new era of development.

South Korea is making a decisive move in the digital asset space with a new South Korean stablecoin bill , signaling a shift towards tighter regulation for foreign-issued digital currencies. Democratic Party lawmaker Lee Kang-il recently announced plans to propose the Digital Asset Innovation Act. This legislation aims to restrict the indiscriminate circulation of stablecoins issued overseas, ensuring they meet specific requirements set by South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC). Understanding the South Korean Stablecoin Bill: Why the Urgency? The motivation behind this crucial South Korean stablecoin bill is multifaceted. Regulators are increasingly concerned about potential financial instability, money laundering risks, and the need to protect local investors from unregulated foreign entities. Currently, many foreign stablecoins circulate domestically without stringent local oversight. This situation poses systemic risks that the FSC aims to mitigate through comprehensive legislation. This legislative push aligns with a growing global trend towards greater digital asset regulation. By establishing clear guidelines, South Korea seeks to enhance market integrity and ensure a safer environment for its citizens engaging with cryptocurrencies. It’s a proactive step to manage the rapid evolution of the digital finance landscape. What Requirements Will Foreign Stablecoins Face? The proposed Digital Asset Innovation Act will introduce specific criteria for foreign stablecoins to operate legally within South Korea. While the full details are still emerging from the FSC, key requirements are expected to include: Licensing and Registration: Foreign issuers will likely need to obtain explicit authorization from South Korean authorities. Capital Reserves: Demonstrating sufficient, regularly audited reserves to fully back their stablecoins will be mandatory. Consumer Protection Measures: Adherence to local investor safeguards, including clear disclosure requirements and accessible dispute resolution mechanisms. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Know Your Customer (KYC): Strict compliance with South Korean financial regulations designed to prevent illicit activities. This framework intends to level the playing field for domestic stablecoin projects and ensure that all digital assets operating in the country meet high standards of transparency and security. Impact of the South Korean Stablecoin Bill on the Crypto Ecosystem The implications of this South Korean stablecoin bill are far-reaching. For foreign stablecoin issuers, it presents a significant challenge. They may need to undertake costly and complex adaptations to their current operations to comply with the new rules. Issuers unable or unwilling to meet these new standards might face restricted or even prohibited access to the lucrative South Korean market. Conversely, domestic stablecoin projects could see a substantial boost, as the regulations may create a more secure and predictable environment for their growth and innovation. This move by South Korea could also influence other nations currently considering similar regulatory frameworks for digital assets. It highlights a global shift towards a more regulated, rather than entirely permissionless, crypto environment. Navigating the New Landscape: Insights for Stablecoin Projects For stablecoin developers and companies eyeing the South Korean market, proactive engagement and strategic planning are absolutely crucial. Adapting to the upcoming changes will be key to sustained success. Consider these actionable insights: Monitor Developments Closely: Stay updated on the FSC’s specific requirements as they are formalized. Official announcements and guidance will be vital.

However, some analysts are still hopeful that ETH is likely to surge beyond $5,000 in the coming weeks, thanks to its rising illiquid supply and positive exchange-traded fund (ETF) momentum. Ethereum To Hit $5,500 In September? According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, Ethereum’s latest upswing in August which pushed the digital asset from a range of $3,700 – $4,000 to its latest all-time high (ATH) of $4,946, was largely buoyed by broader market rally and positive ETF inflows. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Latest Rally Fueled By Large-Scale Binance Orders, Analyst Says The analyst noted that ETH reserves on Binance crypto exchange witnessed a sharp uptick in August. The quick surge in inflow of tokens to the exchange shows that holders are choosing to sell or take profits at higher prices. Arab Chain shared the following chart which shows both liquid (green) and illiquid (beige) ETH supply. According to the chart, the vast majority of ETH supply remains illiquid, creating a structural supply shortage. On the other hand, the chart shows a slight increase in the liquid supply, suggesting that a portion of ETH has returned to circulation and could add to short-term selling pressure. The analyst remarked: The overall illiquidity of the supply reinforces the long-term bullish outlook. Short-term cautionary signals – rising Binance reserves combined with a small increase in liquid supply – suggest a potential correction after the recent strong upswing. If the growth in ETH reserves on Binance shows signs of slowing down or withdrawals resume, the digital asset’s supply shortage will remain pronounced. Consequently, a clear and decisive break above the $4,800 resistance level could propel ETH toward $5,200 – $5,500 in the near term. The CryptoQuant analyst concluded by saying that September is likely to witness sideways to a slightly bullish move for ETH between $4,300 to $5,000. However, a failure to break through the $4,800 level – coupled with rising exchange reserves – could raise the possibility of a correction to $4,200. What’s In Store For ETH? While a breakout above $4,800 is possible, some analysts are tempering their expectations by saying that ETH may test the psychologically important $4,000 level before resuming its uptrend.

According to a recent report, ETH whales added a whopping 260,000 ETH to their wallets on September 1.

While analysts track the ETF race, many traders are also watching MAGACOIN FINANCE , an altcoin that is drawing attention for those seeking strategic investment, hedge, and diversification opportunities. Solana ETF Odds Soar as Confidence Builds The case for a Solana ETF has gained remarkable traction in 2025. Bloomberg Intelligence initially raised the odds of a U.S. spot Solana ETF approval from 70% in February to 90% by April. By midyear, Polymarket pushed the probability even higher, with traders pricing in a 99% likelihood. Analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas eventually locked in their forecast at 95%, with an SEC decision expected by October. This optimism is matched by real progress. The launch of the REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF (SSK) in July marked a milestone, even if its structure differs from a direct spot product. The fund allocates at least 40% to international Solana ETFs, charges a 1.4% fee, and carries a staking yield of around 7.3%. Adding to the momentum, the SEC has streamlined its review timelines, cutting approval windows from the usual 240 days to just 75. This regulatory adjustment could fast-track Solana’s ETF journey. For traders eyeing the best altcoin to buy , SOL remains in focus. Analysts have projected upside ranges stretching from $300 to as high as $2,700 if institutional demand accelerates following an ETF launch. XRP ETF Anticipation Nears Peak While Solana commands attention, XRP has become an equally hot ETF candidate. Bloomberg analysts recently increased the odds of XRP ETF approval to 95%, placing it alongside Solana and Litecoin in the race for October decisions. The groundwork is clear: asset managers like Grayscale, Bitwise, WisdomTree, and Franklin Templeton have filed updated applications. Meanwhile, XRP futures open interest has surged past $800 million, showing institutional readiness. Analysts also argue that an ETF could push XRP into new price territory. Commentator Kenny Nguyen suggested XRP could climb between $22 and $50 once ETFs go live, compared to today’s price of $3.11. Estimates of inflows range from $5 billion to over $16 billion, potentially propelling XRP’s market cap well into the trillions. Regulatory uncertainty remains a factor, given Ripple’s ongoing legal disputes with the SEC. Yet the streamlined disclosure and custody standards introduced this year could clear a smoother path forward. For traders deciding on the best altcoin to buy , XRP’s ETF angle cannot be ignored. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Strategic Hedge Altcoin Amid Solana and XRP ETF momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention as a strategic hedge and diversification play . For traders who missed the early moves in SOL and XRP, MAGACOIN offers another angle—rooted in utility, fundamentals, and speculation on exchange listings . Analysts believe this altcoin could outperform ETF-driven moves with an easy 15X surge post-listing. The project positions itself as a way to ride crypto’s next major wave while staying aligned with core investment strategies like hedging and diversification. For anyone scouting the best altcoin to buy in 2025 , MAGACOIN has emerged as a name worth watching. How Traders Can Position Themselves With ETF approvals looming for Solana and XRP, the landscape for altcoins is shifting quickly. Traders looking for the best altcoin to buy should weigh ETF-driven names alongside emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which provides a different path for exposure.

Analysts say the blockchain could possibly double its value in the upcoming bull market cycle. Cardano, which is renowned for its innovation and strong ecosystem, remains one of the leading cryptocurrency blockchain networks. Recent network upgrades, ecosystem milestones, and growing institutional debate are reshaping its long-term outlook. Alongside ADA, top altcoins Chainlink, Polkadot, and XRP are drawing attention as high-conviction plays for 2025. Newer entrants like MAGACOIN FINANCE have also surfaced in analysts’ watchlist, raising questions about whether emerging tokens could find a place alongside larger-cap rivals. Why Cardano Could 2x Cardano has had its ups and downs recently, with the Midnight Network’s NIGHT token airdrop adding to short-term volatility. Still, long-term sentiment looks positive. The Cardano community just approved a $70 million development fund, which should drive more projects and use cases on the network. On top of that, Cardano is rolling out new Layer-2 solutions, like Hydra upgrades and ZK-bridges, that could improve speed and scalability by the end of the year. Some forecasts suggest ADA could move into the $5–$7 range during the next big cycle. That would be more than double where it is now. LINK, DOT, and XRP in the Spotlight Chainlink (LINK) has been gaining traction thanks to real-world adoption, including a U.S. Department of Commerce deal to provide economic data on-chain. Analysts say LINK could test $25 in late 2025, with even bigger gains possible by 2026. Polkadot (DOT) is also back on investors’ radars. With new initiatives like Polkadot Capital Group, the project is targeting institutional money. Forecasts suggest DOT could hit $8 in a bullish scenario. XRP has momentum, too. The SEC settlement gave the project regulatory clarity, and speculation about a possible ETF has fueled excitement. Analysts believe XRP could revisit $5–$8 if adoption trends hold up. Investors Spotlight MAGACOIN FINANCE as Token to Watch The trends in the crypto market highlight the direction investors and traders are moving—projects with utility, adoption, and strong ecosystems. This mix of factors explains why Cardano continues to exist as a market leader. Like Cardano, MAGACOIN FINANCE combines this mix of factors to stand out as one of the most innovative projects. Experts following the project said it mirrors the early days of Cardano before the rest of the market caught on. With MAGACOIN FINANCE’s price under a cent, the barrier of entry is very low, making it attractive for both retail and large investors. Demand is racking up, and speculations of a possible exchange listing are going around. Smart investors know the best time to accumulate a project is before it lists on exchanges. Bottom Line Cardano looks like it has real potential to 2x during the next bull cycle, supported by its upgrades and development push. But LINK, DOT, and XRP are also strong contenders for big gains in 2025. And while smaller projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE aren’t in the same tier, they show how fast-moving communities can create surprise winners in the crypto space.

51158337,573668,1756954857,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51158337.jpeg,US Bancorp Resumes Bitcoin Custody Services After Three-Year Pause – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/us-bancorp-resumes-bitcoin-custody-services/,"US Bancorp is relaunching its Bitcoin (BTC) custody services for institutional investment managers following recent regulatory developments in the US. US Bancorp Resumes Bitcoin Custody For Fund Managers On Wednesday, US Bancorp announced that it has relaunched its offering of crypto custody services after more than three years, following the removal of a Biden-era guidance that prevented financial institutions from providing these services. US Bank’s crypto custody service was originally announced in 2021 in partnership with fintech company NYDIG. However, the program was paused in early 2022 after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121), which required custodians to hold capital on the balance sheet for these activities. The rule was rescinded earlier this year, following the US President Donald Trump’s executive order for “Strengthening American Leadership In Digital Financial Technology.” Since then, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Federal Reserve have also removed the “reputational risk” examination from supervisory guidelines. Stephen Philipson, head of wealth, corporate, commercial, and institutional banking at US Bank, affirmed that “following greater regulatory clarity, we’ve expanded our offering to include bitcoin ETFs, which allows us to provide full-service solutions for managers seeking custody and administration services.” According to the announcement, the bank will now offer its Bitcoin custody services as an early access program to Global Fund Services clients, intended for institutional investment managers “with registered or private funds who seek a secure safekeeping solution for bitcoin.” “We had the playbook, and it’s sort of opening it up and executing it again,” Philipson said , adding that they will likely scale more broadly after assessing demand and marketplace development. The bank is reportedly exploring how the use cases of crypto and stablecoins may fit into its wealth, payments, and consumer banking requirements. Additionally, the financial institution will also consider offering custody services for additional cryptocurrencies if they meet the bank’s standards. Similarly, Citigroup is exploring plans to offer crypto custody and payment services. The bank is also studying custody offerings for crypto-linked exchange-traded products, which could include Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). US Regulatory Shift Continues US regulators have also announced new efforts to continue the Trump administration’s efforts to make America “the crypto capital of the world.” On Tuesday, the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued a joint statement clarifying their views on spot crypto trading in the US. According to the statement , the regulators view that SEC and CFTC-registered exchanges are not prohibited from facilitating the trading of certain spot commodity products under existing law, setting the stage for traditional financial venues to offer these products. The regulatory agencies noted that they are ready to engage with market participants, support consideration by their respective agencies, and address related questions. CFTC Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham stated that “under the prior administration, our agencies sent mixed signals about regulation and compliance in digital asset markets, but the message was clear: innovation was not welcome. That chapter is over.” Meanwhile, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins affirmed that “market participants should have the freedom to choose where they trade spot crypto assets,” adding that “the SEC is committed to working with the CFTC to ensure that our regulatory frameworks support innovation and competition in these rapidly evolving markets.”",Crypto News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Custody|bitcoin ETFs|btc|BTCUSDT|CFTC|Citigroup|crypto custody service|crypto regulation|Stablecoins|US Bancorp|US Bank|US SEC,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|REGULATION|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-04 03:00:57

ETH is now facing hurdles near $4,500 and might struggle to continue higher. Ethereum is still struggling to recover above the $4,500 zone. The price is trading above $4,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $4,385 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a decent increase if there is a close above the $4,500 level in the near term. Ethereum Price Recovers Further Ethereum price started a recovery wave after it formed a base above the $4,200 zone, like Bitcoin . ETH price was able to climb above the $4,265 and $4,320 resistance levels. The bulls were able to clear the 50% Fib retracement level of the key drop from the $4,660 swing high to the $4,209 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $4,385 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $4,420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,500 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the key drop from the $4,660 swing high to the $4,209 low. The next key resistance is near the $4,520 level. The first major resistance is near the $4,555 level. A clear move above the $4,555 resistance might send the price toward the $4,620 resistance. An upside break above the $4,620 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,660 resistance zone or even $4,720 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,500 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,400 level. The first major support sits near the $4,360 zone. A clear move below the $4,360 support might push the price toward the $4,315 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $4,260 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $4,220.

The movement was brought to light by on-chain analyst OnchainLenz, whose expertise in tracking blockchain transactions provides invaluable insights into such large-scale activities. FalconX operates as a prime broker, offering institutional-grade services for trading, credit, and clearing of digital assets. Therefore, a significant ETH withdrawal from such a platform often indicates a strategic move by a large entity or multiple entities, rather than individual retail investor activity. The fact that these are “new wallets” adds another layer of intrigue, suggesting fresh players or a new operational setup for existing ones. Why Does This Massive ETH Withdrawal Matter? Understanding the context of such a large ETH withdrawal is vital for several reasons. Firstly, movements of this magnitude can influence market sentiment, potentially leading to speculation about future price action. Secondly, they highlight the increasing involvement of institutional players in the crypto ecosystem. When large sums move, it often reflects carefully planned strategies. Here are some key aspects to consider: Market Impact: While not a direct sell-off, a large withdrawal can precede future trading activity, either buying or selling, depending on the recipient’s intent. Institutional Confidence: It could signal institutional confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value, with entities opting for self-custody or specific staking strategies. Transparency of Blockchain: The public nature of blockchain allows analysts to track these movements, providing a level of transparency unseen in traditional finance. What Could Be Behind Such a Large Ethereum Movement? While the exact reasons behind this particular ETH withdrawal remain speculative, several common scenarios could explain such a large transfer of funds. These movements are rarely arbitrary and typically serve a strategic purpose for the entities involved. Exploring these possibilities helps us understand the broader crypto landscape. Possible motivations for this significant withdrawal include: Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Large blocks of ETH might be moving to facilitate private, off-exchange transactions, often preferred by institutions to avoid market slippage. Self-Custody: Entities might be moving funds from a prime broker to their own secure, cold storage solutions for enhanced security and long-term holding. Staking Preparations: With Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake, large holders often move ETH to dedicated staking wallets to earn rewards. Portfolio Rebalancing: An institution could be rebalancing its digital asset portfolio, moving funds to different platforms or assets based on new investment strategies. New Investment Vehicles: The funds might be destined for new investment products or decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, requiring direct wallet access. It is important to remember that without direct confirmation from the parties involved, these remain educated guesses based on common industry practices. Navigating the Crypto Landscape After a Major ETH Withdrawal For individuals and institutions operating in the crypto space, understanding these large on-chain movements is becoming increasingly important. The transparency offered by blockchain technology provides a unique opportunity to gain insights into market dynamics that are often opaque in traditional financial markets. Monitoring significant events, like this recent ETH withdrawal , allows for more informed decision-making. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow reputable on-chain analysts and news sources to keep abreast of major transactions and their potential implications. Understand Context: Always seek to understand the broader context behind large movements rather than reacting solely to the headline. Risk Management: Use such insights to refine your own risk management strategies and portfolio allocations. The continuous flow of information on the blockchain empowers participants to have a clearer picture of the evolving crypto ecosystem. In conclusion, the withdrawal of $290 million in ETH from FalconX by three new wallets represents a significant on-chain event. While the precise motives are not yet clear, it underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market and the growing sophistication of institutional participation. Such large-scale movements remind us of the powerful insights gained through on-chain analysis and the continuous evolution of digital asset strategies. This massive ETH withdrawal is a testament to the ever-active and intriguing world of blockchain finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is FalconX?

Alpenglow upgrade reduces finality time, boosting network performance and attracting developer interest. Price Movement and Technical Levels Solana (SOL) was trading at $210 at the time of writing, reflecting a 4% increase in the last 24 hours and a 3% rise over the past week. The price action is moving within a tight consolidation range between $200 and $206, showing steady accumulation after recent volatility. Interestingly, the 4-hour chart indicates a bullish market structure that began forming in early August. According to BitGuru, SOL reversed from a double bottom pattern near $165 and moved upward by over 20%. A subsequent rally added another 14%, pushing the price toward the $210–213 resistance area. SOL is now making its third attempt to move beyond this level. Source: X A noticeable rise in trading volume has been recorded over recent sessions. According to data, Solana’s 24-hour trading volume stands at over $9.2 billion. Analyst Altcoin Sherpa stated, “This Solana compression is huge. Tons of volume being transacted within this range and I think that we’re going to break up soon.” The Volume Profile tool shows increased transaction activity around the $200–$206 zone, where price action is clustering. This compression pattern is often viewed as a signal of potential breakout when volume is concentrated in a narrow range. EMA Support and Short-Term Structure Solana is trading above all major exponential moving averages (EMAs) on the 4-hour chart. The 200 EMA is positioned at $200, and the 100 EMA at $197.57. These moving averages are acting as dynamic support levels. Shorter-term EMAs (20 and 55) are now converging around $201–$202, which aligns with the current trading range. $SOL This Solana compression is huge.

Traders are watching the $206.65 resistance level closely. A clean break above this range could lead to price movement toward $220 or higher. Network Upgrade and Ecosystem Development Solana has approved the Alpenglow upgrade. This update is designed to reduce transaction finality from 12.8 seconds to a near-instant speed of 100–150 milliseconds. Developers describe Alpenglow as the most extensive rewrite in the network’s history. The upgrade is aimed at improving transaction speed and reliability across the Solana blockchain.

This significant event underscores the magnified risks present in leveraged perpetual futures trading. Understanding Massive Crypto Futures Liquidations A “liquidation” in futures trading happens when a trader’s position is automatically closed by an exchange. This occurs because their margin, or collateral, is no longer sufficient to cover potential losses as the market moves strongly against their leveraged position. The recent surge in crypto futures liquidations , particularly for short positions, points to a sudden upward price movement that caught many bearish traders off guard. What Triggered These Sudden Crypto Futures Liquidations? The latest figures paint a clear picture of market pressure: Bitcoin (BTC): $35.38 million was liquidated. A significant 80.68% of these were short positions, indicating traders betting on a price decline were squeezed by an unexpected rally. Ethereum (ETH): Even more impactful, $50.66 million in ETH futures were liquidated. Short positions accounted for 69.02% of this total, signaling strong upward momentum for the second-largest cryptocurrency. Solana (SOL): SOL also saw substantial liquidations, totaling $8.76 million. Here, 59.2% were short positions, reflecting a broader market sentiment shift that surprised many. These numbers reveal a powerful short squeeze. When prices rise unexpectedly, short sellers are forced to buy back assets to cover their positions, which further fuels the price increase and cascades into more liquidations. This phenomenon often leads to rapid, sharp price movements. Navigating Volatility: Lessons from Crypto Futures Liquidations This wave of crypto futures liquidations serves as a potent reminder of the risks in leveraged trading. While futures offer potential for magnified gains, they also come with amplified losses. For traders, understanding market sentiment and employing robust risk management strategies are crucial. Key takeaways for traders include: Manage Leverage: Avoid excessively high leverage; even minor price fluctuations can lead to quick liquidations. Set Stop-Loss Orders: Automatically close positions to limit potential losses if the price moves against you. Monitor Market Sentiment: Stay informed about trends and news that could trigger sudden price shifts. The dominance of short liquidations suggests that bearish bets might have been overextended. Traders anticipating further price declines should approach the market with caution, considering the potential for unexpected pumps. In conclusion, the past 24 hours dramatically illustrated the high stakes in crypto futures trading. The $94 million in crypto futures liquidations , predominantly from short positions, underscores the unpredictable nature of the market and the critical importance of disciplined trading strategies. Staying informed and managing risk will remain paramount for all participants.

Crypto futures liquidations happen when a trader’s leveraged position is automatically closed by an exchange because their margin balance falls below the required level, typically due to significant adverse price movement. Why were short positions mostly liquidated? Short liquidations occur when the price of an asset unexpectedly rises. Traders who bet on a price decline are forced to buy back the asset at a higher price, causing a “short squeeze” that fuels further price increases and liquidations. How can traders avoid liquidation? Traders can mitigate liquidation risks by using lower leverage, setting stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin, and closely monitoring market sentiment and news. What does this event mean for the broader crypto market? While individual liquidations impact specific traders, large-scale events like this can create temporary price instability. They highlight underlying market demand or a shift in investor confidence, but are not always definitive indicators of a full market reversal.

Recently, a significant shift has been observed within these funds concerning digital assets. We’re delving into a crucial report revealing a 4% decline in Australian SMSF crypto holdings over the past year, sparking important conversations among investors and regulators alike. What’s Happening with Australian SMSF Crypto Holdings? According to data from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), as reported by Cointelegraph, the total value of cryptocurrency held by Australians in self-managed retirement funds experienced a notable dip. As of June, these holdings stood at AUD 3.02 billion (approximately $1.99 billion USD). This figure represents a decrease of roughly AUD 100 million from the AUD 3.12 billion ($2.06 billion USD) recorded in the previous year. While this might seem like a straightforward decline, it’s essential to consider the context and potential nuances behind these numbers. 4% Drop: A clear reduction in the overall value. AUD 100 Million Less: The monetary impact on these retirement portfolios. ATO Data: The official source providing transparency into these trends. Why Did Australian SMSF Crypto Holdings Decline? Several factors likely contributed to this decrease. The cryptocurrency market has experienced significant volatility over the past year, with major assets undergoing price corrections. This broader market downturn naturally impacts portfolios that hold digital assets. Moreover, the report highlights a critical detail: the comparability of data. Last year’s figures were based on tax filings through June 30, whereas this year’s data is current only as of May. This difference in reporting periods could influence the exact percentage of the decline, suggesting the actual year-on-year change might be slightly different. Key considerations include: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency prices fluctuate dramatically, affecting portfolio values. Investor Behavior: Some SMSF trustees may have de-risked their portfolios by selling crypto assets. Data Discrepancy: Varying reporting periods can skew direct year-on-year comparisons, making precise analysis challenging. Navigating the Nuances of SMSF Crypto Investments For SMSF trustees, understanding the dynamics of Australian SMSF crypto holdings is paramount. The ATO’s data provides a snapshot, but it’s crucial to remember that individual fund performance can vary widely. While a 4% aggregate drop is reported, some funds might have seen larger declines, while others might have remained stable or even grown, depending on their specific asset allocation and timing. The rise of digital assets within SMSFs reflects a growing interest in diversifying retirement portfolios. However, it also underscores the need for robust risk management strategies and a thorough understanding of the assets being held. Trustees must ensure their investment decisions align with their fund’s investment strategy and their personal risk tolerance. What Does This Mean for Your Australian SMSF Crypto Holdings? This report serves as a timely reminder for SMSF trustees to review their investment strategies, especially concerning volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. It’s not just about the potential for high returns but also about managing the inherent risks. Actionable insights for trustees: Regular Review: Periodically assess your fund’s investment strategy and asset allocation. Diversification: Avoid over-reliance on a single asset class, especially volatile ones. Professional Advice: Consult with financial advisors specializing in SMSFs and digital assets. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market trends and regulatory changes impacting cryptocurrency. The 4% drop in Australian SMSF crypto holdings is a data point, not necessarily a definitive trend for every fund. It highlights the dynamic nature of crypto investments within retirement portfolios and the ongoing need for informed, strategic decision-making. Conclusion: A Call for Prudent Management The recent 4% drop in the value of cryptocurrency held by Australian SMSF crypto holdings serves as a powerful indicator of the market’s ebb and flow. While the allure of digital assets remains strong for diversification and growth, this data underscores the importance of a cautious and well-researched approach. For SMSF trustees, continuous education, adherence to investment strategies, and seeking expert advice are not just recommendations but necessities to navigate the complex world of crypto investments and secure a stable retirement future. This period of adjustment offers a valuable lesson in balancing innovation with responsibility. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are Australian SMSF crypto holdings? Australian Self-Managed Super Funds (SMSFs) are a type of retirement fund where the members are also the trustees, responsible for managing the fund’s investments. Crypto holdings refer to the various cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) that these funds choose to invest in as part of their broader investment strategy. 2. Why did the value of Australian SMSF crypto holdings drop by 4%? The primary reason for the 4% drop is likely the general volatility and downturn experienced in the global cryptocurrency market over the past year. Broader market corrections affect all portfolios holding these assets. Additionally, differences in data reporting periods between years might slightly impact the exact percentage comparison. 3. Is investing in cryptocurrency via an SMSF risky? Yes, investing in cryptocurrency is considered high-risk due to its extreme price volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and potential for fraud or security breaches. While it offers potential for high returns, SMSF trustees must carefully assess these risks against their fund’s investment strategy and their personal risk tolerance. 4. What does the ATO data suggest for SMSF investors? The ATO data provides a snapshot of aggregate trends in Australian SMSF crypto holdings . It suggests a period of valuation decline for crypto assets within these funds. For individual SMSF investors, it’s a prompt to review their own crypto allocations, ensure compliance with superannuation laws, and re-evaluate their risk management strategies. 5. How can SMSF investors manage risks associated with crypto holdings? SMSF investors can manage crypto risks by diversifying their portfolio, only investing what they can afford to lose, conducting thorough research, adhering to their fund’s investment strategy, and seeking professional financial and legal advice. Regular monitoring of market conditions and regulatory changes is also crucial. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

Traders seemed cautiously upbeat, feeding off rising expectations that the US Federal Reserve might finally trim interest rates this month. It wasn’t just Bitcoin stretching its legs. The wider crypto market shook off the jitters too, gaining over 1.5% and edging within arm’s reach of the $4 trillion mark. Sentiment, while not exactly brimming with euphoria, was clearly in better shape than the day before. The Fear & Greed Index crept back to 55, settling into the lower end of the ‘Greed’ zone. Altcoins had a slower start. Price action remained muted through most of the session, with little excitement. But by late Asian trading hours, a quiet shift was underway, most tokens had flipped into the green, clawing back gains as bulls tried to capture the $112k support. Why is Bitcoin price going up? Bitcoin is finding its footing again, rising not just on technical strength but also on the back of growing belief that the US central bank is finally ready to pivot. As of Tuesday, traders are pricing in more than a 90% chance that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates by 25 basis points at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on September 17. That looming cut has stirred a mild risk-on mood across financial markets, nudging investors back into Bitcoin and other higher-risk assets. This has sparked a mild risk-on shift across markets, giving Bitcoin just enough lift to break out of its recent slump. Lower borrowing costs generally boost demand for risk assets, and Bitcoin, as always, is among the first to respond. Markets aren’t just betting on one cut, they’re expecting at least two rate reductions by the end of 2025. That kind of dovish outlook tends to favor speculative assets like BTC, especially in an environment where traditional yields might soon be heading lower. Eyes are now turning to a packed calendar of US economic reports this week, with Wednesday’s JOLTS Job Openings leading the lineup. That will be followed closely by the ADP private payroll data and ISM’s Services PMI on Thursday. These releases will culminate in Friday’s Nonfarm Payrolls report, a key barometer for labor market health. If the numbers come in weak, it could cement the Fed’s rate-cut narrative. That possibility alone is keeping markets primed. Traders are hungry for confirmation, but they’ve already started positioning. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a significant resurgence on Tuesday, with net inflows hitting $332.7 million, the highest in two weeks, according to CoinGlass. On the technical front, Bitcoin has broken above a stubborn two-week downtrend. Trader Rekt Capital flagged the move earlier Tuesday, noting that price was pushing through multiple levels of resistance. According to Rekt’s analysis, a daily close above that line, or even a successful retest, would confirm the breakout and likely energize bulls further.

So far, Bitcoin seems to be holding just above it. That’s giving bulls room to breathe, at least for now. What’s next for Bitcoin price? With Bitcoin holding above $112,000, traders are watching for a clean break toward $112,700, a level marked as crucial by several analysts. According to well-followed market commentator Ted Pillows, $112,700 is currently acting as a liquidity magnet, with dense clusters of short positions and sell orders stacked just above it, making it a critical battleground for bulls attempting to extend the rally. Others, like ZYN, are watching the $112.5k level, marking it as the final barrier in what he sees as a three-stage structure. BTC/USDT 8h price chart. Source: ZYN on X. In his view, Bitcoin has already cleared accumulation and is nearing the end of its “manipulation” phase. A confirmed breakout from this range, he says, would trigger the long-awaited “expansion” leg. Adding more weight to this zone is the growing pile of short positions sitting just above. Analyst Crypto Seth pointed to more than $15 billion worth of shorts stacked between $115k and $120k, noting that a squeeze could erupt if Bitcoin pushes higher.

According to Glassnode’s Binary Spending Indicator, activity from older wallets has spiked. Historically, this kind of behavior tends to surface near local tops or just before key turning points in the cycle. Some analysts, including the team at Bitcoinsensus, suggest this may be early “sell-the-news” positioning. With expectations high for a Fed rate cut, whales could be preparing to exit before the rest of the market catches on. There’s also been a noticeable decline in the average Bitcoin balance held by large wallets. Entities holding between 100 and 10,000 BTC are now sitting on around 488 BTC each, a level not seen since December 2018. That shift started in November 2024 and hasn’t reversed since. It likely signals redistribution, coins flowing from long-time holders to newer, more active market participants. According to David Bailey, CEO of Nakamoto, whale sell pressure has capped Bitcoin’s momentum, and the rally will likely resume once selling pressure subsides. When writing, Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $112,245, up 1.3% in the past 24 hours. Altcoin market Over the past 24 hours, the altcoin market cap initially dipped from $1.72 trillion to $1.69 trillion, but later rebounded to exceed $1.75 trillion, securing gains of 1.7% over the day. Ethereum (ETH), the largest altcoin in the market, rose 3% hovering over $4,460 as of press time, while other major altcoins holding the largest shares in the market, such as XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Tron (TRX), posted gains ranging between 1-4%. Among the top 100 altcoins, the leading gainers were MemeCore (M), which recorded a double-digit surge of 15%, followed by OKB (OKB) and Maple Finance (SYRUP), which gained 8.7% and 8.5% respectively. Source: CoinMarketCap MemeCore : While no immediate catalyst for MemeCore’s (M) gains today could be identified, its gains were likely supported by investor hype and speculation surrounding the project’s recent partnership with D-Pump, a web3 token launch platform. The partnership will reportedly focus on ecosystem interconnection, technical collaboration, and market expansion, key pillars that aim to empower the meme economy and promote the broader adoption of on-chain assets across both platforms. Maple Finance: SYRUP rallied today partly due to the rapid growth of SyrupUSDC, its yield-bearing stablecoin, which is close to hitting $1 billion in market cap just three months post-launch. The token’s listing on Upbit, one of the leading exchanges in South Korea, also supported its gains. OKB : OKB token’s gains were likely driven after the token gained increased visibility when the Dutch central bank slapped a large fine on the exchange for offering its services in the Netherlands without registering with local financial watchdogs. While usually adverse, these developments can still bring the token into broader discussion among market participants, with speculative trading and Bitcoin’s recovery rally likely adding to the gains.

If bears retain momentum then ADA could create a further downside to $0.60 as per analysts. Currently, traders are moving into less-known and early-stage projects as well. MAGACOIN FINANCE is a breakout token with 40x potential that has emerged as a surprise pick among the other analysts as well. Cardano Faces Bearish Pressure Toward $0.60 Cardano (ADA) last traded above the $1 mark on Aug. 14. The asset has faced quite a correction since its August high. The dip could be due to the general market bearishness. Investors may have begun booking profits after Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to an all-time high of $124,128 in August. Low ETF inflows may have also led to a market down turn. Buyers attempted to stall Cardano’s pullback at the 50-day SMA ($0.82), but the bears maintained their selling pressure. The ADA/USDT pair closed below the 50-day SMA on Sunday, starting the move toward the support line of the descending channel pattern. Buyers will try to defend the support line, but the relief rally is expected to face selling at the 20-day EMA ($0.84). If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, the likelihood of a drop to $0.68 increases. Buyers will have to propel Cardano’s price above the downtrend line to signal a comeback. The pair could then rally to $1.02. Cardano price is currently trading at $0.8337. A Breakout Token Analysts Say Could Deliver 40x Upside Analyst recommendations are increasingly pointing to MAGACOIN FINANCE, which investors have identified as a breakout altcoin. It is positioned as one of the best new altcoins to buy 2025. Unlike bigger-cap names, it provides an ROI multiplier narrative. This is attractive to traders looking to make that exponential upside which is often on offer during rotation. There’s a lot of opinion regarding prices, as MAGACOIN FINANCE has capped supply, dual audit security, and zero tax trading, which is rare in this market. Another reason is the exclusivity and early adopter status, as MAGACOIN FINANCE is still trading under $0.01, investors can position themselves ahead of the first major exchange listings. Crypto whales have confidence in MAGACOIN FINANCE as they have decided to purchase the cryptocurrency. It certainly strengthens confidence in this early-stage project to go through some early breakout cycles, as seen in Solana or Polygon. For risk-friendly traders, it is the type of early bet that has a 40x potential , which carries more weight than vaporware and is backed by tokenomics and community traction. Final Thoughts: Balancing Risk Between Blue Chips and Breakout Altcoins Cardano’s near-term outlook remains uncertain, with price predictions warning of a possible slide toward $0.60 if resistance levels hold firm. However, the broader market dynamic is not only about defensive plays but also about catching the next wave of growth. As ADA consolidates, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE demonstrate how a mix of strong fundamentals, whale backing, and early adoption can create asymmetric opportunities for investors seeking ROI-driven upside.

Following this announcement, the price of Ondo’s native token, ONDO, surged over 6% close to the $1 mark after opening the week at $0.86, aligned with the broader crypto market’s correction. Founder Calls Ondo Global Markets A ‘Breakthrough’ According to the protocol’s press release, Ondo Global Markets aims to provide one of the largest gateways for global exposure to US markets, particularly for eligible investors in the Asia-Pacific, African, and Latin American regions. The newly launched platform is now live on the Ethereum blockchain, with plans to expand to other networks, including BNB Chain, Solana (SOL), and Ondo Chain. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Descending Channel Breakout Shows Where Price Is Headed Next The new platform allows both retail and institutional investors outside the US to mint and redeem tokenized US stocks and exchange-traded funds 24/5, utilizing traditional exchange liquidity where applicable. These tokenized assets are reportedly fully backed by the underlying securities held with US-registered broker-dealers.. Investors will benefit from total economic returns equivalent to those of the underlying stocks, including price fluctuations, dividends, and corporate actions, as each token mirrors the performance of its asset. Nathan Allman, the Founder and CEO of Ondo Finance, expressed enthusiasm about the launch, stating, “Ondo Global Markets is a breakthrough in financial access.” He emphasized that the platform allows global investors to tap into the largest selection of transferable tokenized US stocks and exchange-traded funds on-chain, drawing a parallel to how stablecoins have introduced the US dollar into the digital realm. Bridging Traditional Assets And Blockchain Technology A spokesperson for Ondo Finance highlighted the similarities between tokenized stocks and USD-pegged stablecoins, noting that the former provides the same total-return exposure as their underlying assets: Tokenizing the US dollar created an entirely new level of global reach and usability for dollars. Similarly, tokenized Treasuries have exploded in adoption, growing over 7,000% since 2023, because they meet real needs: 24/7 access to US dollar-denominated assets, and the ability to hold a stablecoin with yield. Ondo was one of the first movers here and continues to lead this space, with over $1.4B in TVL across 10 chains.

The spokesperson who spoke with The Defiant believes this extensive support network allows investors to easily access and manage their tokenized equities across various on-chain applications. When writing, ONDO trades at $0.96, being one of the few tokens recording gains in all time frames. However, despite the cryptocurrency’s 60% growth year-to-date, it still trades 54% below its $2 record price.

While Bitcoin’s store of value dominance and Ethereum’s institutional adoption continue to anchor the market, analysts are turning their attention toward altcoins like Avalanche (AVAX) and Sui (SUI) — both trading under $25 despite surging adoption. Alongside these opportunities, a rising project, MAGACOIN FINANCE , is being highlighted as one of the best crypto investments 2025 , with potential to rival early-stage gains seen in high-potential altcoins . Avalanche (AVAX) Shows Strong Adoption Avalanche , a leading smart contract blockchain designed for scalability and usability, has emerged as one of the fastest-growing Layer-1 blockchain adoption plays. According to data from Nansen , AVAX transactions rose 66% in a week , surpassing 11.9 million transactions across 181,300 active addresses. This growth outpaced every other blockchain network. The surge in activity comes amid governmental adoption of Avalanche technology and renewed ETF filings , boosting confidence in the AVAX crypto forecast . Priced at $23.91 , AVAX continues to trade below the $25 threshold, cementing its status as one of the top undervalued altcoins 2025 . Investors now speculate whether Avalanche could be positioning it as an undervalued gem with significant long-term potential. SUI: Bullish Calls Signal Undervaluation Meanwhile, SUI price prediction headlines are heating up. Crypto influencer @AltcoinGordon recently suggested that SUI could eventually hit $10 , framing its current sub-$1 levels as a major accumulation opportunity. Source X Despite no disclosed technical analysis in Gordon’s call, on-chain activity supports a bullish outlook. SUI’s daily trading volume has ranged from $200 million to $500 million, while its total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols now exceeds $300 million. Technicals show support around $0.80–$1.00, resistance near $3.5, and potential for breakout alignment with Gordon’s SUI crypto forecast . Institutional investors are also showing interest in SUI’s DeFi ecosystem and its high-performance blockchain built for low-latency transactions. Trading below $25, SUI has become one of the best altcoins under $25 , drawing attention as a low market cap crypto with potential . Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Hidden Gem While AVAX and SUI grab headlines as undervalued crypto gems , the biggest upside may lie with MAGACOIN FINANCE . Analysts say that a majority of investors are now turning bullish toward MAGACOIN FINANCE as on-chain data reveals heavy accumulation. During its early-access stage, MAGACOIN FINANCE faces thousands of investors rushing in as it hovers below $1. This is creating an urgency and FOMO among investors MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a rare chance to enjoy massive returns ahead of the upcoming bull cycle. Analysts believe that MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver up to 55x returns as its transparent roadmap gives investors a strong confidence. They argue that as AVAX vs SUI comparisons dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE may quietly outperform both, as it provides early backers with a 50% extra bonus using the PATRIOT50X code. Final Thoughts Recent data highlights how the use of AVAX and SUI continues to grow at a rapid pace despite the fact that their tokens are trading below $25. Both crypto assets show patterns of undervaluation in the broader digital asset market, which is usually a sign that big price explosions are on the way. However, the coin that is least expected to explode in value, MAGACOIN FINANCE, could be the one that brings 55x returns that the investors are looking for. As the crypto market cycle unfolds, positioning early in undervalued gems like Avalanche, Sui, and MAGACOIN FINANCE could offer exponential upside — a strategy seasoned investors call the cornerstone of identifying the best crypto investments 2025 .

The Asia-Pacific (APAC) region once again stood out, cementing its role as the global hub of grassroots crypto activity. India, US, Pakistan Lead Crypto Adoption According to the report, India, Pakistan, and Vietnam emerged as the top three countries in the APAC region with widespread digital assets activities both on centralized and decentralized platforms. Interestingly, North America is not too far behind. Following Donald Trump’s victory in the November 2024 US presidential election, the American crypto ecosystem has gained renewed momentum, supported by favorable regulations and broader acceptance among banks and financial institutions. In the overall index rankings, India maintained its first-place position, topping all subcategories, including centralized value, decentralized finance (DeFi) value, and institutional value. The US climbed to second place, while Pakistan, Vietnam, and Brazil rounded out the top five. As highlighted, the APAC region remains the fastest-growing hub for on-chain digital assets activity. The APAC region recorded a 69% year-over-year (YoY) increase in value received, while total transaction volume surged from $1.4 trillion to $2.36 trillion. Much of this growth was driven by heightened activity in India, Pakistan, and Vietnam. Latin America followed closely, posting a 63% rise in adoption across both retail and institutional segments. Sub-Saharan Africa grew by 52%, primarily fueled by the region’s reliance on cryptocurrencies for remittances and everyday payments. That said, in absolute terms, North America and Europe remain dominant, receiving more than $2.2 trillion and $2.6 trillion, respectively. Overall, while adoption increased across all regions, APAC and Latin America emerged as the standout leaders. Adjusted for population, the 2025 Global Crypto Adoption Index rankings paint a different picture. When adjusted for population, the top three countries are Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia. Recent Strides In Adoption In APAC Region The APAC region’s dominance in terms of crypto adoption is hardly a surprise, as the past year saw various positive developments pertaining to digital assets in countries belonging to the region. For instance, in June 2025, Vietnam finally gave the green light to a new digital tech law that brought cryptocurrencies under formal rules for the first time. The law also requires new anti-money laundering and cybersecurity mechanisms in place to meet global norms. Similarly, Pakistan disclosed plans to create a National Crypto Council to oversee the nascent virtual assets industry in the country. This development followed the South Asian nation’s move to legalize cryptocurrencies in November 2024. India – which is leading crypto adoption despite having some of the harshest digital assets tax regulations in place – is also slowly warming up to the idea of creating a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve. At press time, BTC trades at $112,091, up 1.1% in the past 24 hours.",Crypto News|Uncategorized|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Chainalysis|crypto adoption|Cryptocurrency|Global Crypto Adoption|india|Pakistan|USA|vietnam,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BTC|REGULATION|FIAT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-04 04:00:33

In the same climate, MAGACOIN FINANCE highlights why missing early opportunities can be costly and how smart positioning often depends on recognizing utility and fundamentals. Solana Alpenglow Vote Gains Approval Solana has moved forward with its Alpenglow (SIMD-0326) proposal, with community members backing a shift toward near-instant block finality. The update introduces Votor, a system allowing validators to approve or skip blocks off-chain before submitting compact proofs on-chain. This change could shrink Solana’s block settlement from 12.8 seconds to just 150 milliseconds, a move that places the blockchain alongside traditional processors like Visa in speed. The model keeps validator costs manageable, with fees tied to each epoch and penalties for abstention or contradictory votes. By rewarding active participation and burning a portion of fees to reduce inflation, Solana aims to maintain both efficiency and economic balance. Voting runs through Epoch 842, with early results showing heavy support. Developers and validators see this as a step that could unlock new opportunities in real-time applications such as finance, gaming, and decentralized services. If fully approved, Alpenglow would mark a defining moment in how Solana structures its network, offering a balance between speed, trust, and decentralization. SHIB and RENDER Draw Investor Attention Meanwhile, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Render (RNDR) also gained traction amid Solana’s progress. SHIB continues to build its ecosystem with projects like ShibaSwap and the Shiberse metaverse, while also relying on token burns to reduce supply. RENDER, on the other hand, is expanding its role in decentralized rendering for artists and 3D creators, with adoption closely tied to the rise of NFTs and virtual content. Both tokens illustrate how market interest often shifts toward projects with visible expansion efforts. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Rising Altcoin with Growing Utility Focus As Solana’s SIMD-0326 proposal draws attention to protocol upgrades, utility-driven tokens like RENDER and MAGACOIN FINANCE are quietly emerging as smart altcoin picks. Built with transparent tokenomics and designed for long-term usability, MAGACOIN FINANCE appeals to traders and analysts seeking the next big crypto story with real traction. In a market increasingly focused on fundamentals, it stands out as a rising asset that aligns with investor demand for both innovation and structure. How Traders Can Position Themselves The approval of SIMD-0326 will show how quickly the crypto market adapts to innovation, while SHIB and RENDER underline the value of ecosystems and utility. For traders, the lesson is to avoid missing early entry into assets that build both narrative and function. MAGACOIN FINANCE fits that description, and those seeking early access can explore it directly through the official channels: Website: https://magacoinfinance.com X: https://x.com/magacoinfinance Telegram: https://t.me/magacoinfinance Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

Both are drawing large presale traction, but neither matches the pace of BlockDAG. Often described as the strongest presale of 2025, BlockDAG (BDAG) has shifted focus again with its leaderboard shake-ups. Fresh whale entries are overtaking multimillion-dollar spots, sparking urgency that smaller buyers can’t overlook. With BDAG priced at $0.0013 in Batch 30, and a 2900% return now on the table, leaderboard moves are fueling faster entries. Ahead of the BlockDAG Deployment Event, the presale moved to a flat $0.0013 coin rate, reinforcing transparency and equal opportunity to all buyers. The scene is no longer just hype; it is a competitive race. Delays could leave late buyers behind as whales set the tone and the presale edges toward its finish line. BlockDAG: $395M Raised and Batch 30 Momentum BlockDAG’s presale has turned into a contest of speed and size, with each leaderboard update showing how fierce the race has become. New whales continue to push into multimillion-dollar positions, shifting rankings and raising pressure on everyone watching from the sidelines. The action is constant, and each change highlights the scale of interest pouring into the project. For many, hesitation is already costing valuable ground, as larger buyers move quickly to secure their allocations before the current price or bonus shifts again. At this stage, BDAG remains steady at $0.0013, while the presale has brought in more than $395 million and over 25.9 billion coins sold. A potential for huge returns makes every entry far more rewarding, and whales are capitalizing on this clear upside. 3 million users are already active on the X1 miner app , showing BlockDAG’s adoption is growing well beyond the presale itself. For smaller buyers, the urgency lies in not missing out as the pace accelerates. With whales racing to secure top leaderboard slots, those waiting too long may find fewer chances to join at the most favorable terms. BlockDAG’s presale design rewards speed, making quick action just as important as the amount committed. Every leaderboard shift acts as a public reminder that the window is narrowing, and the The most attractive positions will not remain open. This blend of high ROI, miner adoption, and competitive whale activity has created a presale climate unlike any other in 2025. It explains why BlockDAG continues to be ranked the best crypto presale of the year, with buyers treating every update as a signal to enter before the final stages close. Pepeto Expands Utility Beyond Meme Status Pepeto is moving beyond simple meme hype, aiming to prove its use through tools and verified contracts. Built on Ethereum, the project has a supply of 420.69 trillion coins with presale pricing at about $0.000000149, already pulling in over $6.4 million. Security is backed by audits from SolidProof and Coinsult, while features such as PepetoSwap, a zero-fee exchange, and PepetoBridge, for smooth cross-chain transfers, show a focus on function. Staking returns between 237% and 245% APY are drawing attention, fueling fast sellouts at each presale stage. Enthusiasts are highlighting Pepeto not only for meme appeal but also for its structured model, stronger than rivals like Pepe or Little Pepe. With 30% of supply reserved for presale, another 30% set aside for staking, and clear splits for marketing, liquidity, and development, the tokenomics aim for balance. Remittix Pushes PayFi Into Global Payments Remittix is branding itself as a PayFi altcoin that directly connects crypto with real payments. Its presale has raised $21.9 million with 625 million coins sold, closing in on its $22 million milestone. A confirmed listing on BitMart will follow once the target is crossed. The system supports crypto-to-bank transfers across more than 30 nations, with over 40 cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat options available. The Beta Wallet, set for Q3 2025, will introduce real-time FX conversions, making global payments faster and more practical. Analysts place Remittix above names like XRP and Solana in terms of utility, thanks to its roadmap and its focus on usable cross-border services. Forecasts suggest possible returns between 3,500% and 8,000%. A $250,000 community giveaway has boosted visibility, and presale activity shows confidence in its long-term reach. For those looking at projects that bridge hype with working tools, Remittix is presenting a clear path to adoption instead of speculation alone. Why BlockDAG Remains the Top Crypto Presale Pepeto is turning heads with staking rewards and a working ecosystem, while Remittix is chasing PayFi growth through payments and an upcoming wallet. Both have potential, but neither can match BlockDAG’s scale. With BDAG fixed at $0.0013 and $395 million already raised in Batch 30, its momentum leaves others trailing. Leaderboard updates, with whales locking multimillion-dollar positions, are adding pressure on smaller buyers to act quickly. That urgency is fueling stronger entries, placing BlockDAG as the clear front-runner. Seen as the best presale crypto in 2025, BlockDAG is the only project where whale competition, bonus multipliers, miner adoption, and ROI combine to form a race no one wants to miss.

Featuring the Magnificent 7, BlackRock funds, and its own stock, this is an addition to the platform’s already rich derivatives portfolio. TradFi And DeFi Convergence Coinbase, one of the top 3 spot exchanges by trading volume, has announced its upcoming stock and crypto equity index, The Mag7 and Crypto Equity Index Futures, set to launch on Monday, the 22nd of this month. This financial product will be the first of its kind to offer a hybrid mix of stock exposure and crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). While several industry peers, such as Kraken, Robinhood, Bitget, and others, offer equities in the form of xStocks, no other company has yet started to provide this dual approach. Coinbase Derivatives, which already offers a diverse range of instruments for investors, including energy and metals, is set to introduce the index in just over 2 weeks. The CEO of the exchange, Brian Armstrong, celebrated the news on X, naming their trading platform “the everything exchange.” We’re launching the first US futures that give exposure to the top US tech stocks and crypto at the same time. We’ll launch more products like this as part of the everything exchange. Coming on September 22. pic.twitter.com/iTLSt7a8kx — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) September 2, 2025 Traders will have the benefit of experiencing the Magnificent Seven stocks without having to purchase them directly, along with two of BlackRock’s established ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum, all in a single futures product. Moreover, the combination of assets on the upcoming index, along with the already hefty list of instruments, will expand access and efficiency to investors, opening the doors for new trading strategies. Index Features The well-known Mag 7, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), NVIDIA (NVDA), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) will fill the stock portion. Additionally, the ETFs from the goliath BlackRock will be the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) and the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA). Lastly, the exchange’s stock (COIN) will also be available for purchase.

Source: Google Finance The index will also boast an even-weighting methodology, with each of the 10 available products representing a 10% slice of it. As prices change, the balance can fall below 10%, but there will be quarterly rebalances, which will reset the weightings. The market research firm, MarketVector, will be the official provider for the index.

The price is now facing hurdles near $2.88 and might start another decline below $2.80. XRP price is attempting to recover above the $2.80 resistance. The price is now trading above $2.80 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a short-term rising channel with support at $2.850 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it stays above the $2.8120 zone. XRP Price Faces Resistance XRP price managed to stay above the $2.720 level and started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price climbed above the $2.75 and $2.80 resistance levels. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.040 swing high to the $2.70 low. However, the price seems to be struggling to stay above the $2.880 resistance zone. Recently, there was a break below a short-term rising channel with support at $2.850 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $2.80 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If the bulls protect the $2.8120 support, the price could attempt another increase. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.880 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.9160 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.040 swing high to the $2.70 low. A clear move above the $2.9160 resistance might send the price toward the $2.960 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.00 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $3.050. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $2.880 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.8120 level. The next major support is near the $2.80 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.80 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.740.

This landmark moment is more than just a token launch—it signals the start of a new chapter in regulated and inclusive crypto finance. HTX became the first major exchange to list WLFI, with spot trading going live at 12:00 (UTC) on September 1. Three Core Pillars Redefine Crypto Finance Rather than being a simple evolution of existing crypto products, WLFI aims to bring “inclusive finance” to the forefront through three key approaches: Solving Problems in Traditional Finance : WLFI is dedicated to addressing the long-standing issue of non-transparency in traditional banking. By leveraging blockchain’s open and transparent nature, it ensures that every transaction and decision is clear and traceable. Focusing on Marginalized Communities : WLFI’s core mission is to provide users with reliable financial tools while protecting them from the risk of arbitrary account closures by banks, ensuring continuous access to financial services. By prioritizing regions with limited banking coverage and large unbanked populations, WLFI delivers a comprehensive set of practical financial solutions. Compared to traditional financial institutions, WLFI offers greater value through lower fees, higher returns, and a more user-friendly service experience. Integrating Crypto Advantages : WLFI merges the benefits of cryptocurrency with the power of self-sovereign assets. This fusion led to the introduction of USD1, a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Upon launch, USD1 quickly became the fastest-growing stablecoin in history. WLFI is developing a robust WLFI App that will offer a variety of financial services. The ultimate goal is to make crypto payments accessible to everyone, everywhere, and to bring crypto finance into the mainstream. HTX: An Incubator and Strategic Partner As a leading global crypto exchange, HTX is more than just the platform for WLFI’s initial launch; it is a full-fledged participant in the project’s development. 1. Premier Platform for Token Launches HTX was the first platform to list USD1 on May 6, 2025, and immediately launched a limited-time zero-fee event for the USD1/USDT spot trading pair to reduce trading costs and significantly boost liquidity. The subsequent listing of the WLFI token reinforced HTX’s position as the primary launchpad. 2. Innovative Mechanisms to Incentivize User Participation On August 8, HTX announced that it had become one of the launch partners for the USD1 Points Program , which incentivizes users to actively participate in the WLFI ecosystem through activities such as trading, holding, and staking USD1. This initiative has boosted USD1’s trading activity, enhanced user loyalty, and transformed participants into active contributors driving ecosystem growth. 3. Events to Boost Ecosystem and User Interests HTX is launching a variety of events to boost the popularity of WLFI, including: Futures Trading Competition: A WLFI futures trading competition running from August 27 to September 3, featuring a prize pool of 10,000 USDT. Points Incentive Program: The USD1 Points Program is fully live, allowing users to earn points through spot trading and on-chain deposits for an enhanced wealth experience. Limited-Time WLFI Earn Carnival: Starting September 1 at 13:00 (UTC), users can subscribe to the WLFI Flexible product and enjoy a 20% APY. More exclusive events will be announced to further boost user activity and engagement. 4. HTX and WLFI Strategic Partnership Drives Project Growth HTX maintains a strong strategic partnership with WLFI, serving as a key platform for its strategic rollout. From promoting USD1 to supporting WLFI’s listing, HTX has actively contributed at every stage. Leveraging its robust platform capabilities, HTX continuously provides technical expertise, market reach, and liquidity resources, strengthening WLFI’s market edge and accelerating its growth in a competitive crypto landscape. The launch of WLFI signals the emergence of a new financial model, with HTX being an important driving force to transform this experiment into reality. This partnership has the potential to bridge digital assets with traditional political and economic forces, injecting momentum into the global financial landscape and guiding crypto finance into a new era of development. About HTX Founded in 2013, HTX (formerly Huobi) has evolved from a virtual asset exchange into a comprehensive ecosystem of blockchain businesses that span digital asset trading, financial derivatives, research, investments, incubation, and other businesses. As a world-leading gateway to Web3, HTX harbors global capabilities that enable it to provide users with safe and reliable services. Adhering to the growth strategy of “Global Expansion, Thriving Ecosystem, Wealth Effect, Security & Compliance,” HTX is dedicated to providing quality services and values to virtual asset enthusiasts worldwide.

The rollout aims to give businesses across the continent access to a stable, digital dollar designed for cross-border payments, liquidity and on-chain settlement, the company said in a Wednesday press release. RLUSD, launched in late 2024 and issued by a New York trust company regulated by the state’s Department of Financial Services, has grown to over $700 million in supply on Ethereum (ETH) and the XRP Ledger (XRP), RWA.xyz data shows. The token could be used for treasury operations, remittances and as collateral for trading tokenized assets such as commodities or securities, Ripple said. Ripple’s expansion comes as stablecoins emerge as a cheaper and faster alternative to traditional payment channels, especially in emerging markets where access to reliable currencies and banking is often limited. In parts of Africa, residents already use digital dollars like USDT for savings or cross-border transfers, a report by Castle Island and Brevan Howard said. RLUSD’s entry introduces a regulated alternative aimed squarely at institutional users, a segment that faces challenges accessing stable liquidity in local currencies. In parallel, Mercy Corps Ventures is testing RLUSD in climate risk insurance initiatives in Kenya. In one trial, the stablecoin funds are released automatically when satellite data signals drought conditions. Another pilot underpins rainfall insurance, with payouts triggered by extreme weather events.

Here’s how other ETH-based tokens like Shiba Inu stack up. Shiba Inu, Uniswap, & Ethereum Are Among The Most Centralized ETH Tokens In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Santiment has talked about how the different assets in the Ethereum ecosystem line up against each other in terms of the amount of supply that’s concentrated on the top 10 wallets. Below is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in this metric for eight cryptocurrencies over the past few months. From the graph, it’s visible that 51% of the Ethereum supply is owned by the 10 largest wallets on the network. This is more than most of the other ETH-based tokens on the list. The two coins that are ahead in this metric are Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Uniswap (UNI). The latter is only marginally ahead of ETH with a value of 52.2%, but the former is significantly ahead at 62.3%. Generally, a cryptocurrency’s supply being heavily concentrated on just a few hands doesn’t tend to be a constructive signal, as it means only a few players are needed to move the market. Beyond market dynamics, supply centralization has another drawback: it potentially weakens the network security. Chains like Ethereum’s run on a consensus mechanism called the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) . Under this system, validators called stakers have to lock up a stake in order to receive a chance at adding the next block to the chain. The higher is a validator’s stake, the higher is the chance that they get picked. If a single staker crosses the 51% supply threshold, they can, in theory, gain total control over the blockchain. This type of attack doesn’t exist on Bitcoin, where the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism is employed instead. In PoW networks, miners compete against each other using computing power. Here, too, however, if a validator gains control over 51% of the network computing resources, they can mold BTC to their will. Considering that Ethereum has just 10 holders controlling 51% of the supply, an attack on the network is possible if these entities come together. The chances of it happening, though, are quite slim. Still, the fact the likes of ETH, SHIB, and UNI are notably centralized on just a few holders could be something to watch for. In contrast, some other tokens in the ecosystem like USDC (28.6%), DAI (31%), and Chainlink (31.5%) are in a healthier zone in terms of this metric. ETH Price Ethereum has seen a surge of almost 4% over the last 24 hours that has taken its price to the $4,380 mark.",Ethereum|ERC-20 tokens|ETH|Ethereum Centralization|Ethereum Supply|ETHUSDT|shib|Shiba Inu,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|SHIB|UNI|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-04 05:00:00

Average Bitcoin Whale Is Holding Just 488 BTC Now In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about the latest trend in the average supply held by Bitcoin whales. Glassnode defines “whales” as entities holding between 100 and 10,000 BTC. At the current exchange rate, the range’s lower bound converts to $11.2 million and upper one to $1.1 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin In Trouble? Exchange Reserve Spikes To Highest In Months Thus, the only investors who would qualify for the cohort would be the big-money traders. These holders can carry some degree of influence in the market, so their behavior can be worth keeping an eye on. The behavior of the cohort as usually gauged from their total holdings, however, can provide a skewed picture about the sentiment among them, as the investors toward the larger end of the range have more of a weightage in it. One way to pinpoint the behavior of the average whale is by looking at the size of the holdings of the average member of the group. Below is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in this metric for Bitcoin over the last few years. As is visible in the graph, the average Bitcoin supply per whale peaked back in early 2022, but switched to a decline as the bear market took over the sector. This suggests the whales reduced their exposure to the cryptocurrency during this period. With 2023 starting a recovery run for BTC, the average whale started loading up again, albeit at a slower pace than in the previous cycle. This accumulation continued until mid-2024, at which point it once more witnessed a reversal. Interestingly, instead of backing the rallies that have occurred between then and now, the whales have only accelerated their selling alongside them. The late 2024 run, especially, saw these humongous investors shed their holdings at a rapid pace.

In another X post, the analytics firm has also talked about how Ethereum whales have been doing recently. In particular, Glassnode has shared the trend in the holdings of the “mega whales,” holders carrying more than 10,000 ETH ($44.6 million). As displayed in the above chart, the Ethereum mega whales participated in buying during the recent price surge, but their accumulation has now stopped with the 30-day change in their balance dropping to zero. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $111,900, up more than 1% over the past day.

In a video shared alongside a recent post, the analyst stated that while many believe there are one hundred billion XRP readily available, the liquid supply is significantly lower. According to the analyst, the actual figure of XRP available for purchase on the open market is closer to a range of 1.5 to 3.5 billion tokens. This perspective emphasizes that the gap between total supply and accessible supply could potentially drive the price. THIS WILL TRIGGER A HUGE #XRP PUMP!!! pic.twitter.com/7d3gE2HLsZ — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) September 3, 2025 Impact of Spot ETFs The analyst further explained the influence that spot XRP exchange-traded funds could have if introduced. These products, offered by large financial institutions such as BlackRock and Schwab, would allow investors to gain exposure to XRP through traditional stock markets. The analyst noted that each ETF share could represent multiple units of XRP , such as five, ten, or twenty, but would still require fresh XRP purchases to back the fund. This direct demand from ETFs would create an additional layer of buying pressure on the token. Institutional and Corporate Interest In addition to ETFs, the analyst pointed to potential demand from banks, treasury firms, and companies seeking entry into the digital asset space. If hundreds of institutions pursued XRP simultaneously, the analyst suggested that the available supply could be insufficient to meet demand. According to their explanation, this scenario could lead to rapid absorption of liquidity in the order books. Price Implications The central argument put forward is that the combination of a limited accessible supply and new sources of demand from both ETFs and institutional entities could have a significant impact on XRP’s price trajectory. The analyst argued that these factors create conditions where price movements may accelerate more quickly than expected, particularly if multiple sectors compete for a limited pool of tokens. The analyst’s commentary highlights the role of supply and demand dynamics in the potential future performance of XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 By outlining the discrepancy between total supply and available liquidity, while also pointing to the possible introduction of spot ETFs and institutional adoption, the perspective presented centers on the idea that the market may not have accounted for how quickly demand could outpace supply. According to the analyst, these conditions could contribute to a sharp increase in XRP’s value if such developments occur.

The firm is a Bitcoin accumulation platform focused on building America’s Bitcoin infrastructure backbone, according to the announcement. Shares in the Trump-backed Bitcoin venture surged as much as 100% before retreating on its market debut, with the President’s son Eric, saying he hoped to create “the greatest Bitcoin company on Earth.” It’s great to be back! @AmericanBTC @worldlibertyfi https://t.co/YUMsEUA2F6 — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) September 3, 2025 We’re Going to Win The Race In an interview with Bloomberg following the Nasdaq debut, Eric Trump said that American Bitcoin is different from other corporate treasuries such as Michael Saylor’s Strategy because “we have a great mining business,” and an “unbelievable advantage.” “We’re mining Bitcoin at roughly 50 cents on the dollar to the actual price of Bitcoin. We’re mining a lot of it and using the Hut 8 infrastructure in order to do so.” Eric Trump is the co-founder and chief strategy officer of American Bitcoin, a majority-owned subsidiary of mining firm Hut 8 . “We have massive aspirations to be the absolute best crypto company anywhere on Earth,” he said before adding that the firm will implement both strategies, purchasing BTC and mining Bitcoin to dollar cost average down. “Everybody all around the world wants the asset, from the largest Fortune 500 companies to the biggest sovereign wealth funds to nation states to US states, [such as] Texas.” Bitcoin is an unbelievable store of value, and “we’re going to win the race,” he said. When asked about his personal wealth, which Bloomberg estimated as $600 million from his 7.5% stake in American Bitcoin, Eric said he got into the industry because of the financial revolution and being debanked while his father was running for president. “I believe in Bitcoin, I’ve been a long-term owner of Bitcoin … and I see its adoption all over the world and how much it is being embraced globally, and the floodgates are just starting to open.” Trump Family Scooping Up More BTC American Bitcoin held 2,443 BTC as of the end of May, according to BitcoinTreasuries, but that number is likely to be higher. Mining firm and AMBC partner Hut 8 is the twelfth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder with 10,667 BTC worth around $1.2 billion. Meanwhile, Trump Media and Technology Group Corp holds 15,000 BTC worth $1.67 billion according to BitcoinTreasuries. American Bitcoin also said on Wednesday that it had entered into a $2.1 billion stock offering with investment banks including Cantor Fitzgerald and Mizuho Securities, with proceeds used for BTC purchases and mining technology.

Trading volumes spiked to 416.41M tokens during resistance testing at $0.223, far above the 24h average of 244.87M. Prediction markets (Polymarket) show ETF approval odds rising from 51% to 71% , drawing institutional positioning. Analysts split: some warn of a triangle breakdown toward $0.17 Fibonacci support, while others forecast potential upside toward $1.00–$1.40 based on historical pattern repeats. Price Action Summary DOGE traded within a $0.009 range (4.17% volatility) between $0.214 and $0.223. Midday rally (13:00–15:00) lifted price from $0.215 to $0.219 on volume spikes >400M. Evening session rejection at $0.223 triggered profit-taking and heavy volume flows. Final hour (01:31–02:30) saw DOGE fade 0.5% from $0.219 to $0.218, with volume accelerating to 16.1M in the last minute. Session low printed at $0.2178 as $0.218 support gave way under late selling pressure. Technical Analysis Support: $0.214 confirmed by repeated institutional bids in overnight trading. Resistance: $0.223 established on high-volume rejection. Momentum: Lower highs forming; expanding volume on declines signals distribution. Patterns: Possible triangle setup under $0.22; breakdown would target $0.17 Fibonacci support. Volume: Institutional-level surges above 400M confirmed corporate desk participation. What Traders Are Watching Whether $0.218 support holds or if breakdown opens path to $0.214 → $0.17.

Analyst EGRAG Crypto said this while discussing XRP's current price position and its future outlook. For context, after dropping from the $3.66 peak in July to a floor price of $2.69 on Sept. 1, XRP appears to have entered a recovery phase, having gained 5.57% since the recent floor.Does XRP Have More Room for Growth?Meanwhile, discussions around XRP's top price for this bull run have gained steam. While some believe there is no more room for growth beyond the $3.66 high, others insist there is, but suggest the potential push beyond $3.66 may likely not be by a large margin.For instance, market watcher Crypto Rover predicted late last month that while Ethereum (ETH) could reach a peak of $9,500 in the next four months, XRP may only see a top price of $4.8 within this period. This represented a mild 57% increase from its price at the time.However, EGRAG disputed claims that XRP may top out at $4, projecting much higher targets. In his latest analysis, he still dismissed these claims but included an important nuance for a better market outlook. According to EGRAG's recent disclosure, if XRP is incapable of reaching his lofty $22 target, then it has already topped at $3.66, and there's no in-between. He presented a chart detailing XRP's historical price movements as a guide to his forecast.While he placed the chart and broader analysis behind a paywall, exclusively for subscribers, the analyst provides a sneak peek for onlookers. Specifically, his chart features two curves at the top and bottom. The top curve has marked XRP's peak for each cycle, while the bottom one has marked its bottom.If XRP Has Not Topped, Then Its Peak Lies Around $22For instance, in Cycle 1, when XRP hit the top curve at a price of $0.0614 in December 2013, this marked the top of that cycle. Meanwhile, in Cycle 2, XRP retested the top curve at a price of $3.31 in January 2018 . Expectedly, this represented the top for that cycle.However, in this cycle, despite XRP reaching a new peak of $3.66 in July, its price action is still far below the top curve. This essentially suggests that XRP might still have more room for growth before reaching its top for this cycle. XRP Chart | EGRAG Crypto Notably, EGRAG shows that the top curve aligns with an XRP price of around $22, which represents a 674% increase from the current price of $2.84. The market analyst believes that if XRP still has more upside potential, then the next uptrend would take prices to this level.However, EGRAG suggests the other possibility is that XRP would not observe another upward push, but maintain $3.66 as its peak, the same way it missed the top curve during the 2021 run. Nonetheless, multiple analyses do not agree with this. For instance, Batman recently predicted an imminent push higher after XRP swept liquidity and found support around $2.7.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong recently revealed a drastic measure: he fired employees who did not comply with a directive to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) tools into their daily work. This bold move underscores a pivotal shift in how leading tech companies, especially in the fast-paced crypto sector, view productivity and innovation. At the heart of this decision lies Coinbase’s stringent Coinbase AI policy , designed to push the boundaries of efficiency and skill within the organization. What’s Driving Coinbase’s Bold Coinbase AI Policy? Armstrong’s rationale is clear: AI proficiency is no longer optional; it is a fundamental skill for modern professionals. He views AI as a transformative force, capable of dramatically enhancing productivity and problem-solving. For Coinbase, staying at the forefront of the competitive crypto industry means leveraging every available technological advantage. This proactive stance is a core component of the company’s forward-looking Coinbase AI policy . The CEO believes that those who fail to embrace these tools risk falling behind, not just individually but also hindering the company’s overall progress. This isn’t merely about using new software; it’s about fostering a culture of continuous learning and adaptation. The Mandate: A Week of AI Immersion The directive wasn’t a sudden, unannounced purge. Armstrong outlined a clear expectation: developers were given one week to actively use AI tools in their tasks. This period served as an experimental phase, allowing employees to explore AI’s capabilities and integrate them into their workflows. The goal was to identify and adopt practical applications, not just for the sake of it, but to genuinely improve output. Following this week, those who hadn’t demonstrated compliance without a valid, documented reason faced termination. This firm approach highlights the seriousness with which Coinbase views its commitment to technological advancement and its Coinbase AI policy . The Unforeseen Consequences: Firings and the Future of Work While the decision to fire employees might seem harsh, it sends a powerful message across the tech landscape. It signals that companies are increasingly willing to enforce AI adoption as a core competency. This shift raises important questions about the future of work, skill development, and employee adaptability. Benefits of AI Adoption: Enhanced Productivity: AI tools can automate repetitive tasks, freeing up employees for more complex, creative work. Improved Decision-Making: AI can analyze vast datasets quickly, providing insights that inform better strategic choices. Innovation Catalyst: By streamlining processes, AI allows teams to focus on developing new products and services, crucial for a company like Coinbase. Cost Efficiency: Automation can lead to significant operational cost reductions over time. However, the rapid push also presents challenges. Employees need adequate training and support to effectively integrate AI into their roles. Resistance can stem from a lack of understanding, fear of job displacement, or simply the effort required to learn new systems. Understanding and addressing these concerns is vital for any successful Coinbase AI policy implementation. Embracing AI: A Crucial Skill in the Crypto Landscape The cryptocurrency industry is inherently fast-paced and technologically driven. From developing new blockchain protocols to managing vast amounts of transaction data, AI has a growing role to play. For a platform like Coinbase, AI can enhance security protocols, improve customer service through intelligent chatbots, optimize trading algorithms, and even detect fraudulent activities more effectively. Therefore, employees who master AI tools become invaluable assets. Their ability to leverage these technologies can directly contribute to Coinbase’s competitive edge and its mission to build the future of finance. This makes the Coinbase AI policy not just about internal efficiency, but about maintaining market leadership. Actionable Insights for Your Own AI Journey Whether you’re an individual professional or a business leader, Coinbase’s actions offer valuable lessons: Prioritize Learning: Invest time in understanding and experimenting with AI tools relevant to your field. Online courses, workshops, and hands-on projects are excellent starting points. Foster an AI-Friendly Culture: For leaders, create an environment that encourages experimentation with AI, provides necessary training, and addresses concerns transparently. Start Small, Scale Up: Begin with simple AI applications to solve specific problems before attempting large-scale integrations. Evaluate Impact: Continuously assess how AI tools are improving productivity and efficiency. Adjust your strategy based on tangible results. The message is clear: proactive engagement with AI is no longer a luxury but a strategic imperative. This applies across all industries, especially in technology and finance. Coinbase’s decision to enforce its Coinbase AI policy with such rigor marks a significant moment in the intersection of technology and corporate culture. Brian Armstrong’s unwavering belief in AI’s transformative power has led to tough choices, but it also highlights a future where AI proficiency is a baseline expectation. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, companies and individuals alike must adapt swiftly, viewing AI not as a threat, but as a powerful ally in achieving unprecedented levels of productivity and innovation.

While ETH is observed to bottom out at $4,250, analysts caution that a definite break above $4,415 is needed to rekindle bullish pressure. This indecisiveness has forced investors to turn to newer contenders with higher upside potential. Remittix (RTX) , a PayFi project revolutionizing cross-border payments, is capturing that spotlight, with forecasts suggesting a jump from $0.1030 to $4, a staggering 40x return by January. Ethereum Price Struggles At Key Levels The Ethereum price is at $4,301 after dipping below the $4,400 level. ETH fell to the $4,220 support and bounced higher, regaining $4,250 and $4,300, but lost momentum around $4,355 resistance. Market participants closely watch the $4,380–$4,415 zone, where a bearish trend line still keeps the upside space capped. Despite efforts at recovery, Ethereum’s price is still below its 100-hourly SMA, reflecting a poor short-term setup. The RSI is close to 50, indicating a neutral but defensive environment. Analysts anticipate that Ethereum may be setting up a classic bear trap, appearing weak at the moment before maybe retreating in October. However, until ETH breaks above $4,415 with conviction, most forecasts remain cautious. This uncertainty has pushed many investors to explore alternative assets with clearer upside. Among those, Remittix (RTX) is emerging as the standout, with some analysts predicting a move from $0.10 to $4, a potential 40x surge by January. Remittix Gains Momentum As PayFi Leader While Ethereum’s trajectory depends on reclaiming resistance levels, Remittix is winning investor attention with a utility-first narrative. Positioned in the PayFi sector, RTX is building infrastructure for direct crypto-to-bank payments across 30+ countries. Unlike speculative plays, it focuses on practical features like flat fees, real-time FX conversions, and a Pay API that caters to freelancers, merchants and businesses. Remittix has already secured over $23,6 million in funding, distributed more than 643 million tokens, and trades at just $0.1030. Listings on BitMart and LBANK strengthen its liquidity profile, while the upcoming Q3 2025 wallet beta will support 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies, cementing its role as a real-world payment solution. Why Analysts See 40x Potential In RTX $23,6 million+ raised and 643 million+ tokens sold Confirmed BitMart and LBANK listings Wallet beta arriving in Q3 2025 with broad crypto/fiat support Flat fees and instant FX quotes for international transfers Merchant-ready Pay API to drive global adoption Final Takeaway Ethereum price is stuck between support at $4,220 and resistance at $4,415. Until ETH confirms direction, upside potential appears limited. By contrast, Remittix is already advancing through funding milestones, exchange listings and product rollouts that point toward exponential adoption. Analysts believe RTX’s path from $0.1030 to $4 is more than just speculation, it’s a reflection of its payments-first model, which could make it one of the fastest-growing altcoins in 2025.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, a significant Bitcoin price drop has occurred, pushing its value below the crucial $111,000 mark. This sudden movement has caught the attention of investors and analysts alike, sparking discussions about what lies ahead for the market. What Triggered This Bitcoin Price Drop? Bitcoin’s journey has always been characterized by volatility, and its latest dip is a testament to this inherent nature. Currently, the Bitcoin price drop sees BTC trading at $110,959.76 on the Binance USDT market. Such movements are rarely isolated incidents; they often stem from a confluence of factors influencing market sentiment and trading activity. Understanding these potential catalysts is key to making informed decisions in the fast-paced crypto landscape. Macroeconomic Pressures: Global economic indicators, interest rate changes, or geopolitical events can significantly impact investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. When traditional markets show signs of instability, crypto often feels the ripple effect. Regulatory News: Announcements or rumors regarding new cryptocurrency regulations from major economies can induce market uncertainty, leading to sell-offs. Whale Activity: Large transactions by significant holders (known as ‘whales’) can move the market. A sudden large sell-off by a whale can trigger a cascading effect. Technical Indicators: Breaking key support levels on price charts can trigger automated selling orders and psychological fear among traders. How Are Investors Reacting to the BTC Price Fall? A substantial Bitcoin price drop often elicits varied responses from the investor community. For some, it’s a moment of concern, prompting them to reassess their portfolios. Others, however, view these dips as strategic opportunities, adhering to the “buy the dip” philosophy. This divergence in sentiment creates a dynamic market environment where both caution and opportunity coexist. Panic Selling: Newer or less experienced investors might react emotionally, selling their holdings to cut losses, which can exacerbate the downward trend. Strategic Accumulation: Experienced traders and long-term holders often see a Bitcoin price drop as a chance to accumulate more BTC at a lower cost, confident in its long-term potential. Increased Volatility: Price drops frequently lead to heightened volatility, with rapid price swings in both directions as buyers and sellers battle for control.

The post highlighted that the Credentials amendment, introduced in version 2.3.0 of the software, is set to become active within 15 hours. The amendment, identified by its amendment ID, has reached a consensus of over 82 percent, with 29 validators in favor and 6 against, crossing the required threshold of 28 out of 35 votes. In 15 hours the Credentials amendment on the XRP Ledger will be active. Credentials can be applied to attest a compliance requirement like KYC and AML for a user/institution and issued to their Decentralized Identity. All natively on the XRP Ledger. That's today's Alpha. pic.twitter.com/6RbKVpq9Pd — Vet (@Vet_X0) September 3, 2025 Purpose of the Credentials Amendment The amendment introduces functionality that allows credentials to be applied directly on the XRP Ledger. These credentials can be linked to compliance requirements such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) standards. Through this feature, institutions and users can receive credentials that attest to their compliance status. These credentials can then be issued to their decentralized identity. This process will operate natively within the XRP Ledger, removing the need for external verification mechanisms and offering a streamlined compliance layer. Significance for Institutional Adoption One social media user, identified as RISKTAKE, commented that the amendment is a significant step toward institutional adoption and trust. This perspective highlights the potential for financial institutions and regulated entities to integrate more easily with the XRP Ledger once compliance-focused infrastructure is embedded into its core protocol. By enabling on-chain compliance attestation, institutions can more easily meet regulatory requirements when interacting with decentralized finance ecosystems. Simplifying Trust Signals Another user, known as Foggy, explained the amendment’s impact by stating that it is similar to having a “you can trust me” marker. In this sense, entities using the ledger could display their verified compliance credentials in a manner that signals trustworthiness to counterparties. While the comparison is simplified, it reflects the broader aim of the amendment, which is to enhance verifiable trust in interactions that occur on the XRP Ledger . Status and Consensus The amendment summary indicates that while the Credentials amendment has not yet been enabled, it is well on its way to activation, given the achieved consensus level. The process requires 28 affirmative votes out of 35, a threshold that has been reached with 29 votes in favor. With activation expected within the next 15 hours, the Credentials amendment will soon become part of the XRP Ledger’s core functionality. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Credentials amendment represents a technical step toward integrating compliance into the XRP Ledger’s operations. By making KYC and AML attestations natively verifiable on-chain, it introduces infrastructure that may support broader institutional participation. With validator consensus secured and activation imminent, this amendment marks a significant update in the XRP Ledger’s ongoing development.

The SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple in 2020, alleging that the company sold XRP tokens as unregistered securities. In July 2023, in the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Ripple, Judge Analisa Torres determined that XRP is not inherently a security, and the case was fully resolved in August of this year. Deaton explained on X that, despite more than 2,000 exhibits being submitted, Judge Torres cited just a few dozen, including the XRP Holder Affidavits, his amicus brief, and oral arguments from the LBRY case. He remarked , “No credible person can argue that the XRP Army didn’t make a difference in the Ripple case. If they do, they’re either ignorant of the facts and truth or intentionally lying.” Deaton is recognized for championing the rights of crypto investors, particularly XRP holders, whom he contended were underrepresented in the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple. Deaton argues that even one person can change a situation’s outcome Deaton noted that the court’s acknowledgment of XRP holder affidavits and his brief validated the role of community voices in the legal process. He stated that without those citations, some might have questioned whether their efforts had any real impact. Still, the ruling itself proved otherwise, showing that the XRP Army’s activism genuinely influenced the court’s reasoning . His observations point to the growing belief that collective action can meaningfully impact the course of major crypto litigation. The lawyer even affirmed, “Often, people say one person can’t make a difference. I say: one person can inspire many people and together, they can make a difference.” Some X community members agreed with Deaton that the XRP Army helped influence the judge’s decision. One user noted that there’s real influence when a large group engages through open forums. Another insisted that the XRP Army had left its mark on history, with the courtroom resounding with the power of a united community. And with the US Appeals Court approving a joint move to dismiss appeals last month, the Ripple-SEC case is effectively closed. Ripple’s McCrimmon explained that the firm is working to enhance payments and transactions On the What’s at Stake podcast, Ripple’s Vice President and Deputy General Counsel Deborah McCrimmon also shared insights into the company’s mission and its battle with the SEC. McCrimmon explained that Ripple is working toward an “internet of value,” seeking to make moving money globally easy and inexpensive. The XRP Ledger enables those near-instant, low-cost payments. She also said that the SEC case against Ripple became a collaborative effort, with the XRP community helping surface key SEC materials that strengthened Ripple’s fair notice case. Moreover, Deaton noted that retail investors’ consistent advocacy played a crucial role in helping Ripple weather the lawsuit, a factor many believe positions XRP to surpass Ethereum’s performance. Long before the lawsuit, many in the crypto world dismissed XRP and used “XRP Army” as a jab at its most loyal holders. However, the SEC case turned that label into a badge of honor, rallying the community together. XRPs price spiked 72% after Judge Torres issued a mixed ruling, determining that the token sold on public exchanges was not inherently a security back in 2023, rising from $0.47 to $0.81, according to CoinGecko. Today, Ripple continues to grow the real-world utility of its token, deploying solutions for lightning-fast cross-border payments and greater access to financial services. Ahead of the SEC and Ripple dropping their appeals, effectively winding down the court case, the token surged in trading once more on speculation and reached a high of $3.35 before retreating. At press time, XRP is exchanging hands at $2.85 a token, and is down about 4% in the past 24 hours after reaching a new all-time high of $3.65 back in July If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

51163785,https://square.htx.com/?p=45955,1756963548,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/100/default.png,"HTX Research丨H1 2025 Key Industry Highlights: DAT Becomes the Standard, Perpetual DEX Aggregators Surge, Stablecoin Channels Dominate, and More.",https://square.htx.com/htx-research%e4%b8%a8h1-2025-key-industry-highlights-dat-becomes-the-standard-perpetual-dex-aggregators-surge-stablecoin-channels-dominate-and-more/,"Summary Panama City, 3 September, 2025 – In the first half of 2025, the crypto industry presented a flourishing scene of multi-point prosperity. Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) has shifted from a trend to a consensus, becoming a “standard” strategy for projects and companies. Whether it is BitMine continuously raising funds to purchase tokens and becoming the world’s largest Ethereum treasury, or MicroStrategy adjusting its financing structure to focus on issuing preferred shares to expand its Bitcoin holdings, both reflect that the model of continuously accumulating crypto assets through the capital market flywheel is gaining favor and validation. At the same time, veteran projects in the Ethereum ecosystem are rejuvenating , regaining growth under a warming regulatory environment and technological iteration— the U.S. SEC’s attitude shift clarified the compliance prospects for Uniswap, MakerDAO’s reorganization into Spark and issuance of the new token SPK drove a sharp increase in TVL, and Maple’s integration of Syrup and adoption of Pendle to enable yield trading innovation all prove that “old trees” can indeed bloom with new flowers. In the DeFi field, the perpetual contract trading track has risen as one of the biggest highlights: high-performance on-chain exchanges such as Hyperliquid saw revenues surge this year, with trading depth comparable to centralized exchanges, and trading volume and fees ranking among the industry’s top. More importantly, perpetual aggregators such as Hypersolid and Range aggregate liquidity from multiple DEXs into one interface, lowering user thresholds and offering better prices. Together with Hyperliquid’s launch of Builder Codes and the HIP-3 mechanism for an open market, developers can easily introduce contracts for new underlying assets. These innovations signal that this track contains exceptional primary market opportunities. The stablecoin payment war heated up rapidly during this period, with major dedicated chains competing around the concept of “channels as king”: Stripe’s Tempo focuses on merchant network integration, Tether’s Plasma promotes zero-fee transfers and Bitcoin-level security, and Circle’s Arc positions itself as open financial-grade infrastructure, while Tron, leveraging its control over more than half of the world’s circulating USDT, its low-fee and efficient network, and strong partnerships with exchanges and cross-border channels, continues to sit firmly on the throne, demonstrating that beyond technology, “network effects + user experience” are the true keys to victory for stablecoin settlement networks. On the macro front , as expectations strengthen for the Federal Reserve to shift from tightening to easing, with inflation falling and potential rate cuts signaled, large amounts of cash parked in money market funds are likely to flow back into risk asset markets. We have already seen Bitcoin dominance retreat from its May peak, with funds accelerating into Ethereum and other sectors with substantial yields and new narratives. Overall, this round of the market emphasizes value and structural opportunities rather than broad bubbles: from the stock-coin resonance brought by the DAT model, to technological upgrades and compliance dividends for veteran projects, and to the leap in derivatives and stablecoin infrastructure, all provide the market with resilience beyond previous cycles. At the same time, caution is required— only projects with solid fundamentals and sustainable models can endure cycles, enjoying macro tailwinds while withstanding volatility risks potentially triggered by over-financialization. 1.From Trend to Consensus: Digital Asset Treasury Companies (DAT) Have Become Blue-Chip Standard 1.1 What is DAT? The story begins with MicroStrategy: in 2020, MicroStrategy bought Bitcoin into its corporate treasury, effectively turning “publicly listed company stock” into a way of investing in Bitcoin. This was the first true DAT. The Ethereum version of DAT is on the rise: by 2024–2025, with spot BTC/ETH ETFs approved and accounting standards improved (allowing crypto assets to be measured at fair value), more companies began openly making large-scale crypto purchases. The case of BitMine: in August 2025, BitMine announced ETH holdings exceeding 1.15 million tokens, worth nearly $5 billion , becoming the world’s largest ETH treasury. To keep buying, it raised the ceiling on the amount of funds it could raise through stock issuance to $24.5 billion . This was essentially telling the market: “We will keep using stock issuance proceeds to buy more ETH.” In other words, the essence of DAT is a “coin-buying machine,” continuously increasing crypto holdings through the financing power of the stock market. 1.2 Investment Logic of DAT When analyzing Digital Asset Treasury (DAT), the core lies in understanding its valuation framework and key indicators. Net Asset Value (NAV) is the most important benchmark, representing the amount and value of token holdings per share, serving as the foundation of all valuation judgments. The relationship between stock price and NAV reflects the rationality of the market’s pricing of this model: if the stock price is close to NAV, the premium level is limited; if the stock price is significantly higher than NAV, it indicates substantial sentiment or expectation components. mNAV (Market-to-NAV Ratio) is calculated by dividing the stock price by NAV, directly measuring the premium level given by the market. When mNAV The number of tokens per share , i.e., the actual number of tokens corresponding to each share, directly reflects whether the company can continuously enhance NAV through financing activities. If the number of tokens per share continues to rise, it indicates that financing and token-swapping processes are smooth and the flywheel logic is sustainable; if stagnant or declining, it suggests that this model may face structural problems. Leverage level (Debt/NAV) also needs to be included in risk assessment. While high leverage can accelerate NAV growth, it also amplifies risk exposure amid market volatility. The valuation logic of DAT stock can be simplified as: Stock Price ≈ Number of Tokens per Share × Token Price × Premium Multiple (mNAV). The essential difference between DAT and spot or ETF investment lies in its ability to obtain two types of returns simultaneously: first, asset appreciation from the underlying token price increase; second, NAV growth from increasing the “number of tokens per share” through stock issuance financing and token conversion. The operation of the DAT logic is manifested as: stock price rises → stock issuance → purchase more tokens → tokens per share increase → NAV rises → stock price rises further. This mechanism relies on the two-way linkage between the capital market and the token market, theoretically giving DAT higher elasticity than spot or ETFs. Taking BitMine as an example, its data clearly demonstrates the valuation logic of DAT. At the end of June 2025, its NAV/share was about $4, with a stock price of $4.27, close to 1× NAV. By the end of July, NAV/share had increased to $30, and the stock price had risen to $51, corresponding to 1.7× NAV. A decomposition of the increase shows that about 60% came from the increase in ETH holdings per share (achieved through issuance and token conversion), 20% came from ETH’s own price increase, and another 20% from the rise in market premium levels. This case illustrates that DAT’s stock price growth is not only driven by the underlying token price, but also depends on whether financing strategies can effectively convert into NAV growth, and whether the market recognizes this model. In summary, the value of DAT lies in its ability to leverage capital market financing capacity into continuous growth of token holdings, thereby forming valuation elasticity higher than spot or ETFs. But its sustainability depends on market confidence in the flywheel logic. Once the market premium declines, issuance fails to effectively enhance tokens per share, or the macro environment reverses, DAT stock adjustments may exceed that of the tokens themselves. Therefore, a reasonable investment strategy should be to position around mNAV = 1, ensuring premium levels are controllable, while continuously monitoring the trends of mNAV and tokens per share. Only when these conditions are met does DAT have long-term investment value. https://blockworks.co/analytics/treasury-companies It is worth noting that Ark Invest also explicitly emphasized the unique value of DAT compared to ETFs when evaluating BitMine . Ark pointed out that this was actually their first time being able to obtain stable exposure to Ethereum within the ETF system. Directly buying other funds or ETFs faces many problems, such as tax compliance (the “bad income” rule stipulates that if certain gross profits exceed 10% of a fund’s annual profit, it may lose tax benefits or even be forced to close) and risks of overlapping fees, making it difficult to be a viable path. BitMine, however, provided a feasible solution. Although BitMine stock has some premium, the utility of its Ethereum Treasury is significantly higher than that of a Bitcoin Treasury, because ETH can be staked, while current ETFs still cannot achieve ETH staking. This difference means that DAT not only provides exposure to asset prices, but can also capture additional on-chain yield sources, further enhancing its relative competitiveness. 1.2.1 SharpLink and BitMine: The Power Shift in Ethereum Corporate Holdings The Ethereum corporate holding landscape was originally dominated by SharpLink, but in just 35 days from July to August 2025, BitMine quickly overtook it through continuous financing and large-scale accumulation, becoming the world’s largest ETH treasury company. This is not only a reversal in holding scale, but also a showdown between OG capital and Wall Street capital lineages. 1.2.1.1 SharpLink: The Slow Accumulation of the Native Community SharpLink’s shareholder lineup covers the core capital of the Ethereum ecosystem. Consensys founder Joseph Lubin serves as chairman of the board; Pantera, Arrington, Galaxy Digital, and others participate, forming a mix of OG camp, infrastructure camp, and financialization camp. The company emphasizes long-term token holding, on-chain security, and transparent management. Most of its ETH holdings come from transfers within team wallets or small batch purchases, with build-up costs concentrated in the $1,500–$1,800 range, and some early costs even below $1,000. This “native” path brings three characteristics: Strong hoarding mentality : prone to selling pressure when prices rise sharply. Closed-loop information flow : focused on on-chain operations and audit disclosure, more cautious in capital market narrative tactics. Slow disclosure cycle : relies on quarterly reports, lacking rhythmical market communication. For example, the S-ASR document submitted in June 2025 allowed it to sell stock at any time, causing market concerns about selling pressure. Due to these characteristics, when BitMine launched a rhythmical disclosure offensive, SharpLink’s response appeared half a beat slower, causing market attention and capital to lean toward the faster-paced competitor. 1.2.1.2 BitMine: A Structural Blitz with Wall Street Strategy BitMine was previously a small Nasdaq-listed company without a crypto label. But starting in July 2025, it rapidly expanded its ETH treasury through a typical Wall Street path: PIPE financing + warrant structure : cooperating with Galaxy Digital, ARK Invest, Founders Fund, etc., first obtaining funds and warrants through PIPE financing, then gradually issuing more stock, using new funds to purchase large amounts of ETH. Rhythmical disclosure : almost every 7 days releasing rhythmical announcements, disclosing new holding scales in each announcement, creating a market expectation cycle of “buy → disclose → price rises → buy again.” Narrative marketing : BitMine positioned itself as the “leading Ethereum corporate treasury,” with each holding update not only pushing up its own stock price, but also increasing ETH spot trading volume and price. In just 35 days, BitMine’s holdings grew from 0 to 830,000 ETH, its stock price rose from $4 to $41, and its total market capitalization exceeded $3 billion, achieving a complete overtake of SharpLink. More importantly, it changed the market’s perception of ETH corporate holdings—from “slowly hoarding tokens while waiting for appreciation” to “structural financing driving price increases.” 1.2.1.3 The Narrative King’s Opinion Shield In this Ethereum treasury competition, the role of opinion leaders was equally important. Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, is one of the most influential bridges between U.S. equities and the crypto market. His influence lies not in accurate predictions, but in his skill at creating narratives: Self-built indicators to boost sentiment : his Bitcoin Misery Index (BMI), which quantifies market sentiment using volatility, trading volume, and other data, calls for “buying the dip” at low values and emphasizes “structural bull market arrival” at high values. Regardless of market trends, he always finds positive interpretations. High-frequency appearances across platforms : a regular guest on CNBC’s Fast Money , Bloomberg commentator, and daily updates on his own Twitter and YouTube, spreading views through short videos and charts to attract retail and institutional attention. Creating belief : he doesn’t just call for rises, but attaches “macro narratives.” For example, he claimed ETH would become part of corporate balance sheets, providing narrative protection for structural plays like BitMine; similarly, he repeatedly emphasized halving cycles and institutional allocation importance, thereby guiding the market to view price increases as inevitable. Thus, during BitMine’s build-up period, Tom Lee’s rhetoric provided the market with strong backing: when ETH prices rose, he emphasized institutional buying; when prices adjusted, he emphasized buying opportunities. Whether up or down, he always redirected attention to “structure and long-term value.” 1.2.2 Future Market Path for BTC Treasury Companies in the Next 6–12 Months If DAT prices experience sustained decline, their financing flywheel may reverse, forming an “ mNAV death spiral .” In short, the premium (mNAV) between the company’s market value and its NAV acts as an “umbilical cord”: when the price of assets (BTC/ETH) drops, NAV shrinks, and the company’s stock price also falls; if the stock price falls close to or below NAV, the company loses the ability to issue new shares at a high premium; if debt or preferred shares require repayment, the company may be forced to sell assets to repurchase stock or service debt. Such selling behavior in turn suppresses market prices, accelerating NAV decline and triggering more forced selling by companies. Only those able to maintain strong mNAV and continuously increase BTC per share holdings are likely to survive. How DAT Prices Decline Could Trigger Death Spiral 1.2.3 Who Can Survive the Cycle? Different Tiers of DAT Companies Strategy (MicroStrategy) has long financed through issuing common shares, multiple types of preferred stock, and convertible bonds, building the world’s largest Bitcoin reserve. These preferred stocks provide fixed dividends or conversion rights for the coming years, while the convertible bonds allow creditors to convert into stock in the future. As of Q2 2025, the company held about 628,791 BTC, maintained a clean balance sheet, had an enterprise value of $126 billion, and debt of only $8.2 billion. On the July 31 earnings call, Strategy announced it would “exit the debt game”: it plans to redeem all convertible bonds and focus on multiple tranches of preferred stock issuance. The company expects its existing $6.3 billion preferred stock size to grow significantly, and during its investor roadshow announced issuance of a brand new $4.2 billion Stretch (STRC) perpetual preferred stock, targeting a 10% apy. TD Cowen’s Lance Vitanza noted that the convertible bond market is mainly dominated by hedge funds and arbitrageurs, who usually buy convertibles while shorting the stock to manage risk, so issuing convertibles causes heavy short-selling pressure. As Strategy’s market cap and reputation increased, it has been able to access the preferred stock market with better terms, avoiding this issue. In addition, the company stated that unless Bitcoin’s price drops more than 80%, it is almost impossible for it to face forced liquidation, reflecting the robustness of its capital structure. Such a financing strategy makes Strategy a unique crypto treasury company. Most latecomers in BTC, ETH, Solana and other sectors are still in growth stages, often needing to use PIPE placements, convertible bonds, and credit facilities to raise funds quickly, which increases leverage and creates potential selling pressure. For example, Twenty One and ProCap in 2025 respectively raised $485 million and $235 million through convertible bond issuance to launch Bitcoin treasury strategies. Therefore, currently only Strategy can expand without leverage through the preferred stock market, while other companies still rely on hybrid financing models. Conclusion Through its new “preferred stock + no debt” financing strategy, Strategy avoids the arbitrage short-selling pressure of the convertible bond market, while maintaining sufficient capital to handle price fluctuations. This model enhances its uniqueness among strong players, showing that the company not only focuses on accumulating Bitcoin but also prioritizes optimizing its financing structure. By contrast, mid-tier and weaker treasury companies still need to rely on convertibles, PIPE, and credit facilities, with higher leverage levels, making them vulnerable when markets cool down. This difference also explains why Strategy’s stock performance has outpaced Bitcoin itself, allowing it to remain ahead in the fiercely competitive crypto treasury market. 2. Stablecoin Payment Wars: Channels Are King, Tron Holds the Core Advantages Over the past few years, stablecoins have evolved from trading instruments into global payment infrastructure. With the passage of the U.S. GENIUS Act, more financial and tech companies are exploring stablecoins to lower cross-border payment costs and capture yield spreads. However, competition in stablecoins is shifting from “issuance capacity” to “channel control.” Winning the stablecoin payment war will depend not just on technology or fees, but on capturing key inflows and outflows of capital. Several stablecoin-dedicated chains are advancing quickly: Stripe’s Tempo, Plasma, Stable, Circle’s Arc—and TRON, which has already established dominance. Below, we examine their strategic positioning and the core competitive drivers of stablecoin payments. Comparison Between Traditional SWIFT Model and Public Chain+Stablecoin Pool Model Stripe’s Tempo: An Enterprise-Grade Chain Built on Existing Channel Payment giant Stripe is developing a dedicated payment chain, Tempo, in collaboration with Paradigm. Reports indicate that Tempo is a payment-focused Layer 1 blockchain, Ethereum-compatible, developed quietly by a small team. Paradigm’s reth execution client supports Tempo’s operations, providing critical technical infrastructure. Unlike open DeFi ecosystems, Tempo is designed to integrate deeply with Stripe’s merchant and channel network, offering enterprise customers stablecoin settlement. Its success depends on migrating existing business payment flows on-chain rather than targeting crypto-native users. In other words, Tempo follows a “channel-first” logic—leveraging Stripe’s global merchant base to scale its on-chain settlement network, rather than bootstrapping a developer ecosystem from scratch. Plasma: A Zero-Fee, Bitcoin-Anchored Stablecoin Network Backed by Tether, Plasma is a Bitcoin settlement-layer L2 network that combines Bitcoin’s security with EVM compatibility, enabling Ethereum contracts to migrate seamlessly. Plasma’s main selling point is “gasless USDT transfers”—users only post a small bond to prevent abuse, while ordinary transfers are fee-free. This drastically lowers friction for payments and remittances. Plasma also supports optional private transactions and promises permissionless bridging of native BTC, integrating Bitcoin liquidity with Tether’s dollar pools to create a low-slippage exchange and lending layer. On the funding side, Plasma secured early backing from Founders Fund and Tether at the end of 2024; its first liquidity tranche sold out within minutes, showing strong demand for zero-fee stablecoin chains. If Plasma succeeds in capturing significant USDT flows currently on Ethereum and TRON, it could bring Tether $1–2B in new annual revenue, solving its structural problem where issuance profits are strong but on-chain fee capture is weak. Stable: A Settlement Chain for Institutions and Large Transactions Unlike Plasma’s focus on user experience and zero fees, Stable is designed for compliant settlement for enterprises and institutions worldwide. Supported by Tether and Bitfinex, Stable uses USDT directly as both a gas and accounting unit—users don’t need to hold a separate native token. The chain emphasizes sub-second settlement speeds and “blockspace guarantees” for cross-border payments and commodity trades, ensuring large-value transactions receive priority finality on-chain. Combined with Tether’s investments in Latin American agriculture, African payments, and Canadian gold mining, Stable aims to embed USDT into supply chain finance and global trade settlement. For multinational companies reliant on wire transfers and letters of credit, if on-chain clearing can provide instant release, its efficiency would far surpass traditional methods. Thus, Stable could elevate USDT from a “trading pair currency” to a “global settlement currency,” further strengthening Tether’s control over stablecoin capital flows. Circle’s Arc: Neutral and Open Financial Infrastructure Circle, the issuer of USDC, announced the launch of its own blockchain, Arc, to meet institutional demand for stablecoin finance. Arc is an open, EVM-compatible Layer 1 that supports USDC and other stablecoins, integrating Circle’s CCTP cross-chain protocol, payment network, wallet services, and smart contract infrastructure. Powered by Malachite’s high-performance consensus engine, Arc offers sub-second finality and introduces a predictable, USDC-denominated gas fee mechanism. Arc also includes a stablecoin FX engine, enabling cross-border payments, FX trading, and capital market settlements. Circle argues that existing public chains cannot fully meet financial institutions’ compliance and efficiency requirements, so Arc aims to provide specialized stablecoin financial infrastructure while remaining open and neutral to attract other issuers. Unlike Tether’s strategy of channel capture via proprietary chains, Circle positions Arc as a collaborative “public utility” for finance, aspiring to become the settlement layer of the stablecoin industry. Tron: Defending Its Moat with Channel Dominance Despite new chains entering the race, the current king of stablecoin payments remains TRON . As of mid-2025, TRON hosts over $80.7B in USDT supply with daily transaction volumes above $21B—far exceeding Ethereum during the same period. TRON’s advantages come from several factors: Low migration costs – TRON VM is Ethereum-compatible, and TRX itself was originally an ERC-20; migrating USDT from Ethereum to TRON required almost no changes. Deep exchange integration – Binance designates TRON as its default deposit network, supported by Huobi, Poloniex, and others, forming massive channels. Emerging market dominance – In Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia, TRON is the leading network for payroll and remittances. Low fees & reward model – Its DPoS consensus and “bandwidth + energy” model allow institutions and exchanges to complete transfers at near-zero cost by staking. Strong channel stickiness – OTC desks and cross-border networks are deeply locked into TRON liquidity; migrating elsewhere would require rebuilding flows, making replacement difficult. These advantages have created a strong channel moat, ensuring TRON’s dominance in stablecoin payments. Comparison of Public Chains Core Competitive Drivers of Stablecoin Payments The comparisons above show that the real competition in stablecoin payments lies not simply in “technology” or “lower fees,” but in channel control and network effects. USDT flows are concentrated among exchanges, OTC desks, cross-border networks, and high-frequency institutions. Whoever secures these channels becomes the market leader, even without offering the lowest fees. At the same time, user experience optimization is equally critical. For example, Stable and Arc lower barriers by introducing gasless or predictable fee mechanisms and faster settlement, making institutions more willing to adopt. In payment use cases, the decisive factor is not marginal performance gains, but the ability to build a robust clearing network and sustainable ecosystem. 3.Winners in Payment Channels & New Token Listings: Tron and HTX’s Six-Month Story 3.1 Tron: Stablecoin Supremacy and the DAT Experiment Tron continues to dominate the stablecoin and cross-border payment sectors. Research from Cointelegraph and CryptoQuant shows that in H1 2025, Tron’s stablecoin supply grew 40% YTD, with over 51% of global USDT now on Tron. CryptoQuant further reports that Tron processes ~2.3–2.4M USDT transfers daily, with $2.46B in average daily transfer value—6.8× and 2.7× Ethereum, respectively. In May 2025, network transaction count hit 273M, while active addresses reached 28.7M in June, setting multi-year highs. This growth was driven by surging SunSwap volumes (wTRX monthly volume spiked to $3.8B in May) and rising JustLend demand, making Tron the primary battlefield for stablecoin circulation and DeFi rates. https://defillama.com Beyond payments, the Tron ecosystem is experimenting with Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) models. Publicly listed Tron Inc. (formerly SRM Entertainment) adopted a blockchain-integrated treasury approach in 2025, holding 365M TRX staked on JustLend to earn ~10% annualized yield—among the first DATs directly combining staking income. In July, Tron Inc. filed a $1B shelf registration with the SEC, planning equity or bond issuance to acquire more TRX, effectively mirroring MicroStrategy’s equity-financed Bitcoin accumulation strategy. This model combines equity financing with on-chain yield, potentially driving continuous TRX treasury expansion. 3.2 HTX: Leading in Fiat Gateways and New Token Trading In exchange competition, HTX is consolidating its edge via two strategies. Safe and efficient fiat on/off ramps – In Aug 2025, HTX launched the industry’s first “Verified Station” module, allowing only merchants with a “zero-freeze” record. It also introduced a “0-freeze + 100% reimbursement” dual insurance mechanism: if an order is frozen by judicial action, compensation is split 50/50 between the merchant and platform, capped at 10,000 USDT per order. Supported by a 24/7 rapid-response compensation team, this significantly reduced fiat ramp risks and boosted user trust. Leadership in new token trading – According to CryptoQuant, as of mid-Aug 2025, HTX’s YTD spot trading volume for new listings reached $38B, ranking first among “second-tier” exchanges and accounting for 22% of daily new-coin trading. Binance led with $133B, followed by Bybit ($35B) and MEXC ($34B). This included hot projects such as BIO, AIXBT, and CGPT, showing that new assets have become a major traffic driver. HTX’s broader market standing has also improved: CoinGecko ranking rose from #13 to #7, CoinMarketCap from #15 to #9, DefiLlama (North America-focused) at #6, Kaiko Q2 spot ranking from #10 to #8 with an AA rating, and CryptoRank CIS ranking at #3. Official data shows HTX has disclosed reserve data for 32 consecutive months, with platform USDT balances rising from 665M to 1.15B in the past three months—a >30% increase, underscoring its growing liquidity and security capacity. https://www.coingecko.com Together, Tron and HTX demonstrate powerful chain–payment–exchange flywheel dynamics in 2025. Tron is expanding stablecoin dominance, strengthening DeFi, and pioneering TRX DATs to anchor payments and lending. HTX is reinforcing fiat gateway safety and driving activity in new token markets, combining liquidity depth with user security. This dual-engine model positions Tron and HTX at the core of the stablecoin and exchange ecosystems, while reminding investors to watch closely for risks in DAT leverage, volume structures, and platform governance. 4. Ethereum Ecosystem: Old Trees Bloom Again—Legacy Projects Find New Narratives, Roadmaps Gradually Realized 4.1 U.S. Policy Shift: From Regulatory Resistance to Policy Support In early 2025, with the change in SEC chairmanship, regulatory winds made a historic turn. The new SEC chair, Paul Atkins, launched the “Project Crypto” initiative, explicitly stating “we will no longer regulated by enforcement,” and declared that most tokens are not securities. This policy not only granted legitimacy to on-chain projects but also reduced compliance burdens for new issuances. Soon after, U.S. lawmakers passed the CLARITY Act and policies such as 401(k) crypto investments, further paving the way for institutional participation. This warming policy climate had profound impact on several legacy projects: Uniswap : In February 2025, the SEC withdrew its investigation into Uniswap Labs. Media commentary described this as signaling regulators no longer see it as an illegal securities trading platform—a major victory for DeFi. UNI price and Uniswap v4 TVL both rose as a result. Cardano/ADA : New policy clarified that “liquid staking is not a security.” Project leader Charles Hoskinson emphasized ADA staking is not a security. This allowed ADA, previously affected by staking disputes, to regain market recognition. Chainlink/LINK : By cooperating with the SEC’s crypto compliance task force and participating in compliance framework development, Chainlink formed a collaborative relationship with regulators, with its token rising on regulatory tailwinds. From a policy perspective, the U.S. regulatory shift brought a new narrative to old projects—“only compliance can scale.” Legacy projects shifted from being in a “regulatory gray zone” to “compliance infrastructure,” attracting renewed attention from institutions and developers. 4.2 MakerDAO to Spark: Rebranding and Token System Reconstruction As DeFi’s old “central bank,” MakerDAO completed a strategic restructuring in 2024: the community renamed the parent brand to Sky , and elevated the stablecoin sub-brand “Spark Protocol” into an independent sub-DAO, launching governance token SPK . Under the restructuring plan, Spark will airdrop 666,600 SPK to the community, then issue 100 million annually for depositor incentives and governance. Sky also used SparkLend, Spark Savings , and the cross-chain liquidity module SLL to allocate multi-chain stablecoin capital across DeFi, CeFi, and RWA. Spark’s TVL has since grown to $8.2 billion, up 250% in just a few months, ranking sixth among DeFi platforms. SPK’s strong performance made the “MakerDAO → Spark” transition a typical case of an old project shedding its stale label and discovering a new narrative. https://spark.fi 4.3 Syrup/Pendle: Building a New Yield Trading Curve Lending giant Maple Finance’s Syrup.fi found a new growth curve through cooperation with Pendle . In 2024, SyrupUSDC launched on the Pendle platform, where users could hold PT-SyrupUSDC for fixed income, trade YT-SyrupUSDC for future yields, or provide liquidity to earn fees and Pendle rewards. With Pendle V3’s launch of the Boros platform in 2025, BTC/ETH funding rates were split into tradable yield units, further expanding TVL and trading volume, pushing Pendle’s TVL to $10 billion. https://syrup.fi At the same time, Maple integrated Syrup with its institutional business, forming a unified ecosystem; Q2 2025 updates showed Maple’s AUM reached $2.6 billion, with syrupUSD becoming the fastest-growing yield-bearing dollar asset ($2.1 billion AUM), deeply integrated with platforms like Pendle. The Syrup + Pendle combination demonstrated how legacy lending platforms can use “yield trading” innovation to unlock new markets. https://maple.finance/insights/q2-2025-maple-market-update 4.4 ZKVM Roadmap: Boundless and Succinct Exploring Ethereum’s New Infrastructure On the technical front, Ethereum’s roadmap is moving toward “ZK-first.” According to the Ethereum Foundation’s 2024 plan, future validators will be able to use ZK clients to verify zkVM-generated proofs instead of re-executing transactions, achieving faster block verification and on-chain light clients. This vision has spawned multiple zkVM infrastructure projects, with RISC Zero’s Boundless and Succinct’s SP1/Prove among the most important. Boundless : In July 2025, the RISC Zero team launched Boundless’ incentivized testnet on the Base chain. It is a decentralized zero-knowledge compute marketplace using “Proof of Verifiable Work (PoVW)” consensus, where ZK miners earn rewards by verifying zkVM proofs. Boundless allows blockchains to share computation without redundant execution. CEO Shiv Shankar noted it can “enable cross-chain reuse of on-chain computation, improve efficiency and security, and attract developers and miners across ecosystems.” SP1 and Succinct Network : Succinct Labs’ SP1 is a fully open-source zkVM. According to the team, SP1 leverages cross-table lookup architecture and customizable precompiles to significantly speed up proving, achieving 4–28x performance gains over existing zkVMs for certain tasks. SP1 is a general-purpose zkVM designed for Rust developers, supporting compilation of normal Rust programs into verifiable zero-knowledge proofs. The Succinct Network (token symbol PROVE) builds a decentralized proving marketplace, providing “zero-knowledge infrastructure” with SP1, and accelerating proofs up to 20x with FPGA. The network supports multiple proving systems and is compatible with Ethereum, Solana, and other ecosystems. The evolution of zkVM means Ethereum could achieve efficient verification directly on Layer 1 in the future, enabling rollups, cross-chain bridges, AI inference, and other applications to operate within a zero knowledge environment. The advancement of these infrastructure projects allows Ethereum, the “old tree,” to grow new technical branches. 5.Gamified Investment Logic: Primary Opportunities in Derivatives Exchanges and Aggregators If we compare the crypto primary market to a game, the investment rhythm becomes clear: enter early in projects, enjoy the short-lived cash flow boom, then exit when channels mature. It is exactly this “game-like” logic that makes derivatives DEXs and their aggregator s such an intriguing track. On one hand, the market environment is shifting. According to CoinGecko’s quarterly report, decentralized spot trading volume grew 25% in Q2 2025 compared to the previous quarter, while centralized exchange volume fell nearly 28%, pushing the CEX/DEX ratio to a record high. In the same quarter, decentralized perpetual contract trading volume surpassed $89.8 billion for the first time, with Hyperliquid capturing 73% of the market. This liquidity migration signals that large capital flows are moving on-chain, and users are increasingly willing to trade high-volatility perpetuals on decentralized platforms. On the other hand, product-level innovations are reinforcing this trend. Meme-coin trading aggregators such as GMGN helped 28,000 users earn $163 million during the TRUMP token boom in 2024. Its edge lay in capturing new coin signals, enabling 1-second transactions, and offering copy-trading and stop-loss/take-profit functions. This proved that combining deep liquidity, fast execution, and user-friendly interfaces can attract large numbers of retail investors and KOLs. Perpetual aggregators are replicating this model. Projects like Hypersolid and Range connect multiple perpetual DEXs such as Hyperliquid through a single interface, aggregating fragmented liquidity to offer users better prices, funding rates, and cross-chain collateralization. Similarly, Hyperliquid’s Builder Codes allow front-end apps (wallets, bots, or trading tools) to plug directly into its deep order book and earn fee-sharing, letting developers profit without building their own trading engines. Tools like Unit let users inject Solana assets into Hyperliquid in one click and automatically convert them into futures margin, streamlining the experience. In summary, the perpetual aggregator track combines both “fast breakout + clear exit” features: policy-driven liquidity migration, mature technical components lowering startup barriers, and aggregator network effects rapidly accumulating users. This makes it highly aligned with the traditional primary market “game” investment logic—an emerging opportunity worth watching. 5.1 Derivatives Trading Track: The Core Sector of Exploding Revenues As the crypto market entered a new bull cycle from late 2023, derivatives trading gradually became DeFi’s largest cash flow source. DeFiLlama’s rankings show that Hyperliquid generated about $3.15M in 24h revenue—second only to Tether and Circle; in the derivatives sub-ranking, edgeX led with $688.6K in 24h revenue, followed closely by Jupiter JLP and others. https://defillama.com Perp DEX (Perpetual DEX) is a decentralized exchange supporting perpetual futures contract trading. Unlike centralized exchanges, Perp DEXs rely entirely on blockchain smart contracts, with users managing assets directly through Web3 wallets—achieving self-custody and full on-chain transparency . 5.2 Differences between Perp DEX and CEX Ownership of funds : Users hold private keys, avoiding the risk of CEX misappropriation or collapse. No KYC : Most Perp DEXs do not require identity verification. On-chain transparency : All transactions and funds are verifiable, avoiding FTX-style black-box risks. Fee advantages : Many DEXs run on Layer 2 or custom chains with near-zero gas fees. Performance & liquidity : While historically weaker than CEXs, today’s DEXs have improved significantly, with some achieving near-centralized speed and depth. Transparency pressure : CEXs only launched “Proof of Reserves” under pressure from DEXs, which are natively verifiable. User access : Most Perp DEXs require Web3 wallet connections, but more are beginning to support email/social login (semi-custodial wallets), lowering barriers for newcomers. Core Metrics TVL (Total Value Locked) : Reflects capital scale and community trust. OI (Open Interest) : Shows trading activity and leverage usage. High TVL and OI usually mean strong liquidity, good depth, and low slippage. Maker fees : Liquidity provision fees, sometimes with rebates. Taker fees : Immediate execution costs, typically higher. Rebates : Encourage market-making, improve liquidity. Vaults (Strategy Vaults) Copy-trading vaults : Users can follow professional traders’ strategies. LP vaults : Provide liquidity, earn fees and liquidation income, but carry drawdown risk. 5.3 Hyperliquid Ecosystem: Growth Driven by Speed, Depth, and Buybacks Hyperliquid is far ahead in the perpetual trading track thanks to its self-developed Layer 1 chain, high-performance order book, and powerful economic model. Year-to-date, Hyperliquid has generated $406M in revenue, with an annualized run rate of over $810M ; 92% of fees are used for HYPE buybacks. Open Interest stands at ~$12B , with TVL reaching $4.93B —far surpassing other Perp DEXs. Ecosystem expansion is another of Hyperliquid’s strengths: the Unit protocol, launched in February, enabled native deposits and withdrawals for BTC, ETH, SOL, and more, while placing orders directly on-chain via an auction system. Unit TVL has reached $800M , though spot trading volume accounts for just 2%, still in its early phase. HyperEVM’s mainnet grew TVL from under $50M to $2.08B within two months of launch, with new tools such as Builder Codes (e.g., Phantom Perps) driving sharp increases in daily active addresses and transactions. On the revenue side, Hyperliquid has already accumulated $406M this year; daily revenues rose from $1M to $3M in Q1, peaking above $5M . In the last 24h, the Aid Fund repurchased 92,180 HYPE , spending $3.87M at an average price of $42.02 —showing that the buyback mechanism continues to support the token price. https://data.asxn.xyz/dashboard/hl-buybacks 5.4 From “Meme Aggregator” Logic to Contract Aggregators On Solana, GMGN.ai became a popular entry point for meme-coin trading by aggregating liquidity across multiple DEXs, offering instant token discovery and copy-trading. The keys to its success lie in three aspects: Liquidity aggregation providing the best prices.Minimalist UI enabling seamless trading for new users. Leaderboards and social elements enhancing user stickiness. This logic is now migrating to perpetuals. Early multi-chain perpetual aggregators such as Rage Trade have started integrating Hyperliquid, GMX, and Synthetix, but the true “GMGN for contracts” may emerge within Hyperliquid’s ecosystem: leveraging Hyperliquid’s high-speed order book and deep liquidity, a front-end could aggregate perpetual liquidity across multiple protocols—even CEXs—while offering one-click position opening, strategy copy-trading, follow-trading, and performance leaderboards. Meanwhile, Unit and Builder Codes allow wallets or apps to embed Hyperliquid trading directly, further lowering barriers for users. Such contract aggregators could solve the current challenges of complex DEX UIs and fragmented liquidity, sparking a new wave of user growth similar to GMGN’s impact on memecoins. 5.5 HIP-3: Contract Engine for Stocks and Beyond The rise of contract aggregators depends on openness at the base layer. Hyperliquid’s HIP-3 proposal is a turning point. HIP-3 allows any user holding 1M HYPE to bid for new market deployment rights: winners can freely set perpetual parameters, select on-chain oracles, and capture up to 50% of trading fees. This means creators can launch perpetual products without building their own order book—Hyperliquid provides the infrastructure and liquidity. HIP-3’s openness not only enables community-created perpetual markets for crypto assets and commodities but also opens the door to traditional assets like stocks. For example, Ventuals leveraged HIP-3 to launch “stock valuation perpetuals,” where the valuation of private companies (e.g., OpenAI, Stripe, SpaceX) is divided by 10^9 to form a “valuation unit.” Investors can long or short these company valuations using USDC, with up to 10x leverage , suspension, and settlement mechanisms. Ventuals also plans to source pre-IPO valuation data as oracles, effectively tokenizing equity valuations into perpetual contracts. With HIP-3 live and more developers and institutions acquiring HYPE to deploy markets, contract versions of stocks and other RWAs could emerge at scale—aggregators will allow users to trade across asset classes in one place. 6. Macro Market Outlook Historically, Fed rate cuts fall into two categories: Preemptive – to hedge risks before a severe downturn (e.g., 1990, 1995, 2019). Crisis-driven – forced easing during recessions (e.g., 2001, 2008). Today, with a weakening labor market, trade tariffs, and geopolitical uncertainty—but inflation clearly easing—the environment resembles a preemptive cut, which supports risk assets. Both Bitcoin and U.S. equities have hit new highs. 1990–1992 : During the S&L crisis and Gulf War, the Fed cut rates from 8% → 3%, easing credit stress, CPI fell, GDP rebounded, equities rallied. 1995–1998 : To avoid over-tightening, the Fed cut in 1995–96, supporting growth. Later, the Asian financial crisis and LTCM collapse prompted further cuts, fueling the dot-com bubble. Money market fund assets have surpassed $7 trillion Despite debates on whether a September cut could trigger a crypto top, fund flows suggest otherwise. U.S. money market funds hold a record $7.2T in assets. Historically, outflows from MMFs correlate positively with inflows into risk assets. As cuts reduce their yield advantage, more capital could shift into crypto and equities. This unprecedented cash reserve is the strongest potential powder keg for the bull market. Fed Meeting Dates and Target Rate Ranges Structurally, capital is already rotating away from Bitcoin. BTC dominance has fallen from 65% in May to 59% in August, while altcoin market cap has surged >50% since July to $1.4T. CoinMarketCap’s “Altseason Index” still sits at ~40, well below the 75 threshold, yet the divergence between muted indicators and soaring market cap reveals selective capital inflows—especially into Ethereum (ETH). ETH benefits from $22B+ in ETF flows, plus its role as the backbone of stablecoins and RWAs, giving it stronger capital pull than BTC. https://www.coingecko.com This bull market differs fundamentally from past cycles. With an overwhelming number of tokens, the era of “everything pumps” is over. Investors are focusing on value and structural opportunities—favoring projects with real cash flows, regulatory prospects, or strong narratives, while long-tail assets without fundamentals are being marginalized. At the same time, valuations are stretched. Treasury strategies may be at risk of over-financialization: if institutions or treasuries engage in concentrated selling, it could trigger cascading liquidations and deep market shocks.

Called the Ethereum ‘Strategy,’ Bitmine now holds a total of 1,947,299 ETH, valued at $8.69 billion, per on-chain analyst EmberCN. Bitmine (BMNR) 在过去 1 小时里从 Galaxy Digital 和 FalconX 两家机构业务平台收到了 80,325 枚 ETH ($3.58 亿)。 这应该是他们在本周所购买的 ETH，再加上他们截至 8/31 时所持有的 1,866,974 枚 ETH，他们现在应该是有 1,947,299 枚 ETH ($86.9 亿) 了。 本文由 #Bitget ｜ @Bitget_zh 赞助 https://t.co/yXOy23Idg3 pic.twitter.com/ha2VqgeEj4 — 余烬 (@EmberCN) September 4, 2025 This means that the total stash is more than double the holdings of SharpLink, the second-largest ETH holder. As of August 31, Bitmine held 1,866,974 ETH with an average cost of $3,883, while SharpLink held 837,230 ETH with an average cost of $3,594. The purchase comes a day after the publicly traded Bitcoin mining company announced that it holds 1.87 million Ethereum tokens . This is nearly 1.55% of the entire ETH supply. This development underscores how institutional players like Galaxy Digital and FalconX are facilitating large-scale crypto movements. Bitmine Mirrors Saylor’s Strategy Playbook – Bullish for Supply Squeeze The transfers highlight Bitmine’s aggressive ETH accumulation plan, potentially signalling confidence in the token’s long-term value, despite recent price fluctuations. Besides, on Tuesday, The Ether Machine announced that it added another 150,000 ETH to its treasury, bringing its total holdings to 500,000 ETH, worth around $2.19 billion. Consistent accumulation by major players highlights that strategic positioning is key in the current market. Further, the token will likely continue to attract institutional interest in the coming months, driving the price further. Ethereum accumulation has helped the coin climb to $4,385, making a 20.1% increase in a month and a staggering 84% rise in the past year, per CoinMarketCap data . Additionally, the latest CoinShares report indicates that ETH ETFs have assets under management of $37.9 billion, an optimistic signal to maintain ETH’s momentum. How Long Will ETH Amid Treasury Play Sustain? Treasury excitement has been a major driver of ETH’s recent price surge. Unlike Bitcoin, ETH holdings can be staked, turning idle reserves into a yield engine. This makes Ethereum a different kind of balance sheet bet: asset and an income stream. That said, it’s a double-edged sword. If ETH keeps getting locked up for staking/yield, investors can expect sustained price pressure, but also sharper volatility if hoarders face forced selling or sentiment turns. James Toledano, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet, told Cryptonews that network-level improvement in capacity, lower DeFi transaction costs, and active Layer‑2 adoption have also fostered a flurry of on‑chain activity. “Momentum may carry ETH higher in the near term; however, history cautions toward late‑Summer/September pullbacks even after sharp rallies,” he added. Bulls see ETH’s ability to hold $4,450 as critical for maintaining upward momentum.

Analysts Comment,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/are-new-solana-sol-price-peaks-on-the-horizon-analysts-comment/,"Solana (SOL), which entered 2025 with sharp fluctuations, is gaining momentum again despite experiencing declines of up to 70 percent during the year. SOL, which has risen 15% in the last two weeks, has outperformed Ethereum, which remained stagnant, and Bitcoin, which lost 4% in the same period. The token, which has gained 30% on a monthly basis, reached a six-month high of $216.87 last week. Solana's rally accelerated particularly after VanEck filed for a staked Solana ETF alongside decentralized finance platform Jito. Bloomberg's recent report that Galaxy and Jump planned to establish a $1 billion Solana-focused treasury fund also supported the rally. “Solana is currently at a critical resistance level,” said Leo Zhao, Investment Director at MEXC Ventures. “Positive macro signals, such as a potential US interest rate cut, could lead to new highs.” Related News: BREAKING: FED Releases the Much-Anticipated Beige Book - Here's Everything You Need to Know Interest from institutional investors is growing. Giants like Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, and Bitwise have applied for SOL ETFs, while BlackRock expanded its tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, to Solana this year. Institutions like Ark Invest, Galaxy, and Republic are increasing their presence on the network through SOL staking and tokenization projects. The Solana network stands out in the tokenization trend with its high transaction capacity. “If you believe in a future where everything from farmland to buildings to stocks will be tokenized, Solana is the perfect vehicle,” said Josh Brown of Ritholtz. “Because no other Layer 1 network can handle such high transaction volume.” *This is not investment advice.

Following approvals for Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, analysts believe Solana may be next in line to receive the SEC’s blessing. Reports suggest the regulatory timeline could be shorter than many expected, with conversations already underway between major asset managers and US regulators. For Solana, an ETF would be a historic milestone, validating its rise as one of the most important blockchains in the ecosystem. Yet while institutional attention continues to flow toward Solana, retail traders are increasingly looking beyond the obvious. Many believe the biggest multiples won’t come from large caps, but from emerging names like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is quickly gaining recognition among early investors. Solana’s case for an ETF The argument for a Solana ETF rests on momentum. Solana has become one of the most active Layer-1 blockchains, boasting transaction speeds of more than 65,000 TPS and fees measured in fractions of a cent. Its developer ecosystem has expanded rapidly, hosting leading projects in DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. Institutional players now view Solana as the logical third pillar of the crypto market, after Bitcoin and Ethereum, making it a prime candidate for regulated investment vehicles. Data from CoinShares shows Solana has consistently led inflows among altcoins in 2025, with nearly $1.2 billion entering Solana-focused products this year alone. Analysts argue that an ETF could unlock billions more in institutional capital, cementing SOL’s place as a core asset in diversified crypto portfolios. Why timing matters The prospect of a Solana ETF arriving sooner than expected carries major implications for market structure. ETFs not only legitimize assets but also make them accessible to new classes of investors, retirement accounts, wealth managers, and risk-averse funds. If the SEC accelerates approval, Solana could experience a similar effect to Ethereum in mid-2024, when its ETF drove billions of inflows in just weeks. But while Solana’s upside from an ETF is undeniable, analysts caution that large-cap gains are often measured in multiples of 2x or 3x, not the explosive surges seen in earlier days. For investors looking for transformative growth, presales and small-cap projects remain the higher-risk, higher-reward arena. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the conversation. Ranked among the Best Cryptos to Buy for the coming multi-year bull market, it has already become one of 2025’s most talked-about presales. Early rounds have sold out in record time, signaling both grassroots demand and early whale interest. What differentiates MAGACOIN FINANCE from typical meme tokens is its blend of cultural branding, capped supply, and credibility anchored by completed audits. Analysts project it could deliver extraordinary upside by capitalizing on the same dynamics that fueled SHIB and PEPE, but with stronger foundations. The project’s accessibility is also a key advantage. Unlike Solana, which trades in the hundreds, MAGACOIN FINANCE allows retail investors to stack millions of tokens at low entry points. This psychology, owning a “big stack” before listings, creates community loops that spread virally across social platforms. For those seeking exponential returns rather than institutional stability, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as the cultural ignition point. A dual-track opportunity Investors don’t need to choose between Solana and MAGACOIN FINANCE; they serve different purposes. Solana represents the institutional track: steady growth, ETF validation, and large-scale adoption. MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the retail-driven track: asymmetric upside, cultural magnetism, and viral momentum. Together, they form a balanced strategy, anchoring a portfolio in credibility while still leaving room for breakout multiples. Conclusion The possibility of a Solana ETF arriving earlier than expected has sent a wave of optimism through the market. Institutional money is circling, and Solana’s position as a top Layer-1 makes it a strong candidate for accelerated approval. Yet for investors seeking more than stability, the real buzz is forming elsewhere. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its surging presale, capped supply, and inclusion on “Best Cryptos to Buy” lists, is being called one of the most compelling breakout opportunities of 2025. The coming months may show that while Solana secures its institutional crown, MAGACOIN FINANCE ignites the hopes for huge gains.

Judge Analisa Torres even cited XRP holder submissions in her ruling, which concluded that XRP itself is not a security. While the token soared to a record $3.65 in July, XRP has since cooled and is currently trading at $2.83. XRP Army Shaped Ripple’s Case Ripple Labs’ long-running legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially ended last month after both parties agreed to drop their appeals. This put an end to the case which began in 2020. The SEC accused Ripple of selling its XRP token as an unregistered security, but Judge Analisa Torres’ 2023 ruling determined that only some XRP transactions could be classified as securities, setting the stage for the eventual conclusion. Now, with the dust settled, many in the crypto community are crediting XRP tokenholders —who are referred to as the “XRP Army”—for playing a major role in shaping the outcome. Crypto lawyer John Deaton, who became a central figure in representing XRP holders during the case, argued that their involvement was decisive. He pointed out that over 2,000 exhibits were filed, including affidavits and amicus briefs from XRP holders, which Judge Torres explicitly cited in her ruling. Deaton said this provided undeniable proof that retail investors’ voices influenced the court. Ripple executives agreed with this. Deputy general counsel Deborah McCrimmon even mentioned how XRP supporters helped uncover speeches and public statements from regulators that boosted Ripple’s fair notice defense. She explained that while Ripple never asked for this assistance, the grassroots efforts saved the company potentially thousands of dollars in legal work and provided critical context showing the case’s impact beyond Ripple itself. The XRP Army’s activism extended far beyond court documents. Over the years, they lobbied regulators, submitted affidavits, launched petitions, and organized coordinated social media campaigns. Deaton said this collective action proved that while one person might not be able to shift the outcome alone, one person can inspire many, and together they can drive change. XRP price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Market reactions to the case have been mixed. XRP surged 72% immediately after Judge Torres’ 2023 ruling, and more recently spiked to a record high of $3.65 in July amid speculation about a final resolution. However, after briefly touching $3.35 when news of the appeals being dropped surfaced, the token has cooled and is currently trading at $2.83.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|REGULATION|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-04 05:30:00

This new target comes right after a 30% plunge in quarterly profits last week, shaking investors and confirming what the numbers were already saying. Deliveries in both July and August were nearly identical to the same period last year, offering no growth. Local rivals are flooding the market with cheaper models stacked with tech, and consumers are biting. The company, based in Shenzhen, now faces the rest of the year with that revised number hanging over its head and no room left for mistakes. BYD loses edge as rivals take customers Profits aren’t the only thing bleeding. BYD’s ability to grab more customers through aggressive discounting has been slammed by new restrictions from Beijing, which has started cracking down on wild price cuts that were once common. Without that tool, the company is now trying to survive in the busiest part of the year (September and October) by pushing full-priced models against cheaper, sleeker offerings from companies like Geely and Xpeng. Even newer players are chipping away. Xiaomi’s SU7 sedan and YU7 SUV came out of nowhere and gained traction fast, surprising both consumers and analysts. These models are loaded with features and priced to compete. As a result, BYD is being squeezed from all sides and can’t rely on discounts to fight back. Its shares fell by 2% in Hong Kong at Thursdsy’s market open, which suggests most investors had already braced for a drop. Analysts at Bloomberg are now estimating 4.5 million units sold by year-end. Eunice Lee, senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said the company’s new number is “largely in line with buyside expectations now and should be achievable.” She added, “This could also be a near-term clearing event for the stock.” Still, hitting that lower number won’t be easy. The company’s brand strength is being tested daily by new models, tight margins, and tighter regulation. Even though BYD is still the biggest EV brand in China by volume, its lead is shrinking fast. The weapons it once used to dominate (scale, price, speed) are now liabilities in a crowded market that’s watching every yuan. Tesla goes public with robotaxi app in Austin While BYD fights to hold its ground in China, Tesla is opening up its robotaxi service to the public in the U.S. On Wednesday night, the company’s official Tesla Robotaxi account posted on social media platform X that the app is “now available to all.” This marks the first time the app isn’t limited to investors or influencers. The post included a link to Apple’s App Store , allowing users to download and join the waitlist. The rollout lines up with earlier comments from Elon Musk, who said the app would go public in September. Tesla originally launched the service in June, using about 10 to 20 Model Y SUVs in Austin, Texas for a small test group. Since then, it has quietly expanded into California, where it offers a non-autonomous rideshare service under the same branding, according to several X posts from Elon Musk. What’s not clear yet is whether the same app will work across both Austin and the Bay Area. The terms of service inside the app include legal details for California users, which hints at possible expansion, but there’s been no official word from Tesla on the exact locations that are live.

The 2017 cycle set the gold standard for parabolic crypto rallies, and Crypto Metric sees XRP aligning with the same structural markers, prolonged accumulation, shrinking exchange reserves, tightening volatility, and heavy on-chain positioning by whales. If these parallels hold, XRP’s next leg shifts from mere speculation to a scenario with real probability. Notably, in 2017, prolonged sideways trading allowed demand to concentrate while readily available supply thinned, creating the conditions for fast, sustained appreciation. Therefore, a $4.50-plus target represents a multi-bagger move from recent levels, which explains the renewed excitement among momentum traders and allocators hunting asymmetric returns with such a move leading to a new all-time high (ATH) since the present one stands at $3.65. Presently, XRP is trading at $2.84, according to CoinGecko data . $706.5M Worth of XRP Moves On-Chain — Whale Games or Institutional Play? According to renowned market analyst Xaif Crypto, a massive 257,105,694 XRP, valued at approximately $706.5 million, was just transferred on-chain , sparking intense speculation within the crypto community. Such a large-scale movement raises pressing questions: Is this the latest round of whale maneuvering, or the quiet entry of institutional capital? Whale activity has consistently shaped XRP’s market moves, often foreshadowing sharp volatility. A transfer of hundreds of millions signals more than routine activity, it suggests coordinated action, whether for liquidity shifts, exchange positioning, or strategic accumulation. However, analysts warn such moves frequently precede major swings, specifically upward if whales are stockpiling, or downward if distribution is underway. On the other hand, growing institutional interest in XRP cannot be ignored. With Ripple’s expanding footprint in cross-border payments, coupled with increasing regulatory clarity in major markets, institutions may be positioning themselves for exposure. A $706.5 million transfer aligns more closely with the type of balance sheet reshuffling typical of large financial entities rather than retail-driven market speculation. Adding to the intrigue, this transaction surfaces during a period of tight consolidation in XRP’s price, echoing patterns seen before previous rallies. Historically, large on-chain movements have coincided with accumulation phases, suggesting that a breakout could be on the horizon. Traders are closely monitoring the charts, where cup-and-handle and ascending triangle structures point toward a potential upside target of $3.55. Conclusion Whether this staggering $706.5 million XRP transfer represents whale-driven market tactics or the early signs of institutional accumulation, its sheer scale cannot be overlooked. It signals that powerful players are positioning themselves ahead of a potentially pivotal moment for XRP. Meanwhile, while XRP’s current consolidation bears striking resemblance to its legendary 2017 setup, the path to $4.50 and beyond hinges on more than just technical echoes of the past with on-chain metrics suggesting the groundwork for a breakout is forming.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-04 05:37:53

Ripple, a leader in enterprise blockchain and crypto solutions, is now extending its support for its proprietary stablecoin, Ripple RLUSD , to institutional clients across the continent. This strategic move, initially reported by CoinDesk, signals a new era for digital payments and financial inclusion in a rapidly expanding market. To ensure widespread adoption and seamless integration, Ripple has established crucial partnerships. The company is collaborating with payments provider Chipper Cash, the prominent South Africa-based cryptocurrency exchange VALR, and the African stablecoin exchange Yellow Card. These alliances are poised to accelerate the deployment and utility of Ripple RLUSD , bringing advanced financial tools directly to businesses and financial institutions. What is Ripple RLUSD and Why is Africa a Key Market? Ripple RLUSD is a stablecoin, meaning its value is pegged to a stable asset, typically the US dollar. This stability makes it an ideal digital asset for cross-border transactions and institutional use, offering predictability in volatile crypto markets. For institutional clients, RLUSD provides a reliable bridge between traditional finance and the digital economy. Africa represents a vibrant and rapidly evolving financial landscape. The continent has seen an explosion in mobile money adoption and digital payments, yet traditional cross-border transactions often remain slow, expensive, and complex. This creates a compelling need for efficient, low-cost, and transparent solutions. Ripple recognizes this immense potential, positioning Ripple RLUSD as a powerful tool to address these challenges and foster economic growth. Forging Powerful Partnerships for Widespread Adoption of Ripple RLUSD Ripple’s strategy for Africa hinges on strong local partnerships, ensuring that Ripple RLUSD can effectively serve diverse markets. Each partner plays a vital role in this ecosystem: Chipper Cash: As a leading cross-border payments app in Africa, Chipper Cash provides the infrastructure and user base to facilitate smooth transactions for businesses and potentially bridge to consumer applications. VALR: This South Africa-based cryptocurrency exchange offers a robust platform for trading and accessing digital assets. VALR’s involvement will likely provide liquidity and a trusted gateway for institutions to acquire and utilize Ripple RLUSD . Yellow Card: An African stablecoin exchange, Yellow Card is crucial for ensuring the accessibility and exchangeability of RLUSD across various African nations, supporting local currency conversions and wider utility. These collaborations are not merely transactional; they represent a concerted effort to build a resilient and interconnected digital financial infrastructure that can truly empower African institutions. How Will Ripple RLUSD Transform Institutional Finance? The introduction of Ripple RLUSD for institutional clients promises several significant benefits: Faster and Cheaper Cross-Border Payments: Traditional international transfers can take days and incur high fees. RLUSD facilitates near-instant settlements at a fraction of the cost, improving efficiency for businesses operating across borders. Enhanced Liquidity Management: Institutions can manage their liquidity more effectively by converting between fiat and stablecoins with greater speed and lower friction. Increased Transparency: Blockchain-based transactions offer an immutable record, enhancing transparency and traceability, which is vital for compliance and auditing purposes. Financial Inclusion: By making digital finance more accessible and efficient, RLUSD can indirectly support broader financial inclusion, allowing more businesses to participate in the global economy. These advantages are critical for businesses looking to expand, streamline operations, and leverage the growing digital economy in Africa. Navigating the Future: Opportunities and Potential Impact of Ripple RLUSD While the opportunities for Ripple RLUSD in Africa are immense, the journey will involve navigating various market dynamics. Regulatory frameworks are still evolving across different African nations, and adapting to these diverse environments will be key. However, the clear demand for modern financial solutions and the strong local partnerships position Ripple favorably. The move to support RLUSD in Africa is a bold step towards integrating the continent more deeply into the global digital economy. It represents a commitment to leveraging blockchain technology to solve real-world financial challenges, potentially setting a new standard for institutional digital asset adoption. In conclusion, Ripple’s strategic push to introduce Ripple RLUSD to institutional clients in Africa, backed by powerful local partnerships, marks a pivotal moment.

The price is now trading above $200 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $207 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $212 resistance zone. Solana Price Faces Resistance Solana price started a decent increase from the $194-$195 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL was able to climb above the $200 and $202 resistance levels. There was a clear move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $218 swing high to the $194 low. However, the bears seem to be active near the $212 resistance zone. The price reacted to the downside below $210. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $207 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. Solana is now trading above $204 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2102 level. The next major resistance is near the $212 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $218 swing high to the $194 low. The main resistance could be $218. A successful close above the $218 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $232. Any more gains might send the price toward the $245 level. Another Decline In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $212 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $204 zone. The first major support is near the $200 level. A break below the $200 level might send the price toward the $195 support zone. If there is a close below the $195 support, the price could decline toward the $184 support in the near term.

The high-level gathering will follow a separate event on artificial intelligence hosted earlier in the day by First Lady Melania Trump. The dinner is being labeled the administration’s inaugural tech-policy dinner, according to information confirmed by a White House official. The confirmed guest list includes Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, and OpenAI founder Sam Altman. Each of them is expected to attend this private meeting, which is invitation-only. A broader list includes Greg Brockman, who is president of OpenAI, Sergey Brin from Google, Shyam Sankar from Palantir, and Alexandr Wang, who co-founded Scale AI and now leads a superintelligence group at Meta. Trump excludes Elon while bringing in crypto czar and reshoring allies Also attending are Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella, Oracle’s Safra Catz, and Micron Technology’s David Limp. All of these names have either aligned themselves with Trump’s second-term economic reshoring agenda or played roles in past administration-led announcements on emerging technologies. David Sacks, a venture capitalist who now holds the title of White House crypto and AI czar, is expected to be seated at the table. Also attending is Jared Isaacman, founder of Shift4, despite the fact that Trump canceled his NASA nomination back in June without explanation. One person not attending is Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, who was notably excluded from the invitation list. Elon previously held a position as a special government employee in the early months of Trump’s current term and later ran the administration’s DOGE office, focused on crypto, before resigning in May. Trump explains Elon’s absence and addresses personal feud on-air When asked about the snub during a phone interview on The Scott Jennings Show , recorded Tuesday and aired Wednesday, Trump didn’t dodge. “He’s got 80% super genius, and then 20% he’s got some problems. And when he works out the 20%, he’ll be great,” Trump said. He continued, “I always liked him. I like him now. But he went off the reservation and he wished he didn’t do it.” Trump described Elon as “a man of common sense” and “a good man,” then added, “I don’t think he has a choice. What’s he gonna do? He’s gonna go with the radical left lunatics? They’re lunatics.” Elon reportedly contributed at least $277 million to support Trump and other Republican campaigns. He later took credit for Trump’s 2024 victory and the GOP’s Senate edge. In a June 5 post on X, Elon claimed, “Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House, and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate.” He followed that with “Such ingratitude.” The feud escalated after Elon publicly slammed the administration’s latest tax legislation, nicknamed the “Big Beautiful Bill,” which had passed earlier in the year. On social media, Elon called it a “MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK.” In response, Trump initially floated the idea of terminating government contracts tied to Elon’s companies. But during a press interaction in June, he toned things down. “Look, I wish him well. You understand? We had a good relationship, and I just wish him well.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",Tech|Apple|OpenAI|SpaceX|Tesla,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-04 05:50:36

China's markets, however, lagged behind, with benchmarks falling on reports that regulators are considering new rules to curb speculation. Elsewhere, the US dollar struggles after weaker July JOLTS job openings, with traders now eyeing weekly jobless claims, ADP employment data, and the ISM Services PMI later. Silver slipped 1% to around $40.7 per ounce on Thursday, easing from 14-year highs. Gold dipped to around $3,540 per ounce on Thursday, pausing its longest winning streak since March but remaining at record highs. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 1.56% to above 42,400 while the broader Topix Index added 0.7% to 3,070 on Thursday. The Japanese yen strengthened past 148 per dollar on Thursday, recovering from the prior session’s losses. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 1.44% to below 3,770 while the Shenzhen Component slid 2.2% to 12,200 on Thursday, marking a third straight decline as artificial intelligence and semiconductor shares came under heavy selling pressure. Chinese regulators are weighing measures to cool the stock market after a strong rally since early August, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday. Furthermore, China has imposed new tariffs on certain U.S. optical fiber products following a six-month probe that concluded American exporters were evading existing anti-dumping rules. The levies, set between 33.3% and 78.2%, took effect Thursday in Beijing on “certain cut-off shifted single-mode optical fiber,” the Ministry of Commerce said. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 1.17% to 25,100 in Thursday morning deals, marking the third straight decline amid broad-based sector losses. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.42% to 80,958 in morning trade on Thursday, extending gains from the previous session after the Goods and Services Tax Council approved a major overhaul of the GST regime. The new GST rate structure, set to take effect on September 22, aims to boost domestic consumption and offset the impact of the recently imposed 50% US tariffs. India's free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association will come into effect on October 1, according to a statement by Switzerland, as reported by the Economic Times. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.97% to above 8,805 on Thursday, snapping a four-session losing streak, as heavyweight miners and gold stocks advanced on firmer commodity prices. The Australian dollar was little changed at around $0.654 on Thursday, holding its recent gains, supported by stronger-than-expected trade balance figures. Australia's trade surplus expanded significantly in July, reaching A$7.31 billion. The surge was driven by rising exports, which increased by 3.3%, combined with a decline in imports, which fell by 1.3%. At the same time, household spending climbed 5.1% year-on-year in July, the highest growth since November 2023, following a 4.6% rise in June. On Wednesday, RBA Governor Michele Bullock warned that further interest rate cuts may be unlikely if consumer spending continues to rise rapidly. In the U.S. on Wednesday, all three major indexes ended mostly higher as tech strength offset broader market weakness, with investors weighing a favorable antitrust ruling for Google against signs of labor market softening. U.S. stock futures held firm on Thursday following a mixed performance on Wall Street: Dow -0.11% ; S&P 500 +0.07% ; Nasdaq +0.14% .

Hoskinson Shares IOG Audit Results,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano-ada-redemption-controversy-over-hoskinson-shares-iog-audit-results/,"Following the controversial accusations, the results of the third-party forensic review of the Cardano (ADA) voucher redemption program have been made public. Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, says he’s now “waiting for the apologies to come rolling in.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Attempts $111,000 Reclaim, But Last Leg Up Could Be Weeks Away – Analyst Cardano Accusations Have ‘No Basis’ On Wednesday, the Cardano community celebrated after the third-party forensic review of the ADA voucher redemption program was published. The investigative report, conducted by law firm McDermott Will & Schulte and the audit firm BDO, determined that the allegations against Input Output Global (IOG) don’t have any foundation. “After review of tens of thousands of documents, a forensic on-chain and traditional forensic analysis, and eighteen formal interviews of current employees, former employees, Voucher Holders, service providers, community members, and other third parties, the Investigation determined that each of the allegations related to the Topics of Investigation do not have any basis,” the report reads. Public accusations included five main allegations, including that insiders stole or misused ADA that should have been allocated to voucher holders and that there were improper sale tactics related to the voucher program. The claims also accused Cardano blockchain upgrades of being designed to make voucher redemption difficult, and deleted voucher holders’ “private keys” or assets. Lastly, the allegation that Cardano insiders had no legal right to send unredeemed ADA to CDH and decide how to spend it. The controversy emerged in May, when Non-Fungible Token (NFT) artist Masato Alexander alleged that Charles Hoskinson had “unilaterally used his genesis keys to REWRITE the Cardano ledger” during the Allegra hard fork in 2021 to take control of 318-350 million ADA, about 0.2 percent of the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) allocation that remained unclaimed years after launch. Hoskinson denied Alexander’s claims, arguing that 99.8% of the vouchers sold were redeemed by their original buyers, while the remaining 0.2% were “returned to the TGE and donated to Intersect through the same process that funded the Cardano Foundation.” The Review Findings Based on the Investigation, McDermott Will & Schulte and BDO found that the sources of the public allegations against IOG and Charles Hoskinson didn’t originate from unredeemed voucher holders, and they “did not identify evidence indicating that Input Output or Sawyers turned away any potential Voucher Holder who possessed a valid Voucher.” Additionally, they concluded that reasonable guardrails were implemented to prevent deceptive marketing and sales tactics, noting that the program was not designed to exploit the elderly. The audit also revealed that 97.3% of all the vouchers, or 98.8% of the ADA allocated, were redeemed on-chain during the Byron era, and “substantial efforts were undertaken to cause Voucher Holders to redeem on-chain” at the time. As of August 15, 2025, 99.2% of Vouchers consisting of 99.7% of all ada sold pursuant to the Voucher Program have been redeemed through the on-chain redemptions and Post-Sweep Redemption Project. Meanwhile, the review highlighted that the voucher certificates contained redemption codes instead of “private keys,” refuting the accusation that these keys were later deleted. It also concluded that Cardano insiders did not misappropriate the staking rewards from the unredeemed ADA. Time To Move On, Says Hoskinson Hoskinson went on X Space to share the audit result, reading the announcement of IOG’s Chief Legal Officer & Chief Policy Officer, Joel Telpner, and the executive summary of the 128-page document. Cardano’s founder said that it’s been a “deeply frustrating” process, noting that “It’s one thing to attack my intelligence, my physical appearance, my business acumen, my integrity. It’s another thing to accuse me of a crime.” Related Reading: No Ethereum Rally Until Q4? Analyst Eyes Choppy September Before New Highs “This is over. And for the people who stirred this pot: do the right thing, and just apologize. Have some common fucking decency as a human being. Apologize. Let’s just all move on, say you were wrong. Have enough integrity to do that,” he asked. Hoskinson shared his hope that most people will realize that the accusations were taken “too far,” concluding that “Hopefully, we can now just put this nightmare behind us.” Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",Cryptocurrency Market News|ADA|ADAUSDT|Cardano|Cardano audit|Cardano Controversy|Charles Hoskinson|Charles Hoskinson Cardano|crypto community|Input-Output Global (IOG)|Joel Telpner,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ADA|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-09-04 06:00:19
51165215,573731,1756965621,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51165215.jpeg,Bitcoin Treasury Firm Supported By Winklevoss Twins Announces Upcoming IPO,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-treasury-firm-winklevoss-twins-announce-ipo/,"In a notable trend this year, crypto-focused companies are increasingly seeking to go public. The latest entrant to this wave is a newly established Bitcoin treasury firm backed by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, which is preparing for a public listing in Amsterdam. Treasury Plans Amsterdam Debut According to a report by Reuters, the Netherlands-based firm, named Treasury, has announced plans to list on the Amsterdam stock exchange through a reverse merger with Dutch investment firm MKB Nedsense. This move is said to allow Treasury to access public markets more quickly and efficiently. The company recently raised €126 million (approximately $147 million) in a private funding round led by Winklevoss Capital and Nakamoto Holdings, indicating strong backing from notable investors. The reverse listing is expected to provide a significant premium, reflecting a 72% increase over MKBN’s closing share price of €0.7 as of July 11. Both companies aim to achieve a post-consolidation share price of €2.10. To finalize this process, MKBN will hold an extraordinary shareholders meeting to approve the transaction. Following the successful completion, MKBN will be rebranded as “Treasury N.V.” and will trade under the ticker symbol “TRSR.” This move follows a broader trend in the Dutch market, where local crypto firm Amdax announced its plans in August to launch a Bitcoin treasury company named AMBTS on Euronext Amsterdam. Bitcoin treasury companies, like Treasury, hold Bitcoin reserves as their primary assets, differentiating them from traditional firms that typically hold cash. This model allows them to focus on accumulating and retaining Bitcoin over the long term. A prominent example of this strategy is Michael Saylor’s company, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which has continually added to its Bitcoin holdings on weekly basis, resulting in significant unrealized profits for the company so far. Treasury has already amassed over 1,000 Bitcoin, which pales in comparison to Strategy’s stash of 636,000 Bitcoin, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net data . However, it is positioning itself to attract investors in a region where crypto options are relatively limited compared to those in the United States. Gemini’s Upcoming IPO In addition to their new venture, the Winklevoss twins are also preparing crypto exchange Gemini for an initial public offering (IPO) in the US. As reported by Bitcoinist on Tuesday, they are targeting a valuation of up to $2.22 billion, with plans to offer 16.67 million shares priced between $17 and $19 each under the ticker “GEMI.” If successful, this IPO could raise approximately $317 million at the upper end of the pricing range, making Gemini the third publicly traded digital asset exchange, following the successful launches of Bullish and Coinbase.

At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention for trading under $0.004 and being talked about as a stronger play for those seeking 20x returns. Elon Musk’s Lawyer Leads Dogecoin Treasury Plans Elon Musk’s personal lawyer, Alex Spiro, has been named chairman of a new public company aiming to create a Dogecoin treasury worth $200 million . According to reports, the House of Doge has approved the treasury as the official corporate vehicle behind DOGE, making it one of the largest steps toward institutional recognition for the memecoin. The new setup is fueling renewed conversations among traders about Dogecoin’s upside. With DOGE already trading in a relatively tight range this year, many analysts argue that a successful treasury launch backed by Musk’s circle could act as a catalyst for the token. Some forecasts point to the possibility of Dogecoin delivering a 20x ROI , should institutional demand and retail interest align around the treasury project. Dogecoin’s history shows how sensitive it is to Musk’s influence. His public endorsements have often led to quick price moves, cementing DOGE’s reputation as the meme coin most closely tied to mainstream recognition. With the treasury plans underway and investors watching Musk’s next steps, speculation is rising on whether DOGE could once again enter a new growth phase. Why Dogecoin Matters to Traders Since its creation in 2013, Dogecoin has consistently held its place as the leading meme coin by market value. The token’s movements often mirror public hype, making it attractive for short-term traders who thrive on volatility. Now, with corporate-backed funds and treasury projects in play, Dogecoin is finding a new narrative. Institutions seeking exposure to memecoins are beginning to create structured vehicles that make DOGE accessible without direct ownership. This trend is reshaping how traditional investors can access the meme coin market. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Altcoin Trading Under $0.005 With Stronger 20x Outlook While Dogecoin garners attention from Musk’s orbit, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being discussed as a fresher alternative for those looking ahead. Currently trading under $0.005 , this altcoin combines meme coin appeal with real DeFi utility — giving it fundamentals that DOGE lacks. Analysts tracking new projects have pointed out that MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver 20x gains before Dogecoin , given its utility-first design and early pricing. For traders shifting focus away from crowded meme coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a mix of early entry pricing and a story built around more than just hype. With a community-first structure and transparent setup, it is quickly becoming the coin that investors are curious to learn more about — especially those looking for the “next Dogecoin” but with added fundamentals. What Traders Should Do Next Dogecoin’s treasury plan under Alex Spiro is likely to keep it in headlines, but traders looking for higher upside should consider diversifying into new altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as one trading under $0.005, with a case for stronger 20x growth compared to DOGE. Those aiming to position early should review the project now before wider attention builds.

Bloomberg data shows that more than a dozen XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been filed this year, including seven spot products that remain under review. Market observers argue that these pending approvals could represent one of the most important developments for XRP’s long-term price trajectory. Institutional Interest Already Growing Even before a decision on spot products, investor interest in XRP-linked funds has accelerated. Teucrium’s XRP ETF, a leveraged product, has become the firm’s best-performing fund in its 16-year history, attracting over $300 million in inflows within three months of launch . This momentum suggests that spot ETFs, if approved, could see even greater demand given their direct exposure to XRP. Demand is also evident in derivatives markets. Futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) have seen rapid growth, with XRP becoming the fastest cryptocurrency to reach $1 billion in open interest, surpassing both Bitcoin and Ethereum on that metric. Analysts view this as a sign that institutional participants are prepared to scale their involvement if easier investment vehicles, such as spot ETFs, become available. Expectations for XRP ETF Inflows Industry leaders have begun to outline possible inflow scenarios. Steven McClurg, Chief Executive Officer of Canary Capital, recently suggested that up to $5 billion could enter XRP ETFs within their first month of trading. He also argued that XRP spot ETFs might outperform Ethereum ETFs in terms of early adoption. If such forecasts prove correct, XRP could benefit from a surge of institutional capital rarely seen outside of the largest digital assets. Presently, XRP trades at $2.71 with a market capitalization of $163.1 billion. For the token to reach substantially higher levels, it would require significant new demand, precisely what proponents expect ETFs to generate. Still, the scale of inflows will depend on wider market conditions, investor sentiment, and global liquidity trends. XRP Price by December 2025 if ETFs Are Approved To possible projections , Gemini AI was asked to model a scenario where all pending spot ETFs gain approval by their October deadlines. The analysis suggested that widespread approval could serve as a turning point, providing institutional investors, including pension funds, hedge funds, and asset managers, with a regulated avenue for XRP exposure. According to the model, ETF issuers would need to purchase large amounts of XRP to back their funds, which could apply upward pressure on the price. Additionally, extensive media coverage and renewed retail enthusiasm could reinforce this demand. Based on these assumptions, Gemini projected that XRP could reach between $10 and $16 by December 2025. A price in this range would push XRP’s market capitalization above $500 billion, potentially placing it among the top three cryptocurrencies by value. While the outlook is encouraging, analysts caution that the projection remains speculative. Market performance will ultimately hinge on a range of factors, including regulatory developments, global financial conditions, and overall trends in digital assets. The ETF approvals themselves may not guarantee a lasting rally if broader economic pressures weigh on investor appetite. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 October 2025 could be a decisive moment for XRP. If the SEC grants approval to all pending spot ETFs, the influx of institutional participation has the potential to drive prices significantly higher. However, investors are reminded that outcomes remain uncertain and that long-term success will depend on sustained demand beyond the initial launch period.

According to the company's assessment, on August 13th, the MVRV Z-Score returned to its March 2024 levels. Ethereum hadn't performed strongly during that period. The MVRV Z-Score measures the difference between market value and realized value, adjusting for historical volatility. This metric is used to identify both periods of market enthusiasm and attractive accumulation opportunities for long-term investors. Related News: Expert Analyst Claims Bitcoin Will “First Fall to $100,000,” Then Shares What They Expect Next According to data shared by Alphractal, the metric is currently trading below the on-chain “indecision zone.” Historically, this zone has acted as both a resistance and pullback area depending on whether the market is bullish or bearish. For a more optimistic outlook, the indicator needs to surpass its August peak of 1.33. However, the MVRV Z-Score, currently at 0.9, suggests that Ethereum may face sideways consolidation and selling pressure in the short term. *This is not investment advice.

In 2027, it will range between $146.30 and $173.73, with an average price of $160.02. In 2031, it will range between $329.18 and $356.61, with an average price of $342.89. Hyperliquid is a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) . It has its own Layer 1 blockchain, and HYPE is its native token, which is used for staking, governance, and payments within the ecosystem. One of the key features of Hyperliquid, along with its high-speed platform, is that it offers crypto perpetual futures for trading by its users without the need to own the asset. The platform supports a number of cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to BTC, ETH, SUI, AVAX, and SOL, to name a few. Technically, the Hyperliquid blockchain is based on two protocols, namely HyperEVM and HyperBFT; combined, they help provide high-speed trading and Ethereum-based smart contracts with reliability to support the Hyperliquid ecosystem. The Hyperliquid platform revolves around community participation, as token holders have voting rights to govern and influence developments taking place on the platform. On November 29, 2024, Hyperliquid conducted an airdrop of its native token, HYPE, but unlike other players, it was selective in allocating the airdrop to only 94,000 users with an average value of $45,000 to $50,000, making it one of the most worthy airdrops in crypto history. Let’s take a deep dive into what the future holds for the HYPE token in Cryptopolitan’s Hyperliquid price prediction for 2025 and beyond.

According to an overall analysis, the currency has lost 1.11% of its value today. Technical indicators give bullish signals, but the price charts also showcase a bearish market scenario at the time of writing. Why is Hyperliquid down? The cryptocurrency market is shedding, and HYPE is receiving the same sentiment. Moreover, it is encouraging that HYPE marked a new ATH on August 27, 2025. From a broader perspective, the HYPE price decreased to $45.48, losing 1.11% of its total value in the last few hours, but it is still trending near its ATH. Is Hyperliquid a Good Investment? HYPE has growing utility, and its Ethereum compatibility helps it steal a share of DeFi industry. While the technical analysis can change from bullish to bearish, price predictions paint a different picture. However, a risk analysis is recommended. Will Hyperliquid reach $50? The current price action does justify predicting a $50 target. In the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, but if the token maintains its price levels, a rally can be initiated. It can be expected that HYPE will reach above $50 by any time in 2025. Can Hyperliquid Coin reach $100? According to Hyperliquid price prediction, HYPE price might surpass $100 in 2026. The highest price HYPE could attain that year is expected to be above $114.30. Will Hyperliquid reach $500? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, Hyperliquid may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will Hyperliquid reach $1000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, Hyperliquid is unlikely to reach $1000 before 2031. How high can Hyperliquid go? The highest expected price for Hyperliquid is $303.53, which it will achieve in 2031. Does Hyperliquid have a good long-term future? Hyperliquid is trading higher than its December 2024 price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current price and a favorable future valuation of $356.61 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

However, you should note that HYPE is still quite volatile. Negative market sentiment, such as market crashes, could derail the predictions. Hyperliquid Historic Price Sentiment Hyperliquid price history: Coingecko The native token of Hyperliquid, called HYPE, was launched on November 29, 2024, through an airdrop targeted at a limited number of only 94,000 users. This was one of the most lucrative airdrops, with an average allocation of value of $45,000 to $50,000. Hyperliquid kept away from venture capitalists, who usually get most of the tokens in usual airdrops; rather, 76% of the supply was slated for user-centric initiatives. Usually, tokens dump after airdrops until the market momentum picks up, but Hyperliquid’s approach helped garner trust, and the token jumped from $4 to $35 from November 2024 to December 22, 2024. Hyperliquid’s market cap improved during this period, reaching above $8 billion, showing significant growth, as it received super positive market sentiment. In late December and early January 2025, the HYPE token corrected down to $20.24, shedding significant value as per crypto market data. Price stabilized through February as it traded in a range of $19.92 to $27.42 before taking a dive at the end of February, when the broader trend turned bearish again. HYPE stumbled to $12.34 by mid-March, and it touched a low of $10.21 on April 7, 2025. The token saw nothing but improvement in the remainder of the month of April, and its price surged to $18.57 by the end of the month. On June 16, 2025, HYPE reached an all-time high of $45.57. A month later, on July 14, it marked another all-time high of $49.75, and on August 27, it marked its current ATH of $50.99 with changing market dynamics. At the start of September, HYPE is trading near $45.",Crypto Price Predictions|HYPE|Hyperliquid,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|AIRDROP|ETH|ALTCOIN|USDC|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-04 07:20:00

A truly rare Bitcoin buy signal is potentially on the horizon, one that has only emerged twice before in past bear markets. This could represent a significant development for investors and the broader cryptocurrency community. Unpacking the Crucial Bitcoin Buy Signal According to an insightful analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost, a powerful on-chain indicator is flashing green. This indicator is the Binance Bitcoin/stablecoin ratio. Historically, when this ratio approaches one, it has acted as a very rare Bitcoin buy signal . What exactly does this mean? A ratio close to one signifies that the volume of Bitcoin and stablecoins held on Binance is nearly equal. This suggests a unique market dynamic: a substantial amount of stablecoins have flowed into the exchange, yet this capital has not yet been heavily concentrated into Bitcoin. Darkfost further highlighted that Binance’s holdings of ERC-20 stablecoins have reached an unprecedented record high of $37.8 billion. This massive pool of stablecoins represents significant latent buying power, poised to potentially enter the Bitcoin market. A Glimpse into the Past: Historic Accuracy of This Bitcoin Buy Signal The historical context of this indicator is particularly compelling. The same Bitcoin buy signal appeared just last March. What followed was a remarkable market rebound, with Bitcoin surging from a retreat to $78,000 to establish a new all-time high of $123,000. This previous instance underscores the potential significance of the current observation. While past performance is never a guarantee of future results, the rarity and historical accuracy of this specific indicator warrant serious attention from investors. Benefit: The potential for a significant upside if historical patterns repeat. Rarity: This signal has appeared only twice before in past bear markets, making its current emergence highly notable. What Does This Imminent Bitcoin Buy Signal Mean for You? The potential re-emergence of this strong Bitcoin buy signal offers a fascinating perspective on current market dynamics. It suggests that despite recent price movements, there is considerable capital waiting on the sidelines, ready to be deployed into Bitcoin. However, it is crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile. While on-chain indicators provide valuable insights, they should be part of a broader investment strategy. Always conduct your own thorough research and consider your risk tolerance. Actionable Insight: This indicator suggests a potential accumulation phase for Bitcoin, backed by significant stablecoin reserves. Challenges: Market volatility and unforeseen global economic factors can always influence price action. The current environment, with record stablecoin holdings on Binance, indicates a robust potential for demand. This could pave the way for an interesting period in Bitcoin’s price trajectory. In conclusion, the potential return of this rare Bitcoin buy signal is a compelling development for the crypto community. While it is not financial advice, the historical accuracy of this specific indicator, as highlighted by CryptoQuant, suggests a unique opportunity. Investors should remain informed and consider how this on-chain data fits into their overall market outlook. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Binance Bitcoin/stablecoin ratio? This ratio compares the amount of Bitcoin held on Binance to the amount of stablecoins. A ratio approaching one indicates that the volumes are nearly equal, suggesting significant stablecoin inflow without immediate conversion to Bitcoin. Who is Darkfost from CryptoQuant? Darkfost is a contributor to CryptoQuant, an on-chain analytics platform. Analysts like Darkfost use various data points from blockchain networks and exchanges to provide insights into market trends and potential price movements. How accurate has this Bitcoin buy signal been historically? Historically, this specific indicator has appeared only twice before in past bear markets, and each time it preceded a significant rebound in Bitcoin’s price, including a notable surge from $78,000 to $123,000 in March. Does this signal guarantee a Bitcoin price increase? No, no indicator can guarantee future price movements. While this Bitcoin buy signal has a strong historical track record, the crypto market is complex and influenced by many factors. It serves as a strong indicator, not a definitive prediction. What are ERC-20 stablecoins? ERC-20 stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. They are built on the Ethereum blockchain (ERC-20 standard) and are commonly used by traders to enter and exit positions or to hold value without exposure to crypto volatility.

According to a post by Alpha Crypto Signal, “If this breakdown confirms, $PEPE can slide toward the 0.0000085 – 0.0000080 zone next.” Trading Volume and Liquidation Trends Data shows a 15% decrease in trading volume, now at $980 million. Open interest is also down by 4%, sitting at $535 million. These drops suggest fewer active positions in the market, often a sign of reduced participation before a larger move. On the liquidation side, long positions have taken the brunt of recent moves. Long liquidations totaled over $326K, while shorts accounted for only $9,900. OKX was the exchange with the highest long liquidations at $288,300. Source: Coingass Other platforms like HTX, CoinEx, and Gate registered smaller numbers. The imbalance points to the fact that buyers were losing on trades, whereas sellers were seemingly unaffected. On-Chain Activity Continues to Decline As of August 3, PEPE recorded 2,599 active addresses, continuing a broader downward trend in such activity that began in late 2024. Daily active addresses reached a high of nearly 27,500 in November 2024 during a price rally. Since then, both the address count and price have dropped. Throughout 2025, active wallets have remained below the zone of 5,000, essentially witnessing a decline in user activity on the network. Source: Glassnode Meanwhile, the symmetrical triangle pattern comes close to testing. The next area to watch will be around $0.0000085 and $0.0000080 if the price breaks through the support line at $0.0000095, followed by strong volume. A recovery above $0.0000115 is needed to change the current setup. Until then, trading volume, liquidation data, and on-chain usage continue to promote a cautious outlook for the token.

If you’re involved in digital assets, you’ll want to pay close attention to the recent announcement concerning the MixMarvel delisting . This development from a major exchange like Bithumb often signals important shifts for investors and the broader market. What Prompted the MixMarvel Delisting by Bithumb? South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb recently confirmed a significant decision: it will officially delist MixMarvel (MIX) on October 13 at 6:00 a.m. UTC. This isn’t a snap judgment; it follows a thorough review process. Bithumb initially placed MIX on its investment warning list, giving the project time to address concerns. The core issue, according to Bithumb, was the ""insufficient explanatory materials"" provided by the MixMarvel project foundation. These materials were meant to clarify the reasons for the initial warning. After a comprehensive re-evaluation, Bithumb determined that MixMarvel no longer met the essential criteria for continued trading support. This review focused on several critical areas: Project Disclosures: Transparency and clear communication are vital in the crypto space. Business Viability: The long-term operational health and financial stability of the project. Sustainability: The ability of the project to maintain its ecosystem and development over time. Ultimately, Bithumb concluded that these aspects were not adequately addressed, leading to the unfortunate MixMarvel delisting . Understanding the Impact of a Crypto Delisting A delisting, especially from a prominent exchange like Bithumb, can send ripples through the crypto community. For holders of MIX tokens, this news is particularly critical. When an asset is delisted, it typically means: Reduced Liquidity: It becomes harder to buy or sell the token on major platforms. Price Volatility: The token’s price often experiences significant downward pressure due to panic selling and reduced demand. Limited Trading Options: Investors may need to transfer their tokens to other, potentially smaller or less secure, exchanges that still support MIX, or to a personal wallet. This event underscores the importance of due diligence for all crypto investors. Exchanges act as gatekeepers, aiming to protect their users from projects that may not be sustainable or transparent. The MixMarvel delisting serves as a stark reminder of these risks. What Should MixMarvel (MIX) Holders Do Now? If you currently hold MixMarvel (MIX) tokens, taking immediate action is crucial. Here are some actionable insights: Check Bithumb’s Official Announcement: Always refer to the exchange’s direct communication for precise deadlines and instructions. Consider Your Options: You might choose to sell your MIX tokens before the delisting deadline. Alternatively, you could transfer them to a personal wallet or another exchange that still supports MIX. Research any alternative platforms thoroughly. Do Not Procrastinate: Missing the delisting deadline could result in your funds becoming inaccessible or difficult to recover on Bithumb. Remember, the responsibility for managing your assets ultimately rests with you. Staying informed about your investments and the platforms you use is paramount. This Bithumb delisting highlights the dynamic nature of the crypto market. Navigating Future Crypto Investments Post-MixMarvel Delisting The situation with the MixMarvel delisting offers valuable lessons for all crypto enthusiasts. When evaluating potential investments, consider these factors: Project Fundamentals: Look beyond hype. Investigate the team, technology, use case, and roadmap. Transparency: Does the project communicate openly and provide regular updates? Are their financial disclosures clear? Exchange Listings: While being listed on major exchanges is a positive sign, understand that these listings are not permanent. Exchanges regularly review assets. Community Engagement: A healthy, active community can be an indicator of a project’s vitality. By adopting a cautious and informed approach, investors can better navigate the volatile crypto landscape and potentially avoid similar scenarios. The market constantly evolves, and vigilance is key to successful participation. In conclusion, Bithumb’s decision to proceed with the MixMarvel delisting on October 13 underscores the rigorous standards exchanges maintain for listed assets. This move serves as a critical reminder for investors about the importance of project viability, transparency, and the inherent risks in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency. Staying informed and proactive is essential for protecting your digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why did Bithumb delist MixMarvel (MIX)? A1: Bithumb delisted MixMarvel (MIX) because the project foundation provided insufficient explanatory materials to address concerns after being placed on an investment warning list. A comprehensive review found the project lacking in disclosures, business viability, and sustainability. Q2: When will the MixMarvel delisting officially take place? A2: The official delisting of MixMarvel (MIX) from Bithumb is scheduled for October 13 at 6:00 a.m. UTC. Q3: What does a delisting mean for current MIX token holders? A3: For current MIX holders, a delisting typically means reduced liquidity, potential price volatility, and limited trading options on major exchanges. Holders will need to sell their tokens before the deadline or transfer them to a personal wallet or another exchange that still supports MIX. Q4: How can investors protect themselves from similar delisting risks? A4: Investors can protect themselves by thoroughly researching project fundamentals, assessing transparency, understanding that exchange listings are not permanent, and monitoring community engagement. Always stay informed about your investments and the platforms you use. Q5: Are all delistings due to project failures? A5: Not necessarily. While many delistings are due to projects failing to meet exchange criteria (as in the MixMarvel delisting case), some can also occur due to low trading volume, regulatory changes, or a project’s strategic decision to move to other platforms. However, insufficient project viability is a common reason. If you found this insight into the MixMarvel delisting valuable, please share this article with your network.

According to top experts, its potential for wealth-building might be stronger than that of meme-coin giant Shiba Inu (SHIB). Mutuum Finance’s presale is live right now at stage 6 with tokens at $0.035. The project has already recorded more than $15.31 million in raise and acquired more than 16,000 token holders. As the cryptocurrency market continues to migrate towards more utility-driven ecosystems, Mutuum Finance wins. While Shiba Inu sits in the cultural and speculative highlight reel, Mutuum Finance’s lending and liquidity protocols are gaining the attention of both seasoned investors and institutional buyers. Shiba Inu Forecast: Mild Mid-Term Appreciation Expected Under Gentle Sentiment Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading around $0.00001237. Analysts estimate that by the start of October 2025, SHIB would appreciate around 5%, possibly to around $0.00001298. Estimations on a monthly basis suggest a broader range of $0.00001207 to $0.00001587, taking probable upside to 28% in the month into account. Overall, SHIB’s future is muted and range-bound, subject to the overall market dynamics and ecosystem expansion, as investor interest gradually focuses on emerging DeFi platforms such as Mutuum Finance. Stage 6 Presale Live with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance has already made waves in the DeFi arena by securing more than 16,000 investors and raising more than $15.31 million in presale. The project is also conducting a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program for improving security on the platform and further stimulating community engagement, with rewards divided into four levels of risk: critical, major, minor and low. Interest Rate Models When money is abundant, the rates are kept low in MUTM to keep borrowing cheap; however, when money is scarce, the rates are raised, in an effort to make borrowing less attractive and therefore more desirable to borrowers to repay borrowings or to place deposits. Stable rates, as a rule, are higher than variable rates but do not fluctuate unless there is a significant level of volatility in the market. Mutuum Finance Excites investors with a Giveaway Ten lucky investors get to walk away with $10k each as part of an ongoing $100,000 giveaway . This makes it more exciting for existing investors and new investors to join the platform. Mutuum Finance’s lending model is built with 2 characteristics in focus, flexibility and efficiency. A Peer-to-Contract model utilizes smart contracts to facilitate automated lending with zero human intervention. Market dynamics are used for deducting facts while keeping the rate structure the same. The Peer-to-Peer model lets lenders and borrowers get connected directly without middlemen, making it suitable for meme coins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also gaining momentum, with analysts highlighting its greater wealth potential compared to Shiba Inu (SHIB). Stage 6 of presale is live at $0.035, and a raised figure of over $15.31 million is already accompanied by 16,000+ token holders on board. Early adopters can gain substantial upside as demand accelerates ahead of the next price increase. While SHIB’s short-term potential realizes a 5%–28% potential gain, Mutuum Finance offers a use-case-driven solution in its dual lending architecture, $50,000 CertiK bug bounty, and $100,000 community giveaway. With the market shifting in direction of projects with real-world DeFi applications, now is the right moment to invest in MUTM tokens before the next presale phase that will drive the price even higher.

Naturally, this volatility has spurred a wave of trading as crypto traders see this as a time of opportunity due to the fluctuations. The result of this has been a rapid rise in the open interest of both Bitcoin and Ethereum during this time. While this, on its own, is significant, looking at the previous performances, it could suggest where the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are headed next. Bitcoin And Ethereum Open Interest Remain Very High Toward the end of the month of August, the Ethereum price began rising rapidly, fueled by large buys from Ethereum treasury companies such as Bitmine and SharpLink. This push would eventually see the Ethereum price reach a brand new all-time high, beating out its $4,800 peak from 2021 after climbing above $4,950. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Descending Channel Breakout Shows Where Price Is Headed Next In the same vein, the open interest had risen rapidly, and this metric, too, rose to new all-time highs. By August 23, amid the frenzy, the Ethereum open interest climbed above $70 billion for the first time in history, marking a major milestone. Since then, the Ethereum open interest has retraced. But it is still sitting above $55 billion at the time of this writing, suggesting that interest in the altcoin is still high. While the Bitcoin open interest did not hit new peaks in the month of August like Ethereum, it also remained at very high levels. Data from Coinglass shows that the Bitcoin open interest is still averaging at a high $80 billion, still close to the $86 billion all-time high that was recorded back in July. What The Open Interest At ATHs Could Mean Looking at previous performances when the Bitcoin and Ethereum open interest have been at all-time high levels, there is usually a period of consolidation that follows, especially as price retraces. This was seen after the first all-time highs of the year back in February, which was followed by a few months of consolidation. Related Reading: Ethereum price Crash To $4,081: Why The Bears Are In Charge Then again, the peaks in June were followed by short consolidations, which ended in July. And then, another consolidation before the open interest started to rebound in August. This shows that the period of consolidation is not always long, but at the end of it is always another rise in open interest that coincides with a rise in price. From here, if the Bitcoin and Ethereum open interest were to hit new peaks, it would probably mean that their prices are ready to hit new highs as well. Following the trend of the last few months, the open interest could start to pick up again toward the end of September, propelled forward by price recoveries.

It has already held quite well during the recent market downtrend and continues to flash bullish signals during this time. To buttress the bullishness of the SHIB price, crypto analyst Javon Marks has highlighted the confirmation of a bullish pattern. In the event that such a pattern holds and plays out, it could mean new all-time highs for the Shiba Inu price. The Bullish Divergence That Could Send Shiba Inu Price To ATHs In his analysis, Marks pointed out the bullish pattern that has now set the Shiba Inu price on a path to possible new all-time highs. A regular bull divergence had appeared on the MACD histogram, suggesting that the Shiba Inu price may be primed for another reversal. If this reversal does play out, then the first thing for the Shiba Inu price is for it to double . This would quickly put it above $0.00002, which would turn this resistance level into support. In total, the crypto analyst expects the first leg of the recovery to actually reach a 163% gain. This would inevitably help it break the resistance at $0.00003, leading into the next leg of the move. After this move is completed, the analyst expects the Shiba Inu price to keep rising after breaking out of an older structure . Besides the initial 163% run, the Shiba Inu price would still more than double by this point, making it only a part of the total move. A 570% move is expected with a continuation of the bullish momentum, and this would put the price above $0.000081. This target is what pushes the Shiba Inu price toward the new all-time highs and is essential for the total bullish move. Beyond this, though, there is the possibility that the bullish move would actually continue. Going by the analyst’s chart, there could be an almost 100% increase from its previous all-time high for the meme coin to actually eliminate another zero . This target is placed at the $0.0000155 level, something unprecedented in the Shiba Inu history. For now, the Shiba Inu price is still trending around $0.0000125 after the downturn from the weekend. Coinmarketcap data shows that the meme coin is still maintaining a daily trading volume above $200 million as the market fluctuates.",Shiba Inu|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-04 07:30:49

Particularly, Chainlink and Litecoin proponents have renewed attacks on XRP, questioning whether XRP still has a place in the future of digital assets. However, despite the chatter, XRP continues to show strength through its performance with rebuttals from within its community.Chainlink's Growing Institutional Appeal Leads to XRP CriticismsNotably, Chainlink's growing institutional presence has been a major point. Having secured partnerships with SWIFT, Mastercard , and others, Chainlink has built a reputation as the go-to provider of oracle services for decentralized finance and tokenized markets. As a result, Chainlink community figures have recently claimed that these moves put LINK ahead of XRP as the ""banking coin"" for major institutions.Interestingly, Chainlink's new deal with the U.S. Department of Commerce provided another reason for these commentaries. Notably, the partnership will bring major economic data to different blockchains, but the XRP Ledger was not included. This led to some critics suggesting the government snubbed XRPL due to a lack of trust. However, XRP proponents have pushed back.XRP Proponents Push BackFor instance, dUNL validator Vet explained that the issue surrounding XRPL's snob was due to infrastructure. According to Vet, the government leveraged Chainlink and Pyth, and since neither of them has yet to support XRPL, the network wasn't part of the rollout. He argued that the decision had nothing to do with bias.Meanwhile, in another commentary, some Chainlink advocates claimed these recent developments had enlightened investors, leading to a rotation of capital from XRP to LINK.Nonetheless, attorney Bill Morgan dismissed these claims with chart data. He pointed to trading data that shows XRP holding its ground against LINK and reminded critics that XRP has delivered stronger gains this year. Also, former Ripple developer Matt Hamilton stressed that both communities should recognize that XRP and LINK serve very different purposes. Specifically, XRP drives payments and settlement, while LINK primarily powers oracles. These are two roles that don't cancel each other out.https://twitter.com/HammerToe/status/1958533970372571385Litecoin Fuels the XRP AttacksMeanwhile, Litecoin also joined the campaign when its official account mocked XRP's adoption story, comparing it to the foul smell of a comet. The post led to backlash from XRP's community.In his response, attorney Morgan compared XRP's current market ranking and rising market cap with Litecoin's steady decline. He also noted that XRP plays a role in major policy conversations, including at a White House crypto roundtable, while Litecoin has largely faded from relevance.Other community voices also stepped up. For one, Digital Asset Investor brushed off claims that XRP holders were leaving for Chainlink. He called the idea nothing more than a fear campaign designed to create doubt. Multiple XRP community figures share this view, arguing that the project continues to attract unfair criticism that doesn't match its actual track record.Subtle Jab from SWIFT CIOEven outside these community skirmishes, XRP faced shots from industry leaders. Notably, SWIFT's Chief Innovation Officer, Tom Zschach, recently took a subtle jab at Ripple and XRP, arguing that surviving lawsuits does not prove resilience. He said real adoption depends on trust and shared governance, not legal battles. In response, Osama E., Agile Lead at Sharkforce Consulting, argued that XRP's years of legal scrutiny have actually strengthened its position. He said the network has proven itself more than most other blockchains and now stands out as one of the most battle-tested systems in the industry.Despite all the drama, XRP has kept its momentum. Notably, it stands out as one of the biggest gainers in the past year, up 403% within this period despite the recent drop to $2.82. This outpaces the growth from LINK (+111%) and LTC (+71%) in the same timeframe.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|LINK|LTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-09-04 07:33:32

The initiative also aims at ensuring investor protection while maintaining market integrity. The stock exchange suggested plans to introduce enhanced minimum free float requirements and capital raised during initial public offerings. Nasdaq also proposed stricter rules on suspension and delisting of firms that fail to meet its revised listing standards. Nasdaq targets companies operating in China 🚨 Nasdaq just proposed tougher rules for small IPOs & Chinese listings: 🔹Raise public float min to $15M (from $5M) 🔹Faster suspensions for firms 🔹Chinese IPOs must raise at least $25M Goal: curb pump-and-dump swings, boost liquidity. pic.twitter.com/LZ10vMz8dX — Schaeffer's Investment Research (@schaeffers) September 4, 2025 Under the stock exchange’s net income standard, companies will require a minimum of $15 million of public float to be listed. Firms with a market value of listed securities under $5 million and a listing deficiency will also be suspended and delisted from the exchange at a faster rate. Nasdaq’s new requirements are also targeting companies operating in China, establishing a $25 million threshold for public offering procedures in new listings. The $25 million threshold for public offering proceeds matches the exchange’s previous $25 million standard established in its 2020 rule change. John Zecca, executive vice president of the stock exchange, highlighted that the aim is to focus on investor protection and market integrity. Zecca also said the revised standards are in line with market realities and show the company’s commitment to promoting fair and orderly markets. According to him, the initiative also makes emerging companies easily available to investors through the stock exchange platform. “These new listing standards represent one step in a necessary, industry-wide effort – alongside regulators, U.S. exchanges, and market participants – to closely examine trading behaviors in small company securities, with the goal of safeguarding market integrity and enhancing protection for investors.” – John Zecca , Executive Vice President and Global Chief Legal, Risk & Regulatory Officer at Nasdaq. Nasdaq said that its revised standards come as it seeks to address emerging patterns linked to pump-and-dump schemes in the U.S. trading environment. The firm stated that it had to revise its minimum liquidity standard rules to fit the current trading environment. According to the exchange, the new public listing requirements are meant to remain relevant and effective. The stock exchange added that it reintroduced the minimum public offering threshold for China-based companies. The initiative also builds on the firm’s previous standards set for restrictive markets, where the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) could not inspect auditors. Nasdaq plans to collaborate with SEC and FINRA Nasdaq also plans to strengthen its relationship with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) by reporting potential manipulative trading activities. The initiative is also meant to strengthen the exchange’s cooperation with both domestic and international regulators to maintain high standards in the U.S. trading market environment. The proposed rules are still pending approval from the SEC , where the exchange wants to implement the changes promptly. Companies in the initial listing process will get 30 days to complete the process under the prior standards, after which the new listing requirements will begin. Nasdaq is also planning to begin suspending and delisting companies 60 days after SEC approval. Last month, the U.S. stock exchange proposed to suspend and delist companies trading below $0.10 for ten consecutive trading days. Nasdaq also issued a 360 days for companies trading on the exchange below $1, with no added compliance periods for firms that effected a reverse stock split within the prior year. The SEC also requested comments from Nasdaq regarding the eligibility of foreign firms trading in the U.S. to benefit from lighter U.S. reporting requirements. The stock exchange stated the need to balance the interest in attracting foreign companies to the U.S., while still protecting all investors in the U.S. public markets. Don’t just read crypto news.

Ross argued that since COVID, the U.S. has not experienced a ""normal"" economy—business cycles have been heavily influenced by central banks and government spending. Despite years of warnings from so-called ""perma-bears,"" he sees no true recession, only delayed cycles. Key forward indicators are now turning positive. U.S. manufacturing has been in contraction for years, but recent PMI data and new orders suggest a revival. Ross believes this clarity, especially around tariffs and fiscal policy, will spark growth and lift risk assets, including Bitcoin. On geopolitics, Ross voiced concerns about U.S. vulnerability in energy and manufacturing compared to China, warning of a possible conflict in the next few years. However, he also highlighted optimism in AI, robotics, and Bitcoin as transformative forces that could reshape the global economy. For Bitcoin, Ross stressed that liquidity remains the biggest driver. He sees price lagging behind where it “should” be but expects a sharp move higher as the U.S. economy strengthens. While cautious about eventual cycle peaks, he remains bullish into 2026, when he expects Bitcoin to potentially reach new highs. He also warned that the AI-driven manufacturing comeback may not bring jobs, but instead lead to structural unemployment, forcing society to rethink economic models and possibly consider measures like universal basic income. Overall, Ross remains short- to mid-term bullish: “The economy is about to take off, and with it, Bitcoin is finally set to run.”",,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|TRADING|ASIA,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-09-04 07:36:00

In recent months, there have been growing discussions about ETH prices reaching unprecedented levels. One of the boldest forecasts for Ethereum that has gained traction is the $62,000 target popularized by Fundstrat’s Tom Lee.Meanwhile, some are now considering the broader implications of such a price level for the altcoin market. For instance, Cryptoinsightuk suggested that XRP could soar to $50 if ETH were to surpass $62,000 this cycle, as Lee predicted.Tom Lee's Path to $62,000 for EthereumIn a recent analysis shared by Altcoin Daily, Tom Lee explained the foundation of his bold case for Ethereum reaching $62,000, citing the Wyckoff methodology.According to Lee, Ethereum’s current market structure resembles a massive “base,” similar to the one that preceded its 54x rally from $90 in 2020 to its all-time high of $4,866. With the new base forming from the $1,385 level, Lee argues that Ethereum is building potential energy for another outsized breakout.Ethereum-to-Bitcoin Ratio AnalysisAnother key factor in Lee’s projection is the Ethereum-to-Bitcoin ratio. The long-term eight-year average sits at 0.0479, while the current ratio lingers below that at 0.0403. Meanwhile, the 2021 peak reached 0.0807.Lee believes Ethereum not only has room to return to its historical average but could also surpass prior highs—especially as it becomes the preferred chain for Wall Street to build payment rails and financial infrastructure.Fundstrat models Ethereum’s potential price levels using different Bitcoin targets and ETH/BTC ratios. If Bitcoin climbs to $250,000 and Ethereum returns to its average ratio, ETH could range between $12,000 and $22,000.However, factoring in Ethereum’s role in replacing traditional banking payment rails, Lee suggests its implied value could climb as high as $62,000, corresponding to an ETH/BTC ratio of 0.25.Technical Outlook: $9,000 by Early 2026Adding to the bullish case, Fundstrat’s technical strategist Mark Newton projects Ethereum could reach $5,500 by September 2025 and as high as $9,000 by early January 2026. While not as extreme as Lee’s long-term scenario, Newton’s technical analysis underscores strong upward potential in the next cycle.What a $62,000 ETH Means for XRP and the Altcoin MarketFor context, Ethereum is trading at $4,315 today, after dipping 13% from its all-time high of $4,953. The journey from here to $62,000 requires a growth of 1,337%. Notably, this aggressive target could give Ethereum a market cap of approximately $7.48 trillion.Meanwhile, Bitcoin would need to be trading somewhere near $500,000 to maintain a significant lead ahead of Ethereum. Together, both would command a market cap of over $17 trillion in these ambitious scenarios.Given their historical 72.4% dominance, the global crypto market could be close to $24 trillion. This would leave the broader altcoin market with around $7 trillion.Cryptoinsightuk believes XRP could command the next biggest share of the market, with a $50 unit price equating to about $3 trillion. Indeed, XRP currently trails only Bitcoin and Ethereum in the crypto rankings. Notably, XRP demands a growth of 1,685% from its current position to reach $50.However, he also stated that he does not expect these ambitious price scenarios to play out in this cycle or anytime soon. He instead stressed that while Tom Lee’s aggressive $62,000 ETH prediction is receiving applause, a similar outlook for XRP is often met with widespread criticism and skepticism, with many calling such projections unrealistic.https://twitter.com/Cryptoinsightuk/status/1962966542141865989",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|MARKET|XRP|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-09-04 07:38:49

These tokens, valued at an impressive $2.05 million, were transferred from BitGo just hours before the analyst’s report. Moreover, Cumberland has been observed making frequent, smaller-value on-chain transfers over the past 24 hours. This pattern of activity is often indicative of a market maker actively managing a token’s liquidity. This situation gains additional significance because Cumberland is already well-known as the primary market maker for the TRUMP memecoin.

Cross-market AI is an advanced application of artificial intelligence that aggregates and analyzes data from multiple platforms, markets, and industries to create a unified, holistic view. Unlike traditional AI that operates within a single data silo, cross-market AI synthesizes information from diverse sources, such as social media, financial markets, and customer behavior logs, to enable more effective and personalized strategies. Real-world Use Case: A major retail brand uses cross-market AI to analyze customer behavior across its e-commerce site, in-app purchases, and social media interactions. The AI identifies a key trend: customers who engage with a specific product on Instagram are highly likely to respond to a personalized email offer for a related item, leading to a 30% increase in conversion rates for that product line. Why Everyone is Talking About Cross-Market AI The conversation around cross-market AI is driven by its ability to deliver significant business advantages in a competitive, data-driven landscape. Improved Business Outcomes: This technology enables organizations to predict customer behavior with greater accuracy, which directly boosts key performance indicators (KPIs) like conversion rates and return on investment ( ROI ). A McKinsey & Company report estimates that generative AI alone could contribute up to $4.4 trillion in annual global productivity, with marketing and sales being top beneficiaries. Customer-Centric Focus: By creating detailed customer profiles from behavior across multiple channels (e.g., social media, email, online searches), cross-market AI empowers businesses to meet the modern consumer’s demand for highly personalized experiences. Enhanced Predictive Capabilities: The AI’s ability to analyze massive datasets and forecast trends helps companies make smarter, data-driven decisions on everything from marketing budget allocation to product positioning. Automated Efficiency: By automating repetitive tasks like data analysis, A/B testing, and content creation, cross-market AI frees up human employees to focus on high-value, strategic work. Innovation in Marketing: This technology is at the forefront of marketing’s evolution. Companies that integrate cross-market AI tools can develop more creative and targeted campaigns and leverage new capabilities like generative AI for content creation. Key Features of Cross-Market AI Technology The power of cross-market AI lies in its core features, which enable a comprehensive approach to data analysis and strategic execution. Data Integration: Collects and combines data from various sources, including social media, website analytics, and customer relationship management ( CRM ) systems, to provide a comprehensive, 360-degree view of the customer. Customer Segmentation: Analyzes vast datasets to categorize customers into specific segments based on their behavior, psychographics, and preferences, allowing for highly targeted and effective marketing campaigns. Hyper-Personalization: Uses integrated data to deliver deeply personalized content, product recommendations, and offers across multiple channels, enhancing customer engagement and loyalty. Marketing Automation: Automates and optimizes marketing campaigns and workflows, including automated email sends and programmatic advertising, streamlining operations and improving campaign performance. Predictive Analytics: Uses machine learning to forecast consumer behavior, market trends, and campaign outcomes, enabling proactive strategy adjustments and dynamic pricing. AI Chatbots and Assistants: Implements conversational AI to provide intelligent, 24/7 customer support and engagement across various platforms. Real-Time Adaptation: Dynamically adjusts strategies based on real-time market data and customer interactions, ensuring that campaigns remain relevant and effective. Final Summary: The Strategic Imperative of Cross-Market AI The adoption of cross-market AI is not just a technological upgrade—it is a strategic imperative for businesses aiming to stay competitive. The ability to synthesize insights from diverse data streams allows for unprecedented foresight and personalization, leading to tangible improvements in customer experience and business outcomes. Organizations that move quickly to integrate this technology will gain a significant advantage in the race for market share and sustained growth.

Hilton explained that his approach is straightforward, long-term, and built on discipline rather than complicated tactics.Long-Term Hold StrategySpecifically, Hilton noted that his main approach revolves around buying and holding XRP over the years. He said he has accumulated XRP steadily and plans to hold until the asset reaches at least a 30x return from current levels.That translates to an XRP price target of around $80–$90, which he believes is achievable in the future. For Hilton, patience and long-term vision are the cornerstones of his profit strategy. In his words: ""I think XRP will go beyond that. And I don't really care how long it takes—whether it takes a year or two, three, four, or five. I'm going to hold."" This aligns with the perspective of other XRP commentators who urge investors to secure a bag of 10,000 tokens and remain patient for the coin to enter the triple-digit range, enabling portfolios to reach million-dollar levels.In July, investor Armando Pantoja said he is willing to wait for XRP to eventually reach $1,000 per coin, even if it takes over 10 years. This price outlook would make modest holdings worth $2,850 today (1,000 XRP) grow into a million-dollar fortune.Consistently Buying XRP, Even in Red MarketsThe second component of Hilton’s plan is consistent accumulation. He claims to continue buying XRP weekly, regardless of market conditions.Instead of being discouraged during downturns, he views red days as opportunities to acquire more at a discount. He stressed that while others panic and sell, his focus remains on strengthening his portfolio for the long run. ""So, I continue to buy even on the red days. Why? Because buying at $2.85 is still a deal relative to where it's going to be,"" he said.Don’t Sell on FearHilton also noted that it is important to stay unemotional. He said he avoids selling during market crashes or reacting to negative narratives suggesting XRP could fail. Instead, he treats dips as entry points, as he believes XRP, and crypto more broadly, are here to stay. Hilton dismissed the idea that making money with XRP requires complicated strategies. For him, success boils down to three things: holding long-term, consistently buying, and blocking out short-term noise.While XRP won’t create overnight millionaires , he believes time and disciplined investing will deliver results.Diversify, Not Just XRPIn addition to holding XRP, Hilton also uses swing trading tools to expand his profits. However, he emphasized that these are secondary to his main XRP strategy, which he believes is simple but effective.Notably, Hilton also emphasized the importance of diversification in crypto. He noted that he owns stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other crypto assets in addition to XRP. He advised against putting all eggs in one basket, as this could expose one’s portfolio to risk.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-09-04 07:44:27
51170434,https://invezz.com/?p=2860739,1756971900,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Bitcoin dip or altcoin breakout? why MAGACOIN FINANCE could steal the spotlight in 2025,https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/04/bitcoin-dip-or-altcoin-breakout-why-magacoin-finance-could-steal-the-spotlight-in-2025/,"For years, the phrase “buy the dip” has been synonymous with Bitcoin. Investors who followed that rule in 2018 or 2020 walked away with extraordinary returns when the market rebounded. But in 2025, the question has shifted. With Bitcoin already trading above $100,000, can dip-buying still deliver transformational upside, or has the strategy matured into a conservative play? Analysts argue that while Bitcoin remains the bedrock of crypto, the real breakout opportunities are increasingly found elsewhere, in smaller tokens that thrive on cultural momentum and community energy. Among the altcoins gaining attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly emerged as one of the most talked-about contenders for explosive run. Bitcoin: still king, but with limits Bitcoin is not going anywhere. As the world’s first and largest cryptocurrency, it remains a digital store of value, a hedge against inflation, and the benchmark for institutional adoption. Spot ETFs from BlackRock, Fidelity, and others have transformed Bitcoin into a mainstream financial asset, attracting billions in inflows. Yet this very maturity also creates limits. Bitcoin’s market cap is now measured in trillions, making the days of 50x or 100x returns unlikely. Analysts forecast moderate upside, perhaps another 2x in a strong cycle, but the asymmetric returns that once defined Bitcoin’s rise have largely shifted to smaller-cap tokens. Investors who continue to buy dips may still benefit, but the strategy is now more about wealth preservation than wealth creation. Unlike established tokens with capped upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE sits at the ignition point of its story. Presale rounds are selling out in record time, fueled by both retail enthusiasm and early whale participation. What sets it apart from many meme coins is a mix of credibility and identity: completed audits by HashEx and CertiK, a limited supply designed to enforce scarcity, and branding that resonates far beyond crypto-native circles. Analysts describe it as a project designed for visibility and staying power, not just a speculative flash. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE especially compelling is timing. While Bitcoin buyers enter at six-figure levels with modest upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the psychological satisfaction of stacking millions of tokens at a low cost. This narrative, cheap access plus cultural magnetism, has powered every major meme coin explosion in the past. If momentum holds, analysts argue that MAGACOIN FINANCE could capture the same ignition dynamic that turned SHIB and DOGE into household names. Why hesitation is expensive Retail investors often fall into the same trap: they wait for headlines, for listings, for confirmation. By the time that comes, whales and early buyers are already holding positions at far lower levels. This cycle repeats across every breakout token, from Ethereum’s early ecosystem to PEPE’s viral run. The message is consistent: conviction before consensus is where fortunes are made. Today, MAGACOIN FINANCE sits at that same juncture. It is no longer a whisper, but it has not yet become a mainstream phenomenon. Analysts warn that the window to secure allocations at favorable levels is closing quickly. Once it trends broadly on social media or lands on major exchanges, the asymmetry that defines early positioning will vanish. Lessons from past winners The blueprint is clear. Early Ethereum holders who accumulated under $100, Solana believers who bought at $5, and SHIB communities that acted before listings, all were rewarded not because they timed the top, but because they recognized the bottom. The investors who embraced narrative-driven momentum before the mainstream arrived walked away with the largest multiples. Conclusion Buying the Bitcoin dip has worked for over a decade, but its role has shifted from wealth creation to wealth preservation. For investors seeking transformational upside, the spotlight is moving toward cultural tokens that combine scarcity, community, and viral attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its surging presale demand, completed audits, and cultural magnetism, is increasingly viewed as the breakout candidate for 2025. The lesson from past cycles is simple: the biggest gains don’t go to those who follow the crowd, they go to those who act before the story hits the front page.

This is made possible by AI tools trained on the distinct Ghibli aesthetic, which includes soft, hand-drawn textures, warm pastel colors, and a nostalgic, dreamy atmosphere. The primary benefit of this trend is accessibility; anyone can create stunning anime art without requiring artistic skills. The process is simple and can be accomplished in one of two ways. Method 1: Use an Image-to-Image AI Tool This is the fastest method for “Ghiblifying” an existing photograph. It’s ideal for transforming a portrait, pet photo, or landscape into a Ghibli-inspired piece. Select a Tool : Popular platforms offering dedicated AI filters include Fotor and Remaker AI . These tools have specific “Ghibli AI” or anime-style filters. Upload Your Image : Choose a high-quality photo with clear details. The AI uses the photo as a base to create the new artwork. Apply the Filter : With a single click, the AI analyzes and transforms your image into the signature Ghibli style, typically in just a few seconds. Download : Once generated, save your new artwork to your device. Method 2: Use a Text-to-Image AI Tool This method is for creating a brand-new illustration from scratch using only a descriptive text prompt. Choose a Platform : Major AI platforms with advanced image generation capabilities are the best choice. These include Google Gemini , ChatGPT (for Plus users) , and xAI’s Grok . Craft a Detailed Prompt : The key to a great result is a specific prompt. Describe the scene, characters, lighting, and mood. Crucially, explicitly include the phrase “Studio Ghibli style” to direct the AI. Example Prompt : “A peaceful Studio Ghibli-style image of a young girl standing in a sunlit meadow, surrounded by lush green hills and soft pastel clouds. The atmosphere should be warm and dreamy, with hand-drawn textures and soft lighting.” Generate and Refine : Submit the prompt and let the AI create the image. You can then adjust your prompt to refine elements like lighting or character details. The Viral Rise of the Ghibli AI Trend The trend surged in popularity after companies like OpenAI rolled out new image-generation features, making the process seamless. The demand for these whimsical, nostalgic images has been so high that it has even caused server overload for some providers, with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman noting that their GPUs were “melting” from the volume of requests. The viral nature of the trend has also fueled a broader debate about AI art. Critics argue that these tools devalue human creativity and raise copyright concerns, as the AI models are trained on vast datasets of existing art.

Recent dips in Bitcoin’s price have fueled this uncertainty, causing some investors to question the longevity of the current bullish trend. However, a prominent analyst offers a compelling counter-narrative, suggesting that the current Bitcoin cycle is far from finished. This insight could be crucial for anyone navigating the volatile world of digital assets. Is the Current Bitcoin Cycle Truly Unbroken? Despite the recent volatility that has gripped the market, the prevailing sentiment that the Bitcoin cycle has concluded might be premature. According to Axel Adler Jr., a respected contributor at CryptoQuant, the underlying data points to a different story. His analysis indicates that Bitcoin’s current market behavior aligns with a structural uptrend, rather than a cycle top. Adler’s perspective offers a glimmer of hope and a logical framework for understanding Bitcoin’s resilience. He emphasizes the importance of key support levels, which often act as critical junctures for price action. Understanding these levels is fundamental to predicting future movements and making informed investment decisions. Many investors closely monitor such analyses to gauge market health and potential future trajectories. It is vital to look beyond daily fluctuations and consider broader, long-term indicators that reveal the true state of the market. This approach helps to avoid panic selling and to capitalize on sustained growth. Understanding Key Support: Why $107K Matters for the Bitcoin Cycle A significant part of Adler’s argument hinges on Bitcoin’s performance on the monthly chart. He notes that BTC is currently trading around $110,700, which is comfortably above a crucial support level: the short-term holder realized price at $107,600. This metric is a powerful indicator, representing the average price at which short-term investors acquired their Bitcoin. What does this mean for the Bitcoin cycle? Short-term holder realized price: This metric helps to identify the cost basis for investors who have held Bitcoin for less than 155 days. When the price stays above this level, it suggests that these newer market participants are generally in profit, reducing the likelihood of widespread selling pressure. Comparison to other holder groups: Adler highlights that the current price is significantly higher than the realized price for all holders ($52,800) and long-term holders ($35,600). This wide margin indicates robust profitability across different investor cohorts, strongly supporting the notion of a structural uptrend in the ongoing Bitcoin cycle . The fact that Bitcoin maintains its position above these critical realized price levels provides a strong foundation for continued growth. It suggests that the market has absorbed recent selling and is ready to push higher, rather than entering a prolonged bearish phase. This resilience is a hallmark of a healthy and maturing asset class. Decoding Market Sentiment: What NUPL Tells Us About This Bitcoin Cycle Another powerful tool in Adler’s analysis is the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) indicator. This metric helps assess the overall profitability of the Bitcoin market by comparing the unrealized profit of all coins to their unrealized loss. A higher NUPL value indicates greater market-wide profit. Currently, the NUPL indicator stands at 0.53, placing it firmly in the profit zone. While this is a positive sign, Adler points out that it is at a lower level compared to previous market cycles. This observation is particularly insightful: Profit zone, but not overheated: Being in the profit zone means that, on average, Bitcoin holders are sitting on gains. However, the relatively lower NUPL value compared to past peaks suggests that the market is not yet experiencing the extreme euphoria or speculative frenzy often seen at cycle tops. Room for growth: This ‘cooler’ profit zone implies that there is still significant room for the market to expand before reaching potential exhaustion points. It suggests that the current Bitcoin cycle has more fuel to burn, offering further upside potential for investors. This balanced view from the NUPL indicator provides a nuanced understanding of market sentiment. It counters the narrative of an imminent crash by showing that while profitable, the market isn’t excessively overbought, leaving room for continued price appreciation. Navigating the Future: What’s Next for the Bitcoin Cycle? Axel Adler Jr.’s conclusion is clear and provides actionable insight for investors: if Bitcoin’s price can successfully be maintained above the key support level of $107,000, the bullish trend is highly likely to continue. This threshold acts as a crucial barometer for the market’s immediate future, signaling whether the upward momentum will persist. For investors, monitoring this specific price point becomes paramount. A sustained break below $107,000 could signal a shift in market dynamics, while holding firm above it reinforces the analyst’s optimistic outlook for the ongoing Bitcoin cycle . This provides a tangible metric to watch amidst the often-confusing daily price movements. The confluence of strong realized price support and a healthy, yet not overheated, NUPL indicator paints a compelling picture. It suggests that while corrections are a natural part of any market, the foundational elements for a continued uptrend in the Bitcoin cycle remain firmly in place. This perspective encourages a long-term view, rather than reacting to short-term fear. Conclusion: A Resilient Bitcoin Cycle The latest analysis from CryptoQuant’s Axel Adler Jr. offers a powerful counter-argument to the idea that Bitcoin’s current bull run is over. By focusing on critical on-chain metrics like the short-term holder realized price and the NUPL indicator, he demonstrates that Bitcoin’s foundational support remains strong. The key takeaway is clear: as long as the $107,000 support level holds, the prevailing bullish trend of the Bitcoin cycle is poised to continue. This provides a robust framework for investors to confidently navigate the market, understanding that significant upside potential still exists. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the “short-term holder realized price”? The short-term holder realized price is an on-chain metric that calculates the average price at which Bitcoin was acquired by investors who have held their coins for less than 155 days. It helps identify the cost basis for newer market participants. 2. What does the NUPL indicator tell us about the market? NUPL stands for Net Unrealized Profit/Loss. It assesses the overall profitability of the Bitcoin market by comparing the total unrealized profit to the total unrealized loss across all coins. A positive NUPL indicates that the market is, on average, in profit. 3. Why is the $107,000 level so important for Bitcoin? According to the analysis, $107,000 represents the short-term holder realized price, acting as a crucial support level. If Bitcoin’s price remains above this point, it signals that newer investors are profitable, reducing selling pressure and supporting a continued bullish trend. 4. Is this Bitcoin cycle different from previous ones? While the current NUPL is in the profit zone, it’s at a lower level compared to previous cycle peaks. This suggests the market might not be as overheated or euphoric as in past cycles, potentially indicating more room for sustained growth. 5. What should investors watch for next in the Bitcoin cycle? Investors should closely monitor Bitcoin’s price action relative to the $107,000 support level. A sustained hold above this level would reinforce the bullish outlook, while a decisive break below it could signal a shift in market dynamics.

The license, granted under the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), allows QCP to provide spot and derivatives trading, market making and structured solutions for institutional and professional clients. The firm already holds a Major Payment Institution license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Founder Darius Sit said the Abu Dhabi approval marked a cornerstone in QCP’s global strategy. He also described the Middle East as a vital region for digital assets. Moreover, he noted that the ADGM framework gives institutional clients confidence in both security and regulatory oversight. Strategic Location Positions ADGM As Gateway To MENA And Asia Abu Dhabi has positioned itself as a leading destination for crypto firms.

Since then, it has worked to attract exchanges, custodians, and token issuers. To do so, it relies on strict compliance standards and favorable tax policies. Major investments have reinforced the emirate’s wider push into digital assets. In March, Abu Dhabi’s MGX fund committed $2b to Binance , showing its intent to compete with other global financial centers. Market participants say the combination of clear rules, tax advantages and geographic reach makes ADGM appealing to firms seeking to operate across the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Applicants Face Heavy Costs, Stringent Compliance Demands However, the licensing process is demanding. Applicants face high fees, detailed compliance checks and requirements for robust governance and cybersecurity frameworks. Firms must submit detailed business plans, AML and CFT policies, and evidence of qualified leadership before winning approval. For QCP, the dual licensing in Singapore and Abu Dhabi provides coverage across two established financial hubs. The company says this positioning enables it to bridge liquidity between Asia and the Middle East, while offering clients 24-hour regulated trading. Abu Dhabi Attracts More Crypto Firms Seeking Strong Oversight ADGM’s chief market development Officer, Arvind Ramamurthy, welcomed QCP’s addition. He said the group’s focus on regulatory compliance and digital asset innovation fits the center’s goal of attracting top-tier financial institutions to the region. QCP joins a growing list of firms using Abu Dhabi as a base for crypto expansion. By securing one of the more challenging licenses to obtain, the company has strengthened its credentials in a sector where regulators are demanding higher standards. As global oversight of digital assets intensifies, Abu Dhabi is betting that its combination of progressive regulation and institutional credibility will draw more players like QCP to its shores.

A joint audit , published on Wednesday, confirmed that 99.7% of all Cardano tokens sold pursuant to the voucher program have been successfully redeemed through the on-chain redemptions and Post-Sweep Redemption Project. “The Investigation determined that each of the allegations related to the Topics of Investigation do not have any basis.” Further, the investigations revealed that unclaimed ADA were allocated to Cardano Development Holdings for grants and community initiatives. The investigation was jointly conducted by Input Output Global (IOG), global law firm McDermott, Will & Schulte and the global accounting firm BDO.

It elaborates how the voucher distribution was managed through a structured and secure framework with transactions recorded on-chain. Cardano Misconduct Allegations – Founder Hoskinson’s Promise Fulfilled In May, allegations surfaced against the ecosystem’s founder , Charles Hoskinson, over manipulating the blockchain during the 2021 Allegra hard fork. He was accused of misappropriating over $600 million worth of ADA tokens. Per the accusations, 318 million ADA, valued at around $619 million in 2021, was moved from presale addresses into the Cardano reserves. Additionally, NFT artist Masato Alexander claimed that Hoskinson used a “genesis key” to rewrite the ledger. He argued that most of the original token holders never reclaimed their funds. Hoskinson later promised an audit to debunk claims of misappropriation of $600 million worth ADA. He said that the Cardano Foundation will soon release an audit to counter rising criticisms. He wrote on X at the time that the original token buyers had already redeemed most of the 350 million ADA. In June, Hoskinson said that he received the first copy of the audit report, promising to release more details by mid-August, if there are no delays.

Our Pi network price prediction anticipates the Pi price to reach a maximum level of $0.4232 by 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $4.74. Pi Network, founded by Stanford PhDs Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan, is a social cryptocurrency and developer ecosystem built for accessibility and real-world utility. The Pi Network is entering a crucial stage in 2025 as its ecosystem expands, but market sentiment stays cautious. Pi Coin recently hit an all-time low of $0.3304 on August 26, 2025, months after peaking at $2.98 in February, highlighting its volatile price action within the crypto market. Despite this, the network is moving forward with completing key developments. The Passkey Update introduced Face ID, fingerprint, and device PIN authentication, strengthening security ahead of the long-awaited Mainnet launch. At the same time, Pi Hackathon 2025 opened the door for developers to build real-world services and apps, while early seed investor Ulu Ventures confirmed its backing as an indication of continued confidence in Pi’s future. In this article on Pi Network price prediction, we look at recent trends, ecosystem development, and both technical and fundamental factors that could determine Pi coin value between 2025 and 2031.

PI declined 1.19% in the last 24 hours. The coin faces resistance near $0.38, while support is around $0.32. On September 4, Pi Network (PI/USDT) is trading at $0.3487, marking a 1.19% day decline. The day’s chart captured a high of $0.3587 and a low of $0.3447, while the previous close stood at $0.3522. The token has struggled to hold gains since its sharp spike in May, where it briefly touched levels near $1.80 before sliding into a prolonged downtrend to an all-time low on August 26, 2025. Pi Network 1-day price chart analysis The 24-hour chart shows the Pi Network price trading at $0.3487, marking a 1.19% decline. The daily chart shows the token struggling to sustain upward momentum, with resistance forming around $0.38 and support near $0.32. Price movement has remained weak, with sellers dominating. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 44.30. This places Pi in a neutral zone, leaning slightly bearish as it hovers below the 50-mark. The RSI indicates that buying strength remains limited, with no immediate signs of overbought or oversold conditions. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line stands at 0.0017, while the signal line is at -0.0157. The histogram is at -0.0175, reflecting bearish momentum. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView Pi/USD 4-Hour Price Analysis Pi is trading around $0.3473 on 4-hour chart, showing sideways movement with less strong momentum. The RSI at 45.06 suggests bearish pressure, as buying strength remains subdued. On the downside, support is at $0.34, and a drop below this level could open the way toward $0.32. On the upside, resistance sits near $0.36, and only a decisive breakout above this zone could allow Pi to retest the $0.38–$0.40 range. The MACD line is at 0.0010, the signal line is at -0.0021, and the histogram is around -0.0031, indicating bearish momentum but with weakening strength.

From the Pi price analysis, the coin is likely to continue consolidating between $0.3420 support and $0.3456 resistance in the short term. A breakout above resistance could trigger a way toward $0.351, while a drop below support may cause further downside momentum. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.3610 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly, neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is PI’s price down today? Pi Network (PI) is down today as upcoming token unlocks raise supply concerns, adding to selling pressure in a weak crypto market. Bearish technical factors like broken support levels, oversold RSI, and negative MACD confirm a fragile price action outlook. Broader market fear and low liquidity further weigh on sentiment, leaving investors cautious about Pi’s near-term value. Will Pi Price Reach $5? If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $5 mark. Will Pi Reach $10? Depending on the current market sentiment, the PI price might take several years to reach the $10 milestone. We expect the Pi price to reach $10 by 2033.

Always do your own research when trying to make investment decisions. Pi Historic Price Sentiment PI price history: Coinmarketcap Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi shows sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72 if support at $0.60 holds. At the start of July 2025, Pi Network faces high volatility as massive token unlocks trigger strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458–$0.50 range.

At the same time, Chainlink is showing resilience, with LINK price predictions turning more bullish as whale accumulation grows. Yet, the spotlight is shifting toward Remittix , a PayFi-focused altcoin. With its $23.5 million raise, analysts forecast Remittix could surge 5,000% faster than its rivals. Pi Network Price Prediction Shows Weak Liquidity Concerns Pi Network price today trades at $0.4472, slipping after hitting a short-term peak near $0.4944 earlier in the session. The Pi Network Price Prediction shows that resistance at $0.50 remains unbroken, and without stronger catalysts, momentum is stalling. Community sentiment is split, with some pointing to Pi Coin News around potential listings or ecosystem upgrades, while others highlight low liquidity and speculative trading. Pi Coin Price Prediction models remain cautious, with realistic targets closer to $0.60 by Q4 2025 rather than a surge to $1. Despite Pi Network’s 50M+ user base and its unique mobile mining model, the lack of centralized exchange support continues to weigh heavily on market outlook. Pi Coin Price resilience at $0.42 now acts as support, but analysts argue Pi needs significant adoption news to justify higher valuations. For now, Pi Network News reflects uncertainty, leaving traders eyeing alternatives with stronger fundamentals. Chainlink Price Prediction Sees Cup And Handle Formation Chainlink price today sits near $23 after a recent 17% pullback, but analysts say the correction could be setting the stage for a bigger move. The LINK Price Prediction remains bullish thanks to whale accumulation and shrinking exchange balances, which historically point to strength. Recent Chainlink News shows reserves climbing steadily, removing tokens from circulation and tightening supply. Whales have snapped up nearly 2 million tokens in 30 days, boosting confidence that the Chainlink Price Prediction could target $27 and beyond. Partnerships continue to strengthen the outlook, with LINK News highlighting new integrations such as secure rate feeds and U.S. government data adoption. The cup-and-handle pattern forming on charts further supports upside momentum. Analysts note that a breakout above $27 could unlock targets of $31, making the LINK Price today look like an attractive entry. For now, Chainlink Price resilience is convincing traders that upside remains firmly in play. Analysts Back Remittix As The Next Major Breakout Remittix is quickly separating itself from hype-driven projects by focusing on one of the biggest real-world challenges: cross-border payments. Unlike Pi Network’s speculative climb and correction phases or Chainlink’s slow but steady gains, Remittix is scaling at speed. The project has already raised over $23.5 million with more than 642 million tokens sold at just $0.1030. Investors are betting on its unique PayFi infrastructure to deliver the next wave of adoption.

A recent discovery has sent ripples through the cybersecurity community: hackers are now leveraging Ethereum smart contracts to conceal malicious code. This alarming development introduces a novel method for deploying Ethereum smart contract malware , cleverly bypassing traditional security scans and posing a significant risk to developers and users alike. This isn’t just another virus; it’s a stealth operation using the very backbone of decentralized finance. What is This New Ethereum Smart Contract Malware Tactic? Security firm ReversingLabs recently uncovered this sophisticated technique, shedding light on a new frontier for cybercrime. They found malicious packages embedded within the popular open-source code repository, NPM. These packages, deceptively disguised as simple utilities, contained hidden URLs. When activated on an infected system, these URLs quietly prompted the download of dangerous malware. This method is not merely a simple trick; it represents a strategic and ingenious move by attackers. By embedding malicious elements or their triggers within Ethereum smart contracts, cybercriminals are essentially using the decentralized, immutable nature of the blockchain as a sophisticated hiding place. This makes detection incredibly difficult for conventional security tools that aren’t specifically designed to scrutinize blockchain transactions for such covert operations. The elegance of this approach lies in its ability to leverage a trusted infrastructure for nefarious purposes. Why is This a Game-Changer for Blockchain Security? This technique signifies a notable shift in how cybercriminals operate within the crypto space. While malware previously relied on more direct attack vectors, the use of Ethereum smart contract malware for concealment offers several distinct advantages to attackers: Enhanced Evasion: Traditional antivirus and endpoint security software are typically not configured to scan blockchain data or smart contract code for hidden payloads. This blind spot is precisely what attackers exploit. Increased Persistence: Once a malicious trigger or reference is embedded within an immutable smart contract, it can be highly persistent. The very nature of blockchain, designed for permanence, becomes a liability. False Legitimacy: The association with legitimate smart contracts and open-source libraries can lend an air of authenticity to the malicious activity, making it far harder for unsuspecting users or even automated systems to detect foul play. ReversingLabs aptly described this as a “novel technique,” underscoring its innovative and concerning nature. Developers who frequently integrate open-source packages into their projects are particularly vulnerable. The unsuspecting inclusion of a compromised package could lead to widespread infections, making acute awareness of Ethereum smart contract malware an absolute necessity for anyone involved in blockchain development or digital asset management. How Can We Combat This Emerging Ethereum Smart Contract Malware Threat? Protecting against this advanced form of Ethereum smart contract malware requires a proactive, multi-layered approach and increased vigilance from all stakeholders. Here are critical actionable insights for developers, security teams, and even everyday users: Thorough Code Audits: Always perform in-depth security audits of all smart contracts and open-source libraries before deployment or integration. Never simply trust; verify every line of code and its dependencies for any anomalies. Robust Supply Chain Security: Implement stringent supply chain security practices for all open-source dependencies. Utilize specialized tools that scan for known vulnerabilities, suspicious patterns, and unexpected changes within packages. Behavioral Monitoring and Analysis: Shift focus towards monitoring system behavior for unusual network requests, unexpected file downloads, or suspicious process executions, even if they originate from seemingly legitimate sources. Stay Updated and Patch Regularly: Ensure all software, including operating systems, development tools, and security solutions, are consistently updated to their latest versions. Patches often address newly discovered vulnerabilities. Continuous Developer Education: Invest in educating development teams on the latest threat vectors, including novel blockchain-based attack methods. Understanding the enemy is the first step in defense. This evolving threat highlights the urgent need for continuous adaptation in cybersecurity strategies, especially within the rapidly advancing and complex blockchain ecosystem. The security landscape is dynamic, and our defenses must be equally agile. Conclusion: The emergence of Ethereum smart contract malware as a sophisticated hiding mechanism for malicious code marks a concerning evolution in cybercrime. As our digital landscape continues to intertwine deeply with blockchain technology, the methods employed by attackers become increasingly subtle and harder to detect. Remaining informed, implementing stringent security protocols, and fostering a culture of unwavering vigilance are paramount to safeguarding our digital assets and critical infrastructure from these insidious threats. The ongoing fight against hidden malware requires collective effort, continuous innovation, and proactive measures from every corner of the crypto community. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Ethereum smart contract malware? A1: Ethereum smart contract malware refers to malicious code or triggers that are hidden within or referenced by legitimate Ethereum smart contracts, allowing hackers to bypass traditional security scans and deploy malware onto unsuspecting systems. Q2: How do hackers use smart contracts to hide malware? A2: Hackers embed hidden URLs or other malicious payloads within seemingly innocuous open-source packages that interact with smart contracts. When these packages are used, the hidden elements prompt infected systems to download and install malware. Q3: Why is this new technique difficult to detect? A3: This technique is difficult to detect because traditional security tools are not designed to scan blockchain data or smart contract code for hidden malicious content. The immutable nature of the blockchain also provides a persistent hiding place for these threats. Q4: What steps can developers take to protect against this threat? A4: Developers should perform thorough code audits of all smart contracts and open-source dependencies, implement robust supply chain security, monitor system behavior for anomalies, keep software updated, and educate their teams on new threat vectors. Q5: Are general users at risk from this type of malware? A5: While developers integrating open-source code are directly targeted, general users can be indirectly at risk if applications or services they use incorporate compromised components.

While August brought turbulence and brief outflows, the recovery has underscored the resilience of institutional demand, with products like BlackRock’s IBIT fund continuing to anchor adoption. Yet this institutional wave is not unfolding in isolation. As large funds reinforce Bitcoin’s position, retail investors are beginning to scout for higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities. Among the names drawing attention, MAGACOIN Finance has emerged as a presale that is positioning itself as a speculative complement to Bitcoin’s ETF-driven surge. ETFs Cement Bitcoin’s Role in the Cycle Since their launch, spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted more than $54 billion in inflows, establishing themselves as the backbone of institutional adoption. BlackRock’s IBIT fund alone has surpassed $80 billion in assets under management, becoming the flagship vehicle for traditional investors entering the market. Even August’s mild withdrawals proved temporary, as renewed deposits quickly restored momentum, reinforcing the sense that institutions are tactically buying dips rather than retreating. This consistency is reshaping market dynamics. ETFs are not just drawing liquidity; they are validating Bitcoin’s role as digital gold in institutional portfolios. Analysts suggest that this foundation is why forecasts continue to climb, with the $120,000 target viewed less as a speculative bet and more as a logical extension of structural demand. Price Action and Forecasts for Q4 Bitcoin’s climb to nearly $124,000 in August triggered profit-taking, but technical indicators show the broader uptrend remains intact. Consolidation above the 200-day EMA is strengthening the case for a fresh rally, with short-term forecasts clustered between $117,900 and $122,300. Looking further ahead, analysts see room for $125,000–$130,000 in Q4, especially if ETF participation accelerates. The long-term outlook is equally bullish. Conservative models put 2025 targets in the $145,000–$175,000 range, while more aggressive forecasts stretch toward $181,000–$200,000. Importantly, experts emphasize that ETF flows are functioning as a sentiment barometer: every retracement has been met with renewed institutional buying, while corporates such as MicroStrategy, Trump Media, and Metaplanet have expanded their holdings at support. This pattern has reinforced the perception that Bitcoin’s bull market remains firmly intact. Market Sentiment Turns Decisively Bullish Heading into the final quarter of 2025, sentiment across the analyst community is strikingly positive. CoinPedia’s latest macro outlook observed that “as long as support holds, optimism remains intact… and the odds are very high that consolidation above $108K will lead to a bullish move toward $130K.” Institutional participation through ETFs has become the anchor of this cycle, but high-profile endorsements are also amplifying confidence. Eric Trump, echoing the institutional narrative, has publicly projected that Bitcoin could eventually climb to $1 million, framing it as the digital reserve asset of the future. While such forecasts are at the upper edge of the spectrum, they capture the scale of optimism that is building around Bitcoin as ETF inflows deepen and regulatory clarity improves. Against this backdrop, analysts argue that the foundation for a historic rally is stronger than in any previous cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Retail Counterbalance to ETFs While Bitcoin dominates institutional flows, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out its narrative from a different angle that could deliver 35x ROI to early players. The presale has become one of the cycle’s most discussed retail plays, appealing to investors who believe the most asymmetric returns are found outside regulated ETF products. History suggests that when institutions crowd into Bitcoin, speculative capital often rotates into emerging tokens. MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as the beneficiary of this dynamic, offering exposure to a high-risk, high-reward story built on timing and community momentum. For investors balancing portfolios, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly seen not as a rival to Bitcoin but as a complement — the retail-driven counterpart to the institutional ETF wave. Conclusion Bitcoin’s ETF-fueled rally has reestablished it as the anchor of the crypto market, with inflows surpassing $1.2 billion and analysts targeting $120,000 as the next milestone. The message is clear: institutions are here, adoption is accelerating, and price action reflects unprecedented demand. But alongside this institutional story sits a retail one. MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the counterpoint, a presale token thriving on community enthusiasm and speculative appetite. For investors weighing the best strategies heading into Q4, the dual narrative is compelling: Bitcoin is defining the institutional era, while MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver the kind of breakout performance that only retail-driven cycles can produce.

The formation begins with corrective waves labeled A through E, covering the first half of 2025. Following this, the chart introduces a bullish five-wave impulse sequence, starting when XRP hit its all-time high of $3.65 in July, before retracing and entering another consolidation phase . Dark Defender’s analysis suggests that this consolidation phase is forming Wave 2. Wave 2 is often a corrective pullback before Wave 3, which is the strongest Wave in the cycle. Dark Defender’s chart suggests that Wave 3 could reach as high as $15. Wave 4 is also corrective, but preserves most of the profit made in Wave 3, before the final climb in Wave 5. The chart shows Wave 5 targeting $18.22, which sits at the Fibonacci 361.8% extension level. Notably, Dark Defender has constantly reiterated this target , and despite XRP’s recent pullback, he is confident that the asset can reach this level. Key Levels to Monitor Several levels are highlighted on the chart as reference points for this trajectory. At the lower end, the $1.88 mark, labeled as the 161.8% Fibonacci extension, establishes a strong base. The $3.33 level serves as a trigger, with a breakout above it expected to accelerate XRP’s momentum.

This isn’t just another corporate deal; it involves a lawmaker stepping in to tackle delays and investor concerns. Let’s dive into why this development is so significant for the digital asset landscape. What’s Behind the Binance Gopax Acquisition Delay? Min Byung-deok, a prominent lawmaker and chairman of the ruling Democratic Party’s Digital Asset Committee, is scheduled to meet with Richard Teng, the CEO of Binance, next week. The core of their discussion will revolve around the significant delay in Binance’s efforts to acquire South Korean exchange Gopax. This delay is directly linked to a pressing issue: the repayment of debt to victims of Gopax’s GoFi staking service. Unfortunately, Gopax has been unable to repay both principal and interest to its GoFi investors. This unfortunate situation stems from the 2022 bankruptcy of its operating partner, Genesis Global Capital. The ripple effect of Genesis’s collapse left GoFi investors in a precarious position, awaiting resolution. Binance’s proposed acquisition was seen as a potential lifeline for Gopax and its affected users. However, the process has faced unexpected hurdles, leading to frustration among investors and prompting legislative intervention. Why is This Binance Gopax Acquisition Meeting So Important? This upcoming meeting is critical for several reasons. Firstly, it highlights the growing regulatory scrutiny on cryptocurrency exchanges, especially when investor funds are at risk. A lawmaker’s direct involvement underscores the gravity of the situation and the government’s commitment to protecting its citizens. Secondly, the resolution of the Binance Gopax acquisition is vital for the stability and trust within the South Korean crypto market. A successful acquisition could pave the way for Gopax to fulfill its obligations to GoFi investors, restoring confidence in the platform and the wider ecosystem. Key issues at stake include: Investor Protection: Ensuring GoFi victims receive their owed funds. Market Stability: Preventing further disruption in the South Korean crypto market. Regulatory Clarity: Setting precedents for future acquisitions and operations of global exchanges in the region. Binance’s Reputation: A successful resolution could strengthen Binance’s standing in a key Asian market. The outcome of these discussions could set a significant precedent for how global crypto giants navigate local regulatory frameworks and address past financial challenges. What’s Next for the Binance Gopax Acquisition and GoFi Victims? The meeting between Lawmaker Min and Binance CEO Teng is expected to be a pivotal moment. While specific details of the discussions remain confidential until the meeting, the focus will undoubtedly be on finding a concrete path forward.

Market watchers are showing interest in XYZVerse (XYZ), hinting at a possible huge price jump. This buzz grows as major names like XRP and Solana (SOL) are expected to reach new peak prices. Fresh data suggests XYZVerse could outpace them both. XRP (XRP) Source: TradingView XRP keeps hovering between $2.67 and $2.98 after a rough week that shaved 4.72% off its tag. The slide now sits at 7.86% for the month, yet the coin remains 18.65% up from half a year ago. Momentum cooled, but bulls are still circling. Short term signals stay mixed. Price hugs the 10-day average at $2.85 while the 100-day line at $2.81 rises gently. RSI stands at 44.10, near neutral but leaning weak. Stochastic sits at 20.81, hinting oversold. MACD keeps a tiny positive line, suggesting bears lack full control. If buyers defend $2.56, a break above $2.98 could rush toward the first wall at $3.19, a jump of about 8%. Clearing that zone opens $3.51, roughly 18% above now. Failure to hold $2.56 risks a slide to $2.24, about 15% down. Expect choppy trade with a slight upward tilt. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Hits the $15M Milestone XYZVerse ($XYZ), recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, is drawing significant attention thanks to its standout concept. It is the first ever meme coin that merges the thrill of sports and the innovation of web3. Unlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse offers real utility and a clear roadmap for long-term development. It plans to launch gamified products and form partnerships with big sports teams and platforms. Notably, XYZVerse recently delivered on one of its goals ahead of schedule by partnering with bookmaker.XYZ, the first fully on-chain decentralized sportsbook and casino. As a bonus, $XYZ token holders receive exclusive perks on their first bet. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.005, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.01. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $15 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $20 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors are rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price, and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Solana (SOL) Source: TradingView Solana moved in a tight $184.88-$217.32 range this week and still closed with a 1.72% gain. The token slipped under its 10-day average of $209.18 yet stays above the 100-day line at $204.55, showing short-term cooling while the broader trend stays up. Momentum tools sit low, which often signals sellers are tiring. Zoom out and the picture brightens. SOL jumped 21.76% in the past month and 48.21% over 6 months, outpacing most large caps. The rise lost speed only in the last few sessions, letting buyers regroup near the mid-200 area. Volume holds steady, so a single sharp move could set the next leg. Traders watch $233.88 as the first ceiling. A break there would open room toward $266.33, roughly 23% above today’s top tick. Failure to clear $217 could drag price to support at $169.01, about 10% below the week’s floor, with deeper protection near 136.57. Given the longer climb and modest near-term pullback, odds still lean to an upside test before any larger slide. Conclusion XRP and SOL are good, but first all-sport memecoin XYZVerse now leads the 2025 bull run, targeting 20,000% gains by merging GameFi, media partnerships, and passionate sports fandom.

51170646,https://cryptonews.com/?p=418361,1756973870,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/51170646.jpeg,Ethereum Advocacy Group Etherealize Raises $40M to Bring ETH to Wall Street,https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-advocacy-group-etherealize-raises-40m-to-bring-eth-to-wall-street/,"Ethereum-focused firm Etherealize has secured $40 million in fresh funding as it ramps up efforts to bring the second-largest cryptocurrency to Wall Street’s doorstep. Key Takeaways: Etherealize raised $40M to accelerate Ethereum’s adoption by traditional finance. The funding comes amid a $1.2B ETH accumulation by public firms, signaling growing institutional interest. The firm will build infrastructure for tokenized asset settlement and Ethereum-based financial tools. The raise, led by Electric Capital and Paradigm , aims to deepen institutional understanding of Ethereum and accelerate its adoption across traditional finance. The funding round arrives during a pivotal week for Ethereum, with public firms collectively adding over $1.2 billion worth of Ether (ETH) to their treasuries, a surge that underscores growing institutional appetite for the asset. Etherealize Aims to Bridge Ethereum and Wall Street Etherealize, launched in January with backing from the Ethereum Foundation and co-founder Vitalik Buterin, is designed to bridge the gap between Ethereum’s complex ecosystem and the financial world’s demand for clarity, tools, and regulation-ready infrastructure. Co-founder Grant Hummer previously noted that despite Ethereum’s presence in crypto ETFs, many institutions still lack the fundamental knowledge needed to engage meaningfully with ETH. The $40 million will fund new tools and platforms tailored to institutional workflows. Etherealize plans to build infrastructure for private trading and settlement of tokenized assets, including a settlement platform for tokenized bonds and other fixed income products. The firm is positioning itself at the intersection of crypto-native innovation and enterprise-level finance, hoping to deliver scalable solutions for firms seeking exposure to Ethereum’s capabilities. “Over the past decade, Ethereum has gone from an experiment to the world’s most battle-tested, open financial network,” said co-founder Danny Ryan, adding that the new capital will help “upgrade institutional finance to modern, safer, globally accessible rails.” ETHEREALIZE'S NEXT CHAPTER We were born as a marketing and BD arm for Ethereum. Today, we're excited to announce that we’re expanding our mission: Etherealize is building for the next era of finance—where Wall Street merges with Ethereum. (1/12) pic.twitter.com/mlmqBDmAHH — Etherealize (@Etherealize_io) September 3, 2025 The raise comes as Ethereum sees renewed momentum among public companies. The Ether Machine, a crypto treasury firm planning a public listing, led this week’s accumulation with a 150,000 ETH buy , valued at $654 million. Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion Technologies, Ethereum’s largest corporate holder, added another $65 million in ETH on Wednesday alone, per data from Arkham. Other firms followed suit. Sharplink Gaming and Yunfeng Financial disclosed ETH purchases worth $176 million and $44 million, respectively. Joseph Lubin Predicts 100x ETH Surge Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin believes ETH could rally 100x or more over time , calling it Wall Street’s future infrastructure as TradFi shifts toward decentralized finance. In an X post, Lubin said Ethereum will replace many siloed systems at institutions like JPMorgan and become the backbone for financial services, staking, and smart contract execution. Backing the bullish stance of Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, Lubin stated he’s “100% aligned” with Lee’s view that Ethereum could flip Bitcoin in network value. He compared the moment to 1971 when the U.S. dollar left the gold standard, signaling a tectonic shift in financial architecture led by Ethereum. Likewise, Lee has predicted that Ethereum will rally in the near term to $5,500 , with an ambitious year-end target of $12,000. During his August 26 guest appearance on the Amitis Investing program, Lee disclosed that institutional Wall Street sentiment toward Ethereum has shifted dramatically following the U.S. Senate’s passage of the GENIUS Stablecoin legislation . Lee emphasized that Ethereum is the foundational blockchain infrastructure for traditional finance (TradFi), currently supporting over $145 billion in stablecoin supply.

By press time, somETHing was trading at $0.03214, reflecting a 32.97% increase over the past day. During the same timeframe, the token’s trading volume spiked to $218,600, a notable jump from its typically low activity, with a market capitalization of $1.3 million. somETHing one-day price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Despite the surge, the token remains highly illiquid, with only 461.2 units traded and no unique traders, buyers, or sellers recorded. Why somETHing is pumping The sudden pump is in part linked to an X repost by Buterin of a July 31 post from Marius van der Wijden, a prominent figure in the Ethereum ecosystem. In the post titled “Believe in somΞing,” he shared an introspective message about his journey with the network as it marked its 10th anniversary. Vitalik Buterin’s repost of post on somETHing. Source: X Wijden’s post, which Buterin amplified, reflects on his journey since Ethereum’s inception in 2015. He highlighted his role in the Ethereum Foundation and his contributions to the network’s development, including the successful execution of ‘The Merge’ upgrade in 2022 . Notably, the post’s nostalgic tone and emphasis on Ethereum’s decentralized ethos seem to have resonated with the community, drawing attention to somETHing. Overall, the lack of sustained trading activity suggests speculative hype around Buterin’s repost drives the pump more than genuine demand. This phenomenon is not uncommon in the crypto space, where a single endorsement from a high-profile figure like Buterin can trigger notable short-term price movements.
