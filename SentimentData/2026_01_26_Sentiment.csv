The Treasury Secretary said Sunday that Carney’s latest deal with Beijing is a flat-out reversal of what Canada agreed to just months ago. He said this directly backs Donald Trump’s warning that Canada could face 100% U.S. tariffs if it keeps acting as a trade loophole for China. “The Canadians a few months ago joined the US in putting high steel tariffs on China because the Chinese are dumping,” Scott said on ABC’s This Week . “The Europeans also have done the same thing. And it looks like that Prime Minister Carney may have done some kind of about-face.” Canada lifts EV tariffs after deal with Xi This all started when Canada cut tariffs on 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles, dropping them from 100% to just 6%. That was part of a new arrangement Carney worked out with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Carney said he expects Beijing to respond by dropping restrictions on Canadian rapeseed imports. But Washington sees this as Canada handing China the keys to the North American supply chain. Scott warned that if Canada moves forward with a free trade deal with China, the U.S. will retaliate… hard. “We have a highly integrated market with Canada. The goods can cross across the border during the manufacturing process six times. And we can’t let Canada become an opening that the Chinese pour their cheap goods into the U.S.,” he said. Trump already put out a message on Truth Social. “If Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a ‘Drop Off Port’ for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,” Trump posted Saturday. The White House isn’t just talking either. They’re already reviewing which Canadian goods could get slapped with new penalties. Cars are top of the list. Scott also said China could get hit with fresh tariffs too if this agreement expands beyond the current scope. Davos speech sparks tension as new USMCA talks approach The timing is brutal. Carney’s deal comes just ahead of planned talks to renegotiate the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement this summer. Scott didn’t say how this China move would affect that, but it’s now clear tensions are running hot. Canada’s trade minister Dominic LeBlanc tried to calm things down Saturday, saying there’s no free trade deal with China in the works. He claimed the Carney-Xi agreement is about ending tariff disputes, not opening the floodgates. But that hasn’t stopped the criticism. Part of the heat is coming from a speech Carney gave at the World Economic Forum in Davos. He told world leaders to start “naming reality,” quoting Czech dissident Václav Havel, and warning against lies about how the world works. While Carney didn’t name the U.S. directly, he took clear aim at American tactics, blasting “tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, and supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited.” Scott wasn’t impressed. “I’m not sure what Prime Minister Carney is doing here, other than trying to virtue-signal to his globalist friends at Davos,” he said. This clash isn’t just about words. Carney has previously tried to cool things down with Trump by removing retaliatory tariffs and apologizing for an anti-tariff ad out of Ontario. But this time, the damage might be harder to walk back. Both Carney and Trump are attending the same summit this week, but no meeting has been confirmed. Carney is leaving the day Trump arrives. Either way, Canada’s sudden China shift is now a front-row issue for U.S. trade hawks. And Scott made it clear: if it keeps up, Washington is ready to hit back.

Experts See This New Crypto Outperforming Cardano (ADA),https://www.cryptopolitan.com/next-crypto-to-hit-1-experts-see-this-new-crypto-outperforming-cardano-ada/,"As new cycles form, traders often shift between mature assets and early-stage utility tokens. Mature assets offer stability but slower repricing. Early assets offer higher potential upside if utility arrives on schedule. Analysts say this rotation has already begun as participants search for the next crypto with room to appreciate during the next two-year window. Cardano (ADA) Cardano ADA still holds a position among the top cryptocurrencies by valuation. It trades near $0.36 with a market cap of roughly $13B. The project saw strong early growth when smart contract capability arrived and community expectations surged. That period produced the majority of ADA’s long-term appreciation. Technical analysts now highlight resistance zones near the $0.40 to $0.45 region. Breakouts above these levels require heavy inflows due to liquidity saturation. ADA’s valuation size makes it behave like other mature assets where returns slow because large capital is required for meaningful price moves. Forward projections for ADA show more modest upside. Market commentators mention that ADA’s next cycle may generate single to low double-digit % increases if demand remains steady. While Cardano still benefits from network security and wide ownership, its early explosive phase has already played out. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sits in a very different part of the cycle. It is building a decentralized lending platform that supports supply-side yield and collateralized borrowing. The protocol design features two lending markets. One uses pooled liquidity where lenders earn APY through mtTokens and borrowers draw against available assets at set loan-to-value levels. The second matches users directly under collateral rules and liquidation safeguards. From the 4B token supply, 45.5% or roughly 1.82B tokens have been allocated for presale access. The presale started in early 2025 at $0.01. The current presale price is $0.04, marking a 300% appreciation for early participants. The project has raised $19.9M and onboarded 18,900 holders. A total of 830M tokens have been sold across multiple phases. Mutuum Finance also completed an audit with Halborn Security and holds a 90 out of 100 token scan score from CertiK, which analysts consider relevant for lending systems. Mature vs Early Utility Contrast The contrast between ADA and MUTM comes down to valuation and utility timing. ADA is mature, widely held and liquid. Its utility is known and fully priced. That leads to slower moves because upside must fight against valuation gravity. Some traders apply simple allocation logic to compare opportunities. For example, a $1,000 position in ADA at $0.36 yields roughly 2,777 ADA. If ADA moves to $0.50 over time, the position gains $388. By contrast, a $1,000 purchase of MUTM at $0.04 yields 25,000 MUTM. As long as analysts’ bullish models of $0.20 to $0.30 during 2026 play out once V1 and Mainnet are operational, the position could appreciate between $5,000 and $7,500. Two paths illustrate how mature assets and early assets behave differently. Roadmap and Utility Catalyst Layer Mutuum Finance has its V1 protocol release scheduled for the Sepolia testnet in Q1 2026. V1 will include collateral management, liquidation logic and borrowing using ETH and USDT. The team also plans to introduce an overcollateralized stablecoin that allows users to mint without selling their assets. Oracles will feed pricing data into liquidation systems to prevent forced closures during volatility. Mainnet activation is expected to align with the official launch. Analysts argue that this phase tends to reprice new crypto assets because utility becomes measurable. ADA’s network already passed that sequence, while MUTM is moving into it. ADA remains a foundational asset with a slower return profile due to maturity and valuation size. MUTM sits in the early utility zone where pricing is still forming and catalysts are ahead rather than behind. That contrast explains why some analysts now place Mutuum Finance on lists for best crypto to invest in during the next cycle as traders search for the next crypto to hit $1 within a realistic utility framework.

This comes after years of tiptoeing around global markets and treating crypto like it was radioactive. Now, they want double the international clients and assets within five years. From 17 million clients outside America today, they want 40 million by 2031. The asset manager currently handles more than $12 trillion globally, making it the second-largest in the world. And it’s not slowing down. Salim Ramji, the firm’s new CEO, said there are “incredible opportunities” abroad as more governments start begging people to invest their savings instead of hoarding them in bank accounts. Vanguard joins UK push as it cuts fees and shifts toward global stocks Ramji said too many people in the UK and Europe keep their money in cash because investing is too expensive, too complex, and full of roadblocks. Governments are now trying to change that. In fact, Vanguard is one of 19 firms backing a UK government push to get savers off the sidelines and into the markets. Last week, Vanguard slashed fees on its £52 billion LifeStrategy fund range, a favorite among its retail users. They also pulled back on UK assets and added more international stocks into the mix, saying clients clearly wanted more global exposure. Chris McIsaac, who heads Vanguard’s international operations, said the firm has already doubled international assets in just three years, and at this pace, “it will take us another five to attract the next $1 trillion.” He added, “We see incredible opportunities in international markets. People are under-participating in capital markets. Index funds and ETFs are under-represented in investor portfolios in international markets.” It’s clear the playbook is working. Index funds and ETFs have exploded globally. That growth has been great for both Vanguard and BlackRock, who’ve been the main winners of the passive investing boom. But unlike BlackRock, Vanguard isn’t owned by shareholders. The people who own its funds are its owners. So when costs go down, it’s the investors who benefit. “The average Vanguard fee in Europe is 14 basis points,” Ramji said. “The average fee that the industry charges is 65 basis points.” In a race to the bottom on costs, that’s a big gap. Vanguard struggles to keep ignoring crypto after explosive ETF launches Here’s the part that’ll make crypto fans roll their eyes. Vanguard has always hated crypto. Flat-out refused to play. But they’re boxed in now. After watching crypto ETFs blow up across the market, even the giants have to pay attention. Back in late October, crypto ETFs tied to Solana and Hedera launched on other platforms. One of them, Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL), became the most successful ETF launch of 2025 across all sectors, according to Eric Balchunas at Bloomberg Intelligence. And the crypto wave started earlier. Since 2024, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have seen record inflows. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) alone holds around $66 billion in Bitcoin right now. The demand is there. The trading volume is massive. And Vanguard’s old anti-crypto stance looks more outdated by the day. For now, Vanguard hasn’t released its own crypto products. But that wall is starting to crack. With retail pressure and rising ETF competition, even the old-school index giant might have to cave. That would mark a hell of a U-turn.

They want fewer steps and a system where people can donate crypto with one click inside exchange apps. According to recent stats, South Korea has more than 10 million crypto investors and traders. The market is dominated by retail users trading Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins. Korean charities started accepting crypto donations because it is more regulated in the country. The Community Chest of Korea, also known as Fruit of Love, is one of the charities that began accepting crypto donations, according to local media outlets. Donating crypto is a complex process in South Korea To donate crypto in Seoul, donors must go through six steps. First, they have to call the charity to say they want to donate. Next, donors must fill out a form. The form asks for personal details, the reason for the donation, which crypto they are donating, and how much of that crypto they will give. There is no minimum or maximum amount. After that, the charity reviews the donation. This is done to make sure the money is not illegal. If the donation is approved, the charity chooses a donation date and gives the donor a wallet address to send the coins. But not every crypto and exchange is accepted. The selected crypto coin must be listed on at least three major Korean exchanges. Currently, there are five major crypto exchanges in the country, including Upbit , Bithumb, Korbit, Coinone, and Gopax. Charities measure crypto donations in coins, not in won Another issue that makes crypto donations complex is how donations are measured. Donors do not donate by value, like 100,000 Korean won worth of Bitcoin. Instead, they donate by coin amount, such as 0.01 BTC. Once that number is set, it cannot be changed. If the price goes up or down, the donation value changes too. To change the amount, the donor must start the whole process again. This makes price swings a major risk. After receiving the crypto, the charity sells it almost immediately. Large amounts may be sold in parts, but usually within two days. Donors receive a receipt, and the donation qualifies for tax deductions, just like a normal cash donation. Even with these benefits, most people still sell their crypto and donate cash instead. It is faster and simpler. That is why direct crypto donations are rare in South Korea. Last year, the Fruit of Love charity received 1 bitcoin in crypto donations. The Korean Red Cross and Seoul National University Hospital received 1 bitcoin in donations each from the same person. In other countries, crypto donations are simpler and more common. The United States began allowing Bitcoin donations for political purposes as early as 2014, and in 2024, crypto donations there reached about $688 million. Charities across Europe, including in France, have opened their doors to digital asset gifts, with more than 1,300 organizations now accepting crypto. In the Middle East, Dubai charities have started accepting cryptocurrency donations under a new digital-asset giving framework. Major international nonprofits such as UNICEF and the Rainforest Foundation also accept crypto contributions globally. One-click crypto donations are faster, and without them, crypto donations are likely to stay uncommon in South Korea.

The research partner argues that the timeline for cryptographically relevant quantum computers remains distant and that premature migration to post-quantum cryptography could introduce more immediate risks than the theoretical danger itself. Is blockchain facing a quantum threat right now? In a detailed blog post that was also shared on X, Thaler challenged what he described as frequently exaggerated predictions about quantum computing capabilities. He defined a cryptographically relevant quantum computer as a fault-tolerant machine capable of breaking the secp256k1 elliptic curve used in Bitcoin and Ethereum, or RSA-2048 encryption, within approximately one month. Thaler wrote, “We are nowhere near a cryptographically relevant quantum computer by any reasonable reading of public milestones and resource estimates.” Based on publicly available milestones, Thaler assessed such a breakthrough in the 2020s as highly unlikely, pointing to the U.S. government’s 2035 target for widespread post-quantum cryptography adoption in federal systems as a more reasonable planning horizon. However, he stated that “it is not a forecast that a cryptographically relevant quantum computer will exist by then.” The a16z position distinguishes between different categories of cryptographic systems and their respective vulnerabilities. While Thaler acknowledged that post-quantum encryption demands immediate deployment due to harvest-now-decrypt-later (HNDL) attacks already underway, he stated that digital signatures used in Bitcoin and Ethereum face no such risk because blockchain data is inherently public. Zero-knowledge proofs generated before quantum computers arrive would also remain trustworthy, he said. What are blockchain stakeholders doing about the quantum threat? While Thaler makes his submission on what stakeholders should be prioritizing, players in the blockchain space have been making moves in preparation for the post-quantum phase, with the Ethereum Foundation announcing a newly formed post-quantum team . Coinbase has also created an independent advisory board on quantum computing and blockchain. The board comprises industry experts and researchers, one of whom is Justin Drake of the Ethereum Foundation. The board is tasked with assessing the implications of quantum computing for the blockchain ecosystem and providing clear, independent guidance to the broader community. Franklin Bi, general partner at Pantera Capital, reacted to the Ethereum Foundation’s PQ team announcement by stating that blockchain systems may be better prepared to adopt and adapt to the post-quantum phase compared to traditional financial institutions on Wall Street. He wrote , “People are over-estimating how quickly Wall Street will adapt to post-quantum cryptography. Like any systemic software upgrade, it’ll be slow & chaotic with single points of failure for years. Traditional systems are only as strong as their weakest links.” In making his case for blockchains, he stated, “Equally, people are under-estimating the unique ability of blockchains to enact a system-wide software upgrade at global scale,” adding that if done successfully and timely, blockchain networks can evolve into post-quantum “safe havens” for data and assets. What does Thaler recommend? Thaler left some recommendations stating that all stakeholders, companies, governments, and policymakers should “take the quantum threat seriously,” but added that they should not “act under the presumption that a cryptographically relevant quantum computer will arrive before 2030.” He stated that stakeholders should deploy hybrid encryption immediately, especially in places where long-term confidentiality matters and costs are tolerable. Thaler also wrote that “Blockchains don’t need to rush post-quantum signatures — but should start planning now.” For privacy chains that encrypt or hide transaction details, Thaler stated that they should prioritize a transition sooner if performance is tolerable. Another point that he reiterated is that stakeholders should prioritize implementation security and not quantum threat mitigation in the near term. He called for more funding for quantum computing development while also trying to get people to treat new information as progress reports to critically assess, not prompts for abrupt action for now. Thaler acknowledged that there will be innovations and developments that may shorten the timelines, but also said bottlenecks may also arise that may push the timeline forward.

Foreign Minister Anita Anand said the government will keep pushing to reduce its reliance on the United States, despite fresh tariff threats from President Donald Trump . The message from Ottawa is that trade diversification stays on track, and outside pressure will not rewrite that plan. President Donald Trump, now the 47th U.S. president, fired off a post on social media on Saturday aimed at Prime Minister Mark Carney. He said he would impose a 100% tariff on all goods if Canada turns into what he called a “drop off port” for Chinese exports heading into the U.S. The post came after a new agreement where Canada agreed to lower tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles in exchange for food trade relief, including canola and beef. Trump threatens tariffs after China-linked trade shift Anand responded by shutting down talk of a broader China deal. She said the country is not negotiating a free trade agreement with Beijing. She said the government is acting out of necessity, not ideology. The plan is to double non-U.S. exports within ten years. She said the economy needs protection, and trade diversification is a key part of that goal. “We need to protect and empower the Canadian economy, and trade diversification is fundamental to that,” Anand said . “That is why we went to China, that’s why we will be going to India, and that is why we won’t put all our eggs in one basket.” Energy Minister Tim Hodgson is already moving on that plan. He is traveling to Goa in western India for an energy conference. He will also meet officials from the Indian industry and the government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Talks are expected to cover cooperation on critical minerals, uranium, and liquefied natural gas. Canada holds large reserves of all three. Carney is planning his own visit to India soon, followed by a trip to Australia in March. U.S.-Canada trade ties face strain but remain massive Anand also said the relationship with Washington remains strong. She said she expects that to continue, even with ongoing tariff disputes. The numbers back up how deep the ties run. The U.S. exported about $280 billion in goods to Canada in the first ten months of last year. That was more than it sold to any other country. During the same period, the U.S. imported $322 billion in goods from Canada, based on Commerce Department data. The auto sector sits at the center of that link. Manufacturing on both sides of the border is tightly connected. That is one reason the China electric vehicle deal caused anger in Washington. The agreement allows just 49,000 Chinese EVs per year, but it still hit a nerve. “We have a highly integrated market with Canada,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday on ABC’s This Week . “The goods can cross the border during the manufacturing process six times. And we can’t let Canada become an opening that the Chinese pour their cheap goods into the US.” Economists say the risk from a real break is not equal. A major trade rupture would hit Canada harder due to its smaller and less diversified economy. “If there were 100% tariffs on Canada, it would be a disaster. I guess my question would be, what’s the likelihood of that happening?” said Randall Bartlett, deputy chief economist at Desjardins Group. Bartlett added that Trump often issues tariff threats and later reverses course, saying the chance of full tariffs is low. Trump continued posting on Sunday, again linking China to Canada, writing on Truth Social: “China is successfully and completely taking over the once Great Country of Canada. So sad to see it happen.

57465059,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=265186,1769379011,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Generative AI Ban: Science Fiction Writers and Comic-Con Take Definitive Stand Against Artificial Creativity,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/science-fiction-comic-con-ai-ban/,"BitcoinWorld Generative AI Ban: Science Fiction Writers and Comic-Con Take Definitive Stand Against Artificial Creativity In a decisive move that reverberated through creative communities worldwide, major science fiction institutions and pop culture conventions implemented sweeping bans against generative AI content in early 2025, marking a pivotal moment in the ongoing debate about artificial intelligence’s role in human creativity. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association (SFWA) and San Diego Comic-Con established clear, uncompromising policies that prohibit AI-generated material from their prestigious awards and exhibitions, reflecting growing concerns about authenticity, artistic integrity, and the fundamental nature of creative expression in the digital age. Nebula Awards Implements Strict Generative AI Ban The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association faced significant controversy when it initially attempted to establish nuanced guidelines for AI usage in its prestigious Nebula Awards. According to association documents reviewed in January 2025, SFWA’s Board of Directors first proposed requiring disclosure rather than prohibition for works created with large language model assistance. This approach generated immediate backlash from members who viewed any AI involvement as fundamentally incompatible with authentic creative achievement. Following intense member feedback documented in Jason Sanford’s Genre Grapevine newsletter, SFWA completely reversed its position within days. The organization issued a formal apology and implemented what industry analysts now describe as one of the strictest AI policies in literary awards. The revised rules explicitly state that works “written, either wholly or partially, by generative large language model tools are not eligible” for Nebula consideration. Defining Creative Boundaries in the AI Era The SFWA controversy highlighted complex questions about where to draw boundaries between acceptable digital tools and prohibited AI assistance. Many professional writers now utilize word processors with built-in AI components for grammar checking and basic editing. Research tools increasingly incorporate language model technology for information gathering and organization. SFWA’s final policy attempts to distinguish between these accepted digital aids and what it terms “generative” AI involvement in the actual creative process. Industry experts note that this distinction remains challenging to enforce consistently. As Sanford observed in his analysis, “If you use any online search engines or computer products these days, it’s likely you’re using something powered by or connected with an LLM.” This technological reality creates practical difficulties for award administrators who must determine whether specific tools cross into prohibited territory. Comic-Con’s Quiet Policy Shift on AI Art Parallel developments occurred in the visual arts community when San Diego Comic-Con, the world’s largest pop culture convention, faced artist protests over its initially permissive AI art policy. Convention records show that for several years, Comic-Con had allowed AI-generated artwork in its exhibition spaces but prohibited its sale. This compromise position became increasingly untenable as AI art generation tools improved dramatically throughout 2024 and early 2025. Artists participating in the convention’s prestigious art show organized formal complaints after discovering the permissive policy. Their concerns centered on several key issues: Originality preservation: Maintaining the value of human-created artwork Copyright integrity: Addressing unresolved legal questions about AI training data Economic protection: Safeguarding artists’ livelihoods against automated competition Creative authenticity: Preserving the human connection in artistic expression In response to these concerns, Comic-Con art show director Glen Wooten implemented a complete ban in February 2025. According to correspondence shared with participating artists, Wooten acknowledged that while the previous policy had served as an effective deterrent, “the issue is becoming more of a problem, so more strident language is necessary: NO! Plain and simple.” The Broader Creative Industry Context These developments represent part of a larger pattern across creative industries. Music distribution platform Bandcamp implemented similar AI content restrictions in late 2024. Major publishing houses have begun developing internal AI usage policies. Film and television production companies face increasing pressure from writers’ and actors’ unions to establish clear boundaries around AI-generated scripts and performances. The table below illustrates how different creative sectors have approached AI regulation: Industry Sector AI Policy Approach Implementation Date Science Fiction Writing Complete prohibition for awards January 2025 Comic Convention Art Exhibition and sales ban February 2025 Music Distribution Platform-wide content restriction November 2024 Traditional Publishing Disclosure requirements developing Ongoing Film Production Union negotiations in progress 2025 negotiations Technological Realities Versus Creative Ideals The tension between rapidly advancing AI capabilities and traditional creative values represents one of the defining cultural conflicts of the mid-2020s. Generative AI tools now demonstrate remarkable proficiency in mimicking human creative output across multiple domains. These systems can produce coherent narratives, generate visually compelling artwork, compose original music, and even develop complex character arcs that superficially resemble human creation. However, critics like Sanford argue that this technical proficiency masks fundamental creative deficiencies. In his analysis of the SFWA controversy, he stated that he refuses to use generative AI in his fiction writing “not only because of this theft but also because the tools are not actually creative and defeat the entire point of storytelling.” This perspective reflects widespread concern that AI-generated content, while technically impressive, lacks the authentic human experience, emotional depth, and cultural context that define meaningful art. Legal and Ethical Considerations The creative industry’s AI skepticism connects to unresolved legal questions about training data and copyright. Many generative AI systems train on vast datasets of existing creative works, often without explicit permission from or compensation to original creators. Several high-profile lawsuits filed in 2024 challenged this practice, arguing that it constitutes systematic copyright infringement on an unprecedented scale. These legal challenges have created uncertainty throughout creative industries. Award organizations like SFWA face pressure to establish clear ethical positions while courts gradually develop legal precedents. Their decisions reflect not just artistic preferences but also risk management considerations in an evolving legal landscape. Economic Implications for Creative Professionals The AI bans implemented by SFWA and Comic-Con carry significant economic implications for working creatives. By establishing clear boundaries against AI-generated content, these policies help protect human creators from automated competition in prestigious venues and award competitions. This protection matters particularly for emerging artists and writers who rely on recognition and exhibition opportunities to build their careers. Industry analysts note several economic effects already emerging from these policies: Market differentiation: Human-created work gains premium status Career protection: Emerging creators face less automated competition Value preservation: Artistic authenticity maintains economic value Industry standards: Clear guidelines reduce market confusion These economic considerations intersect with broader questions about technological displacement across creative professions. While some analysts predicted widespread AI replacement of human creatives, the strong institutional resistance demonstrated by SFWA and Comic-Con suggests that human creativity may retain distinctive value that audiences and institutions continue to prioritize. Conclusion The generative AI bans implemented by science fiction writers and Comic-Con represent a watershed moment in the relationship between technology and creativity. These decisions reflect deep-seated concerns about artistic authenticity, economic fairness, and the fundamental nature of human expression in an increasingly automated world. While AI technology continues advancing rapidly, major creative institutions have drawn clear boundaries that prioritize human creativity over algorithmic generation. The ongoing debate about AI’s role in creative industries will likely intensify throughout 2025 as technology improves and institutional responses evolve. What remains clear is that human creativity maintains distinctive value that major cultural institutions continue to recognize and protect through policies like the generative AI ban. FAQs Q1: What exactly did SFWA ban regarding AI? The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association prohibited any work “written, either wholly or partially, by generative large language model tools” from eligibility for its prestigious Nebula Awards, implementing one of the strictest AI policies in literary awards. Q2: Why did Comic-Con change its AI art policy? San Diego Comic-Con changed from allowing AI-generated art exhibition (but not sales) to a complete ban after artists protested, with art show director Glen Wooten stating that “more strident language is necessary” as AI art generation became more prevalent and problematic. Q3: How do these bans affect writers using standard writing software? The policies aim to distinguish between accepted digital tools (like grammar checkers in word processors) and prohibited generative AI involvement in the creative process, though this distinction presents practical challenges for enforcement. Q4: Are other creative industries implementing similar AI restrictions? Yes, music platform Bandcamp implemented AI content restrictions in late 2024, and other creative sectors including publishing and film production are developing their own AI usage policies amid similar concerns. Q5: What are the main arguments against AI in creative work? Critics argue that AI-generated content lacks authentic human experience and emotional depth, raises copyright concerns regarding training data, threatens artists’ livelihoods through automated competition, and fundamentally misunderstands the human nature of creative expression.

William Panzera, 53, of North Haledon, New Jersey, was sentenced following his conviction for drug trafficking conspiracy and international promotional money laundering conspiracy. Counterfeit Pills, Real Fentanyl According to court documents and statements made in court, Panzera was a member of a drug trafficking organization responsible for importing and distributing hundreds of kilograms of fentanyl analogues and other controlled substances. Prosecutors said Panzera and his co-conspirators agreed to import and distribute fentanyl analogues, MDMA, methylone, and ketamine. The drugs were sourced from suppliers in China and were distributed across New Jersey, both in bulk form and as counterfeit pharmaceutical pills that contained fentanyl analogues rather than legitimate medication. Authorities said the conspiracy resulted in the importation of more than a metric ton of fentanyl-related substances and other drugs into the United States. To pay for the shipments, members of the organization sent hundreds of thousands of dollars to China using a combination of wire transfers and Bitcoin (BTC). Panzera was convicted at trial in January 2025. The Justice Department stated that eight other defendants connected to the case have previously pleaded guilty. Fentanyl Trafficking on Dark Web This case comes as part of a broader crackdown on fentanyl trafficking and illicit drug networks coordinated by US and international authorities. In May 2025, the Department of Justice announced the results of Operation RapTor, a large-scale international law enforcement initiative targeting dark web drug markets. The operation led to the arrest of 270 individuals worldwide and the seizure of more than $200 million in cash and digital assets. According to the DOJ, the effort focused on vendors, buyers, and administrators involved in the online trafficking of opioids, particularly fentanyl, and other narcotics. Operation RapTor was conducted in coordination with law enforcement agencies from 10 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, South Korea, and Brazil, and was described as the largest takedown in the history of the agency’s Joint Criminal Opioid and Darknet Enforcement (JCODE) team. Authorities seized more than two metric tons of drugs, including 144 kilograms of fentanyl-laced substances, in addition to over 180 firearms. The investigation relied on intelligence gathered from previously dismantled darknet markets such as Nemesis and Tor2Door. The operation also saw the first use of sanctions by the Office of Foreign Assets Control as part of a JCODE action.

Global risks haven’t gone away, but people are shifting their money to places that still look steady. That’s why fund managers are packing up and buying back into Asia. Donald Trump, the 47th President of the United States, decided to pause his tariff threats against Europe over Greenland, and that helped calm some nerves. But even with that, there’s still tension in the Middle East and growing concern over what the U.S. is doing in Latin America. Fresh data from Bloomberg shows $3.3 billion has already gone into North and Southeast Asia stocks this January. That’s the biggest monthly haul since September. At the same time, global ETF flows into emerging markets hit $7.15 billion in the week ending January 16, and about 75% of that went straight into Asia-focused funds. Bonds aren’t being ignored either. In the same month, $3.7 billion has gone into debt markets in India, South Korea, Indonesia, and Thailand. Ray from Aberdeen Investments said, “Emerging Asia is positioned to outperform broader EM this year, even amid heightened geopolitical uncertainty.” He mentioned AI spending, credit conditions, and China’s role in the region. Ray also said Aberdeen had increased their exposure to emerging Asia, especially in Taiwanese and South Korean equities, because they expect those names to benefit directly from growth in the AI sector. Even with tensions between the U.S. and Europe pulling on the dollar, emerging-market stocks and currencies are pushing ahead. Latin America is getting a boost from rising commodity prices, but in Asia, it’s all about earnings potential. Traders are betting that tech-linked profits in the region will beat what they’re seeing elsewhere. China’s exports, trade surplus, and yuan steady the region Regional stocks are already up 6% in 2026, easily topping the 1.7% gain in the MSCI World Index. This is happening even while the Cboe Volatility Index, Wall Street’s panic signal, climbed to a two-month high last week. The strength is in earnings too. Bloomberg data shows forecasted earnings per share for companies in emerging Asia to jump by 30% over the next year. That crushes the 17% expected in Latin America and edges out the 29% forecast for Eastern Europe. Sophie from BNP Paribas Asset Management said, “Asia represents this pocket of diversification, with a good prospect for earnings.” She added that Chinese stocks don’t track global markets the way they used to before Covid. Meanwhile, China keeps holding the whole region steady. Its local economy might be under pressure, but exports are still strong. The country booked a record $1.2 trillion trade surplus. That’s not small. It’s also why China’s yuan is keeping regional currencies stable. Trade data shows currencies like the baht, ringgit, and Korean won are moving in step with the yuan, showing a correlation of 0.50 or higher over the last five years. That’s why people keep calling the yuan the regional anchor. Leonard from T. Rowe Price said, “The yuan is an anchor for regional FX stability,” and he expects it to keep climbing slowly as the trade surplus grows.

This decision follows former President Donald Trump’s explicit threat to impose 100% tariffs on Canadian exports should Ottawa proceed with Beijing negotiations. The announcement, first reported by Solidintel, represents a critical juncture in Canada’s foreign policy and economic strategy. Canada China FTA: The Strategic Retreat Prime Minister Mark Carney’s administration has confirmed the suspension of all formal free trade agreement discussions with China. Consequently, this decision reverses years of exploratory talks between Ottawa and Beijing. The Canadian government now prioritizes strengthening existing trade partnerships instead. Specifically, officials cite the need to maintain stable North American economic relations as paramount. Moreover, this strategic retreat reflects broader geopolitical realignments affecting global trade patterns. Canada’s trade relationship with China has evolved significantly over the past decade. Initially, bilateral trade reached approximately $100 billion annually before recent tensions. However, several factors have complicated deeper integration: n Security Concerns: Cybersecurity issues and intellectual property protection Human Rights: Ongoing diplomatic disagreements on multiple fronts Supply Chain Dependencies: Lessons from pandemic-era disruptions US Relations: Maintaining privileged access to American markets Trump’s Tariff Ultimatum and Its Implications Former President Donald Trump’s intervention via Truth Social fundamentally altered the negotiation calculus. His explicit threat promised devastating economic consequences for Canada. Specifically, 100% tariffs would target key Canadian export sectors. These include automotive products, agricultural goods, and manufactured items. Therefore, Canadian officials conducted urgent economic impact assessments following the warning. The potential damage from such tariffs would be substantial. For instance, consider these projected impacts on major Canadian industries: Industry Export Value to US Potential Tariff Impact Automotive $50 billion Complete market disruption Agriculture $30 billion Farm bankruptcy wave Energy $80 billion Pipeline project cancellations Manufacturing $40 billion Massive job losses Geopolitical Calculations and Expert Analysis Trade policy experts universally recognize Canada’s difficult position. Dr. Sarah Chen, Director of the North American Trade Institute, explains the strategic dilemma. “Canada faces a classic geopolitical trilemma,” she notes. “Simultaneously, the country cannot maintain full sovereignty while pursuing independent trade with China and preserving privileged US market access.” Consequently, Ottawa must choose between competing priorities carefully. Historical context illuminates this decision further. Previously, the Trudeau administration explored China trade diversification following USMCA renegotiations. However, changing global conditions have reduced that initiative’s feasibility. Meanwhile, the Biden administration maintained pressure on allies regarding China relations. Now, Trump’s explicit threats have created even stronger disincentives. Canada’s Alternative Trade Strategy Development The Carney government has developed a multi-pronged alternative approach instead. This strategy focuses on several key areas simultaneously. First, strengthening existing trade agreements remains the top priority. Second, diversifying partnerships beyond both China and the United States offers new opportunities. Third, domestic economic resilience building receives increased attention. Specifically, Canada now pursues several parallel initiatives: CPTPP Enhancement: Deepening ties with Pacific Rim partners EU-Canada CETA: Expanding the comprehensive economic agreement UK-Canada FTA: Finalizing post-Brexit trade arrangements ASEAN Engagement: Building Southeast Asian trade connections Domestic Innovation: Boosting Canadian technological sovereignty This diversified approach mitigates single-market dependency risks effectively. Additionally, it aligns with broader Western economic security initiatives. Furthermore, it maintains Canada’s commitment to rules-based international trade principles. China’s Response and Bilateral Relations Future Beijing has responded to Canada’s decision with measured disappointment. Chinese officials emphasize their continued interest in comprehensive trade agreements. However, they acknowledge geopolitical realities affecting negotiations. Meanwhile, existing Canada-China trade continues under current frameworks. These include various sectoral agreements and memoranda of understanding. The bilateral relationship now enters a new phase characterized by pragmatic engagement. Specifically, cooperation continues in areas of mutual interest including: Climate change initiatives and green technology Educational exchanges and research collaboration Limited agricultural trade and resource exports Multilateral forum coordination on global issues Nevertheless, comprehensive economic integration remains off the table currently. This limitation reflects structural realities in contemporary international relations. Moreover, it demonstrates how middle powers navigate great power competition carefully. Conclusion Prime Minister Mark Carney’s decision to shelve the Canada China FTA represents a pragmatic assessment of economic and geopolitical realities. The Trump tariff threat accelerated an existing strategic reevaluation process. Consequently, Canada now pursues diversified trade relationships while maintaining crucial US market access. This approach balances economic interests with security considerations effectively. Ultimately, the Canada China FTA suspension illustrates how middle powers navigate complex international environments in 2025. FAQs Q1: What exactly did Prime Minister Carney announce regarding China trade? Prime Minister Carney confirmed that Canada has no current plans to pursue a comprehensive free trade agreement with China. This decision follows former President Trump’s threat of 100% tariffs on Canadian exports if such an agreement proceeded. Q2: How would Trump’s proposed tariffs affect the Canadian economy? The 100% tariffs would devastate key Canadian export industries, particularly automotive, agriculture, energy, and manufacturing sectors. Economic models suggest potential GDP contraction of 3-5% and significant job losses across multiple provinces. Q3: Does this mean Canada will stop trading with China entirely? No, existing trade continues under current agreements. The decision specifically concerns a comprehensive free trade agreement that would significantly deepen economic integration beyond current levels. Q4: What alternatives is Canada pursuing instead of a China FTA? Canada is strengthening existing agreements like CETA with the EU, enhancing CPTPP participation, finalizing a UK trade deal, engaging ASEAN nations, and boosting domestic innovation to reduce external dependencies. Q5: Could Canada revisit China trade talks if US leadership changes again? While theoretically possible, experts believe structural factors beyond US politics make comprehensive China trade integration unlikely for Canada in the medium term, regardless of American administration changes.

This explosive declaration, made via his Truth Social platform, immediately sent shockwaves through diplomatic and economic circles across North America. Consequently, analysts now scrutinize the potential ramifications for trilateral relations between the United States, Canada, and China. Trump Tariff Threat: Analyzing the 100% Duty Warning In his social media post, Trump explicitly stated that China is “successfully and completely taking over Canada.” He further characterized any prospective trade pact as potentially “one of the worst in history.” This threat represents a significant escalation in rhetoric concerning North American trade policy. Historically, the United States has maintained a complex but largely cooperative trade relationship with its northern neighbor under the USMCA framework. Trade experts quickly contextualized the severity of a 100% tariff. Essentially, such a duty would double the cost of affected Canadian goods entering the United States overnight. For context, the average U.S. tariff rate on Canadian imports has typically ranged between 1-3% for most products under normal trade relations. Therefore, this proposed measure would be unprecedented in modern U.S.-Canada economic history. Historical Context of U.S.-Canada Trade Tensions This is not the first time trade tensions have flared between the two nations. During Trump’s first term, his administration imposed tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, citing national security concerns under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. Canada retaliated with equivalent duties on U.S. products. Ultimately, both sides reached a deal to lift those tariffs in 2019. However, the current threat is more severe in both scope and potential economic impact. The following table compares recent major U.S. tariff actions against allies: Year Action Average Rate Rationale Cited 2018 Steel/Aluminum Tariffs 25% / 10% National Security (Section 232) 2020 Digital Services Taxes Proposed 25% Unfair Trade Practices (Section 301) 2025 Threatened Canada Tariffs 100% (Proposed) Foreign Policy (China Relations) Canada’s Delicate Position Between Two Superpowers Canada finds itself in a challenging geopolitical position. The nation has long pursued a “diversification” strategy to reduce its overwhelming economic dependence on the United States, which accounts for approximately 75% of its exports. Simultaneously, China represents the world’s second-largest economy and a significant market for Canadian natural resources, particularly: Canola and agricultural products Potash and critical minerals Forestry and pulp products However, Canada’s relationship with China has been strained in recent years. Notably, diplomatic tensions arose after Canada’s 2018 arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou at the U.S.’s request. China subsequently detained two Canadian citizens, a move widely viewed as retaliation. Trade between the two nations has also faced disruptions, including Chinese restrictions on Canadian canola and meat imports. Economic Impact Analysis of Potential Tariffs A 100% tariff on Canadian exports to the U.S. would have immediate and severe consequences. The United States is Canada’s largest trading partner, with over $700 billion in bilateral goods and services trade annually. Key vulnerable Canadian export sectors include: Automotive Industry: Integrated supply chains would face catastrophic disruption. Energy Sector: Crude oil and natural gas exports could be severely impacted. Agriculture: Meat, dairy, and produce markets would face immediate price shocks. Economists from institutions like the C.D. Howe Institute and the Peterson Institute for International Economics have modeled similar scenarios. Their research suggests such protectionist measures typically result in: Higher consumer prices in the importing country Reduced competitiveness for domestic manufacturers relying on imported inputs Retaliatory measures that shrink overall trade volumes Long-term damage to diplomatic and economic alliances Legal and Political Framework for the Tariff Threat From a legal standpoint, a U.S. president possesses broad authority to impose tariffs under several statutes. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) grants the executive branch significant power to regulate commerce during a declared national emergency. Additionally, Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows for tariffs in response to foreign unfair trade practices. However, applying these tools against a close ally like Canada would represent a novel and controversial interpretation. Politically, the threat arrives during a sensitive period in North American relations. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) underwent its first formal review in 2024. While all parties generally affirmed the agreement’s benefits, underlying tensions regarding enforcement and interpretation persist. Furthermore, the U.S. presidential election cycle often influences trade rhetoric, making policy announcements particularly volatile. Expert Perspectives on Trade Policy Implications Trade policy analysts emphasize the systemic risks of such unilateral threats. Dr. Meredith Crowley, an international trade economist, notes, “History shows that tariff wars between integrated economies primarily generate economic losses without achieving strategic objectives. Supply chains have become so interconnected that punitive measures often backfire, harming industries in both countries.” Former Canadian trade negotiator Sarah Goldfarb adds, “Canada’s trade strategy has consistently sought balance. While economic diversification is prudent, any agreement with China would undoubtedly undergo rigorous scrutiny to ensure it aligns with national interests and existing commitments to allies.” These expert insights highlight the complex calculations facing policymakers in Ottawa. Potential Pathways and Diplomatic Resolutions Diplomatic channels between Washington and Ottawa remain active despite the public rhetoric. Several potential resolutions could defuse the situation. First, Canada might provide additional assurances regarding the scope and content of any discussions with China. Second, trilateral consultations under the USMCA framework could address underlying U.S. concerns. Third, the threat itself may serve as a negotiating tactic to secure other concessions in unrelated policy areas. International precedent also offers guidance. When the European Union pursued a comprehensive investment agreement with China in 2020, it faced pressure from multiple quarters. The EU ultimately proceeded but incorporated specific safeguards on labor standards and sustainable development. A similar model, with enhanced transparency and consultation with traditional allies, could provide a template for Canada. Conclusion The Trump tariff threat against Canada over a potential China trade deal underscores the fragile state of international trade relations in 2025. This development highlights the continuing geopolitical competition between the United States and China, with middle powers like Canada navigating increasingly difficult terrain. The core issue extends beyond simple economics into questions of sovereignty, alliance management, and strategic autonomy. Ultimately, the situation demands careful diplomacy and a clear-eyed assessment of long-term national interests by all parties involved. The coming months will reveal whether this Trump tariff threat evolves into concrete policy or recedes as rhetorical positioning. FAQs Q1: What specific Canadian products would face the 100% tariff? A1: Former President Trump’s statement did not specify particular products. Historically, broad tariff threats could apply to all Canadian exports or target specific strategic sectors like automotive, energy, or agriculture, depending on the final policy implementation. Q2: Does the U.S. president have legal authority to impose such tariffs? A2: Yes, U.S. law grants the executive branch significant trade policy powers. Statutes like the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and Section 301 of the Trade Act provide legal pathways, though using them against a close ally like Canada would be unprecedented and likely face legal challenges. Q3: How has the Canadian government officially responded? A3: As of this reporting, the Canadian government has acknowledged the statement and reaffirmed its right to pursue independent trade policy. Officials typically emphasize their commitment to rules-based trade and their strong economic partnership with the United States while consulting closely with stakeholders. Q4: What is the status of Canada’s trade negotiations with China? A4: Canada and China have engaged in exploratory talks on trade and investment for several years. No formal comprehensive trade agreement negotiations are currently active. Any potential deal would require extensive consultation and face significant domestic and international scrutiny. Q5: How would 100% tariffs affect American consumers and businesses? A5: American consumers would face higher prices for many goods, from automobiles to food products. U.S. manufacturers relying on Canadian components would see production costs surge, potentially making their products less competitive. Economic models predict job losses in interconnected industries in both nations.

Founded by alumni from Anthropic, Meta, OpenAI, xAI, and Google DeepMind, the company aims to address what it identifies as the most significant gap in current AI systems: the inability to coordinate people with competing priorities, track long-running decisions, and maintain team alignment over time. This ambitious initiative, announced in January 2026, represents a fundamental shift from question-answering models to social intelligence systems designed specifically for coordination challenges. The Coordination Gap in Current AI Systems Modern AI chatbots demonstrate remarkable proficiency in answering questions, summarizing documents, and solving mathematical equations. However, these systems primarily function as individual assistants rather than collaborative coordinators. They lack the capability to manage the complex dynamics of group decision-making, conflict resolution, and long-term project alignment. This limitation becomes particularly evident in enterprise environments where multiple stakeholders with competing priorities must reach consensus on critical decisions. The coordination challenge represents what many experts consider the next major frontier for foundation models. While current AI excels at information retrieval and code generation, it struggles with the nuanced social intelligence required for effective team collaboration. This gap has become increasingly apparent as companies transition from simple chat interfaces to more sophisticated AI agents that require integration into complex workflows. The Founders’ Vision for Social Intelligence Andi Peng, co-founder and former Anthropic employee, explains the company’s perspective: “We’re ending the first paradigm of scaling, where question-answering models were trained to be very smart at particular verticals. Now we’re entering what we believe to be the second wave of adoption where the average consumer or user is trying to figure out what to do with all these things.” This transition marks a significant evolution in how organizations and individuals interact with artificial intelligence systems. Eric Zelikman, CEO and former xAI researcher, provides concrete examples of the coordination problems Humans& aims to solve. “Like when you have to make a large group decision, often it comes down to someone taking everyone into one room, getting everyone to express their different camps about, for example, what kind of logo they’d like.” The team specifically recalls the time-consuming process of reaching consensus on their own startup’s logo, highlighting the universal nature of coordination challenges. Technical Innovation: Beyond Traditional Training Methods Humans& plans to develop a fundamentally new foundation model architecture specifically designed for social intelligence rather than information retrieval or code generation. The company’s approach involves innovative training methodologies that distinguish it from existing AI systems. Yuchen He, co-founder and former OpenAI researcher, reveals that the startup’s model will utilize long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL). Long-horizon RL trains models to plan, act, revise, and follow through over extended periods rather than generating one-off responses. Multi-agent RL prepares systems for environments where multiple AIs and humans interact simultaneously. Both approaches represent cutting-edge developments in AI research, moving language models beyond chatbot responses toward systems capable of coordinating actions and optimizing outcomes across numerous steps. The company emphasizes that its model needs to “remember things about itself, about you, and the better its memory, the better its user understanding.” This focus on contextual memory and personalized interaction represents a significant departure from current AI systems that typically treat each interaction as independent rather than part of an ongoing relationship. Market Context and Competitive Landscape The AI collaboration space has become increasingly competitive as companies recognize the limitations of current systems. Several high-profile voices have begun framing the next phase of AI as one of coordination rather than mere automation. LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman recently argued that companies implement AI incorrectly by treating it as isolated pilots rather than integrated coordination systems. He emphasizes that “AI lives at the workflow level, and the people closest to the work know where the friction actually is.” This perspective aligns with broader market trends. The startup AI note-taking app Granola recently raised $43 million at a $250 million valuation as it launched more collaborative features. Meanwhile, established players are making their own moves in the coordination space: Company Coordination Initiative Current Status Anthropic Claude Cowork for work-style collaboration Active development Google Gemini embedded into Workspace Widely deployed OpenAI Multi-agent orchestration and workflows Developer-focused Despite these competitive moves, none of the major players appear focused on rewriting their fundamental models based on social intelligence principles. This distinction potentially gives Humans& a unique advantage or makes it an attractive acquisition target for companies seeking specialized coordination capabilities. Product Strategy and Development Approach Humans& maintains an unconventional development strategy, designing its product in conjunction with its model rather than creating one before the other. Peng explains this approach: “Part of what we’re doing here is also making sure that as the model improves, we’re able to co-evolve the interface and the behaviors that the model is capable of into a product that makes sense.” This simultaneous development of model and interface represents a departure from traditional software development methodologies. The company has indicated its product could serve as a replacement for multiplayer or multi-user contexts like communication platforms (similar to Slack) or collaboration platforms (comparable to Google Docs and Notion). However, the team emphasizes they’re not building another model to plug into existing applications. Instead, Humans& aims to “own the collaboration layer” entirely, creating what Zelikman describes as “connective tissue” across organizations of any size. This connective tissue would theoretically understand the skills, motivations, and needs of each person within an organization while balancing these factors for collective benefit. The system would function equally well for 10,000-person enterprises or small family groups, adapting its coordination approach based on the specific social dynamics of each context. Funding and Resource Challenges The $480 million seed round represents one of the largest early-stage investments in AI history, reflecting both investor confidence and the substantial resources required for this ambitious project. Training and scaling new foundation models demand enormous computational resources and financial backing. Humans& will inevitably compete with established players for access to critical resources, particularly high-performance computing infrastructure. The company’s founding team brings exceptional pedigree from leading AI research organizations, but this advantage comes with significant expectations and competitive pressures. Major AI companies like Meta, OpenAI, and DeepMind actively pursue top talent through both hiring and acquisition strategies. While Humans& has reportedly turned away interested acquirers, stating they’re “not interested in being acquired,” the M&A risk remains substantial given the competitive landscape. Philosophical Foundation and Market Positioning Humans& positions itself philosophically as moving beyond the narrative that AI will replace human jobs. Instead, the company focuses on empowering human collaboration through intelligent coordination systems. This framing addresses growing concerns about AI’s impact on employment while positioning the technology as an enhancement rather than replacement for human capabilities. Zelikman articulates this vision clearly: “We believe this is going to be a generational company, and we think that this has the potential to fundamentally change the future of how we interact with these models. We trust ourselves to do that, and we have a lot of faith in the team that we’ve assembled here.” This confidence stems from both the technical expertise of the founding team and their shared conviction about the importance of social intelligence in AI development. Implementation Challenges and Technical Hurdles Developing AI systems with genuine social intelligence presents numerous technical challenges. Current models optimized for immediate user satisfaction and answer accuracy struggle with the nuanced understanding required for effective coordination. Zelikman notes that existing chatbots “ask questions constantly, but they do so without understanding the value of the question.” Humans& aims to create models that ask questions “in a way that feels like interacting with a friend or a colleague, someone who is trying to get to know you.” This requires fundamental changes to how models are trained and evaluated, moving beyond simple metrics to more complex assessments of social understanding and coordination effectiveness. The company must also address practical implementation challenges, including: Integration complexity with existing enterprise systems Data privacy and security concerns in collaborative environments User adoption barriers for new collaboration paradigms Scalability across different organizational sizes and structures Measurement of coordination effectiveness and social intelligence Industry Implications and Future Developments The emergence of AI coordination models represents a significant evolution in how organizations approach collaboration and decision-making. As companies increasingly recognize that “models are competent, but workflows aren’t,” the demand for intelligent coordination systems will likely grow substantially. This shift could transform enterprise software markets traditionally dominated by communication and collaboration tools. The academic momentum behind long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning suggests growing research interest in coordination capabilities. Recent papers from leading institutions increasingly explore how large language models can move beyond individual interactions toward systems that coordinate actions and optimize outcomes across multiple steps and participants. Industry observers will closely monitor several key developments in the coming months: Initial product demonstrations from Humans& Competitive responses from established AI companies Enterprise adoption patterns for coordination-focused AI Academic research breakthroughs in social intelligence modeling Regulatory considerations for AI systems in collaborative environments Conclusion The $480 million investment in Humans& signals growing recognition that AI coordination models represent the next frontier in artificial intelligence development. By focusing on social intelligence rather than information retrieval, the company aims to address fundamental limitations in current AI systems that hinder effective team collaboration and organizational coordination. While technical challenges remain substantial and competition intensifies, the potential impact of successful coordination AI could transform how organizations of all sizes make decisions, align teams, and achieve collective goals. As the AI industry evolves beyond question-answering models toward systems capable of genuine social intelligence, initiatives like Humans&’s coordination model development will likely play increasingly important roles in shaping the future of human-AI collaboration. FAQs Q1: What makes AI coordination models different from current chatbots? AI coordination models focus specifically on social intelligence and group dynamics rather than individual question-answering. They’re designed to manage competing priorities, track long-running decisions, and maintain team alignment over time using techniques like long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning. Q2: How will Humans&’s approach to training differ from existing AI companies? The company utilizes innovative training methodologies including long-horizon reinforcement learning (for planning and follow-through) and multi-agent reinforcement learning (for environments with multiple AIs and humans). This represents a departure from models optimized primarily for immediate user satisfaction and answer accuracy. Q3: What specific coordination problems can these models address? These systems can help with complex group decision-making, conflict resolution, project alignment across teams, consensus building, and maintaining organizational coherence over extended periods. Practical examples include logo selection processes, strategic planning sessions, and cross-departmental project coordination. Q4: How does the $480 million funding compare to other AI startups? This represents one of the largest seed rounds in AI history, reflecting both the substantial resources required for foundation model development and investor confidence in the coordination AI market. Typical AI startup seed rounds range from $5-50 million depending on the specific focus and team pedigree. Q5: What are the main competitive threats to Humans&’s success? Major challenges include competition for computational resources with established AI companies, potential talent acquisition by larger players, integration complexities with existing enterprise systems, and the fundamental technical difficulty of developing genuine social intelligence in AI systems.

57465513,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=265196,1769380811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Perpetual Preferred Stock: Strive’s Strategic Masterstroke to Fortify Financial Foundations,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/strive-perpetual-preferred-stock-finance/,"BitcoinWorld Perpetual Preferred Stock: Strive’s Strategic Masterstroke to Fortify Financial Foundations In a bold move reshaping corporate finance strategy within the digital asset sector, U.S.-based Strive Asset Management announced plans in early 2025 to issue perpetual preferred stock, fundamentally altering its capital structure and potentially setting a precedent for companies like MicroStrategy. This strategic pivot, first reported by CoinDesk, directly addresses the complex financial pressures facing firms with significant Bitcoin holdings and substantial convertible debt. The initiative aims to replace existing convertible bonds with a more flexible equity instrument, thereby enhancing financial resilience during volatile market cycles. Consequently, this development signals a maturation in how crypto-adjacent companies manage their balance sheets, moving beyond speculative accumulation to sophisticated treasury management. Strive’s Perpetual Preferred Stock Issuance Strive Asset Management has launched a detailed financial engineering effort to bolster its long-term stability. The firm initiated this process by issuing floating-rate Series A perpetual preferred stock, designated as SATA, at a price of $90 per share. Management plans to expand the total issuance to a maximum of 2.25 million shares, representing a significant capital raise. Crucially, accounting standards classify this perpetual preferred stock as equity on the balance sheet, not debt. This classification provides an immediate and substantial improvement to the company’s leverage ratios and debt-to-equity metrics. Furthermore, the structure offers enhanced financial flexibility by removing mandatory redemption dates. In exchange for relinquishing the conversion option typically found in convertible bonds, creditors receive several compelling benefits. These benefits include a high dividend yield, the perpetual nature of the instrument, and a priority claim on assets and dividends that ranks above common stockholders but below traditional debt holders. This arrangement creates a win-win scenario: the company strengthens its equity base, while investors gain a stable, income-generating asset with seniority. The Mechanics of Convertible Debt Restructuring To fully appreciate Strive’s maneuver, one must understand the instrument it seeks to replace: the convertible bond. Convertible debt is a hybrid security that functions as a corporate bond but grants the holder the right to convert it into a predetermined number of the company’s common shares. Companies often use these instruments to raise capital at lower interest rates, offering the conversion feature as a sweetener. However, this feature creates a potential future dilution of existing shareholders’ equity. Moreover, convertible debt carries a looming maturity date, requiring either repayment in cash or triggering conversion if the share price is favorable. In a rising interest rate environment or during equity market downturns, refinancing this debt can become prohibitively expensive or impossible. The following table contrasts the key features of the two instruments: Feature Convertible Debt Perpetual Preferred Stock (SATA) Balance Sheet Classification Liability (Debt) Equity Maturity Date Fixed (e.g., 5-7 years) None (Perpetual) Holder’s Right Conversion to Common Stock + Interest Fixed/Variable Dividend + Priority Claim Impact on Leverage Ratios Increases Leverage Decreases Leverage Seniority in Liquidation Senior to Equity Senior to Common Stock, Junior to Debt Therefore, by executing this swap, Strive effectively removes a future liability and potential dilution event from its books. Simultaneously, it locks in long-term capital that does not pressure cash flows with a principal repayment deadline. This strategic shift is particularly prudent for asset managers navigating the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency markets. MicroStrategy’s $8.3 Billion Debt Dilemma The report from CoinDesk explicitly suggests Strive’s model could present a viable solution for MicroStrategy, the enterprise software company turned Bitcoin development company. MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy, led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, has been largely funded through the issuance of convertible debt. As of early 2025, the company holds approximately $8.3 billion in convertible notes. The largest portion of this debt is a particularly challenging $3 billion tranche. This specific tranche contains a put option exercisable in June 2028, allowing bondholders to demand repayment. Its conversion price is set at $672.40 per MicroStrategy share, a figure nearly 300% above the company’s trading price in early 2025. This massive gap makes conversion highly unlikely before the put date, potentially forcing MicroStrategy to find $3 billion in cash to repay the noteholders. Consequently, analysts and investors are closely monitoring the company’s strategy for addressing this looming obligation. Strive’s pioneering use of perpetual preferred stock offers a potential blueprint for a liability management exercise that could avert a liquidity crisis. Broader Implications for Crypto-Corporate Finance Strive’s action reflects a broader trend of maturation within the cryptocurrency industry. After years of focus on accumulation, leading firms are now prioritizing financial sustainability and strategic capital management. This perpetual preferred stock issuance follows Strive’s January 22, 2025, announcement that it sought to raise an additional $150 million specifically to purchase Bitcoin. Viewed together, these moves depict a coherent strategy: use equity-like, non-dilutive perpetual instruments to strengthen the balance sheet, thereby creating a more robust platform for continued digital asset acquisition. Additionally, this model could influence other public companies with significant crypto treasuries. Firms like Tesla, Block, and various mining companies hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets and may face similar scrutiny regarding their funding strategies. A successful execution by Strive could demonstrate to capital markets and rating agencies that crypto-heavy firms can employ sophisticated, traditional financial tools to de-risk their operations. This demonstration is vital for attracting a broader class of institutional investors who have been wary of the sector’s perceived financial fragility. Expert Analysis on Financial Flexibility Financial analysts specializing in alternative assets note that the perpetual preferred structure provides crucial breathing room. “In volatile sectors, eliminating debt maturity walls is paramount,” explains a veteran corporate debt strategist who requested anonymity due to firm policy. “By converting a dated liability into perpetual equity, Strive effectively immunizes itself against refinancing risk during a potential crypto bear market or a period of tight credit. The higher dividend cost is a prudent trade-off for existential safety.” Furthermore, the priority repayment feature over common stock makes the SATA shares attractive to income-focused funds that might otherwise avoid direct crypto exposure. This opens a new investor base for the company. The move also aligns with post-2023 regulatory guidance encouraging clearer distinction between debt and equity on corporate balance sheets, especially for firms engaged in novel asset classes. Conclusion Strive Asset Management’s initiative to issue perpetual preferred stock represents a significant evolution in corporate finance strategy for the digital asset era. By proactively restructuring its convertible debt into a more resilient equity instrument, Strive enhances its financial flexibility, improves key leverage metrics, and sets a potential precedent for peers like MicroStrategy. This strategic masterstroke addresses the core challenge of funding long-term Bitcoin strategies without the overhang of massive, near-term debt maturities. As the cryptocurrency market continues to integrate with traditional finance, such sophisticated balance sheet management will likely become a standard differentiator between thriving enterprises and those vulnerable to cyclical downturns. The success of this perpetual preferred stock offering will be closely watched as a bellwether for the sector’s financial maturity. FAQs Q1: What is perpetual preferred stock? Perpetual preferred stock is a type of equity security that pays a fixed or variable dividend and has no maturity date. It ranks above common stock in dividend payments and asset claims during liquidation but is typically junior to all forms of debt. Q2: Why is Strive replacing convertible bonds with this stock? Strive aims to improve its financial structure by converting debt (convertible bonds) into equity (preferred stock). This swap improves leverage ratios, removes refinancing risk associated with a maturity date, and provides permanent capital to support its operations and Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Q3: How could this affect MicroStrategy? MicroStrategy holds $8.3 billion in convertible debt, with a $3 billion portion coming due in 2028. If conversion is unlikely, the company faces a large cash repayment. Strive’s model offers a potential template for MicroStrategy to restructure this liability into a more manageable perpetual equity instrument, averting a potential liquidity crunch. Q4: What are the benefits for investors buying this preferred stock? Investors receive a higher, typically fixed dividend yield, priority over common stockholders, and a perpetual income stream. They exchange the potential upside of conversion (from a convertible bond) for greater income stability and seniority. Q5: Does this move indicate a shift in crypto company strategy? Yes. It signals a shift from aggressive, debt-fueled asset accumulation to more sustainable balance sheet management. The focus is now on financial resilience and using traditional corporate finance tools to secure long-term stability amidst market volatility.

This integration, first documented in January 2026, represents a potentially troubling cross-pollination between mainstream AI systems and ideologically-driven knowledge bases. Consequently, researchers and journalists now scrutinize how large language models select their training data and reference materials. The situation highlights growing concerns about algorithmic bias in an increasingly polarized information ecosystem. ChatGPT’s Grokipedia Citations: Documented Evidence and Patterns The Guardian’s investigative reporting revealed that GPT-5.2, OpenAI’s latest iteration, cited Grokipedia in response to nine distinct queries during systematic testing. Interestingly, these citations did not appear for widely-debunked historical claims where Grokipedia’s inaccuracies have received public attention. Instead, the AI referenced the xAI encyclopedia for more obscure topics, including disputed claims about historian Sir Richard Evans that reputable sources had previously corrected. This selective citation pattern suggests either algorithmic weighting or training data peculiarities influencing source selection. Meanwhile, Anthropic’s Claude AI also demonstrates similar behavior, occasionally citing Grokipedia when responding to specific historical and political queries. This parallel development indicates potential industry-wide challenges in source vetting for AI training corpora. Both companies maintain they draw from diverse publicly available sources, but the inclusion of demonstrably biased material raises ethical questions about due diligence in content filtering. The Grokipedia Controversy: Origins and Content Analysis Elon Musk’s xAI launched Grokipedia in October 2025 following Musk’s persistent criticisms of Wikipedia’s alleged liberal bias. The encyclopedia, generated primarily by AI systems, immediately attracted scrutiny for its unconventional content approaches. While many articles appeared copied directly from Wikipedia with minimal alterations, others contained significant ideological departures from consensus scholarship. Medical Misinformation: Grokipedia entries suggested pornography contributed significantly to the AIDS crisis, contradicting established epidemiological research. Historical Revisionism: The platform presented ideological justifications for slavery and used denigrating terminology for transgender individuals. Source Transparency: Unlike Wikipedia’s rigorous citation requirements, Grokipedia often lacked verifiable sourcing for controversial claims. These characteristics aligned with earlier controversies surrounding xAI’s Grok chatbot, which had described itself as “Mecha Hitler” and was reportedly used to generate sexualized deepfakes on the X platform. The encyclopedia’s development reflected Musk’s broader critique of mainstream knowledge institutions while raising questions about replacing one potential bias with another. Expert Analysis: The Implications of AI Source Integration AI ethics researchers express concern about the normalization of ideologically-driven sources within mainstream language models. Dr. Elena Rodriguez, director of the Stanford Digital Ethics Lab, notes: “When AI systems incorporate controversial sources without clear disclaimers, they risk presenting biased information as neutral fact. This challenges fundamental principles of algorithmic transparency and user trust.” The technical implementation raises additional questions. Language models typically weight sources based on frequency, recency, and perceived authority within their training data. Grokipedia’s inclusion in ChatGPT’s responses suggests either intentional integration or insufficient filtering of newly available online sources. OpenAI’s statement about drawing from “a broad range of publicly available sources and viewpoints” acknowledges this approach but doesn’t address quality assessment mechanisms. Comparison: Wikipedia vs. Grokipedia Content Approaches Feature Wikipedia Grokipedia Editorial Process Community-reviewed with citation requirements AI-generated with limited human oversight Bias Management Neutral point of view policy Explicitly conservative-leaning orientation Controversial Content Flagged and discussed on talk pages Presented without qualification Source Transparency Inline citations required Often lacks verifiable sourcing The Broader AI Landscape: Source Reliability Challenges This development occurs amidst increasing scrutiny of AI training data quality and diversity. Major language models traditionally trained on enormous web corpora containing both reliable and questionable sources. However, the deliberate inclusion of an ideologically-positioned encyclopedia represents a new dimension in source selection debates. Furthermore, the timing coincides with heightened regulatory attention to AI transparency requirements in both the European Union and United States. Industry analysts observe that AI companies face difficult balancing acts between content diversity and quality control. Completely excluding controversial sources might create echo chambers, while indiscriminate inclusion risks propagating misinformation. The optimal approach likely involves sophisticated source evaluation, clear labeling of contentious information, and user education about AI limitations. Currently, no industry standard exists for handling politically-charged source material in training data. Technical Implementation and Future Implications From a technical perspective, Grokipedia’s integration likely occurred through several potential pathways. The encyclopedia might have been included in web crawls for training data updates, or OpenAI might have intentionally incorporated it to broaden viewpoint diversity. Regardless of the mechanism, the outcome demonstrates how source selection decisions directly impact AI output quality and neutrality. Looking forward, this situation may accelerate development of source attribution standards and bias detection protocols within the AI industry. Some researchers advocate for “nutrition labels” indicating the ideological composition of training data, while others propose automated systems flagging potentially controversial claims. These developments will significantly influence public trust in AI systems as information sources across educational, journalistic, and research applications. Conclusion ChatGPT’s incorporation of Elon Musk’s Grokipedia represents a critical moment in AI development, highlighting unresolved challenges in source evaluation and algorithmic neutrality. As language models increasingly serve as primary information interfaces, their source selection processes require greater transparency and ethical consideration. The Grokipedia integration underscores the need for robust content evaluation frameworks that balance diversity with accuracy. Ultimately, this development emphasizes that AI systems reflect not only their algorithms but also the quality and character of their training materials, making source curation as important as model architecture in determining reliable outputs. FAQs Q1: What is Grokipedia and who created it? Grokipedia is an AI-generated encyclopedia developed by Elon Musk’s xAI, launched in October 2025. It was created in response to Musk’s criticisms of Wikipedia’s alleged liberal bias and contains content with conservative-leaning perspectives on various topics. Q2: How frequently does ChatGPT cite Grokipedia? According to The Guardian’s testing in January 2026, GPT-5.2 cited Grokipedia nine times in response to more than a dozen different questions. The citations appeared primarily for obscure historical claims rather than widely-debated topics where Grokipedia’s inaccuracies have been publicly documented. Q3: Are other AI systems using Grokipedia as a source? Yes, Anthropic’s Claude AI has also been observed citing Grokipedia when responding to certain queries. This suggests the phenomenon may reflect broader challenges in AI source evaluation rather than being specific to OpenAI’s systems alone. Q4: What controversial content does Grokipedia contain? Grokipedia has been criticized for containing medical misinformation about HIV/AIDS, ideological justifications for historical slavery, and denigrating terminology for transgender individuals. Many articles appear copied from Wikipedia, while others present significant departures from consensus scholarship. Q5: How has OpenAI responded to these findings? An OpenAI spokesperson told The Guardian that the company “aims to draw from a broad range of publicly available sources and viewpoints.” This statement acknowledges the inclusion of diverse sources but doesn’t specifically address quality assessment processes for controversial materials like Grokipedia.

The rotation toward lower-cost assets is not new. It often appears during accumulation periods when investors seek asymmetric returns without needing large capital. Analysts tracking early-cycle movements say a similar setup is emerging now for a group of tokens entering 2026 with different positioning and risk profiles. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin DOGE continues to hold its place as one of the most recognizable meme tokens on the market. It trades near $0.12 with a market cap of roughly $21B. DOGE’s large retail presence and long history make it a durable asset in speculative phases. Many traders include DOGE during risk-on periods due to its liquidity and cultural familiarity. However, DOGE has struggled to break above resistance zones near $0.15 to $0.17. Analysts attribute these barriers to liquidity saturation and valuation weight. Large inflows are required to force DOGE into higher pricing bands, and those inflows typically only appear during strong retail-driven phases. While upside is possible, forward projections tend to be more modest due to DOGE’s size and mature ownership profile. Cardano (ADA) Cardano ADA trades near $0.36 with a market cap close to $13B. It remains positioned as one of the top cryptocurrencies in terms of governance and development. ADA saw a major appreciation window during earlier cycle phases when smart contract support went live and community interest peaked. Today, many chart analysts highlight resistance zones between $0.40 and $0.45. Breaking through those levels may require new utility demand or broader market tailwinds. Cardano is often categorized as a steady asset with slower repricing because a large, diverse holder base resists rapid directional moves. Return models for ADA tend to show smaller % increases over multi-year windows compared to early-stage assets still undergoing discovery. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sits in a different segment of the market. The protocol began MUTM distribution in early 2025 at $0.01 and now sits at $0.04 in its presale phase, marking a 300% appreciation for initial participants. The project has raised $19.9M, onboarded 18,900 holders and sold 830M tokens. From the 4B supply, 1.82B tokens or 45.5% are allocated for presale onboarding. Phase 7 is now underway with more than 6% of the phase already allocated and a planned launch price near $0.06. Unlike DOGE and ADA, Mutuum Finance is still preparing to activate its core utility. It is building a decentralized lending system that supports supply-side yield through mtTokens and collateralized borrowing. Borrowers generate fees that flow into the protocol economy, linking demand to revenue instead of sentiment. Why Analysts See MUTM as a Strong 2026 Candidate Analysts contrasting mature assets with early-stage assets often cite return asymmetry. DOGE and ADA are considered mature with slower repricing. MUTM remains early and has unpriced utility ahead of it. This difference creates divergent forward paths. To illustrate, a $650 position in ADA at $0.36 yields roughly 1,805 ADA. If ADA climbs to $0.50 over time, the position grows by $251. A $650 position in DOGE at $0.12 yields roughly 5,416 DOGE. If DOGE reaches $0.18, the position adds $325. In contrast, a $650 presale allocation into MUTM at $0.04 yields 16,250 MUTM. As long as analysts’ bullish models of $0.20 during 2026 materialize once the protocol shifts into live utility, the position would be worth $3,250. The comparison illustrates why analysts categorize MUTM as a higher-upside candidate moving into the next cycle. V1 Launch and Security Foundation Mutuum Finance has confirmed that its V1 lending protocol is scheduled for the Sepolia testnet in Q1 2026. V1 will introduce collateral management, debt accounting, liquidation logic and borrowing for ETH and USDT. This step moves the project from conceptual into operational. Security is also a core component of the roadmap. Mutuum Finance completed an independent audit with Halborn Security and maintains a 90 out of 100 token scan score from CertiK. Analysts covering DeFi crypto protocols say security validation is one of the prerequisites for long-term usage because lending systems rely on oracle pricing, liquidation accuracy and automated collateral flows. That contrast between meme coins and MUTM explains why some researchers now place MUTM on shortlists for best crypto to invest in during 2026 and 2027 for participants seeking higher-growth exposure during the early utility window.

Tux Pacific, the company’s founder and CEO, said that the decision followed several business pivots and two rounds of layoffs. “After four hard years working in crypto, I decided that the best I could do has already been done: it was time to close up shop,” Pacific wrote , adding that the company had been working on a crypto automation platform similar to workflow tools like n8n and Zapier but with blockchain-specific features, including automated signing through threshold cryptography and artificial intelligence integrations. Entropy went from custody solution to crypto automation Entropy initially positioned itself as a decentralized alternative to centralized crypto custodians such as Fireblocks and Coinbase when it launched in 2021. Pacific, who identifies as transgender and has described themselves as an anarchist, founded the company after working at cryptography network NuCypher, where they developed expertise in advanced cryptographic techniques. The company raised $1.95 million in a pre-seed round in January 2022, followed by the $25 million seed round led by a16z in June 2022. Other investors included Coinbase Ventures, Robot Ventures, Dragonfly Capital, Ethereal Ventures, Variant and Inflection, as well as angel investors Naval Ravikant, Sabrina Hahn and James Prestwich. At the time of its fundraising, Pacific, a self-taught cryptographer, reportedly stated that the company did not yet have a defined business model but was focused on building technology that would allow users to maintain control over their digital assets while benefiting from advanced cryptographic security. However, the company appears to have struggled to find product-market fit as it pivoted to developing a crypto automation platform. After seeking feedback on this iteration, Pacific said it became clear the business model “wasn’t venture scale”, leaving a choice between finding “a creative way forward or pivot once more.” What is Pacific’s next move? In the same post that announced Entropy’s winding down, Pacific said they would be leaving the cryptocurrency industry entirely and moving into pharmaceutical research, specifically focusing on hormone delivery innovations for menopausal women and transgender women undergoing hormone replacement therapy. “My time in crypto might be coming to an end, as I feel myself drawn specifically into pharmaceuticals,” Pacific wrote, noting plans to validate research on new estradiol drug formulations while studying biophysics and organic chemistry. Pacific wrote that “a career is a practice: the goal is not the destination, but the journey of innovation.” Pacific thanked a16z and general partner Guy Wuollet for their support throughout the wind-down process, calling their guidance invaluable. The decision to return capital is not a first in the startup world, but it is also uncommon. Some founders may seek more funds to try out more pivots, seek acquisition, or operate until all the funds dry up. However, raising funds in 2025 may have proven difficult, as data showed that most investors cut checks, both big and small, for mostly late-stage startups. Early-stage startups and those who had not gained enough traction or market fit were mostly overlooked.

The technology company is introducing new designs, features, and pricing strategies, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The lineup features new MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs. The MacBook Pro to be redesigned with an OLED screen and touch support. And a new low-cost MacBook powered by an iPhone chip will be available in the market. This model would serve a role similar to the iPhone Air in the company’s smartphone lineup. Desktop users will have new Mac mini and Mac Studio options powered by new chips. A new Studio Display to be released after almost four years. The last Apple display was released in March of 2022. Apple is planning an epic year for Macs The breadth of launches could make 2026 Apple’s most significant year for Macs in some time. According to Gurman, the rollout is expected to begin early. The upgraded MacBook Pros, MacBook Airs, Mac Studio models, and a new Studio Display are scheduled for release in the first half of the year. The redesigned MacBook Pro is planned for later in 2026. Chip timing could complicate the lineup. Apple introduced the M5 chip in three products in October. The next-generation M6 chip may arrive earlier than expected, though some upcoming laptops may ship before it is ready. Apple previously released the M3 and M4 chips just five months apart. A faster cadence from Apple remains possible. The M5 base chip is integrated in the latest 14-inch MacBook Pro, the iPad Pro, and Apple Vision Pro. This chip features 28 billion transistors. The official transistors count for the M6 chip is not available yet. However, based on industry leaks, the M6 is expected to be built on TSMC’s 2-nanometer (2nm) process. The density increase to 2nm is projected to allow for approximately 15% higher chip density compared to the 3nm M5 chip. This suggests a major increase over the M4 and M5 chip generations. It could put the M6 chip in the range of over 100 billion transistors. Apple is not a computer or smartphone company. In its essence, Apple is a design company. Cook appoints a new head of hardware engineering The hardware changes come alongside a leadership change. Apple’s head of hardware engineering, John Ternus, now oversees the company’s hardware and software design teams. CEO Tim Cook quietly made the decision last week, expanding Ternus’s responsibilities. Apple has historically placed design and user experience at the center of its strategy. The tech design company has been led only by senior executives, including Jony Ive, Tim Cook, former COO Jeff Williams, and now Ternus. Ternus has long been viewed internally as a leading candidate to eventually succeed Cook. He gained a broader role last year, taking on product direction and increased visibility with the media. While there is little concrete evidence that a CEO transition is imminent, his expanded mandate has intensified succession speculation. Reports suggesting an early 2026 leadership change appear unlikely, Gurman noted . Other executives have been mentioned as potential successors. But based on Apple’s internal dynamics and Cook’s timeline, Sabih Khan, the company’s new chief operating officer, is seen as the only other plausible internal candidate. Cook remains firmly in control, with no immediate handoff underway. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The breakout above prior record highs signals a structural repricing of gold rather than a speculative spike, with analysts pointing to central bank accumulation, long-term inflation hedging, and weakening confidence in fiat currencies as key drivers behind the rally. Goldman Sachs Raises 2026 Gold Target to $5,400 Goldman Sachs has reinforced the bullish outlook by raising its 2026 gold price forecast to $5,400 per ounce, citing sustained demand from both private investors and central banks. The investment bank emphasized that recent buyers are unlikely to exit positions quickly, creating a higher price floor for gold over the medium term. According to Goldman’s commodities research team, central bank purchases, particularly from emerging markets remain a powerful structural force, while global investors increasingly view gold as a strategic hedge against geopolitical risk, fiscal imbalances, and long-term currency debasement. The bank also noted that anticipated rate cuts in coming years could further support gold by reducing real yields. David Roche: Gold Could Reach $6,000 on Central Bank Shift Veteran strategist David Roche, President of Quantum Strategy, has offered one of the more assertive institutional forecasts, suggesting gold prices could climb toward $6,000 per ounce if central banks continue reallocating reserves away from traditional currencies and into bullion. Roche argues that rising geopolitical fragmentation and declining trust in global monetary coordination are pushing policymakers toward tangible reserve assets. He has highlighted the growing preference for gold as a neutral store of value in a multipolar world, particularly among countries seeking to reduce exposure to the U.S. dollar. In this framework, gold is not merely a hedge, but a strategic monetary asset undergoing re-monetization. Wall Street: Institutional Support for Higher Gold Prices Across Wall Street, sentiment remains firmly constructive. Several major financial institutions now project gold prices well above historical norms over the next two years, reflecting a shift in long-term assumptions rather than short-term volatility. UBS aligns closely with Goldman Sachs, projecting gold prices around $5,400 per ounce, while Yardeni Research has outlined a bullish scenario targeting $6,000 amid persistent fiscal deficits and rising sovereign debt levels. Jefferies has published one of the most optimistic mainstream outlooks, suggesting gold could reach $6,600 per ounce if inflation risks and geopolitical instability remain elevated. Collectively, these forecasts indicate a growing consensus that gold’s role in global portfolios is expanding, driven by both defensive positioning and long-term strategic allocation. Robert Kiyosaki’s Long-Term Bull Case Outside traditional Wall Street analysis, investor and author Robert Kiyosaki continues to promote an aggressively bullish stance on gold. In recent posts on X, Kiyosaki has reiterated his belief that fiat currencies are entering a period of accelerated debasement, prompting investors to seek refuge in hard assets. Kiyosaki has publicly stated a long-term gold target as high as $27,000 per ounce, framing the metal as insurance against systemic financial risk rather than a conventional trade. While his projections fall well beyond institutional estimates, they reflect broader retail and alternative-investment sentiment supporting gold’s multi-year uptrend.",News|Reports,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-25 23:15:48

The post featured his signature “Saylor Tracker” chart alongside the phrase “Unstoppable Orange,” a clear reference to Bitcoin’s symbolic color and perceived market resilience. This development follows Saylor’s established pattern of similar social media activity preceding official announcements of Bitcoin acquisitions, generating significant speculation about MicroStrategy’s next strategic move in the digital asset space. Decoding Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin Purchase Signal Michael Saylor’s latest social media activity represents more than casual commentary. The “Saylor Tracker” chart he shared visually represents MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy over time. This chart typically displays the company’s BTC holdings against various market metrics. Furthermore, his “Unstoppable Orange” comment carries substantial symbolic weight within cryptocurrency circles. Orange has become Bitcoin’s unofficial color, representing its decentralized, open-source nature and resilience against traditional financial systems. Historically, Saylor has used similar coded language before confirming multi-million dollar Bitcoin purchases, making this post particularly significant for market observers. MicroStrategy’s corporate Bitcoin strategy has evolved considerably since its initial acquisition in August 2020. The company now holds approximately 226,331 BTC, purchased at an average price of $36,798 per Bitcoin according to their latest quarterly filing. This positions MicroStrategy as the largest publicly-traded corporate holder of Bitcoin globally. Their consistent accumulation strategy, often preceded by Saylor’s social media hints, has created a predictable pattern that market analysts now watch closely for signals of impending large-scale purchases. MicroStrategy’s BTC Accumulation Strategy Evolution MicroStrategy’s approach to Bitcoin investment has transformed corporate treasury management. Initially beginning as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, their strategy has matured into a comprehensive digital asset conversion plan. The company regularly uses various financial instruments, including convertible notes and excess cash flow, to fund additional Bitcoin purchases. This methodical approach has allowed them to accumulate Bitcoin consistently while managing corporate financial obligations effectively. The Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Timeline MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin journey reflects broader institutional adoption trends. The table below outlines key milestones in their accumulation strategy: Date Bitcoin Purchased Average Price Funding Method August 2020 21,454 BTC $11,653 Corporate Treasury December 2020 29,646 BTC $27,634 Convertible Notes June 2021 13,005 BTC $35,387 Equity Offering March 2024 12,000 BTC $68,477 Convertible Notes This systematic accumulation has positioned MicroStrategy uniquely within both traditional finance and cryptocurrency sectors. Their transparent reporting and consistent strategy have made them a bellwether for institutional Bitcoin adoption. Consequently, Saylor’s social media activity now serves as an informal indicator of corporate cryptocurrency movements, with market participants analyzing each post for potential signals about future acquisitions. Bitcoin’s Orange Symbolism and Market Psychology The “Unstoppable Orange” reference extends beyond simple color symbolism. Within cryptocurrency communities, orange represents several key Bitcoin attributes: Decentralization : The color appears in Bitcoin’s original logo and represents its peer-to-peer nature Open Source : Orange symbolizes transparency and collaborative development Resilience : The vibrant color represents Bitcoin’s survival through multiple market cycles Innovation : Orange distinguishes Bitcoin from traditional blue-chip financial assets Market analysts interpret Saylor’s emphasis on “unstoppable” as particularly significant. This terminology aligns with his frequent public statements about Bitcoin’s network effects and growing institutional adoption. The phrase suggests confidence in Bitcoin’s fundamental properties rather than short-term price movements. This perspective has become central to MicroStrategy’s investment thesis, which views Bitcoin as a superior store of value compared to traditional fiat currencies and even gold. Expert Analysis of Corporate Bitcoin Strategies Financial analysts following corporate cryptocurrency adoption note several important considerations. First, MicroStrategy’s approach has created a viable blueprint for other public companies considering Bitcoin treasury allocations. Second, their consistent accumulation during both bull and bear markets demonstrates conviction in their long-term thesis. Third, their use of debt instruments to fund purchases represents innovative financial engineering within regulatory boundaries. Finally, their transparent reporting has established best practices for corporate cryptocurrency accounting and disclosure. The market impact of Saylor’s hints extends beyond immediate price reactions. These signals often precede official SEC filings announcing completed purchases, giving attentive investors advance notice of substantial market movements. Additionally, these hints frequently correlate with increased trading volume and volatility in Bitcoin markets as participants position themselves ahead of potential large-scale acquisitions. This pattern has established Saylor’s social media activity as a legitimate market signal worthy of professional analysis. Regulatory and Market Implications MicroStrategy’s continued Bitcoin accumulation occurs within an evolving regulatory landscape. The SEC has increasingly focused on cryptocurrency accounting standards and disclosure requirements for public companies. MicroStrategy has navigated these requirements successfully, establishing precedents for how publicly-traded companies can hold and report digital assets. Their approach has influenced regulatory discussions about appropriate frameworks for corporate cryptocurrency holdings. Market structure implications are equally significant. Large corporate purchases like those typically hinted at by Saylor can impact Bitcoin’s liquidity and price discovery mechanisms. These substantial acquisitions often require execution through multiple exchanges and over-the-counter desks to minimize market impact. Consequently, they provide insights into Bitcoin’s growing market depth and institutional trading infrastructure. Furthermore, they demonstrate increasing sophistication in how large entities accumulate substantial cryptocurrency positions without disrupting broader markets. Conclusion Michael Saylor’s latest “Unstoppable Orange” post represents another chapter in MicroStrategy’s ongoing Bitcoin accumulation narrative.

57466307,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=265204,1769383812,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Spot Gold Shatters Records with Stunning Rally Past $5,000 Milestone",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/spot-gold-all-time-high-5000/,"BitcoinWorld Spot Gold Shatters Records with Stunning Rally Past $5,000 Milestone In a landmark moment for global financial markets, spot gold has decisively breached the $5,000 per ounce barrier, setting a staggering new all-time high. As of early 2025, the precious metal trades at $5,012.11, marking an approximate $700 surge since the year began and cementing a historic bull run that analysts are scrutinizing for its profound implications. Spot Gold’s Historic Ascent to $5,000 The journey to this unprecedented price level represents a significant chapter in commodity history. Consequently, market participants have witnessed a relentless upward trajectory. The $5,000 mark was not merely a psychological barrier but a technical milestone that many analysts had projected for the long term. However, the speed of this ascent has captured global attention. For context, gold traded below $1,800 per ounce as recently as late 2022. This dramatic revaluation underscores a fundamental shift in asset allocation and macroeconomic sentiment. Several interconnected factors have propelled this rally. Primarily, persistent geopolitical tensions have driven demand for traditional safe-haven assets. Simultaneously, evolving monetary policy expectations among major central banks have influenced investor behavior. Furthermore, increasing allocations from sovereign wealth funds and central banks themselves have provided consistent underlying demand. This confluence of drivers created a powerful bullish momentum. Key Gold Price Milestones (2020-2025) Approximate Price (USD/oz) Notable Context August 2020 $2,075 Previous All-Time High (COVID-19 stimulus) Late 2022 $1,620 Cycle Low amid aggressive rate hikes December 2024 $4,300 Breakout begins on shifting Fed outlook Early 2025 $5,012.11 New All-Time High Analyzing the Powerful Drivers Behind the Rally Understanding the gold price requires examining the complex macroeconomic landscape. First, the geopolitical risk premium remains elevated. Ongoing regional conflicts and strategic competition between major economies have eroded confidence in a stable global order. Investors consequently seek assets with a centuries-long reputation as a store of value during uncertainty. Second, the monetary policy environment has been pivotal. While central banks initially fought inflation with aggressive interest rate hikes, the focus in 2025 has subtly shifted. Markets now anticipate a prolonged period of higher structural inflation than the pre-2020 era, even as rate cuts are debated. This environment of real interest rates —nominal rates minus inflation—often proves favorable for non-yielding bullion when real rates stabilize or decline. Central Bank Demand: Institutions like the People’s Bank of China and the Reserve Bank of India have been consistent net buyers, diversifying reserves away from the US dollar. Currency Devaluation Fears: Expansive fiscal policies in major economies have heightened long-term concerns about currency purchasing power. Technical Breakout Momentum: The breach of the 2020 high triggered algorithmic and momentum-based buying, accelerating the move. Expert Perspective on Sustainable Value Market analysts emphasize the changed role of gold in modern portfolios. Historically, gold served as an inflation hedge. Today, its function has expanded to include a hedge against financial market volatility and systemic risk . A senior commodities strategist at a major investment bank recently noted, “The $5,000 level reflects a repricing of tail risks that were previously considered remote. Gold’s performance is less about daily inflation data and more about its insurance premium against broader institutional and currency stress.” This analysis points to a deeper, more structural demand driver beyond short-term speculation. Comparative Performance and Market Impact The rally has significantly outperformed other major asset classes in 2025. While equity markets have shown volatility tied to earnings and economic data, gold’s climb has been remarkably steady. This divergence highlights its unique portfolio diversification benefits. The surge also reverberates through related markets. Mining equities, represented by indices like the NYSE Arca Gold BUGS Index, have seen amplified gains due to operational leverage. Conversely, the rise presents challenges for industries reliant on physical gold, such as certain electronics manufacturers and jewelers, who now face higher input costs. Retail investor participation has also evolved. Physical bullion sales at mints and through dealers have hit multi-year highs. Moreover, flows into gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have turned positive after a period of outflows, indicating renewed institutional interest. This broad-based demand across investor types—from central banks to retail buyers—provides a robust foundation for the current price level. Conclusion The breach of $5,000 for spot gold is a definitive financial event with deep roots in the global macroeconomic climate. This new all-time high symbolizes a collective search for stability amidst geopolitical uncertainty, evolving monetary policies, and concerns about long-term currency values. While price corrections are inherent to any market, the fundamental drivers supporting gold appear sustained. Moving forward, market observers will monitor central bank policies, inflation trajectories, and geopolitical developments to gauge the sustainability of this historic price level for the world’s premier precious metal. FAQs Q1: What does ‘spot gold’ price mean? The spot price refers to the current market price for immediate delivery and settlement of gold. It is the benchmark price for raw bullion, distinct from futures contracts or prices for physical coins and bars which include premiums. Q2: Why is gold considered a safe-haven asset? Gold is deemed a safe haven due to its historical role as a store of value independent of any government or central bank. It often retains purchasing power during periods of currency devaluation, geopolitical crisis, or stock market stress, as it carries no credit risk. Q3: How does the strength of the US dollar affect the gold price? Gold is typically priced in US dollars globally. Therefore, a stronger dollar can make gold more expensive for holders of other currencies, potentially dampening demand. Conversely, a weaker dollar often supports a higher gold price, as seen in the recent period. Q4: Are there risks to the current high gold price? Yes. Primary risks include a significant and unexpected shift towards more aggressive monetary tightening by major central banks, a sharp resolution of geopolitical tensions, or a prolonged period of strong risk-on sentiment in equity markets that diverts investment flows. Q5: How can an average investor gain exposure to gold? Investors can access gold through several channels: purchasing physical bullion (bars/coins), buying shares of gold-backed ETFs (like GLD), investing in gold mining company stocks, or trading gold futures and options contracts, each with different risk and liquidity profiles.

The rally above prior highs refocuses attention on silver’s dual role, both as an industrial metal critical to modern technologies and a safe‑haven asset in uncertain macroeconomic conditions. Citi Sees Silver Reaching $100+ Citigroup’s commodities strategists have issued a bullish outlook for silver, lifting their near‑term price target to $110 per ounce, driven by “heightened geopolitical risks, ongoing physical market shortages, and renewed uncertainty on Federal Reserve independence.” Citi also reiterated its view that silver is poised to outperform gold in the current rally. According to the forecast, silver’s strong performance reflects deeply drawn inventories, accelerating industrial demand, and strong investor interest. Analysts emphasize that the metal’s recent gains, outpacing gold and broader markets are more than a short‑term spike and may signal a structural shift in precious metals demand. Bullish Drivers Behind the Rally Supply Constraints & Tight Inventories Silver’s physical market remains unusually tight, with inventories at key exchanges drawn down significantly over recent quarters. This has heightened the risk of supply squeezes and supported upward pressure on prices. Industrial Demand Surge Silver’s critical role in renewable energy (especially photovoltaics), electric vehicles, and electronics manufacturing has boosted long‑term demand expectations, adding a robust fundamental underpinning to the price rally. Safe‑Haven & Monetary Appeal Amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, including debates around inflation, interest rate policy, and geopolitical tensions — investors continue shifting toward precious metals as portfolio hedges. Silver’s recent outperformance relative to gold underscores its appeal across both defensive and cyclical demand drivers. Citi’s Broader Precious Metals View While Citi’s gold and silver forecasts both reflect an ongoing bull market, the bank’s analysts have highlighted silver’s potential to outperform gold over the near term due to its combination of industrial growth and investor demand. Their revised targets reflect short‑term momentum and structural shifts in metal markets. Citi’s optimism is rooted in a convergence of factors: physical shortages, resilient industrial use, and macroeconomic risk, suggesting that silver could continue higher even after its strong gain past the $100 threshold.",News|Reports,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-25 23:36:18

More importantly, the company is building what could become one of the most valuable physics datasets for artificial intelligence training systems worldwide. This breakthrough comes at a critical time when climate change has intensified wildfire seasons globally, creating unprecedented demand for smarter emergency response technologies. HEN Technologies’ AI Firefighting Hardware Revolution Sunny Sethi founded HEN Technologies in June 2020 after a personal experience during California’s devastating wildfire seasons. His background spanning nanotechnology, solar technology, semiconductors, and automotive manufacturing provided what he calls “bias-free and flexible” thinking. The company’s initial breakthrough came through National Science Foundation-funded computational fluid dynamics research that analyzed how water suppresses fire and how wind affects suppression efforts. The resulting hardware represents a fundamental shift in firefighting technology. HEN’s nozzle controls droplet size with unprecedented precision while managing velocity in innovative ways that resist wind interference. In comparative demonstrations, the difference appears stark: traditional nozzles disperse water inefficiently while HEN’s maintains coherent streams at identical flow rates. However, the physical hardware represents just the beginning of Sethi’s vision. The Smart Hardware Ecosystem HEN Technologies has expanded beyond nozzles to create a comprehensive ecosystem of connected firefighting equipment. The company now produces monitors, valves, overhead sprinklers, pressure devices, and the newly launched “Stream IQ” flow-control system. Each device contains custom-designed circuit boards with sensors and computing power—23 different designs that transform traditional hardware into intelligent, connected equipment. Key technological components include: Nvidia Orion Nano processors powering advanced computing capabilities GPS integration in all devices for real-time positioning Sensor networks that create virtual sensing capabilities throughout systems Weather data integration for predictive analytics The company has filed 20 patent applications with half a dozen already granted, protecting its technological innovations in a market that has seen minimal disruption for decades. Building the Predictive Analytics Platform HEN Technologies’ true innovation lies in the system these connected devices create. The platform uses sensors at water pumps to function as virtual sensors in nozzles, tracking exact activation times, water flow volumes, and pressure requirements. The system captures comprehensive data about water usage per fire incident, specific hydrant utilization, and weather conditions during operations. This data addresses critical problems in firefighting operations. Historically, fire departments have operated with limited communication between water suppliers and firefighters, sometimes resulting in dangerous water shortages during active fires. The Palisades Fire and Oakland Fire decades earlier demonstrated how pressure variations between engines connected to single hydrants could leave firefighters without water as fires continued to grow. HEN Technologies Growth Metrics Year Revenue Fire Department Customers Key Milestones 2023 $200,000 10 departments First product launch 2024 $1.6 million Expanding regional Word-of-mouth growth 2025 $5.2 million 1,500 departments International expansion 2026 Projection $20 million Global presence GSA qualification achieved Rural firefighting operations face particular challenges with water tenders—tankers that shuttle water from distant sources—experiencing logistical nightmares that HEN’s system can optimize through integrated water usage calculations and utility monitoring. Meeting Government Demand for Predictive Systems The Department of Homeland Security has specifically requested this type of system through its NERIS program, an initiative designed to bring predictive analytics to emergency operations. Sethi notes the fundamental challenge: “You can’t have predictive analytics unless you have good quality data. You can’t have good quality data unless you have the right hardware.” HEN’s platform creates application layers similar to what Adobe accomplished with cloud infrastructure, offering à la carte systems for fire captains, battalion chiefs, and incident commanders. The system can warn frontline personnel about impending wind shifts, recommend engine repositioning, and alert crews about diminishing water supplies in specific trucks. The Hidden Value: Physics Data for AI Training While HEN Technologies sells firefighting hardware, the company simultaneously amasses something potentially more valuable: highly specific, real-world physics data. The system collects detailed information about how water behaves under varying pressures, how flow rates interact with different materials, how fires respond to specific suppression techniques, and how physics operates in active fire environments. This data represents exactly what companies building “world models” need—AI systems that construct simulated representations of physical environments to predict future states. These advanced artificial intelligence systems require real-world, multimodal data from physical systems operating under extreme conditions. Simulations alone cannot teach AI about complex physics, creating enormous demand for the type of data HEN collects with every deployment. Companies training robotics and predictive physics engines would pay substantial sums for this real-world physics data. The dataset includes: Fluid dynamics under extreme conditions Material interaction data across temperature ranges Environmental impact measurements on suppression effectiveness Temporal progression data of fire behavior Strategic Funding and Market Position Investors recognize this dual value proposition. Recently, HEN Technologies closed a $20 million Series A round plus $2 million in venture debt from Silicon Valley Bank. O’Neil Strategic Capital led the financing, with participation from NSFO, Tanas Capital, and z21 Ventures. This round brought the company’s total funding to more than $30 million. The company faces competition from established players like IDEX Corp, which sells traditional hoses, nozzles, and monitors, and software companies like Central Square that serve fire departments. However, Sethi insists no company is “doing exactly what we are trying to do”—integrating smart hardware with comprehensive data collection and predictive analytics. HEN’s current constraint isn’t demand but scaling capacity. The company serves prestigious clients including the Marine Corps, US Army bases, Naval atomic labs, NASA, and Abu Dhabi Civil Defense, shipping products to 22 countries through 120 distributors. The recent GSA qualification after a year-long vetting process provides federal approval that simplifies purchasing for military and government agencies. Building a Specialized Team for Dual Objectives HEN Technologies’ ambitious goals required assembling a unique team with diverse expertise. The company’s software lead previously served as a senior director who helped build Adobe’s cloud infrastructure. Other team members include a former NASA engineer and veterans from Tesla, Apple, and Microsoft among the 50-person workforce. Sethi acknowledges the technical breadth required: “If you ask me technical questions, I would not be able to answer everything, but I have such good teams that it has been a blessing.” This team structure enables simultaneous advancement in hardware innovation, software development, and data science—a rare combination in the traditionally conservative firefighting equipment industry. The company’s business model creates recurring revenue streams through both hardware replacement cycles and continuous data generation. With fire departments purchasing approximately 20,000 new engines annually to replace aging equipment in a national fleet of 200,000, HEN’s qualified status positions it for sustained growth. The hardware’s data generation capability ensures revenue continuity between purchase cycles. Conclusion HEN Technologies represents a paradigm shift in firefighting technology through its innovative AI firefighting hardware that simultaneously addresses immediate emergency response needs while building long-term value through physics data collection. The company’s approach demonstrates how traditional industries can leverage modern technology to solve age-old problems while creating unexpected secondary value streams. As climate change intensifies wildfire threats globally, and as artificial intelligence systems hunger for high-quality physics data, HEN Technologies occupies a uniquely strategic position at the intersection of public safety and technological advancement. The company’s upcoming fundraising in the second quarter of this year will likely accelerate both its firefighting mission and its emerging role as a critical data provider for next-generation AI systems. FAQs Q1: How does HEN Technologies’ nozzle achieve 300% better suppression rates? The nozzle uses computational fluid dynamics research to precisely control droplet size and manage water velocity in ways that resist wind interference. This creates more coherent water streams that deliver greater suppression power with the same flow rate as traditional nozzles. Q2: What makes HEN’s data valuable for AI training?

However, crypto has a habit of shattering that belief without warning. History shows that when conditions line up, altcoins do not grind higher over years. They release and erase multiple years of drawdowns in a matter of weeks. That memory was highlighted by a crypto commentator known as Waterman on the social media platform X, who noted a familiar seasonal window between February and late April to early May for an altcoin explosion. Related Reading: Gold Becomes The Whale Safe Haven As Bitcoin Takes A Back Seat Speed Matters More Than Time The most notable example of an altcoin rally season was in 2021, when the entire altcoin market went on a rally to new all-time highs, many of which are still unbroken for some cryptocurrencies. The 2021 cycle delivered some of the clearest reminders of just how fast capital can rotate once momentum takes hold. Solana moved from roughly $20 to $200 in about 50 days, a clean tenfold run. Although Solana has since broken above this peak to register a new all-time high of $293 in January 2025, this was still Solana’s most explosive rally to date. Dogecoin followed an even sharper trajectory, climbing from $0.07 to a peak of $0.73 in under a month due to speculative interest that flowed into other memecoins like Shiba Inu. Unlike Solana, Dogecoin is yet to reclaim or surpass this peak price. Avalanche went further, rallying from around $3 to $60 in less than 40 days, a twentyfold expansion that unfolded faster than most long-term projections ever anticipate. None of these moves required years of development or prolonged accumulation. A Timeframe To Watch Closely Notably, February through late April or early May has more often than not been the period where altcoin performance increases the most. If that pattern repeats, the coming weeks may matter far more than the years that came before them. At the time of writing, the notion of an altcoin season is still impeded by strong Bitcoin dominance. Much of that comes down to how the entire crypto industry ecosystem has changed massively since 2021, especially after the launch of crypto-based ETFs. That steady demand has kept capital inflows concentrated around Bitcoin and slowed the usual rotation into altcoins. Meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have struggled to keep up in terms of price action, even with the launch of Dogecoin ETFs. Although the ETF has boosted visibility, it has not yet resulted into sustained upside. At the same time, investors have become more selective, favoring cryptocurrencies tied to clearer utility. As a result, many crypto communities have been working to create utility for their meme coins.

This significant five-point decline, reported by sentiment analytics firm Alternative, firmly entrenches the market in a state categorized as ‘Extreme Fear.’ The index, a crucial barometer for investor psychology, operates on a scale from 0 to 100, where lower numbers indicate heightened fear and potential selling pressure. Consequently, this latest data point provides a stark, quantitative snapshot of prevailing market trepidation among digital asset traders and institutions worldwide. Crypto Fear & Greed Index Drops to Extreme Fear Territory The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a composite gauge for market emotion. It synthesizes data from multiple sources to generate a single, understandable figure. A reading of 20 sits deep within the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone, which the index defines as scores between 0 and 25. Historically, such levels have often correlated with market capitulation or significant price bottoms, though they are not a direct timing signal. The index’s current trajectory suggests a consolidation of negative sentiment that began earlier this quarter. Market analysts closely monitor this metric because extreme readings can sometimes precede trend reversals, as fear exhausts itself and value-seeking investors re-enter the market. Deconstructing the Index: The Six Pillars of Sentiment The index’s calculation relies on a weighted model incorporating six distinct factors. This methodology ensures a multi-faceted view of market sentiment rather than reliance on a single metric. The model’s components are volatility (25%), market momentum and volume (25%), social media engagement (15%), survey data (15%), Bitcoin dominance (10%), and Google Trends search volume (10%). Each component feeds into the final score. For instance, high volatility typically pushes the score lower, indicating fear. Similarly, a surge in ‘Bitcoin crash’ related Google searches would negatively impact the overall sentiment reading. This structured approach helps filter out noise and identify genuine shifts in collective market psychology. Components of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Component Weight Description Volatility 25% Measures current price swings against historical averages. Market Volume & Momentum 25% Analyzes trading volume and price action strength. Social Media 15% Tracks sentiment and volume on major platforms. Surveys 15% Incorporates data from periodic market participant polls. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s share of total crypto market cap. Google Trends 10% Analyzes search volume for cryptocurrency-related terms. Contextualizing the Extreme Fear Reading in 2025 This drop to 20 did not occur in a vacuum. Several macroeconomic and sector-specific factors have contributed to the prevailing negative sentiment. Firstly, ongoing regulatory deliberations in major economies continue to create uncertainty for institutional adoption. Secondly, broader equity market fluctuations often spill over into cryptocurrency valuations, creating correlated risk-off movements. Furthermore, the post-halving adjustment period for Bitcoin has introduced new supply dynamics that the market is still digesting. Analysts from firms like Glassnode and CoinMetrics have noted that on-chain data shows investors moving assets to cold storage, a behavior typical of fearful or long-term holding phases rather than active trading. Market technicians also point to key support levels being tested across major cryptocurrencies. When these technical levels break, it can trigger automated selling and amplify fear. The current sentiment reading reflects this confluence of technical pressure and fundamental uncertainty. It is crucial to remember that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a lagging indicator; it reflects sentiment that has already been expressed through market actions like selling or reduced buying. Therefore, it confirms the emotional state of the market rather than predicting its immediate future direction. Historical Precedents and Market Cycles Examining the index’s history provides essential context for the current ‘Extreme Fear’ reading. The index previously touched similar or lower levels during major market drawdowns, such as the sell-offs in mid-2022 and the March 2020 liquidity crisis. In many of these instances, the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone represented a period of maximum pessimism, which was later followed by a stabilization and eventual recovery, though the timing varied significantly. This pattern underscores a core tenet of behavioral finance: markets are driven by cycles of greed and fear. The index quantitatively captures these emotional extremes, offering investors a tool to gauge whether sentiment is overly euphoric or excessively pessimistic relative to the market’s cyclical position. Potential Implications for Investors and the Market A sustained ‘Extreme Fear’ reading carries several potential implications for different market participants. For retail investors, it may signal a high-risk environment where emotional decision-making can lead to selling at a loss. For contrarian and institutional investors, however, extreme fear can highlight potential long-term value opportunities, as assets may be trading below their fundamental network value. It is vital to differentiate between price sentiment and underlying blockchain utility. Projects with strong development activity, growing user bases, and clear roadmaps may be unduly punished during broad fear-driven sell-offs. Market structure is also affected. Typically, periods of extreme fear see a decline in leverage across derivatives markets as traders de-risk. Funding rates in perpetual swap markets often turn negative. Additionally, trading volume may shift from altcoins back to Bitcoin, as seen in the ‘flight to safety’ dynamic captured by the Bitcoin dominance metric within the index itself. This environment often separates robust projects from weaker ones, as development continues irrespective of short-term price action. Investors are advised to conduct thorough research and consider dollar-cost averaging strategies to navigate volatile periods defined by low Crypto Fear & Greed Index scores. Risk Management: Emphasize portfolio diversification and avoid over-leverage. Due Diligence: Focus on project fundamentals, not just price charts. Emotional Discipline: Use sentiment indicators as context, not as sole trading signals. Long-Term Perspective: Recognize that crypto markets are historically cyclical. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s decline to a reading of 20 provides a clear, data-driven signal that extreme fear currently dominates cryptocurrency market sentiment. This metric, built from volatility, volume, social data, and search trends, acts as a crucial emotional thermometer for the asset class. While such levels historically indicate high stress and potential capitulation, they also require investors to exercise heightened discipline and focus on long-term fundamentals rather than short-term noise. Monitoring this index, alongside on-chain analytics and macroeconomic developments, remains essential for navigating the complex landscape of digital asset investment. The current ‘Extreme Fear’ zone underscores the market’s ongoing challenges but also serves as a reminder of its cyclical nature. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 20 mean? A score of 20 falls into the ‘Extreme Fear’ category. This indicates that current market data from volatility, volume, social media, and surveys reflects a highly pessimistic and risk-averse sentiment among cryptocurrency investors. Q2: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a good buy or sell signal? The index is primarily a sentiment indicator, not a direct timing signal for trades. While extreme readings can signal potential market turning points, they should not be used in isolation. Always combine sentiment analysis with technical and fundamental research. Q3: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index is typically updated daily, providing a near real-time gauge of market sentiment. This allows investors and analysts to track shifts in emotional tone as market conditions evolve. Q4: Can the index remain in ‘Extreme Fear’ for a long time? Yes, the market can remain in a state of extreme fear for extended periods, especially during prolonged bear markets or periods of significant negative news. The index reflects prevailing sentiment, which can be persistent. Q5: What usually happens after the index reaches an extreme low? Historically, periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ have often preceded market recoveries, as selling pressure exhausts itself. However, the timing and strength of any recovery depend on broader macroeconomic factors and fundamental developments within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

The regulated derivatives contract commenced trading at $86,560, notably lower than its previous Friday settlement of $89,500. This event immediately captured the attention of institutional and retail investors alike, serving as a real-time case study in the interplay between 24/7 digital asset markets and traditional financial trading hours. The CME Bitcoin futures gap is not merely a technical anomaly; it is a window into volatility, liquidity, and the ongoing convergence of crypto and mainstream finance. Decoding the CME Bitcoin Futures Gap Phenomenon The recurring appearance of a CME Bitcoin futures gap stems from a fundamental structural difference. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), a cornerstone of traditional finance, operates on a set schedule. Its Bitcoin futures market closes on Friday afternoon and reopens on Sunday evening, Central Time. Conversely, the global Bitcoin spot market—comprising hundreds of exchanges worldwide—trades continuously, 365 days a year. This creates a temporal disconnect. When the spot price moves significantly over the weekend without the futures market being open to reflect that movement, a gap emerges upon the Monday open. Market analysts consistently monitor the size and direction of these gaps as a volatility indicator. A larger gap, such as the $2.9K move observed, typically signals a weekend of heightened price action or impactful news in the underlying spot market. Several factors can drive this weekend volatility: Macroeconomic Announcements: Geopolitical events or economic data releases in other time zones. Cryptocurrency-Specific News: Protocol upgrades, regulatory statements, or major exchange developments. Liquidity Dynamics: Thinner weekend trading volumes can amplify price swings from large orders. The following table compares key characteristics of the CME futures market and the global Bitcoin spot market: Feature CME Bitcoin Futures Global Bitcoin Spot Market Trading Hours Set session times; closed weekends 24/7, continuous Regulatory Framework Heavily regulated by the CFTC Varies significantly by jurisdiction Primary Participants Institutional investors, hedge funds Mix of retail and institutional traders Price Discovery Derived from spot market reference rates Direct peer-to-peer and exchange trading Settlement Cash-settled in USD Often settled in actual Bitcoin The Mechanics of the Gap Fill Theory Following the Monday opening, a dominant question permeates trading desks: will the gap fill? The “gap fill” theory in technical analysis suggests that price often retraces to cover the empty space left on a chart. In the context of CME Bitcoin futures, this implies the futures price may move toward the prior Friday’s closing level of $89,500. However, this is not a guaranteed mechanical process. The futures price is fundamentally anchored to the spot price through arbitrage mechanisms. If the futures price is trading at a significant discount to the spot price (as it was upon opening), arbitrageurs may execute a strategy. They could buy the cheaper futures contract while simultaneously selling the equivalent amount of Bitcoin in the spot market, locking in a risk-free profit if the price difference covers transaction costs. This collective action creates buying pressure on futures and selling pressure on spot, pushing the two prices toward convergence. Consequently, the futures gap often closes not because of a mystical chart pattern, but due to efficient market forces and profit-seeking behavior. Institutional Perspective and Market Impact For institutional players, these gaps represent both risk and opportunity. Fund managers utilizing CME futures for hedging or exposure must account for weekend volatility that is not reflected in their positions until Monday. This can lead to unexpected margin calls or changes in portfolio risk metrics at the week’s start. Conversely, proprietary trading firms and quantitative funds have developed sophisticated models to anticipate and trade around these weekly discontinuities. The presence of this predictable structural event has, over time, fostered a specialized niche within crypto derivatives trading. The size of the March 24th gap, approximately 3.3% of the prior close, is historically notable but not unprecedented. During periods of extreme volatility, such as the market stress of early 2023, weekend gaps have exceeded 10%. Analysts from firms like Arcane Research and ByteTree have published studies showing that gap-filling behavior occurs with high frequency, but its speed and certainty are inversely correlated with the overall trend strength of the market. In a powerful bull or bear trend, the spot price may simply drag the futures price further away from the old gap, leaving it unfilled for extended periods. Historical Context and Evolution of Crypto Derivatives The CME launched its Bitcoin futures in December 2017, a landmark event that provided the first regulated venue for traditional institutions to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price. Initially, weekend gaps were often dramatic, reflecting a spot market that was still relatively illiquid and prone to wild swings. Over the years, as spot market liquidity deepened with the entry of more institutional custodians and traders, the average size of weekend gaps has generally decreased. However, they remain a persistent feature, underscoring that even as cryptocurrency matures, its market infrastructure still hybridizes with legacy systems. This latest $2.9K gap event occurs within a specific 2025 context. Regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions has advanced, leading to increased participation from asset managers and publicly traded companies. Furthermore, the maturation of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has created another layer of price discovery that interacts with both spot and futures markets. Analysts now observe a more complex relationship where ETF flows, spot exchange activity, and CME futures volumes all influence one another, making the pure “gap fill” dynamic slightly more nuanced than in earlier years. Conclusion The $2,940 CME Bitcoin futures gap observed on March 24, 2025, is a powerful illustration of the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. It highlights the tangible effects of merging a continuous, global digital asset market with the structured world of regulated financial derivatives. While the gap fill theory attracts significant attention, the underlying driver remains the relentless force of arbitrage and the fundamental link between futures and spot prices. For investors, understanding this weekly phenomenon is crucial for risk management and strategic positioning. As the market continues to mature, the CME Bitcoin futures gap will persist as a key volatility indicator and a testament to the unique, hybrid nature of modern finance. FAQs Q1: What causes the CME Bitcoin futures gap? The gap is caused by the difference in trading hours. The CME futures market closes for the weekend, while the Bitcoin spot market trades 24/7. Any significant price movement in the spot market over the weekend creates a difference between Friday’s futures close and Monday’s open. Q2: Is the futures gap guaranteed to fill? No, it is not a guarantee. While price often retraces to fill the gap due to arbitrage activity and market mechanics, strong trending markets can override this tendency, leaving gaps unfilled for long periods. Q3: How do traders use the CME futures gap? Some traders employ a “gap fill” strategy, buying or selling futures on Monday with the expectation the price will move to close the gap. Institutional traders use gap analysis for risk management, adjusting hedges for weekend volatility exposure. Q4: Does this happen with other CME cryptocurrency products? Yes, the same phenomenon occurs with CME’s Ethereum futures and any other derivatives product it offers on assets that trade on continuous spot markets. Q5: Has the average gap size changed over time? Generally, as Bitcoin’s spot market liquidity has improved, the average weekend volatility and thus gap size has decreased. However, during periods of major news or market stress, gaps can still be very large, as seen in past cycles.

This week’s key financial events feature the Federal Reserve’s crucial interest rate announcement alongside commentary from European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and multiple scheduled speeches from U.S. President Donald Trump. Market participants worldwide will closely monitor these developments for signals about monetary policy direction, geopolitical stability, and economic resilience amid ongoing global challenges. Financial Events Calendar: January 27-29, 2025 The upcoming three-day period presents a concentrated schedule of significant financial events that will influence trading across asset classes. Each event carries specific implications for currency valuations, bond yields, and equity market performance. Market volatility typically increases around such scheduled announcements, prompting institutional investors to adjust positions and hedge exposures accordingly. Historical data shows that Federal Reserve decisions alone can move major indices by 2-3% within hours of announcement. Key Financial Events Schedule Date Time (UTC) Event Market Impact Jan. 27 1:30 p.m. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks High (Geopolitical) Jan. 27 5:00 p.m. ECB President Christine Lagarde speaks Medium-High (Eurozone) Jan. 28 1:30 p.m. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks High (Policy) Jan. 28 7:00 p.m. Federal Reserve interest rate decision Very High (Global) Jan. 28 7:30 p.m. FOMC press conference Very High (Forward Guidance) Jan. 29 1:30 p.m. U.S. initial jobless claims data Medium (Labor Market) Federal Reserve Decision: Centerpiece of Financial Events The Federal Open Market Committee’s January meeting represents the most significant of this week’s financial events. Market consensus, based on CME FedWatch Tool data, currently suggests an 85% probability of maintaining the federal funds rate at its current level. However, the accompanying statement and economic projections will provide crucial insights. Analysts will scrutinize language regarding inflation persistence, employment strength, and balance sheet normalization. The Fed’s quantitative tightening pace remains a particular focus for bond market participants. Previous FOMC meetings in 2024 established a pattern of cautious policy adjustment. Consequently, this meeting’s outcome will either confirm or challenge existing market expectations. The post-announcement press conference, featuring Chair Jerome Powell, often generates more market movement than the decision itself. Powell’s responses to journalist questions about future rate paths and economic risks typically provide the clearest policy signals. Historical volatility patterns show S&P 500 options pricing in approximately 1.5% movement around Fed announcements. Expert Analysis: Fed Policy Implications Central bank analysts emphasize several key considerations for this week’s financial events. First, the Fed must balance persistent service-sector inflation against moderating goods prices. Second, labor market tightness continues to influence wage growth and consumption patterns. Third, global economic conditions, particularly in China and Europe, affect U.S. export competitiveness and corporate earnings. Fourth, financial stability concerns have resurfaced following regional banking stresses in late 2024. Finally, fiscal policy uncertainty adds complexity to monetary policy decisions. Market strategists typically recommend specific approaches around major financial events. Many suggest reducing directional bets before announcements while increasing volatility hedges. Others advocate for sector rotation based on interest rate sensitivity. Financial institutions generally increase liquidity provisions during such periods to accommodate client flows. Trading volumes typically surge 40-60% above average during Fed decision windows, according to exchange data from previous quarters. Global Policy Speeches: Supplementary Financial Events President Trump’s scheduled speeches represent significant financial events with potential market impacts. Previous addresses have moved currency markets by 0.5-1.5% based on trade policy signals or geopolitical commentary. Market participants will monitor for indications about tariff policies, international relations, and domestic economic priorities. The timing of these speeches, occurring before the Fed announcement, may establish initial market sentiment for subsequent trading sessions. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde’s commentary constitutes another important element of this week’s financial events. Her remarks typically address Eurozone inflation trends, growth prospects, and monetary policy coordination. Given the ECB’s December decision to maintain rates, markets will seek clarity on future policy direction. The euro’s exchange rate against major currencies often experiences heightened volatility during and after Lagarde’s public appearances, affecting multinational corporate earnings and commodity pricing. Economic Data Release: Labor Market Indicator The January 29 release of initial jobless claims data provides the final major component of this week’s financial events. This high-frequency indicator offers timely insights into labor market conditions. Consensus forecasts anticipate claims remaining near recent averages of 210,000-225,000. Significant deviations from expectations could alter perceptions of economic strength and influence subsequent Fed policy considerations. The four-week moving average provides additional context about underlying trends beyond weekly fluctuations. Historical analysis reveals consistent patterns around such financial events. Jobless claims data typically generates immediate bond market reactions, with higher-than-expected claims pushing Treasury yields lower. Equity markets show more varied responses, sometimes interpreting weak data as positive for future rate cuts. Currency markets generally respond to relative economic strength signals. The data’s publication occurs after European markets close but during active U.S. trading hours, ensuring immediate price discovery. Market Preparation Strategies Sophisticated market participants implement specific strategies around concentrated financial events. Many institutions conduct scenario analysis for each potential outcome, assigning probabilities and preparing response protocols. Liquidity management becomes crucial, with bid-ask spreads typically widening before major announcements. Options markets show elevated implied volatility, particularly for short-dated contracts spanning event periods. Cross-asset correlation patterns often shift during such weeks, requiring portfolio rebalancing. Retail investors face different considerations around these financial events. Financial advisors generally recommend against attempting to time markets based on scheduled announcements. Instead, they emphasize maintaining diversified allocations aligned with long-term objectives. However, understanding event significance helps investors interpret market movements and avoid reactive decisions. Educational resources from major brokerages typically see increased usage during weeks with multiple financial events, according to platform engagement metrics. Conclusion This week’s concentrated schedule of financial events presents both challenges and opportunities for global market participants. The Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision dominates the calendar, supported by policy speeches and economic data releases. Collectively, these financial events will provide crucial information about monetary policy direction, economic resilience, and geopolitical developments. Market volatility will likely remain elevated throughout the period, requiring careful risk management and strategic positioning. Ultimately, the week’s outcomes will influence investment decisions and economic forecasts for subsequent quarters. FAQs Q1: Why is the Federal Reserve decision considered the most important of this week’s financial events? The Federal Reserve sets U.S. monetary policy, influencing global interest rates, currency values, and capital flows. Their decisions directly affect borrowing costs, corporate earnings, and investment returns across all asset classes worldwide. Q2: How do markets typically react to presidential speeches as financial events? Presidential speeches can move markets through policy signals affecting trade, regulation, or fiscal measures. Currency and equity markets often show immediate reactions, though sustained impacts depend on subsequent policy implementation and legislative action. Q3: What time should traders be most alert during these financial events? The highest volatility periods typically occur at 7:00 p.m. UTC (Fed decision) and 7:30 p.m. UTC (FOMC press conference) on January 28. European traders should also monitor 5:00 p.m. UTC on January 27 for ECB commentary. Q4: How can investors prepare for weeks with multiple financial events? Investors should review their portfolio’s sensitivity to interest rates and economic data, ensure adequate diversification, avoid excessive leverage, and consider maintaining cash reserves for potential opportunities that may emerge post-announcements. Q5: Do all financial events have equal impact across different asset classes? No, different events affect various assets disproportionately. Interest rate decisions primarily influence bonds and currencies, while employment data strongly impacts equities. Geopolitical speeches often affect commodity prices and safe-haven assets like gold and government bonds.

His statement was a direct response to President Donald Trump, who threatened to hit Canada with a 100% tariff on all imported goods if Carney moved forward with any deal involving Beijing. “This isn’t a free trade agreement,” Carney said. “It’s just correcting a few tariff problems we’ve had with China the past couple of years.” Trump doesn’t agree. He jumped online and wrote, “China is successfully and completely taking over the once Great Country of Canada. So sad to see it happen. I only hope they leave Ice Hockey alone! President DJT.” Trump lashes out as Canada adjusts China tariffs Carney explained that under the USMCA, no country is allowed to make free trade deals with “nonmarket economies” like China without notifying the others. “We have no intention of doing that with China or any other nonmarket economy,” he said. “What we’ve done is clean up some of the mess from the past couple of years.” In 2024, Canada followed the U.S. by slapping a 100% tariff on electric vehicles from China, and a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum.Beijing fired back with their own 100% import taxes on Canadian canola oil and meal, and 25% on pork and seafood. Carney’s new adjustment drops tariffs on some of those goods, but he insisted it was not a full-blown trade deal. There’s now a cap: China can export up to 49,000 EVs per year into Canada at a 6.1% tariff.That number will increase to about 70,000 in five years.Before 2024, there was no limit. Carney pointed out that 49,000 is only 3% of the 1.8 million vehicles sold in Canada every year. And in return, China is expected to invest in the Canadian auto industry within three years. Trump wasn’t done. On Sunday, he posted a video showing the head of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association warning that the auto sector won’t survive without access to the U.S. The executive said the Canadian market isn’t big enough to support large-scale production from China. Trump wrote, “A MUST WATCH. Canada is systematically destroying itself. The China deal is a disaster for them. Will go down as one of the worst deals, of any kind, in history. All their businesses are moving to the USA. I want to see Canada SURVIVE AND THRIVE! President DJT.” Washington accuses Canada of helping China bypass tariffs On Saturday, Trump wrote, “If Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a ‘Drop Off Port’ for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also went after Carney, saying, “We can’t let Canada become an opening that the Chinese pour their cheap goods into the U.S.” He said the USMCA (which will be renegotiated this summer) doesn’t allow this kind of behavior. “I’m not sure what Prime Minister Carney is doing here, other than trying to virtue-signal to his globalist friends at Davos,” Bessent added. This fight is only the latest in a long list of Trump’s clashes with Canada. The 47th president’s push to buy Greenland has already put a strain on the NATO alliance, and his public jabs at Canada’s sovereignty haven’t helped. Trump has floated the idea of making Canada the 51st state. Just this week, he posted a fake map showing the U.S. absorbing Canada, Greenland, Venezuela, and Cuba. Carney, for his part, has become a voice for countries looking to push back against U.S. pressure. Speaking in Davos before Trump arrived, Carney said, “Middle powers must act together because if you are not at the table, you are on the menu.” He didn’t name Trump, but everyone knew who he was talking about. His speech got a ton of media attention, stealing the spotlight from Trump at the World Economic Forum. But even with the backlash, Carney is standing firm. “We are not doing a free trade deal with China,” he repeated. “We are just fixing problems.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This decisive action, detected by on-chain analytics, reveals the immense pressures even seasoned market participants face during turbulent price action. The holder, identified by the wallet address ‘1011short’, now battles an unrealized loss exceeding $83 million, a situation that offers a rare, transparent window into the risks of decentralized finance (DeFi) leverage. Analyzing the Bitcoin Whale’s Liquidation Defense On-chain data provider Onchain-Lenz first flagged the substantial deposit to the Hyperliquid perpetual futures platform. This transaction was not a new speculative bet but a defensive maneuver. The primary goal was to increase the margin collateral for existing leveraged positions, thereby pushing them further from their liquidation prices. Consequently, this single deposit highlights a fundamental mechanism in derivatives trading: the constant balance between ambition and risk management. Market analysts often scrutinize such large margin calls for signals about potential selling pressure or holder conviction. Furthermore, the scale of the involved capital is staggering. The address’s cumulative realized profits have contracted dramatically, from a peak of $142.5 million to just $9.7 million. This sharp decline illustrates how quickly paper gains can evaporate in crypto markets. However, the holder’s choice to add capital rather than close positions suggests a continued belief in their market thesis. This behavior provides a real-time case study in the psychology of high-stakes trading during drawdowns. Deconstructing the Massive Leveraged Portfolio The wallet’s open positions, visible on the blockchain, represent a concentrated and highly leveraged bet on the broader crypto market’s upward trajectory. Each position uses leverage to amplify potential returns, which simultaneously multiplies the risk of loss. Ethereum (ETH) Position: A $630 million notional value position employing 5x leverage. This is the largest single bet, indicating significant confidence in Ethereum’s price action. Bitcoin (BTC) Position: An $86.98 million notional value position also using 5x leverage. This core position aligns with the holder’s identity as a Bitcoin OG. Solana (SOL) Position: A $61.10 million notional value position with a much higher 20x leverage. This aggressive position on a more volatile asset carries the highest relative liquidation risk. Moreover, the use of cross-margin or isolated margin models on Hyperliquid would determine how the newly deposited USDC protects these positions. Typically, a large infusion like this would bolster the overall margin pool, increasing the buffer for all leveraged trades. The diversity across assets (BTC, ETH, SOL) shows a portfolio approach, though the high leverage unites them under a single risk profile. The Mechanics of Liquidation and Margin Calls To understand the whale’s action, one must grasp how liquidations work on platforms like Hyperliquid. When a trader opens a leveraged long position, they post collateral (initial margin). If the price moves against them, their equity (maintenance margin) decreases. Should it fall below a specific threshold, the protocol automatically closes the position to prevent losses from exceeding the collateral—this is a liquidation. The $20M USDC deposit increased the collateral, lowering the position’s leverage ratio and moving the liquidation price further away from the current market price. This event is not isolated. Data from Coinglass and other analytics firms frequently shows clusters of liquidations during sharp market moves. For instance, a 10% price drop in Bitcoin can trigger hundreds of millions in leveraged positions being force-closed, creating cascading selling pressure. The whale’s preemptive move aims to avoid becoming part of such a cascade. Contextualizing the Action in Current Markets The broader market context is crucial for interpreting this event. Throughout 2024 and into 2025, cryptocurrency markets have experienced significant volatility, influenced by macroeconomic factors, regulatory developments, and ETF flows. Periods of consolidation or downward pressure test the resilience of leveraged strategies. This whale’s activity occurred against such a backdrop, serving as a microcosm of the tension between long-term bullish sentiment and short-term market stress. Additionally, the choice of USDC, a fully-reserved dollar-pegged stablecoin, is significant. It reflects a preference for regulatory clarity and asset stability when adding emergency collateral. The deposit itself is a verifiable on-chain event, recorded immutably on its native blockchain, which underscores the transparent yet complex nature of DeFi. Unlike traditional finance, where such margin calls are private, blockchain analytics make them public, offering educational insights and market signals. Historical Precedents and Market Impact History provides context for large-scale liquidation events. The May 2021 market downturn, for example, saw over $10 billion in leveraged positions liquidated in 24 hours. Similarly, the collapse of the Terra-Luna ecosystem in 2022 triggered a massive deleveraging across the crypto sector. While this individual $20M deposit is a defensive action, a wave of similar but unmet margin calls can lead to rapid, amplified price declines. Experts from firms like Glassnode and CryptoQuant often analyze these flows. They note that while a single whale avoiding liquidation may prevent immediate localized selling, it does not eliminate the underlying risk. If market prices continue to trend against the positions, even the added collateral may prove insufficient. Therefore, the market watches such events not just for the action itself, but for what it implies about overall leverage saturation and potential vulnerability in the system. Conclusion The Bitcoin OG’s strategic $20 million USDC deposit to avoid liquidation is a powerful narrative of risk management in the digital asset era. It underscores the immense scale of modern crypto trading, the ever-present threat of liquidation, and the sophisticated tools traders use to navigate volatility. This event, visible to all via the transparency of the blockchain, provides invaluable real-world data on leverage, market psychology, and the defensive maneuvers of large-scale participants. As markets evolve, such on-chain stories will continue to be essential for understanding the underlying forces driving price action and stability in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What does “avoiding liquidation” mean in crypto trading? In leveraged trading, liquidation is the forced closure of a position by the protocol when its value falls too close to the trader’s borrowed amount. Avoiding it means adding more collateral to increase the buffer between the position’s current value and its liquidation price. Q2: Why did the whale use USDC specifically? USDC is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. It is widely trusted, highly liquid, and maintains its value during crypto market volatility, making it ideal for posting additional, stable collateral on short notice. Q3: How does on-chain data reveal this information? Blockchains are public ledgers. Analytics platforms like Onchain-Lenz track transactions from known wallet addresses, interpreting large deposits to trading platforms like Hyperliquid in the context of open positions that can also be viewed on-chain. Q4: What is the risk of such high leverage (e.g., 20x on SOL)? High leverage magnifies both gains and losses. A 20x long position means a 5% price drop against the position could lead to a 100% loss of the initial margin, triggering liquidation very quickly. It represents an extremely high-risk strategy. Q5: Can actions like this affect the broader Bitcoin or Ethereum market? Yes, potentially. If a whale of this size were liquidated, the platform would automatically sell their positions, creating significant sell pressure. Conversely, their ability to post more collateral can stabilize sentiment by showing conviction and preventing a large, disorderly unwind.

U.S. policymakers for decades touted globalization as a road to growth, stability, and peace. To some extent, today’s world is characterized by shifting tides, with countries seeking resilience or hedging against the pressure to adapt to the threat of economic coercion posed by the world’s largest economy. Allies reduce dependence as Trump reshapes global power Trump’s unapologetic “America First” policy has included threats of tariffs , supply chain constraints, and other aggressive measures to gain concessions from his allies. His ill-fated effort to acquire Greenland and a subsequent threat of tariffs on European countries revealed the dangers of strategic reliance on Washington. Although the overnight crisis receded following a temporary solution, European leaders vowed not to be pressured, suggesting they would increase efforts to rely less on Washington. Neil Shearing, chief economist at Capital Economics in London, said the current environment demonstrates a change in global power relationships. “It’s about power, dependency, and coercion,” Shearing said.” “Now, countries are looking for ways to weaken their strategic reliance on the United States.” In the post-World War II regime, where the U.S. Navy defended sea lanes and the U.S. capital ensured stability, efficient global commerce was possible. But Trump’s recent moves are prompting countries to exchange some of that efficiency for security. Rising costs and market shifts signal a new economic era Even in a time of economic upheaval, the implications are clear. The drive to reduce dependence on U.S. supply chains is increasing the cost of critical goods. Gold prices have surged nearly 80 percent in the past year as investors scramble for refuge, and copper and other metals have soared as domestic semiconductor and pharmaceutical capacity is developed. The American economy continues to emerge as strong, thanks to technological and AI discoveries. Financial markets have been responsive to U.S. growth despite geopolitical tension. The Trump administration argues that its policies reinforce — not weaken — global alliances. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed concerns about a dollar pullback as a “false narrative,” and the White House stressed that America First does not mean America Alone. There are, however, concerns that the implications for the U.S.’s long-term future could be serious. As European countries, Canada , and fast-growing Asian regions pour money into their own technology and defense systems, markets worldwide for capital are growing. Higher borrowing costs will have to confront the U.S., now over $30 trillion in debt and facing annual budget deficits on an urgent scale. The Congressional Budget Office forecasts that by 2035, the Government will need to borrow over $21 trillion, and even modest increases in interest rates will raise annual service costs to the hundreds of billions of dollars. The Greenland affair and other moves during Trump’s second term demonstrate a broader trend: allies and investors cannot take American leadership for granted. “President Trump is intent on jettisoning the Atlantic Alliance and the overall world order that we’ve known for 80 years,” said former U.S. deputy treasury secretary Roger Altman. “He wants to replace that with a tripolar global order among Putin and Xi Jinping.” Today, the global economy is undergoing a transition. Countries that were previously dependent on U.S.-led globalization are carving out their own financial, technical, and strategic resilience in industries that have grown increasingly resistant—or independent—of U.S. centrality. So while American markets are still robust, the global system as a whole is likely to see rising costs, even more fragmented capital flows, and greater uncertainty. What we will have in the next decade will be a new world order, a world order forged by the competition among many powers and the demise of the American monopoly upon unquestioned supremacy.

When prices fell hard, the national team would step in and buy. That belief sat under the market like a floor. But last week, that floor cracked in public after Central Huijin Investment, a state-linked fund, sold sold about $67.5 billion across 14 tech-related ETFs in six sessions through Thursday, according to Bloomberg. Chen Da, founder of Dante Research, said, “If enough people are watching what this player is doing, its actions could be enough to alter expectations.” That view spread quickly on trading floors. The national team was no longer a one-way buyer. It was trading both sides. The numbers showed why nerves rose. The CSI 300 gained 1.8% over the past month. The Star 50 Index, packed with chip names, jumped 16%. Wu Wei, a fund manager at Beijing Win Integrity Investment Management Co., said, “These days it’s probably smart to focus trading on the stocks that the team owns less of to avoid being in the line of fire.” Wu Wei added, “My trading has slowed a bit, because it’s not a bullish signal at the end of the day.” ETF turnover exposes selling patterns during rebounds Details on the trades will only appear in quarterly reports. Until then, investors are doing the math. Central Huijin began buying China’s ETFs aggressively in 2023. By the end of August 2025, it held about $180 billion in these assets.Analyst Rebecca Sin, wrote that the “scale of liquidation suggests a proactive effort to facilitate a price correction in overheated sectors.” After record outflows from a fund tracking the Star 50, they estimate only about 5% of Central Huijin’s firepower remains in that product. Traders started spotting patterns during the week.When indexes jumped during the session, ETF turnover surged. Prices then faded. On Wednesday, turnover in CSI 1000 ETFs climbed as the index rebounded nearly 2% within an hour, before slipping lower. Many desks read that as state selling. The pattern repeated, though strong risk appetite kept some gauges afloat. The E‑fund ChiNext ETF saw large outflows on Thursday. The index later recovered part of its intraday drop. The selling surprised some investors, but others saw it as controlled pressure rather than panic. Volatility eases as investors reassess exposure Short-term volatility on the CSI 300 fell to its lowest level since May. Onshore trading cooled from nearly 4 trillion yuan, or $574 billion, earlier this month. Yang Ruyi, a fund manager at Shanghai Prospect Investment Management Co., said:- “Instead of reading the state funds’ selling as a signal that the rally is over, we should consider this in the context of the structural, slow bull.” Yang Ruyi also said it made sense for Central Huijin to reposition into other thematic ETFs. Z‑Ben Advisors said the market absorbed the selloffs without major swings.That pointed to strong institutional demand for A‑shares in China. Zhu Zhenxin, head of Asymptote Investment Research in Beijing, said, “Selling right now will free up positions so that they can provide a boost at a future time of risk.” Zhu Zhenxin added, “Such intervention will prevent a ‘mad bull’ like the one we saw in 2015.” Attention is now on how much stock remains to sell. Some investors think tech buying could restart once supply dries up. Demand has stayed strong even with clear intervention. The CSI 1000 Index, home to rocket stocks like Hunan Aerospace Huanyu Communication Technology Co. and chip supply names, is still at its highest level since 2017. Questions remain about whether heavy ETF trading is distorting prices. For now, Niu Chunbao, a fund manager at Shanghai Wanji Asset Management Co., is watching blue chips caught in the selling. Niu Chunbao said, “I am pleased to see the team exit some of the ETFs as gains in some stocks were making the market restless and impulsive.” Niu Chunbao added, “Dips caused by their selling may render some value stocks even more attractive to us.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

According to data from Tokenomist, seven major projects will release tokens worth over $120 million combined between January 28 and February 1, 2025. These scheduled events represent a crucial test for market depth and investor sentiment, providing a real-time case study in tokenomics and supply dynamics. Token Unlocks: A Detailed Breakdown of This Week’s Releases The mechanics of token unlocks are fundamental to cryptocurrency investing. Projects typically lock up portions of their token supply for team members, investors, and foundations. These locked tokens release on predetermined schedules, adding new coins to the circulating supply. Consequently, this process can create selling pressure if recipients choose to liquidate their holdings. This week’s schedule presents a diverse range of unlocks by value, percentage of supply, and project maturity. Tokenomist’s data reveals a carefully staggered timeline. The week begins with SIGN’s substantial release of 290 million tokens, valued at $11.61 million. This event represents a significant 17.68% of its circulating supply. Following closely, Jupiter (JUP) will unlock 53.47 million tokens. Although the dollar value is similar at $9.94 million, it constitutes a much smaller 1.70% of its circulating supply, indicating a larger overall market capitalization. Mid-week activity intensifies with TREE and KMNO unlocks. TREE’s release is particularly notable due to its size relative to supply. The project will unlock 85.73 million tokens, worth $8.34 million, which equates to a substantial 39.41% of its circulating supply. Such a large relative increase often warrants close market observation. Conversely, KMNO’s 230 million token unlock, while large in number, represents only 3.68% of its circulating supply at a value of $10.07 million. Analyzing the Impact of Major Unlocks: SUI and OP in Focus The latter part of the week features unlocks from two of the most watched layer-1 and layer-2 networks. Optimism (OP) will release 31.34 million tokens, valued at $8.97 million, on January 31. This event represents 1.62% of its circulating supply. Historical data often shows that unlocks from established, high-market-cap projects like OP can have a more muted immediate price impact due to deeper liquidity and broader investor bases. The $60.9 Million SUI Unlock: Context and Market Expectations The week’s headline event arrives on February 1 with the SUI network unlock. A total of 43.53 million SUI tokens, valued at approximately $60.94 million, will enter circulation. Despite the high dollar value, this release constitutes only 1.15% of SUI’s total circulating supply. This ratio is critical for analysis. A small percentage unlock from a large-cap asset often gets absorbed by the market with less volatility than a large percentage unlock from a smaller project. Market analysts typically monitor trading volume and order book depth in the hours surrounding such events to gauge absorption capacity. Simultaneously on February 1, EIGEN will complete the week’s schedule with a release of 36.82 million tokens worth $11.56 million, accounting for 8.88% of its circulating supply. The clustering of SUI and EIGEN unlocks on the same day may test cross-market liquidity and broader sector sentiment. Historical Precedents and Investor Strategies for Unlock Events Experienced market participants approach token unlock weeks with defined strategies. Historical price action around similar events provides essential context. For instance, unlocks that represent a small fraction of circulating supply (like JUP’s 1.70% or SUI’s 1.15%) have frequently resulted in less pronounced price movement. Conversely, unlocks representing a large percentage of circulating supply, such as TREE’s 39.41%, have a higher historical correlation with increased volatility. Investors also consider the recipient profile. Unlocks destined for early venture investors or team treasuries may behave differently than those for ecosystem rewards or community pools. The former group may have different cost bases and investment horizons. Furthermore, the overall market condition during the unlock week plays a decisive role. A bullish, high-volume market can absorb new supply more effortlessly than a bearish, low-confidence environment. Strategic responses often involve monitoring derivatives data, such as funding rates and open interest on perpetual swap markets, to understand trader positioning. Additionally, an increase in exchange inflows for the unlocking token in the days preceding the event can signal anticipated selling pressure. Savvy investors use these weeks not just for risk management, but also to identify potential buying opportunities if market overreactions occur. The Broader Tokenomics Perspective: Why Unlocks Matter Token unlocks are not merely calendar events; they are a transparent manifestation of a project’s economic design. A predictable, well-communicated unlock schedule aligns with principles of good governance and reduces information asymmetry. It allows all market participants to price in future supply increases. This week’s diverse set of unlocks—from the high-supply-impact TREE release to the high-dollar-value but low-percentage SUI unlock—demonstrates the spectrum of tokenomic models in the blockchain industry. Projects with a large portion of their total supply still locked face a long-term overhang that markets continuously discount. Therefore, the journey towards a fully diluted valuation is a multi-year process for many cryptocurrencies. Analysts emphasize that the key metric is not the unlock itself, but the subsequent net flow of tokens. If the unlocked tokens are staked, delegated, or otherwise put to productive use within the ecosystem, the net selling pressure can be significantly lower than the gross unlock amount. Conclusion This week’s key token unlocks, featuring a major $60.9 million SUI release, provide a concentrated look at the ongoing maturation of cryptocurrency markets. The varying scale and impact of the seven scheduled events underscore the importance of nuanced tokenomics analysis. While unlocks can introduce short-term volatility, they also represent the methodical transition of projects from controlled distribution to open market dynamics. For informed investors, these periods offer valuable insights into market depth, project health, and the real-world application of economic models written into smart contracts. Monitoring the market’s absorption of this $120 million+ in new supply will be crucial for understanding current sentiment and liquidity strength in early 2025. FAQs Q1: What are cryptocurrency token unlocks? Token unlocks are scheduled events where previously locked or vesting tokens are released into the circulating supply. These tokens are often allocated to team members, investors, advisors, or community treasuries and become tradable on the open market according to a project’s published tokenomics schedule. Q2: Why does the SUI unlock matter if it’s only 1.15% of supply? While the percentage is small, the absolute dollar value is significant at $60.9 million. This amount tests market liquidity and investor demand. Even a small percentage of a large market capitalization can represent a substantial volume that needs to be absorbed by buyers, potentially affecting the price in the short term. Q3: Which unlock this week has the largest impact relative to its circulating supply? The TREE token unlock represents 39.41% of its circulating supply, which is the largest relative increase scheduled for this week. This high percentage means the available tokens for trading will increase significantly, which historically has a higher potential to cause price volatility compared to smaller relative unlocks. Q4: How do investors typically prepare for major token unlock weeks? Investors monitor exchange inflow data, derivatives market positioning, and overall market sentiment. They assess the unlock’s size relative to average daily trading volume and may adjust positions based on the recipient profile (e.g., venture investors vs. community rewards). Some employ hedging strategies or wait for post-unlock volatility to subside before entering new positions. Q5: Do all token unlocks lead to price decreases? Not necessarily. The market impact depends on multiple factors: the overall market trend, the unlock size relative to daily volume, the profile of the token recipients, and whether the unlocked tokens are immediately sold or held/staked.

A selloff in its massive $7.3 trillion government bond market wiped out $41 billion in a single session and wrecked whatever calm investors thought Japan still offered. The yield on the 30-year bond spiked over a quarter percentage point in one day. That’s not normal. Pramol Dhawan at Pacific Investment Management said, “A quarter-point surge in yields in a single session. Let that sink in.” This is the same market that used to take weeks to move by a couple basis points. For years, Japan was where investors went for low rates and funding. Now it’s the source of chaos. Inflation has stuck. Prime Minister Takaichi Sanae is doubling down on spending. Bond traders are now staring at yields over 4% on long-term debt, and they’re not ready for what’s coming. Takaichi’s stimulus and election plan sends bonds into chaos Takaichi called a snap election for February 8. She and her rivals are both pushing looser spending. That’s only made things worse. Tuesday’s crash was brutal. The 40-year yield hit 4% for the first time ever. The 30-year jumped eight times more than its usual daily range. This isn’t a normal correction. Masayuki Koguchi from Mitsubishi UFJ said, “I don’t think Japan’s yields have gone far enough yet. This is just the beginning. There’s a chance that bigger shocks will happen.” It’s been building for a while. The Bank of Japan ended negative interest rates back in March 2024. Since then, the JGB market has had nine separate days where losses were more than double the average. The currency’s been a mess too. When Kazuo Ueda at the central bank said they might buy bonds again, long-term debt started to bounce back. But the yen crashed. Then it flipped again. Rumors of government intervention started floating around trading desks in Tokyo. It got real when the New York Fed called banks to ask about the yen’s exchange rate. That’s a clear warning. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent picked up the phone and called Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama. This is no longer just Japan’s headache. Goldman Sachs crunched the numbers. Every 10 basis points of sudden JGB stress adds about 2 to 3 basis points to U.S. yields. That’s how Japan is now shaking global markets. Foreign bets unwind as carry trades come under pressure The yen isn’t just a currency. It’s a tool for funding bets worldwide. Right now, foreign money has borrowed billions using yen to gamble on higher returns elsewhere. Mizuho Securities says up to $450 billion of trades are built on that. If Japanese yields keep climbing, that entire strategy can collapse. And it’s already happening. In mid 2024, when the BOJ hiked again, the yen soared. Global stocks and bonds dropped fast. Investors dumped $1.1 trillion worth of carry trades. The BOJ tried to calm things down by saying it would raise rates slowly. They’re only at 0.75% now. But that message just made traders restart the same bets. Now the bond auctions are failing. Investors have stopped showing up. Inflation is at 3.1%. That’s the fourth year in a row it’s beaten the central bank’s 2% target. Public anger over living costs forced Shigeru Ishiba out in October. Takaichi stepped in and promised to hand out the biggest stimulus since COVID. That made yields jump even faster. The 30-year yield climbed 75 basis points in under three months. It had taken most of 2025 to rise that much. Shinji Kunibe from Sumitomo Mitsui DS said, “Since Takaichi came into office, there’s been some disregard toward the yield movements. The fiscal situation is causing a credibility issue.” Even the U.K. comparison has come up. Some traders are now calling this a Japan version of the Liz Truss collapse in 2022. Ugo Lancioni at Neuberger Berman said, “The danger is that Japan was a market that never moved and now you’re dealing with a level of volatility that is remarkable. You could call it a Truss moment.” Domestic money starts coming home and foreign outflows hit Japan’s government debt load is still massive. The debt-to-GDP ratio is 230%, the worst in the G7. When Takaichi talked about suspending sales tax on food, the bond market sank again. That wouldn’t have mattered in the old days when the BOJ bought every bond in sight. But now that they’ve pulled back, bad news actually hurts. Foreign ownership of JGBs is climbing fast. Back in 2009, foreigners made up 12% of monthly bond trades. Now they’re 65%. They trade faster, leave quicker, and push volatility higher. Stefan Rittner at Allianz Global Investors said the market is in a fragile phase. The BOJ is pulling back, and local buyers aren’t stepping up fast enough. The crash didn’t take much volume. Just $170 million in 30-year bonds and $110 million in 40-year bonds triggered the collapse. That’s a tiny trade for a $7.3 trillion market. But it snowballed fast. Now, Japanese investors are starting to look inward. Around $5 trillion of Japan’s capital is invested abroad. But with domestic yields rising, that might change. Sumitomo Mitsui’s global markets head Arihiro Nagata said, “I always loved foreign bond investment, but not anymore. Now it’s JGBs.” Japan’s second-biggest bank is shifting its portfolio. Life insurers are watching too. Meiji Yasuda, with $2 trillion in securities, says the buying opportunity is coming. Goldman Sachs says Japan’s 30-year yield could soon match the U.S. Treasury’s. The 10-year bond is heating up too. Koguchi said it could rise another 1.25 points to hit 3.5%. That number matters. It affects everything from mortgage rates to corporate loans. Without a big shift in policy, the pressure isn’t going away. James Athey at Marlborough Investment called repatriation flows “the elephant in the room.” He said, “The economics are already overwhelming for Japanese investors. But history says they won’t rush. It is a positive that we’ve seen some baby steps in that direction with headlines suggesting that Sumitomo is looking to increase JGB exposure.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

57467557,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=265227,1769389212,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Altcoin Season Index Reveals Stark 27 Score, Signaling Bitcoin’s Powerful Dominance",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/altcoin-season-index-27-bitcoin-dominance/,"BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index Reveals Stark 27 Score, Signaling Bitcoin’s Powerful Dominance Global cryptocurrency markets are currently exhibiting a clear preference for the original digital asset, as evidenced by a critical on-chain metric. The Altcoin Season Index, a widely monitored benchmark from CoinMarketCap, has registered a score of just 27, signaling a period of pronounced Bitcoin dominance. This reading, captured in the first quarter of 2025, provides a data-driven snapshot of relative performance trends across the top 100 digital assets. Consequently, investors and analysts are scrutinizing this figure to understand the underlying market structure and potential capital rotation patterns. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index Score of 27 CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index serves as a quantitative gauge for market cycles. The platform calculates this metric by analyzing the 90-day price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, deliberately excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens. The core comparison pits these assets against Bitcoin’s performance over the same period. A formal “altcoin season” is declared only when 75% of these top coins outperform Bitcoin, which corresponds to an index score of 75 or higher. Therefore, the current score of 27 sits far below this threshold. This low value indicates that a significant majority of major altcoins have underperformed Bitcoin in recent months, reinforcing Bitcoin’s status as the market leader. Market analysts often reference historical data for context. For instance, previous bull cycles have seen the index surge above 75 for sustained periods, often coinciding with massive capital inflows into smaller-cap projects. The current subdued reading suggests a more cautious or concentrated market environment. Several factors could contribute to this dynamic, including macroeconomic uncertainty, regulatory developments favoring more established assets, or a maturation phase where investors seek perceived safety. This metric, therefore, acts not as a predictor but as a confirmation of existing trends, offering a neutral lens through which to view market sentiment. Understanding Bitcoin Dominance in Current Market Conditions The low Altcoin Season Index score directly correlates with a high Bitcoin dominance figure. Bitcoin dominance measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. When the index is low, dominance is typically rising or elevated, as capital consolidates within the flagship cryptocurrency. This phase often follows major market corrections or precedes significant macroeconomic announcements, where investors exhibit a “flight to quality” mentality within the digital asset space. Historical analysis shows that periods of high Bitcoin dominance can persist for months before eventually giving way to altcoin rallies. Furthermore, this environment impacts trading strategies and portfolio allocations. Seasoned traders monitor this index alongside other on-chain signals, such as exchange flows and network activity. The persistent low score suggests that, for now, speculative energy is not broadly distributed across alternative cryptocurrencies. Instead, it remains focused on Bitcoin and possibly a handful of the largest, most liquid altcoins. This creates a bifurcated market where narrative-driven altcoin pumps are less frequent and sustainable compared to periods when the index reads above 75. The data underscores a period of consolidation and selectivity. Expert Analysis on Market Cycle Positioning Financial researchers emphasize that the Altcoin Season Index is a lagging indicator, confirming trends already in motion. Its utility lies in validating broader market phase hypotheses. A score of 27 firmly places the market in what analysts term a “Bitcoin-centric” or “accumulation” phase for altcoins. During such phases, fundamental development often continues unabated on altcoin networks, even if price action remains subdued relative to Bitcoin. This can set the stage for future rotations, as projects that build utility during quiet periods may attract attention when sentiment shifts. The index thus provides a crucial checkpoint for assessing risk appetite and the maturity of the current market cycle. The Mechanics and History of the Altcoin Season Metric The methodology behind the index is straightforward yet powerful. By focusing on a 90-day window, it smooths out short-term volatility and captures medium-term trends. The exclusion of stablecoins and wrapped tokens is critical, as their pegged nature would distort performance comparisons. The top 100 by market cap ensures the metric reflects the movement of significant, investable assets rather than micro-cap projects. This basket changes over time, reflecting the evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency sector. Notable historical readings provide perspective. The index famously approached 100 during the late 2017 and early 2021 market peaks, periods characterized by explosive altcoin gains. Conversely, readings deep in bear markets often hover near zero, indicating almost universal underperformance against Bitcoin. The current score of 27, while low, is not at an extreme historical low. This suggests a market that is cautious but not entirely devoid of altcoin interest. Some sectors, like decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure or specific Layer 1 solutions, may still show resilience even while the aggregate index remains depressed. Altcoin Season Index Threshold Interpretation Index Range Common Interpretation Typical Market Phase 0-25 Strong Bitcoin Dominance Accumulation/Caution 26-50 Moderate Bitcoin Leadership Early-Mid Cycle 51-74 Altcoins Gaining Momentum Cycle Transition 75-100 Full Altcoin Season Risk-On Expansion Monitoring this index requires understanding its limitations. It does not account for the magnitude of outperformance, only the percentage of coins that do so. Additionally, it equally weights each of the top 100 coins in its calculation, regardless of their individual market cap size within that group. Despite these nuances, it remains a cornerstone tool for gauging market cycle dynamics. Its publication by a major data aggregator like CoinMarketCap ensures widespread visibility and trust in the underlying data integrity. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index registering at 27 offers a clear, numerical insight into present cryptocurrency market structure. This score underscores a period where Bitcoin continues to command investor preference and capital flows, overshadowing broad-based altcoin performance. For market participants, this metric serves as a vital diagnostic tool, confirming the dominance phase and informing strategic patience regarding altcoin allocations. While the index may shift with changing market sentiment, its current reading provides an unambiguous snapshot of a Bitcoin-led market environment as of early 2025. Observing future movements in the Altcoin Season Index will be crucial for identifying the next potential rotation of capital within the digital asset ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What does an Altcoin Season Index score of 27 mean? An index score of 27 means that only a small fraction of the top 100 cryptocurrencies have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. It indicates that market conditions currently favor Bitcoin, and a full “altcoin season” is not active. Q2: How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? CoinMarketCap calculates the index by comparing the 90-day price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin’s performance. The score reflects the percentage of those altcoins that outperformed Bitcoin. Q3: What score indicates an altcoin season has started? A formal altcoin season is typically declared when the index reaches a score of 75 or higher. This threshold means at least 75% of the top altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the measured 90-day period. Q4: Does a low index score mean altcoins are a bad investment? Not necessarily. A low score indicates relative underperformance compared to Bitcoin in the short-to-medium term. It often reflects market cycles and risk sentiment. Many investors view such periods as accumulation phases for fundamentally strong altcoin projects. Q5: How often does the Altcoin Season Index update? The index is typically updated regularly by data providers like CoinMarketCap, reflecting the latest 90-day rolling performance data. Investors should check the source for the most current reading and methodology details.

World Liberty Financial’s Major Cryptocurrency Reallocation World Liberty Financial, a prominent institutional investment firm, recently completed a noteworthy digital asset transaction. The firm sold exactly 93.77 WBTC tokens, representing approximately $8.07 million in value at transaction time. Subsequently, World Liberty Financial purchased 2,868.4 ETH tokens at an average price of $2,813 per token. This substantial reallocation between two leading cryptocurrency assets represents one of the more significant institutional moves observed in recent months. On-chain analytics platform Onchain Lens first reported this transaction through its monitoring systems. The platform tracks large-scale movements across major blockchain networks. Transaction verification occurred through multiple blockchain explorers, confirming the wallet addresses associated with World Liberty Financial. Such transparent verification provides market participants with reliable data about institutional positioning. Understanding the WBTC to ETH Conversion Mechanics Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) represents Bitcoin tokens on the Ethereum blockchain through a custodial wrapping process. Each WBTC token maintains a 1:1 value peg with Bitcoin. This wrapping mechanism enables Bitcoin holders to participate in Ethereum’s decentralized finance ecosystem. World Liberty Financial’s decision to unwrap these assets and convert them to native Ethereum represents a strategic shift between two distinct blockchain ecosystems. The transaction timing coincided with specific market conditions worth noting. Ethereum traded within a consolidation pattern during the transaction period. Bitcoin demonstrated relative strength against major resistance levels. This context suggests World Liberty Financial might have executed this rebalancing to capitalize on perceived relative value opportunities between the two leading cryptocurrencies. Institutional Cryptocurrency Strategy Analysis Institutional investors typically approach cryptocurrency allocations with specific strategic frameworks. Portfolio rebalancing represents a standard practice in traditional finance that now extends to digital assets. World Liberty Financial’s move follows observable patterns among sophisticated investors adjusting exposure based on multiple factors. Several potential motivations could explain this substantial reallocation: Yield generation opportunities: Ethereum’s staking mechanisms currently offer approximately 3-5% annual returns Ecosystem development: Ethereum’s ongoing upgrades and layer-2 expansion create utility value Portfolio diversification: Reducing concentration in Bitcoin-correlated assets Technical analysis: Relative strength indicators favoring Ethereum over Bitcoin Historical data reveals similar institutional rebalancing often precedes broader market trends. Major investment firms frequently adjust allocations before retail investors recognize shifting dynamics. World Liberty Financial’s substantial position change warrants attention from market observers monitoring institutional sentiment. Market Impact and Broader Implications Transactions of this magnitude inevitably influence market perceptions and sometimes price action. While $8.1 million represents a modest portion of daily trading volume, the symbolic significance outweighs the direct market impact. Institutional moves signal confidence levels and strategic outlooks that smaller investors often monitor closely. The cryptocurrency market maintains particular sensitivity to institutional positioning changes. Several factors amplify the importance of World Liberty Financial’s transaction: Factor Significance Transaction Size Among larger single-entity moves in past 90 days Asset Selection Direct shift between two market leaders Timing Context Precedes major network upgrades for both assets Transparency Level Fully verifiable on public blockchains Market analysts generally interpret such reallocations as calculated strategic decisions rather than speculative trading. World Liberty Financial maintains a reputation for methodical investment approaches across traditional and digital asset classes. The firm’s public statements emphasize long-term value creation over short-term trading profits. The Evolving Institutional Cryptocurrency Landscape Institutional cryptocurrency adoption has progressed through distinct phases since 2020. Initial Bitcoin-focused allocations dominated early institutional entry. Portfolio diversification into alternative cryptocurrencies represents the current maturation phase. World Liberty Financial’s substantial Ethereum acquisition aligns with this broader institutional trend toward multi-asset cryptocurrency strategies. Several developments make Ethereum particularly attractive to institutional investors currently: The successful transition to proof-of-stake consensus mechanism Growing institutional adoption of Ethereum-based financial products Expanding real-world asset tokenization on Ethereum networks Regulatory clarity improvements in major jurisdictions Comparative analysis reveals Ethereum’s network activity consistently exceeds other smart contract platforms. Daily transaction volumes, developer activity, and total value locked metrics demonstrate Ethereum’s continued dominance. World Liberty Financial likely considered these fundamental metrics alongside technical analysis when executing this rebalancing. Technical Execution and Blockchain Verification On-chain data provides transparent verification of World Liberty Financial’s transactions. The WBTC unwrapping process involves interacting with the WBTC custodial smart contract. Subsequent Ethereum purchases occurred across multiple decentralized exchanges to minimize price impact. This execution strategy demonstrates sophisticated trading approaches characteristic of institutional participants. Blockchain analysis confirms the transaction occurred without unusual patterns or concerning elements. Gas fees remained within normal ranges for transactions of this size. The execution timing avoided periods of known network congestion. These technical details reinforce the transaction’s calculated, strategic nature rather than reactive trading behavior. Multiple blockchain explorers recorded identical transaction details, ensuring data accuracy. The Ethereum blockchain’s transparency enables real-time verification of large transactions. Market surveillance platforms like Onchain Lens automatically detect and report significant movements. This ecosystem transparency represents a fundamental advantage of blockchain-based assets over traditional financial instruments. Historical Context and Future Implications Historical cryptocurrency market data reveals patterns following similar institutional reallocations. Previous instances of substantial Bitcoin-to-Ethereum conversions often preceded periods of Ethereum outperformance. While past performance never guarantees future results, historical context provides valuable perspective for market participants. The cryptocurrency market continues evolving toward institutional dominance. Traditional financial entities increasingly allocate capital to digital assets. World Liberty Financial’s transaction represents this broader transition toward professionalized cryptocurrency investment management. Market structure changes accordingly, with growing emphasis on fundamental analysis and strategic positioning. Future market developments may validate or challenge World Liberty Financial’s positioning decision. Several upcoming events could influence the relative performance of Bitcoin versus Ethereum: Ethereum’s next major protocol upgrade scheduled for 2025 Potential Bitcoin ETF expansions and regulatory developments Macroeconomic factors influencing all risk assets Technological advancements across both blockchain networks Market participants will monitor whether other institutional investors follow similar rebalancing strategies. Herd behavior sometimes emerges in institutional cryptocurrency markets, particularly when leading firms establish new positioning trends. The coming months may reveal whether World Liberty Financial’s move represents an isolated decision or early indicator of broader institutional sentiment shifts. Conclusion World Liberty Financial’s $8.1 million conversion from WBTC to ETH represents a significant institutional cryptocurrency rebalancing with multiple implications. The transaction demonstrates continued institutional engagement with digital assets while highlighting strategic differences between leading cryptocurrencies. Market observers should consider this move within broader context of institutional cryptocurrency adoption and portfolio management evolution. The transparent nature of blockchain transactions enables detailed analysis of such strategic decisions, providing valuable insights for all market participants monitoring institutional positioning in cryptocurrency markets. FAQs Q1: What exactly did World Liberty Financial do with their cryptocurrency holdings?

57467713,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=265232,1769389811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,South Korean Bitcoin Catastrophe: Prosecutors Pinpoint Phishing in Staggering Loss of Seized Crypto,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/south-korean-bitcoin-phishing-loss/,"BitcoinWorld South Korean Bitcoin Catastrophe: Prosecutors Pinpoint Phishing in Staggering Loss of Seized Crypto SEOUL, South Korea – In a stunning security breach that exposes critical vulnerabilities in digital asset custody, South Korean prosecutors now suspect a sophisticated phishing attack led to the disappearance of seized Bitcoin valued at tens of billions of won. This incident, first reported by Segye Ilbo, throws a harsh spotlight on the procedural risks law enforcement faces when managing confiscated cryptocurrency, especially when relying on hardware wallets. Consequently, the investigation underscores a pressing, global challenge for authorities worldwide as they increasingly grapple with securing digital evidence and assets. South Korean Bitcoin Investigation Uncovers Phishing Vector According to official explanations from the prosecutorial team, the lost cryptocurrency was stored on a hardware wallet—a device typically considered among the most secure methods for holding digital assets. However, investigators believe the security key was compromised when someone connected the wallet to an internet-enabled device and subsequently accessed a malicious phishing site. This action potentially allowed attackers to drain the funds without direct physical access to the wallet itself. Therefore, this points not to a brute-force hack but to a social engineering exploit, a method that remains alarmingly effective against even robust technical safeguards. Furthermore, the case reveals a complex custody arrangement. The seized assets were under shared management, a detail that has expanded the scope of the inquiry. Prosecutors are actively considering the possibility of intentional theft by an insider with authorized access. This dual-track investigation—examining both external cyber intrusion and internal malfeasance—illustrates the multifaceted security threats confronting institutional crypto holders. For instance, similar high-profile losses have occurred at exchanges and investment funds, where combined human error and insider threats have led to catastrophic financial damage. Hardware Wallet Security Under Scrutiny This incident critically challenges the perceived invulnerability of hardware wallets. Often marketed as “cold storage” and immune to online attacks, their security model depends entirely on user behavior. When connected to a compromised computer or if the user is tricked into approving a malicious transaction, the physical device offers no protection. Security experts consistently warn that the “air-gap” is only as strong as the person bridging it. Private Key Isolation: Hardware wallets store private keys offline, but they must interact with online software to sign transactions. Phishing Vulnerability: Attackers can create fake interfaces that trick users into signing transactions that send funds to the attacker’s address. Supply Chain Risks: Maliciously modified hardware or compromised seed phrases during manufacturing present additional threats. For law enforcement agencies, this creates a significant dilemma. They must balance security with accessibility, as evidence may need to be accessed or transferred for legal proceedings. The South Korean case suggests that standard operating procedures for managing seized crypto may be dangerously outdated. A comparative analysis shows varied approaches globally: Jurisdiction Typical Seizure Custody Method Notable Incidents United States Transfer to government-controlled wallets, use of third-party custodians Department of Justice auctions seized Bitcoin United Kingdom Similar to US, with increasing use of regulated custodian services National Crime Agency has specialized crypto units South Korea (prior to incident) Hardware wallet storage under shared management Current investigation into phishing loss Expert Analysis on Institutional Crypto Custody Cybersecurity specialists emphasize that institutional custody, especially for legally seized assets, requires enterprise-grade solutions far beyond consumer hardware wallets. These include multi-signature setups requiring several authorized keys, dedicated hardware security modules (HSMs), and rigorous transaction approval workflows. The apparent use of a standard hardware wallet in a shared management context, as described by prosecutors, indicates a potential gap between the technical complexity of cryptocurrencies and existing asset management protocols within some government bodies. This gap represents a systemic risk as the volume of seized digital assets continues to grow worldwide. The Broader Impact on Crypto Regulation and Enforcement The financial loss, while significant, may have a more profound impact on regulatory confidence and operational tactics. Firstly, it could strengthen regulatory arguments for stricter oversight of all cryptocurrency custody solutions, including those used by private entities. Secondly, it may force law enforcement agencies globally to audit and overhaul their digital evidence handling procedures. Finally, the incident provides a stark, real-world case study for legislators debating new digital asset laws, highlighting that security failures can occur at any point in the chain, even under state control. Moreover, the timing is critical. South Korea has been actively refining its regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, aiming to enhance consumer protection and prevent financial crimes. A high-profile failure within the prosecutorial system itself could accelerate calls for more robust, standardized national protocols for handling digital assets. This event may also influence ongoing discussions about central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), where security and custody are paramount concerns for policymakers. Conclusion The suspected phishing attack leading to the loss of seized Bitcoin in South Korea serves as a critical warning for institutions worldwide. It demonstrates that even hardware wallets, when mismanaged or exposed to social engineering, can fail. The investigation underscores the urgent need for specialized, secure, and auditable custody frameworks for digital assets, particularly within law enforcement and government agencies. As cryptocurrency adoption progresses, developing and implementing these ironclad protocols will be essential to maintaining legal integrity and public trust. This South Korean Bitcoin incident is likely to become a benchmark case, driving significant changes in how seized digital assets are secured globally. FAQs Q1: What exactly happened in the South Korean seized Bitcoin case? South Korean prosecutors lost access to seized Bitcoin worth tens of billions of won. They suspect a phishing attack compromised the hardware wallet storing the crypto, though insider theft is also under investigation due to shared management of the assets. Q2: How can a hardware wallet be vulnerable to a phishing attack? While hardware wallets keep private keys offline, they must connect to software (on a computer or phone) to sign transactions. If a user is tricked into visiting a phishing site and approves a malicious transaction signature, funds can be stolen without the wallet itself being hacked. Q3: What does “shared management” of the seized assets imply? It suggests multiple individuals or departments had access or authority over the hardware wallet and its credentials. This complicates the investigation, as it raises the possibility that someone with legitimate access intentionally stole the cryptocurrency. Q4: How do other countries typically handle seized cryptocurrency? Methods vary. Many transfer seized crypto to government-controlled wallets, often using multi-signature technology or third-party custodian services with enterprise-grade security. Some, like the U.S. Department of Justice, eventually auction seized assets. Q5: What are the likely long-term effects of this incident? The case will likely pressure global law enforcement to adopt stricter, more secure digital asset custody protocols. It may also influence cryptocurrency regulation, emphasizing the need for robust institutional security standards and potentially accelerating the development of more secure custody solutions for government use.

This regulatory evolution follows years of careful observation and represents Japan’s strategic move to establish itself as a mature, regulated hub for cryptocurrency investment products while maintaining its reputation for investor protection. Japan Crypto ETFs: The Regulatory Pathway to 2028 According to exclusive reporting from Nikkei, Japan’s primary financial newspaper, the FSA plans to amend the enforcement order of the Investment Trust Act to formally classify cryptocurrencies as “specified assets” eligible for investment through trust structures. This classification represents a fundamental shift in how Japanese regulators perceive digital assets, moving them from speculative instruments to legitimate investment vehicles. The agency has conducted extensive consultations with market participants throughout 2024 and 2025, examining international precedents while adapting frameworks to Japan’s unique financial ecosystem. Furthermore, this regulatory adjustment will create a clear legal foundation for financial institutions to develop and offer spot crypto ETF products. Major Japanese financial giants including SBI Holdings and Nomura Holdings have already initiated product development in anticipation of this regulatory change. These institutions bring decades of experience in traditional finance alongside recent investments in digital asset infrastructure, positioning them to launch sophisticated products that meet both regulatory standards and investor expectations. Spot Bitcoin ETF Japan: Market Implications and Global Context The potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in Japan carries significant implications for both domestic and international markets. Japan represents the world’s third-largest economy and maintains one of Asia’s most sophisticated financial markets. The introduction of regulated spot crypto ETFs would provide Japanese investors with a familiar, transparent vehicle for cryptocurrency exposure while offering institutional investors the custodial and regulatory safeguards absent from direct cryptocurrency ownership. Comparatively, Japan’s anticipated 2028 timeline places it following the United States’ 2024 approval but potentially ahead of other major Asian economies. This strategic timing allows Japanese regulators to learn from the U.S. implementation while developing frameworks tailored to local market characteristics. The table below illustrates key differences between the anticipated Japanese approach and existing international models: Market Approval Year Key Regulatory Features Custody Requirements United States 2024 SEC oversight, cash creations Qualified custodians, insurance mandates Canada 2021 Prospectus requirements Cold storage mandates Japan (Expected) 2028 FSA oversight, Investment Trust Act Expected stringent domestic custody rules Additionally, Japan’s approach emphasizes several distinctive elements: Gradual implementation allowing market participants to adapt systems Integration with existing investment trust frameworks rather than creating entirely new structures Emphasis on retail investor protection through disclosure requirements Collaboration with self-regulatory organizations including the Japan Securities Dealers Association Expert Analysis: Why Japan’s Cautious Approach Matters Financial regulation experts note that Japan’s deliberate timeline reflects lessons learned from previous cryptocurrency market experiences, including the 2014 Mt. Gox incident and subsequent exchange regulations. The FSA’s methodical approach prioritizes system stability over speed, potentially creating more durable market structures. Market analysts suggest this measured progression could establish Japan as a quality benchmark for other jurisdictions developing similar frameworks, particularly in markets prioritizing investor protection alongside innovation. Moreover, Japan’s existing regulatory framework for cryptocurrency exchanges, established through the Payment Services Act amendments, provides a foundation upon which ETF regulations can build. This existing infrastructure includes: Licensing requirements for cryptocurrency exchange operators Segregation of customer assets from exchange assets Annual financial audits and reporting obligations Cybersecurity standards and cold storage requirements FSA Cryptocurrency Regulation: Evolution of Japan’s Digital Asset Policy The Financial Services Agency’s expected move represents the latest evolution in Japan’s progressive yet cautious approach to digital asset regulation. Following the 2017 recognition of cryptocurrencies as legal payment methods, Japan has systematically developed one of the world’s most comprehensive regulatory regimes for cryptocurrency exchanges. The proposed ETF approval continues this trajectory, expanding regulated access points while maintaining robust oversight mechanisms. Furthermore, this development aligns with broader Japanese government initiatives to promote technological innovation in financial services. The FSA has actively participated in international regulatory discussions through organizations like the Financial Stability Board and International Organization of Securities Commissions, contributing Japanese perspectives while learning from global experiences. This balanced approach seeks to position Japan as an attractive jurisdiction for legitimate cryptocurrency businesses while deterring illicit activities. Tokyo Stock Exchange Crypto Products: Accessibility for Retail Investors Should these products receive final approval, listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange would make spot cryptocurrency ETFs accessible to Japan’s substantial retail investor population through standard brokerage accounts. This accessibility represents a significant democratization of cryptocurrency investment, removing technical barriers associated with direct cryptocurrency ownership while providing the transparency and liquidity of exchange-traded products. Retail investors would benefit from familiar trading mechanisms, clear pricing, and the regulatory protections inherent in listed securities. Additionally, exchange listing would integrate cryptocurrency exposure into existing investment portfolios seamlessly. Financial advisors could recommend appropriate allocations within broader investment strategies, while automated investment platforms could include crypto ETFs in their offerings. This integration represents a normalization of cryptocurrency as an asset class within Japan’s investment landscape, potentially attracting capital from investors previously hesitant to navigate cryptocurrency exchanges directly. Institutional Preparation: SBI Holdings and Nomura Holdings Lead Development Major Japanese financial institutions have positioned themselves strategically for this regulatory development. SBI Holdings, through its SBI VC Trade cryptocurrency exchange, has developed extensive digital asset infrastructure and custody solutions. Similarly, Nomura Holdings established its digital assets subsidiary, Laser Digital, which has been building institutional-grade cryptocurrency services. These institutions combine traditional finance expertise with dedicated digital asset divisions, creating organizations capable of meeting both regulatory requirements and market demands. Concurrently, other financial groups including Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Mizuho Financial Group have invested in blockchain technology and digital asset research. This broad institutional engagement suggests strong market readiness once regulatory approval occurs. Product development reportedly includes multiple structures, with some institutions considering physically-backed Bitcoin ETFs while others evaluate multi-asset cryptocurrency baskets that might include Ethereum alongside Bitcoin. Japan Investment Trust Act Amendments: Technical Framework Details The planned amendment to the Investment Trust Act’s enforcement order represents a technical but crucial regulatory adjustment. By classifying cryptocurrencies as “specified assets,” the amendment creates legal certainty for investment trust managers regarding custody, valuation, and disclosure requirements. This classification follows extensive analysis of cryptocurrency characteristics, including volatility patterns, custody methodologies, and valuation mechanisms appropriate for regulated investment products. Moreover, the amendment process involves multiple stages of regulatory review and public commentary. The FSA typically publishes draft amendments for industry feedback before final implementation, allowing market participants to identify practical challenges and propose refinements. This consultative approach has characterized Japan’s financial regulation for decades and contributes to the robustness of final regulatory frameworks. Conclusion Japan’s expected approval of spot cryptocurrency ETFs by 2028 represents a significant milestone in the maturation of global digital asset markets. The Financial Services Agency’s deliberate, evidence-based approach reflects Japan’s commitment to financial innovation balanced with investor protection. As major institutions develop products and the Tokyo Stock Exchange prepares for listings, Japan positions itself as a sophisticated jurisdiction for cryptocurrency investment. This development not only provides Japanese investors with new opportunities but also contributes to the global evolution of cryptocurrency regulation, potentially influencing approaches across Asia and beyond. The journey to 2028 will involve detailed regulatory development, institutional preparation, and market education, ultimately creating new pathways for cryptocurrency adoption within regulated financial systems. FAQs Q1: What exactly is a spot cryptocurrency ETF? A spot cryptocurrency ETF is an exchange-traded fund that holds the actual cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin) rather than derivatives contracts. Investors buy shares representing direct ownership of the underlying digital assets, which are held in secure custody. Q2: Why is Japan waiting until 2028 when the US already approved spot Bitcoin ETFs? Japan’s Financial Services Agency is taking additional time to develop regulatory frameworks specifically tailored to Japan’s market structure and investor protection standards. This timeline allows for careful consideration of custody solutions, valuation methods, and integration with existing financial regulations. Q3: Will retail investors in Japan be able to buy these crypto ETFs? Yes, if approved and listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, these ETFs would be accessible to retail investors through standard brokerage accounts, similar to how they purchase stock ETFs or other exchange-traded products. Q4: What cryptocurrencies might be included in Japanese ETFs? While Bitcoin will likely be the initial focus, the regulatory framework being developed could accommodate other cryptocurrencies that meet specific criteria regarding liquidity, custody solutions, and market capitalization. Q5: How will this affect Japan’s existing cryptocurrency exchanges? Existing licensed exchanges may see increased institutional interest and potentially develop partnerships with ETF providers for custody or liquidity services. The ETF approval represents an additional, regulated access point rather than a replacement for direct exchange trading.

Pacific wrote on X over the weekend, “I am winding-up Entropy.” They added, “After four years, several pivots, and two rounds of layoffs, I’ve decided to wind-up Entropy and return capital to our investors.” Crypto Automation Bet Fell Short After Investor Feedback The shutdown follows a late-stage push in 2025 to reposition the company around a crypto automations platform, which Pacific described as “basically n8n/zapier/etc for crypto,” with automated signing via threshold cryptography, secure computation using trusted execution environments, and “deep AI integrations.” I am winding-up Entropy. After four years, several pivots, and two rounds of layoffs, I’ve decided to wind-up Entropy and return capital to our investors. For the latter half of 2025, the Entropy team was hard at work on a crypto automations platform (basically n8n/zapier/etc… — tux pacific (@__tux) January 24, 2026 That product direction still failed to clear a venture-style growth bar. “After an initial feedback request revealed that the business model wasn’t venture scale, I was left with the choice to find a creative way forward or pivot once more,” Pacific wrote. Entropy first drew attention in 2022 when it raised $25M in a seed round led by a16z crypto, with participation including Dragonfly Capital, Coinbase Ventures, Robot Ventures, Ethereal Ventures, Variant and Inflection. The company had earlier raised a $1.95M pre-seed round. Founder Looks Beyond Digital Assets Toward Pharmaceuticals Research At launch, Entropy pitched itself as a decentralized alternative to custody providers such as Fireblocks and Coinbase, leaning on cryptographic approaches like multi-party computation to let users control how funds could move, including rule-based constraints. Pacific also thanked a16z crypto and Guy Wuollet for helping steer the wind-down, calling their guidance “invaluable.” The closure lands in a tougher funding climate for early-stage crypto startups. Crypto venture deal count fell about 60% year-on-year in 2025, dropping to roughly 1,200 transactions from more than 2,900 in 2024. Next, Pacific said they plan to step back before deciding what comes after Entropy. “My time in crypto might be coming to an end, as I feel myself drawn specifically into pharmaceuticals,” they wrote, adding they want to work on hormone delivery and validate research on new estradiol drug formulations.

Over the course of the year, HTX, the global leading cryptocurrency exchange, continuously evolved its asset listing and governance framework, balancing broad sector coverage with market preemption and disciplined selection standards. Its asset ecosystem delivers both wealth-generation potential and sustained liquidity. Annual Asset Overview: Broad Coverage, High-Quality Listing, Strong Governance According to HTX’s annual report, more than 922,000 users traded in the spot markets in 2025, with total spot trading volume exceeding 1.9 trillion USDT, representing nearly 30% year-on-year growth. Grid trading volume rose 97%, while capital retained in grid bots doubled year-on-year. On asset listings, HTX added 166 cryptocurrencies throughout the year, spanning Layer 1/Layer 2 ecosystems, public chain ecosystems, memecoins, AI, RWAs, stablecoins, DeFi, and Perpetual DEXs. Asset listings became increasingly balanced across both core and emerging sectors. Notably, 76 of these listings were global firsts, placing HTX among the leading exchanges in initial-listing volume. Market performance data further underscores this advantage. 96 listed assets recorded post-listing gains exceeding 100%. The maximum peak return reached 9,500%. These figures validate HTX’s forward-looking capabilities in tapping into high-potential assets and narratives at their early stages. In parallel with continuous listings, HTX strengthened asset governance. In 2025, 241 assets were delisted, primarily due to prolonged inactivity, deteriorating liquidity, or failure to meet updated trading standards. This disciplined pruning ensured the platform’s asset pool remained liquid, tradable, and operationally efficient, safeguarding overall market quality for users. A Year in Review: Initial Listings Are Not Accidental, but Strategic HTX’s asset strategy has consistently focused on projects with strong narrative momentum, community resonance, and long-term value potential. In 2025, this translated into multiple high-impact initial listings, including PIPPIN (95x), DONKEY (69x), M (42x), and TRUMP (10x). As Justin Sun, Advisor to HTX, stated, the platform’s listing principle is simple: “If it’s hot, we list it. If it’s not, we don’t.” Behind this simplicity lies a systematic listing strategy built on narrative analysis, community consensus, liquidity validation, and deep project collaboration, rather than mere speculation. Through partnerships with premium projects and sustained focus on initial listings, HTX repeatedly positioned itself as a market front-runner. Many assets first listed on HTX were later adopted by major exchanges such as Binance, allowing HTX users to benefit not only from lower entry prices, but also from cross-platform valuation premiums. 1. Macro Narratives: Early Positioning Before Consensus Forms In 2025, political narratives entered the crypto market at scale for the first time, and HTX led decisively. In January, HTX became the first exchange globally to list TRUMP, officially announced by Donald Trump himself on Truth Social as the “official memecoin.” The listing ignited market sentiment, with the token reaching a 10x peak gain, making it one of the most traded and widely accepted assets of the year. In May, HTX again led the market by initially listing USD1 , a USD-pegged stablecoin issued by World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a Trump-family-affiliated project. In September, the project’s governance token WLFI debuted on HTX, becoming the first major exchange to systematically support this emerging political-finance ecosystem. 2. Community Sentiment and Ecosystem Cycle: Capturing the BSC and CZ Narrative Throughout the BSC ecosystem’s rapid evolution, HTX maintained close alignment with community sentiment and core narratives, delivering multiple high-profitability deployments. In March, riding the narrative around CZ’s influence and Middle Eastern capital inflows into Binance, HTX listed TST and MUBARAK , both of which doubled shortly after launch. This was followed by highly community-driven memecoins BANANAS31 and DONKEY , achieving 13x and 69x returns, respectively. In July, M emerged as one of the strongest BSC assets of the year with a 42x gain. In October, GIGGLE debuted on HTX with a 4x gain, before being listed on Binance Spot two weeks later. The power of HTX’s initial listings once again speaks for itself. During the same period, HTX became the first centralized exchange to support Chinese-language memecoins for spot trading, launching “Binance Life”. It also completed the spot trading system upgrades for the Chinese trading pairs 87 days ahead of Binance, securing a decisive early-mover position. 3. Forward-Looking Narratives: Early Coverage over AI Agent, DeFAI, and Payment Sectors HTX positioned itself ahead of the explosion in AI Agent and DeFAI narratives. PIPPIN, listed in January, achieved a 95x peak increase by November, becoming one of the most representative wealth-creation assets in the AI Agent sector. HTX also listed GRIFFAIN, HAT, AI16Z, and SWARMS in their early stages, with most delivering strong post-listing performance, further demonstrating the platform’s pre-judgment on emerging technology narratives. Furthermore, HTX has taken the lead in listing assets that fully cover the emerging x402 sector. By being the first to list the Base leader project PING and the Solana-based x402 leader PAYAI, HTX witnessed a phased doubling in the assets’ value following Coinbase’s launch of the x402 V2. Consequently, HTX has become the sole trading platform to support the core assets of this specific track. 4. Long-Term Focus on Value: Perpetual DEX Infrastructure Beyond high-heat narratives, HTX maintained a strategic focus on infrastructure-driven, application-oriented sectors. In September, as perpetual DEXs gained market traction, HTX moved swiftly to secure early exposure. ASTER, the native token of the benchmark BSC-based Perp DEX, rose 3x on HTX before being listed on Binance Spot within one week. AVNT , a key Base ecosystem project, delivered a 14x return after listing on HTX. Outlook 2026: Tapping Value-Driven Assets and Doubling Down on Initial Listings As institutional capital increasingly shapes market structure and the industry matures, HTX will further reinforce its strategy of value reversion and early discovery of high-potential assets. Going forward, HTX will prioritize assets with verifiable revenue streams, regulatory clarity, and sustainable business models. Conversely, high-FDV, low-circulation VC tokens, as well as purely sentiment-driven memecoins without real use cases, will face the strictest listing standards in HTX’s history, ensuring the utmost protection for users’ assets. Shifting decisively from traffic-driven listings to value-driven selection, HTX will anchor its strategy around three core criteria: real revenue backing, strong compliance foundations, and su stainable models. Based on these principles, HTX will focus on four high-conviction sectors: RWA and tokenized real-world assets; prediction markets; revenue-verifiable perpetual DEXs and derivatives infrastructure; and mobile-first PayFi solutions and super DApps. HTX, highlighting longtermism, is building a secure, transparent, and self-sustaining asset ecosystem, positioning itself as a reliable global platform for value discovery.

This accumulation by addresses holding 1,000 BTC or more represents a notable shift in supply distribution that market analysts are closely monitoring for potential implications on price stability and market sentiment. The data, collected globally through on-chain analysis tools, reveals patterns that often precede substantial market movements. Bitcoin Whale Holdings Reach Critical Threshold Santiment’s latest blockchain analysis reveals that Bitcoin whale addresses now control approximately 7.17 million BTC. This substantial holding represents the highest accumulation level since September of last year. Consequently, market observers are examining this trend for potential signals about institutional and large-scale investor behavior. The data specifically tracks addresses containing 1,000 BTC or more, a threshold commonly used to identify significant market participants. Blockchain analytics firms like Santiment employ sophisticated tracking methods to monitor wallet movements. They analyze transaction patterns, address clustering, and supply distribution metrics. These tools provide valuable insights into market structure and participant behavior. The current accumulation trend suggests several possible scenarios that market participants should consider carefully. Historical Context and Market Implications Historically, Bitcoin whale accumulation patterns have correlated with specific market phases. For instance, previous periods of increased whale holdings often preceded extended bull markets. Conversely, distribution phases sometimes signaled impending corrections. The current four-month high in whale holdings therefore warrants careful examination within this historical framework. Market analysts typically consider several factors when interpreting whale behavior: Supply absorption: Large investors removing coins from exchanges Price support: Reduced selling pressure from major holders Market sentiment: Institutional confidence in long-term value Macroeconomic factors: Response to inflation and monetary policy Recent market data shows interesting correlations between whale accumulation and broader financial conditions. For example, traditional market volatility often coincides with increased cryptocurrency accumulation by large holders. Additionally, regulatory developments frequently influence whale behavior patterns across global markets. Expert Analysis of Current Whale Behavior Financial analysts specializing in cryptocurrency markets emphasize the importance of context when interpreting whale data. While increased holdings suggest accumulation, the motivations behind this behavior require careful consideration. Some experts suggest that current accumulation may reflect strategic positioning ahead of anticipated market developments. Blockchain researchers note that whale behavior analysis must account for several technical factors: Bitcoin Whale Holding Analysis Factors Factor Description Current Status Exchange Balances BTC held on trading platforms Decreasing trend Wallet Age Distribution How long coins remain unmoved Increasing hodling Transaction Volume Large transfers between addresses Moderate activity Network Activity Overall blockchain usage metrics Stable patterns Market participants should remember that whale behavior represents just one indicator among many. Comprehensive market analysis requires examining multiple data points simultaneously. Nevertheless, the current trend provides valuable information about supply distribution dynamics. Comparative Analysis with Previous Accumulation Periods The current whale accumulation level of 7.17 million BTC represents a significant recovery from recent lows. Comparing this data with historical patterns reveals interesting parallels and divergences. For instance, similar accumulation periods in 2020 and 2021 preceded substantial market movements. However, each market cycle exhibits unique characteristics that analysts must consider separately. Several key differences distinguish the current accumulation phase: Regulatory environment: More established frameworks globally Institutional participation: Greater traditional finance involvement Market maturity: Improved infrastructure and products Macro conditions: Different interest rate and inflation landscape These factors suggest that historical comparisons, while useful, require careful contextual adjustment. Market participants should analyze current conditions through both historical and contemporary lenses for optimal understanding. Technical and Fundamental Considerations Beyond whale holdings, several technical indicators provide additional context for current market conditions. Network fundamentals, including hash rate and difficulty adjustments, remain strong. Meanwhile, adoption metrics continue showing gradual improvement across various sectors. These factors collectively contribute to the market environment in which whale accumulation occurs. Fundamental analysts emphasize the importance of considering multiple data sources: On-chain transaction volume and velocity Network security and decentralization metrics Institutional product flows and custody solutions Regulatory developments across major jurisdictions This comprehensive approach helps market participants avoid over-reliance on single indicators like whale holdings. Instead, they can develop more nuanced understandings of market dynamics and potential future developments. Potential Market Impacts and Future Scenarios The increased Bitcoin whale holdings could influence market dynamics in several ways. Reduced circulating supply typically supports price stability during accumulation phases. However, concentrated holdings also raise questions about market decentralization and potential selling pressure during distribution periods. Market participants should monitor these factors carefully in coming months. Several scenarios might develop from current conditions: Continued accumulation: Further reduction in exchange balances Price consolidation: Reduced volatility during holding periods Event-driven movement: Response to macroeconomic developments Gradual distribution: Profit-taking during price appreciation Each scenario carries different implications for various market participants. Retail investors, institutions, and traders might adjust strategies accordingly based on their specific goals and risk profiles. The diversity of potential outcomes underscores the importance of ongoing market monitoring and analysis. Conclusion Bitcoin whale holdings reaching a four-month high represents a significant market development worthy of attention. The accumulation of 7.17 million BTC by addresses holding 1,000 BTC or more suggests changing supply dynamics that could influence future price action. While historical patterns provide useful context, current market conditions require fresh analysis considering evolving regulatory frameworks and institutional participation. Market participants should monitor whale behavior alongside other fundamental and technical indicators for comprehensive market understanding. The Santiment data provides valuable insights, but prudent investors will consider multiple data sources when making financial decisions in dynamic cryptocurrency markets. FAQs Q1: What qualifies as a Bitcoin whale address? Analysts typically define Bitcoin whale addresses as those containing 1,000 BTC or more, though some use thresholds of 100 or 10,000 BTC depending on analysis methodology and market context. Q2: How does Santiment track whale holdings? Santiment uses blockchain analysis techniques including address clustering, transaction pattern analysis, and exchange flow tracking to identify and monitor whale addresses and their holdings over time. Q3: Why do whale holdings matter for Bitcoin markets? Whale holdings matter because concentrated ownership can influence price discovery, liquidity, and market stability, with accumulation often reducing immediate selling pressure while raising long-term distribution concerns. Q4: How does current whale accumulation compare to historical patterns? Current accumulation of 7.17 million BTC represents the highest level in four months, showing recovery from recent lows while remaining below all-time highs recorded during previous market cycles. Q5: What other indicators should investors watch alongside whale data? Investors should monitor exchange balances, network fundamentals, regulatory developments, institutional flows, and macroeconomic conditions alongside whale data for comprehensive market analysis.

Stocks slipped again while traders reacted to geopolitics, weather shocks, and policy risk. The mood stayed cautious from Monday to Friday. Nothing felt settled. Money moved fast, but confidence did not. The S&P 500 finished Friday barely above flat, up less than 0.1% on the day, yet still ended the week down 0.4%.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.7% over the week.The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3% on Friday but still closed the week down about 0.1%. Outside stocks, natural gas futures stole the spotlight. Prices jumped 75% in five sessions as Winter Storm Fern pushed Arctic cold and snow across more than 150 million people in the United States. Geopolitics shake currencies as Davos exposes deeper cracks The loudest political signals came from Switzerland. World leaders and executives gathered at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Donald Trump, now the 47th president of the United States, reached a “framework” agreement with European leaders over Greenland. The talks eased immediate tariff threats. They did not end broader friction. Since the post-pandemic rally, currencies had stayed quiet while stocks ran on earnings, AI optimism, and steady U.S. equity demand. That balance is starting to shift. Macquarie global FX and rates strategist Thierry Wizman said the Greenland deal only handled surface issues. He wrote that it did not solve what he called the “mutual alienation” between the U.S. and its allies. He also warned of a world that looks more fractured, where the dollar loses strength and the U.S. turns inward toward the Western Hemisphere. Despite the pause in tariffs and the EU suspending retaliation plans, traders still moved away from the dollar. Over five days, EUR/USD rose nearly 2%. The Swiss franc climbed more than 2.7% against the dollar. The yen gained about 1.8% by the end of the week. The flows showed demand for safety outside the greenback. Fed holds rates steady as chair race draws market focus Attention now turns to Washington. The Federal Reserve meets Wednesday. Traders expect no rate change. Futures data from CME Group showed a 97% chance the Fed keeps rates in the 3.5% to 3.75% range. The bigger story sits beyond this meeting. Jerome Powell finishes his term in May. Trump’s next pick for Fed chair has become the market’s real obsession. Polymarket odds showed Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s global CIO for fixed income, moving into the lead by Friday afternoon. Former Fed official Kevin Warsh stood at 33%. Trump’s top economic adviser Kevin Hassett trailed at 6%. Speaking in Davos, Trump said Rieder was “very impressive.” The economic data calendar stays busy. Monday brings the Chicago Fed national activity index, durable goods orders, and Dallas Fed manufacturing numbers. Tuesday includes ADP employment data, housing prices, Richmond Fed manufacturing, consumer confidence, and Dallas Fed services activity. Friday ends the week with producer price data, covering monthly and yearly figures for headline and core inflation. Corporate earnings flood markets as AI spending dominates This is one of the heaviest earnings weeks of the year. Reports hit every day. Monday includes Southern Copper, Nucor, Ryanair, Steel Dynamics, AGNC Investment, and Western Alliance. Tuesday ramps up with UnitedHealth, Boeing, RTX, UPS, General Motors, Texas Instruments, Union Pacific, and American Airlines. Wednesday brings the core event. Microsoft, Meta, and Tesla all report after the close. They are joined by ASML, IBM, ServiceNow, Starbucks, AT&T, GE Vernova, Danaher, Waste Management, and more. Thursday follows with Apple, Visa, Mastercard, Caterpillar, Honeywell, Lockheed Martin, Blackstone, Deutsche Bank, Royal Caribbean, and Valero Energy. For tech, the focus stays on spending. Meta CFO Susan Li said in October the company raised its 2026 spending outlook to $70 billion to $72 billion, up from an earlier $66 billion to $72 billion range. Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said the company plans to spend more in 2026 than the $88.2 billion used in 2025. Both companies report Wednesday night. Amazon and Alphabet are set for early February. Funding this push is reshaping credit markets. Apollo chief economist Torsten Sløk wrote that tech companies issued nearly $700 billion in investment-grade debt last quarter. That puts the sector close to the financial industry, which issued just over $800 billion and usually leads the market. Concerns remain. Bank of America strategists Haim Israel and Menka Bajaj said fewer investors now talk about an AI bubble, but risks still exist. They wrote, “AI is a fundamental revolution that is about to change everything, but we cannot ignore valuation debate and timing.” Public pressure is also rising. Jefferies strategists once again pointed to growing concern over data centers, energy costs, water use, job security, and electricity bills.

The prominent venture capital firm, instead, issued a critical warning for the entire industry to redirect its focus and resources toward solving the pressing, tangible security vulnerabilities plaguing major blockchain networks today. This call to action, delivered via a detailed post on the social platform X, emphasizes a stark reality: while quantum computing poses a theoretical long-term challenge, the ecosystem is currently besieged by more immediate and exploitable weaknesses in protocol design, governance, and implementation. a16z’s Stance on the Quantum Threat to Crypto Andreessen Horowitz, commonly known as a16z, stands as one of the most influential venture capital firms in the technology sector, with a dedicated crypto arm that has invested billions into foundational blockchain projects. Consequently, its public statements carry substantial weight within the industry. The firm’s analysis directly addresses the pervasive fear that quantum computers will imminently break the cryptographic foundations of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets. a16z bases its conclusion on current, verifiable technological forecasts from leading research institutions. Specifically, the firm notes that a quantum computer capable of executing Shor’s algorithm—the theoretical method for breaking widely-used encryption like RSA and ECC—with sufficient power to threaten blockchain security within a practical timeframe simply does not exist yet. Furthermore, building such a machine presents monumental engineering challenges. Experts in quantum computing consistently highlight the issues of qubit stability, error correction, and scalability. The timeline for a cryptographically-relevant quantum computer remains a subject of debate, with many estimates placing it a decade or more away. a16z’s argument, therefore, is not that the quantum threat is nonexistent, but that its immediacy is often catastrophically overstated. This misallocation of attention, the firm warns, creates a dangerous distraction. The industry risks focusing on a futuristic specter while ignoring the very real wolves at the door. The Real and Present Dangers Outlined by Experts Security researchers echo a16z’s concerns, pointing to a constant stream of incidents that validate the urgency. For instance, cross-chain bridge hacks, smart contract exploits, and wallet vulnerabilities have led to the loss of tens of billions of dollars in digital assets over the past few years. These are not theoretical threats; they are daily occurrences with devastating financial consequences for users. The complexity of modern blockchain ecosystems, involving multiple layers and interoperating protocols, exponentially increases the attack surface. A report from a major blockchain security firm in 2024 quantified that over 80% of major financial losses in crypto stemmed from code bugs and logic errors, not from fundamental cryptographic breaks. Pressing Vulnerabilities in Bitcoin and Ethereum a16z’s statement specifically highlights the daunting challenges facing the two largest public blockchains by market capitalization: Bitcoin and Ethereum. For Bitcoin, the primary concerns revolve around the immense difficulty of executing protocol upgrades. The network’s conservative design philosophy, while a strength for security and predictability, makes it notoriously slow to adapt. Implementing even widely-supported improvements, like those potentially needed for quantum resistance, requires near-unanimous consensus among a globally distributed set of stakeholders, including miners, node operators, and developers. This governance bottleneck is itself a critical vulnerability, as it can prevent timely responses to emerging threats. Ethereum, while more agile due to its proof-of-stake consensus and regular upgrade cycles, faces its own set of complex issues. Its vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) and layer-2 scaling solutions introduces immense complexity. Each new smart contract and protocol integration represents a potential point of failure. a16z pointed to several categories of immediate threats that demand priority: Smart Contract Bugs: Flaws in contract code that can be exploited to drain funds. Governance Attacks: Manipulation of decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) voting to seize control of protocols. Validator Centralization Risks: Concerns over the geographic and infrastructural concentration of proof-of-stake validators. Side-Channel Attacks: Techniques that extract secret information by measuring physical outputs like power consumption or timing in hardware wallets and nodes. Addressing these issues requires continuous auditing, formal verification of code, and robust security practices at every layer of the stack—a monumental but essential undertaking. The Long-Term Quantum Challenge and Preparedness To be clear, a16z does not advocate for complacency regarding quantum computing. The firm acknowledges it as a legitimate long-term challenge that the industry must eventually confront. Cryptographers are actively developing post-quantum cryptography (PQC)—new algorithms designed to be secure against both classical and quantum computer attacks. Standardization bodies like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are in the final stages of selecting PQC standards for general use. The transition for blockchains, however, will be uniquely complex. It won’t be as simple as swapping out a software library; it may require hard forks, changes to digital signature schemes, and careful management of existing, potentially vulnerable, digital assets. The process demands extensive research, testing, and community coordination, which takes years. Therefore, a16z’s position is one of strategic prioritization: foundational research into PQC for blockchains should continue in parallel, but it should not consume the disproportionate share of security resources and developer mindshare that it currently does. The most prudent path is to fortify the existing digital fortress against today’s known siege weapons, while a dedicated team of engineers and mathematicians works on designing the next-generation fortress for a future threat. Industry Impact and Strategic Shifts This perspective from a16z is likely to influence investment and development trends. Venture funding may increasingly flow toward startups focused on real-time security solutions—advanced monitoring, decentralized auditing networks, and insurance protocols—rather than those solely marketing quantum apocalypse products. For developers and project founders, the message is to conduct rigorous, recurring security audits and prioritize bug bounty programs. For users, the takeaway is to remain vigilant about the security practices of the platforms they use, as the most significant risks are not on the distant horizon but in the code they interact with today. Conclusion Andreessen Horowitz’s intervention serves as a crucial reality check for the cryptocurrency industry. While the dramatic narrative of a quantum computer breaking Bitcoin captures headlines, the far more insidious and immediate dangers lie in buggy code, complex governance, and operational security failures. The quantum threat to crypto, while a serious future consideration, is currently exaggerated relative to these present vulnerabilities. By heeding a16z’s warning and re-centering efforts on solving today’s security challenges, the ecosystem can build a more resilient and trustworthy foundation. This strengthened foundation will, in turn, be far better prepared to integrate post-quantum cryptographic solutions when they become genuinely necessary, ensuring the long-term survival and growth of decentralized digital assets. FAQs Q1: What exactly is the “quantum threat” to cryptocurrencies? A1: The quantum threat refers to the theoretical ability of future, powerful quantum computers to break the cryptographic algorithms (like elliptic-curve cryptography) that secure blockchain transactions and wallets. This could allow someone to forge signatures and steal funds. Q2: Is a16z saying quantum computing is not a threat at all? A2: No. a16z explicitly states it is a long-term challenge. Their argument is that a machine capable of this does not exist based on public forecasts, and the immediate, exploitable vulnerabilities in current systems are a far more pressing priority for developers and security teams. Q3: What are “side-channel attacks” mentioned by a16z? A3: Side-channel attacks are methods of hacking a system by measuring indirect, physical information leaked during its operation. Examples include analyzing power consumption, electromagnetic emissions, or even sound waves from a hardware wallet to deduce its private keys. Q4: How can Bitcoin and Ethereum become quantum-resistant? A4: They would need to undergo a coordinated protocol upgrade (a hard fork) to implement post-quantum cryptographic algorithms. This is a complex, high-stakes process requiring broad consensus, which is why research and planning must start well before quantum computers become a practical threat. Q5: What should a crypto investor or user focus on for security today? A5: Users should prioritize securing their private keys using reputable hardware wallets, enabling all available security features (like multi-signature) on exchanges and DeFi platforms, and being extremely cautious of smart contracts and platforms that have not undergone recent, professional security audits. The human and software layers are the current front lines of security.

Several analysts also commented on Japan’s goal, anticipating that regulators in the island country will approve crypto ETFs by 2028, thereby allowing major institutions to make substantial investments in digital asset products. Sources close to the situation said this move could dramatically reshape one of the most heavily regulated digital asset markets globally. Japan aims to solidify its position as a leader in the crypto industry Big financial firms such as Nomura and SBI Holdings are widely seen as strong candidates to launch Japan’s first crypto ETFs. This perspective illustrates that the nation is transitioning from cautious oversight to active adoption of digital assets, aiming to integrate them into its traditional financial system. Known for being curious yet cautious in the crypto space, sources noted that Japan was among the first nations to embrace Bitcoin as a legal form of payment. However, despite exploring this industry, the island country adopted strict regulations in response to previous challenges with exchange failures and market misuse. Regarding its recent goal, reports highlighted that the country’s move towards potential approval of crypto ETFs reflects a new, systemic approach to regulation. Moreover, these ETFs will encourage global investor participation through regulated products listed on cryptocurrency exchanges, without requiring direct ownership of the digital assets. This sudden decision prompted reporters to reach out to a market strategist based in Asia for further clarity on the country’s next move. Responding to this request, the market strategist who wished to remain anonymous due to the confidential nature of the situation mentioned that, “Japan is taking its time, but it’s clear where things are headed,” further adding that, “The main focus is on protecting investors and maintaining high standards for institutions.” Regarding its timeline, sources close to the situation revealed that Japan prefers steady, long-term adjustments rather than reckless deregulation. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that regulators are examining the approaches adopted by other major markets, particularly the United States and parts of Europe, in their successful launches of crypto ETFs. On the other hand, Japanese officials made clear their intention to embrace a long-term strategic outlook in attempts to en hance the rules governing custody, valuation methods, and disclosure requirements before granting retail and institutional investors access to these products. Following this news, analysts speculated that Japan’s move aims to avert serious threats while ensuring that crypto ETFs comply strictly with the country’s regulatory standards. Analysts acknowledge the heightened adoption of cryptocurrency among individuals Crypto firms Nomura and SBI Holdings are often perceived as potential leaders in the crypto industry, having gained substantial experience in both traditional finance and digital assets through their active participation in the ecosystem. Apart from this, Nomura has expanded its global footprint in digital assets, while SBI has established a strong crypto framework through blockchain investments, collaborations, and exchange services. Therefore, with their involvement in Japan’s crypto ETF market, sources stressed that this move could improve the market’s credibility and provide regulators with assurance that these products have strong backing from companies demonstrating high-level regulatory compliance. Notably, institutional interest is fueling discussions regarding ETFs in Japan. At this moment, pension funds, asset managers, and insurance firms are increasingly seeking compliant pathways to allocate their funds to the crypto industry; however, existing regulatory frameworks restrict their participation.

As attention shifts into 2026, analysts have noted that investors are beginning to rotate into early-stage tokens that are still unpriced for usage. One new crypto has gained 300% since early 2025 and remains under $1, prompting several traders to identify it as a top altcoin candidate for the Q1 2026 window. Mutuum Finance’s Dual Lending Structure The new altcoin drawing interest is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized lending and borrowing platform building two active markets. The first market operates on a pooled model where users supply assets to the protocol and receive mtTokens that track their position. Suppliers can earn APY as borrowers draw from the shared pool. The second market allows users to match directly. Borrowers still post collateral and follow loan-to-value rules. For example, a borrower can secure a position at a 50% or 65% LTV depending on asset type. If collateral value drops, the liquidation bot intervenes to protect pool liquidity. Analysts say this dual-market architecture allows Mutuum Finance to serve borrowers and suppliers with different needs and durations. Investor participation has reflected that roadmap. The project has raised $19.9M and onboarded 18,900 holders. Analysts say the footprint is important because it shows the project did not rely on a small number of allocations. Instead, thousands of participants entered before the protocol’s first deployment. Mutuum Finance’s V1 protocol release is set for Q1 2026 and will introduce collateral handling, liquidation logic and borrowing features in a controlled environment. Supply, Pricing and Appreciation Through Stages The current MUTM price is $0.04. The project is now in Phase 7 of its distribution. Mutuum Finance began at $0.01 in early 2025, marking a 300% appreciation for early participants. The total MUTM supply is 4B tokens. A total of 1.82B tokens or 45.5% are allocated for early access across structured phases. To date, 830M tokens have been sold. Phase structure has been a key part of how pricing has matured. Each phase increases MUTM’s price as allocation progresses. Phase 1 participants secured exposure at $0.01 and are positioned for a 500% appreciation at the official launch price of $0.06. The next phase will raise the price by nearly 20% from current levels, which analysts say is critical for early positioning because pricing compresses once major utility releases approach. Security Validation: Halborn, CertiK and the Bug Bounty Layer Security has been one of the strongest pillars of the Mutuum Finance roadmap. The team completed a full audit with Halborn Security, which reviewed core components such as collateral management, liquidation logic and debt accounting. Lending protocols depend on liquidation accuracy and price feeds, which is why independent review is seen as mandatory for this category of new crypto assets. Mutuum Finance also holds a 90 out of 100 token scan score from CertiK. The CertiK rating evaluates code, external risk factors and architectural dependencies. The presence of both reviews has been noted by analysts who specialize in DeFi research. Alongside these audits, Mutuum Finance introduced a $50,000 bug bounty, allowing external researchers to report vulnerabilities through a structured process. Analysts argue that this reduces protocol risk before Mainnet execution. Investor Behavior, Urgency and Q1 Positioning Participation data suggests that investors are responding to timing rather than just narrative. Phase 7 has already absorbed more than 6% of its allocation, and reports of whale allocations near $100K have appeared during single 24-hour periods. The project also runs a daily leaderboard that rewards the highest contributor with $500 in MUTM, which keeps participation active rather than clustered. Card payment support has removed a common barrier that slows down onboarding during presales. This allowed non-crypto users to enter without converting capital through external venues. Analysts say this helped widen the investor base ahead of V1. With V1 scheduled for Q1 2026 and the stablecoin and oracle components positioned for later activation, several analysts have begun placing MUTM in shortlists for best crypto to invest in for the next accumulation cycle. When comparing altcoins for Q1 2026, the combination of utility, pricing and security validation explains why investor preference has shifted toward MUTM over other early-stage assets still in their conceptual phase.

This strategic move, reported first by the Seoul Economic Daily on November 15, 2024, signals potential industry consolidation and comes amid evolving regulatory frameworks and increasing global competition. Chairman Cha Myung-hun, who controls 53.44% of the exchange through personal holdings and The One Group, has initiated discussions with both overseas exchanges and domestic financial institutions about potential equity investments. Understanding the Coinone Stake Sale Structure Financial industry sources reveal Chairman Cha Myung-hun’s precise ownership structure. Specifically, he holds a 19.14% personal stake in Coinone. Additionally, his company, The One Group, controls another 34.30%. Consequently, this combined 53.44% represents a controlling interest. The exploration focuses on selling a portion of these holdings rather than a complete exit. A Coinone official confirmed ongoing discussions but emphasized that specific details remain undetermined. This careful approach suggests a strategic partnership model rather than a simple ownership transfer. The South Korean cryptocurrency market operates within a unique regulatory environment. Exchanges must comply with strict real-name verification systems and banking partnerships. Furthermore, they face increasing pressure from both domestic regulators and international competitors. Coinone’s move follows similar industry trends where established exchanges seek capital infusion and strategic alliances. For instance, other Asian exchanges have recently pursued mergers or attracted institutional investment to enhance their competitive positions. Market Context and Competitive Landscape Coinone ranks as South Korea’s third-largest exchange by trading volume, consistently trailing behind industry leaders Upbit and Bithumb. According to recent market data, Upbit dominates with approximately 80% market share. Meanwhile, Bithumb holds around 15%, and Coinone maintains roughly 4%. This competitive dynamic creates pressure for smaller players to innovate or consolidate. The potential stake sale could provide Coinone with necessary resources to compete more effectively. The global cryptocurrency exchange landscape continues evolving rapidly. International giants like Binance and Coinbase have expanded their Asian presence significantly. Simultaneously, regional players face mounting compliance costs and technological demands. South Korea’s regulatory framework, while robust, requires continuous adaptation. Consequently, exchanges must balance innovation with strict security and reporting standards. Industry analysts note that strategic partnerships often help navigate these complex requirements. Expert Analysis on Exchange Consolidation Trends Financial technology experts point to several factors driving exchange consolidation. First, regulatory compliance costs have increased substantially across jurisdictions. Second, technological infrastructure demands continuous investment in security and scalability. Third, user expectations for sophisticated trading features and diverse asset offerings continue rising. Dr. Min-ji Park, a blockchain economics researcher at Seoul National University, explains, “The cryptocurrency exchange sector is maturing rapidly. We observe clear movement toward consolidation as platforms seek economies of scale and regulatory expertise.” Historical data supports this consolidation trend. Over the past three years, the number of operating cryptocurrency exchanges has decreased globally. Meanwhile, average trading volumes have concentrated among fewer, larger platforms. This pattern mirrors traditional financial market evolution. In South Korea specifically, regulatory changes following the 2021-2022 market adjustments prompted industry restructuring. Many smaller exchanges either merged or ceased operations entirely during this period. Potential Implications for Investors and Users Coinone’s potential stake sale carries several important implications. For existing users, the primary concerns involve service continuity and asset security. However, strategic partnerships typically enhance platform stability and feature development. For the broader market, this development signals continued industry maturation. Additionally, it may encourage similar moves among other mid-sized exchanges seeking competitive advantages. Key considerations for stakeholders include: Regulatory Compliance: Any new partnership must maintain or enhance existing compliance standards Service Integration: Potential technological synergies between Coinone and partners Market Competition: How the move might alter South Korea’s exchange hierarchy Global Connectivity: Possibility of improved international trading capabilities Innovation Potential: Resources for developing new products and services The timing of this exploration coincides with broader cryptocurrency market recovery. After the 2022 downturn, trading volumes and institutional interest have gradually returned. Moreover, regulatory clarity has improved in several jurisdictions. These conditions create favorable environment for strategic investments and partnerships. Industry observers will monitor whether other exchanges pursue similar paths in coming months. Historical Precedents and Industry Patterns Exchange stake sales and partnerships have occurred previously in global markets. For example, FTX’s international expansion involved multiple strategic investments before its collapse. Conversely, successful partnerships like Coinbase’s various institutional collaborations demonstrate potential benefits. In Asia specifically, Japanese exchange Liquid Group attracted investment from FTX in 2021. Similarly, Indonesian platforms have formed alliances with traditional financial institutions. South Korea’s exchange history includes notable consolidation events. After the 2017 cryptocurrency boom, several smaller exchanges merged to survive regulatory changes. The 2020-2021 period saw increased institutional investment in blockchain infrastructure. More recently, exchanges have focused on diversifying revenue streams beyond simple trading fees. Many now offer staking services, NFT marketplaces, and educational resources. This diversification requires substantial capital investment, explaining the appeal of strategic partnerships. Regulatory Considerations and Compliance Framework South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) and Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) maintain strict oversight of cryptocurrency exchanges. The specific reporting requirements include: Requirement Description Frequency Real-Name Verification Bank partnership for account verification Continuous Anti-Money Laundering Transaction monitoring and reporting Real-time Capital Requirements Minimum operational capital standards Annual review Security Audits Independent security assessments Semi-annual User Protection Insurance and compensation mechanisms Ongoing Any change in Coinone’s ownership structure must receive regulatory approval. The FSC typically reviews financial stability, security protocols, and compliance history during ownership transitions. This process ensures user protection and market integrity. Consequently, potential investors must demonstrate capability to maintain these standards. The regulatory review period often influences transaction timelines and structures. Conclusion The exploration of a Coinone stake sale represents a strategic development in South Korea’s cryptocurrency ecosystem. Chairman Cha Myung-hun’s potential partial divestment reflects broader industry trends toward consolidation and partnership. This move could enhance Coinone’s competitive position through capital infusion and strategic alliances. However, specific arrangements remain undetermined as discussions continue with domestic and international parties. The outcome will significantly influence South Korea’s exchange landscape and potentially signal similar movements across Asian markets. Stakeholders should monitor regulatory approvals and partnership details as they emerge in coming weeks. FAQs Q1: Why is Coinone’s majority shareholder considering a stake sale? Chairman Cha Myung-hun is exploring strategic partnerships to enhance Coinone’s competitive position. The move likely seeks capital for technological development and potential market expansion amid increasing industry consolidation. Q2: How will this affect current Coinone users? Existing users should experience minimal immediate disruption. Strategic partnerships typically aim to improve platform features and security. However, any significant changes would require regulatory approval and proper user communication. Q3: What percentage of Coinone is potentially for sale? The exact percentage remains undetermined. Chairman Cha controls 53.44% total, but discussions involve selling only a portion of these holdings rather than his complete stake. Q4: Who are the potential buyers or partners? Coinone has confirmed discussions with both overseas exchanges and domestic financial firms. Specific names haven’t been disclosed, as negotiations remain in preliminary stages. Q5: How long might this process take to complete? Stake sale negotiations typically require several months. Additionally, regulatory review in South Korea adds further timeline considerations. The process could extend into 2025 depending on complexity and approvals.

Stablecoin issuers generated an estimated $5 billion in revenue throughout 2025, a figure that underscores the sector’s maturation and critical role in the global digital economy. This remarkable earnings report stems primarily from the continued dominance of the Ethereum network, which solidified its position as the premier settlement layer for these pivotal digital assets. Stablecoin Revenue Reaches Unprecedented $5 Billion The $5 billion revenue figure represents a significant capital inflow for companies like Tether, Circle, and MakerDAO. Consequently, this capital fuels further development, regulatory compliance efforts, and ecosystem expansion. Analysts attribute this surge directly to the explosive growth in stablecoin supply. According to definitive data from the analytics platform Token Terminal, the total supply of stablecoins on the Ethereum network increased by a substantial $50 billion over the course of the year. This supply growth pushed the total value of Ethereum-based stablecoins above $180 billion by the fourth quarter of 2025. Therefore, the sheer scale of capital transacting on-chain created a corresponding revenue boom for issuers. Their quarterly revenue climbed steadily throughout the year, culminating in a record-breaking final quarter. Specifically, issuers captured approximately $1.4 billion in revenue during Q4 2025 alone. Ethereum Cements Its Role as the Primary Settlement Layer Ethereum’s infrastructure proved indispensable for this growth. The network’s security, extensive developer ecosystem, and robust DeFi (Decentralized Finance) landscape made it the default choice. Major issuers continued to leverage Ethereum for minting, redeeming, and transferring the vast majority of their tokens. Furthermore, the network’s successful transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism enhanced its appeal by reducing environmental concerns and improving transaction finality. The relationship between supply growth and issuer revenue is direct and mechanical. Issuers typically generate revenue through several key mechanisms: Interest on Reserves: Issuers hold collateral (like U.S. Treasury bills) backing their stablecoins. They earn interest on these high-quality assets. Transaction Fees: Some models incorporate small minting or redemption fees. Protocol Rewards: Decentralized issuers earn native token rewards from their underlying protocols. As the total stablecoin supply expands, the value of the underlying collateral grows proportionally. This expansion directly increases the interest income generated by the reserve assets. Expert Analysis: A Sign of Institutional Adoption Financial analysts interpret this data as a strong indicator of deepening institutional adoption. “The $5 billion revenue mark isn’t just a big number,” explains a market strategist from a leading crypto research firm. “It signals that stablecoins have moved beyond speculative trading into real-world utility like cross-border payments, corporate treasury management, and as a settlement rail for traditional finance. The revenue is a proxy for the immense value being settled on-chain every day.” This trend suggests stablecoins are becoming a fundamental piece of financial infrastructure rather than a niche crypto product. Breaking Down the Quarterly Revenue Surge The quarterly revenue progression tells a story of accelerating adoption. The jump to $1.4 billion in Q4 2025 did not occur in isolation. It resulted from compounding network effects and several macro-financial factors. For instance, periods of traditional market volatility often drive capital into stablecoins as a safe harbor within the crypto ecosystem. Additionally, the maturation of Ethereum’s Layer 2 scaling solutions reduced transaction costs, making stablecoin transactions more accessible for micro-payments and everyday use cases. The table below illustrates the estimated correlation between supply growth and quarterly revenue: Quarter 2025 ~Stablecoin Supply Growth ~Issuer Revenue Q1 $10 Billion $0.8 Billion Q2 $12 Billion $1.0 Billion Q3 $15 Billion $1.2 Billion Q4 $13 Billion $1.4 Billion Note that Q4 revenue reached its peak despite slightly lower supply growth than Q3. This indicates potentially higher yield rates on reserves or increased fee income, highlighting improving issuer business models. The Broader Impact on the Cryptocurrency Ecosystem This revenue generation has profound ripple effects across the entire blockchain industry. First, it provides stablecoin issuers with substantial war chests for security audits, legal teams, and lobbying efforts—all crucial for navigating an evolving global regulatory landscape. Second, the fees paid for Ethereum transactions contribute to the network’s security budget and validator rewards, strengthening the base layer. Finally, the abundant stablecoin liquidity is the lifeblood of DeFi. It enables lending, borrowing, and yield-generation activities that form a parallel financial system. Regulatory bodies worldwide are closely monitoring this growth. The $5 billion revenue figure will undoubtedly feature in discussions about appropriate oversight frameworks. Policymakers must balance fostering innovation with ensuring consumer protection and financial stability. The transparency of blockchain data, as provided by firms like Token Terminal, actually aids regulators in understanding the scale and flow of these digital dollars. Conclusion The landmark $5 billion in revenue earned by stablecoin issuers in 2025 marks a definitive chapter in the asset class’s history. It demonstrates a successful, revenue-generating business model built on top of blockchain technology, with the Ethereum network serving as its critical foundation. This financial achievement, powered by a $50 billion expansion in stablecoin supply, validates the sector’s economic importance. As stablecoins become further embedded in global finance, their role as a multi-billion-dollar revenue engine appears firmly established, signaling a new era of maturity for the entire cryptocurrency market. FAQs Q1: How do stablecoin issuers actually make money? A1: Issuers primarily earn revenue by investing the collateral (e.g., cash and government bonds) that backs their stablecoins. The interest and yield from these low-risk reserves constitute the majority of their income. Some may also charge small fees for minting or redeeming tokens. Q2: Why is Ethereum so important for stablecoins? A2: Ethereum offers unparalleled security, decentralization, and a massive ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi protocols. This makes it the most trusted and useful network for issuing and utilizing stablecoins at scale. Q3: Does this revenue mean stablecoins are completely safe? A3: Not necessarily. Revenue indicates a profitable business model, but safety depends on the issuer’s transparency and the quality/quantity of their reserves. Users must always research an issuer’s attestations and regulatory standing. Q4: What is the difference between revenue and profit for a stablecoin issuer? A4: Revenue is the total income generated (the $5 billion). Profit is what remains after subtracting all operational costs, such as staffing, technology, legal compliance, and security. A portion of this revenue is reinvested to ensure stability and growth. Q5: Could another blockchain challenge Ethereum’s dominance in stablecoins? A5: While other blockchains host stablecoins, Ethereum’s first-mover advantage, deep liquidity, and entrenched developer community create a powerful network effect.

The immediate consequence has been a significant slowdown in Bitcoin’s block production, with average times temporarily extending to 12 minutes, as reported by industry sources including Cointelegraph. This event starkly illustrates the complex interplay between decentralized digital networks and the very real-world constraints of energy grids and climate. Foundry USA Hashrate Plummets Amidst Power Grid Strain The data reveals a stark picture of disruption. Since last Friday, Foundry USA’s contribution to the global Bitcoin network has fallen precipitously. Analysts estimate that approximately 200 exahashes per second (EH/s) of computational power has gone offline from this pool alone. To contextualize this figure, 200 EH/s represents a substantial portion of the network’s total security. Consequently, the Bitcoin blockchain experienced a direct technical impact. With fewer miners competing to solve blocks, the average block time—normally targeted at 10 minutes—increased to around 12 minutes. This slowdown temporarily reduces the rate of transaction confirmations on the network. Importantly, this hashrate drop was not solely a result of forced outages. Many mining firms, including those contributing to Foundry USA, made a voluntary decision to power down their operations. This strategic move aimed to alleviate critical strain on regional power grids, which were struggling to supply over one million households amid widespread outages caused by Fern. This action underscores a growing trend in the industry: mining operations are increasingly acting as flexible, demand-response assets for energy networks. Hashrate Decline: Foundry USA’s share fell by approximately 60%. Power Offline: An estimated 200 EH/s of hash power was idled. Network Effect: Average Bitcoin block time extended to 12 minutes. Grid Relief: Miners voluntarily halted to support public infrastructure. The Anatomy of a Mining Disruption Winter Storm Fern acted as a stress test for Bitcoin’s geographically distributed mining ecosystem. The storm’s path across key mining states like Texas, which hosts a significant concentration of hashrate, directly translated into network-wide effects. Mining operations depend on two immutable physical factors: a constant, high-capacity electricity supply and effective cooling for their application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) machines. Extreme cold can paradoxically benefit mining efficiency by reducing cooling costs, but associated power instability and infrastructure damage pose a far greater risk. The event provides a clear case study in network resilience. While a centralized service would have experienced a complete outage, the Bitcoin network simply slowed down. Miners in other unaffected global regions continued to operate, and the protocol’s difficulty adjustment mechanism will eventually recalibrate to account for the lost hashrate, bringing block times back toward the 10-minute target. However, the short-term volatility in hashrate can lead to increased variance in block discovery and marginally higher transaction fees during the adjustment period. Expert Insight on Energy and Decentralization Industry analysts point to this event as a critical demonstration of Bitcoin mining’s evolving role in modern energy markets. “The voluntary curtailment by miners during Winter Storm Fern is a textbook example of demand response,” explains a veteran energy sector consultant familiar with Texas’s grid. “These large, flexible loads can be shut down almost instantly, providing crucial megawatts back to the grid during peak stress. In return, miners often receive financial incentives or priority status when power is restored.” This symbiotic relationship is becoming a key part of the economic model for miners in deregulated energy markets. Furthermore, the incident sparks discussion about the ideal geographical distribution of hashrate. Over-concentration in any single region, whether it’s Sichuan during the rainy season or Texas during winter, introduces a systemic point of failure. The network’s long-term health and security may benefit from a more evenly distributed global hashrate, making it inherently more resistant to regional climate events or regulatory shifts. Data from the past 72 hours will likely be studied by mining companies as they plan future site locations and grid interconnection strategies. Historical Context and Future Implications This is not the first time weather has impacted Bitcoin mining. Historical precedents include the major hashrate migration out of China in 2021, partly influenced by seasonal hydropower availability, and previous winter storms in North America that tested grid reliability. Each event has contributed to a more mature and strategically aware industry. Mining companies now routinely incorporate detailed climate risk assessments and grid interaction plans into their operational blueprints. The financial implications are twofold. For the miners themselves, curtailment means a direct, temporary loss of revenue from block rewards and fees. However, many have pre-arranged contracts that compensate them for providing grid stability services, potentially offsetting some losses. For the broader cryptocurrency market, such events rarely cause significant price movements on their own, but they serve as a reminder of the physical and energy-intensive underpinnings of proof-of-work networks. The resilience of the Bitcoin price during such infrastructure stresses is often cited by proponents as evidence of its robustness. Event Region Approx. Hashrate Impact Primary Cause Winter Storm Fern (2025) United States ~200 EH/s (From one pool) Power grid strain & voluntary shutdowns China Mining Ban (2021) Sichuan, etc. >50% of global network Regulatory policy shift Texas Winter Storm (2021) Texas, USA Significant regional drop Grid failure & forced blackouts Conclusion The 60% drop in Foundry USA’s hashrate during Winter Storm Fern serves as a powerful real-world lesson on the intersection of cryptocurrency, energy, and climate. It demonstrates both a vulnerability—the concentration of mining infrastructure in weather-vulnerable areas—and a strength, in the form of the network’s ability to absorb the shock and the industry’s growing role as a grid-stabilizing force. As Bitcoin mining continues to evolve, its integration with and response to global energy systems will remain a critical factor for its sustainability and decentralization. The Foundry USA hashrate plummet is a temporary event, but the insights it provides into the future of resilient digital infrastructure are lasting. FAQs Q1: What caused Foundry USA’s hashrate to drop 60%? The primary cause was Winter Storm Fern, which caused widespread power outages and grid instability across the United States. Mining operations voluntarily shut down to relieve pressure on the electricity grid, and some experienced direct power disruptions. Q2: How does a hashrate drop affect the Bitcoin network? A significant hashrate drop slows down block production, temporarily increasing the average time between blocks. This can lead to slower transaction confirmations. The network’s difficulty adjustment algorithm will correct for this over approximately two weeks, returning block times to normal. Q3: Do miners lose money when they shut down during a storm? They lose potential revenue from mining new blocks. However, many miners in regions like Texas have agreements with grid operators to be compensated as “demand response” assets, which can offset some of the lost income from shutting down to support grid stability. Q4: Is the Bitcoin network less secure when hashrate drops? In the very short term, a rapid hashrate decline slightly reduces the computational cost required to attack the network (the “51% attack” threshold). However, the global distribution of hashrate and the speed of the difficulty adjustment make sustained attacks impractical from such a brief, regional event. The network’s security model is designed for long-term resilience. Q5: Will this event make mining companies move to different locations? It reinforces an existing trend toward geographic diversification. Mining companies already factor in political stability, energy cost, and climate risks. Events like Winter Storm Fern highlight the importance of robust grid infrastructure and may influence future site selection to mitigate weather-related downtime.

This capital injection specifically targets the U.S. market expansion of its zero-commission ride-hailing subsidiary, TADA. Consequently, the company confirms plans to launch services in New York City by June 2025, marking a pivotal entry into one of the world’s most competitive urban transportation landscapes. MVL’s TADA Expansion Strategy and Market Context MVL (Mass Vehicle Ledger) operates an integrated blockchain ecosystem for mobility. Its core mission involves creating a transparent data economy connecting drivers, passengers, and service providers. The TADA application serves as the consumer-facing ride-hailing component of this ecosystem. Unlike conventional platforms, TADA historically operated on a zero-commission model for drivers in its primary Southeast Asian markets. This model leverages the native MVL token to facilitate rewards and transactions within its network. The pursuit of $100 million in investment capital represents a major scaling effort. This funding will primarily fuel operational costs, driver acquisition incentives, marketing campaigns, and regulatory compliance frameworks necessary for the complex U.S. transportation sector. Industry analysts note that successful market penetration requires substantial upfront capital, especially in cities like New York with established competitors and stringent regulations. The U.S. Mobility Landscape and TADA’s Value Proposition The United States ride-hailing market remains dominated by giants like Uber and Lyft. However, persistent driver dissatisfaction over commission structures and earnings transparency creates openings for alternative models. TADA’s proposed zero-commission model could disrupt this dynamic, potentially attracting drivers seeking higher take-home pay. Furthermore, the integration of blockchain promises enhanced data security and a verifiable record of transactions for all network participants. Experts from mobility research firms, such as Guidehouse Insights, highlight the increasing convergence of blockchain and transportation. They point to use cases in supply chain verification, fractional vehicle ownership, and dynamic, transparent pricing models. MVL’s attempt to scale its proven Asian model into the U.S. serves as a critical real-world test for blockchain’s utility in mainstream mobility services. Analyzing the New York City Launch Timeline The announced June 2025 launch in New York City presents both a massive opportunity and a formidable challenge. New York’s Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) enforces some of the nation’s strictest regulations for ride-hail services. These rules cover vehicle standards, driver licensing, insurance, and data sharing requirements. Therefore, MVL must navigate this regulatory maze efficiently to meet its public deadline. A successful New York launch could provide a powerful proof-of-concept for other major U.S. metropolitan areas. The city’s dense population, high transportation demand, and tech-savvy user base make it an ideal, albeit competitive, testing ground. The timeline suggests MVL has likely initiated preliminary regulatory discussions and begun establishing local corporate entities. Potential Impacts on Drivers and the Broader Ecosystem The expansion’s success hinges on a dual-sided market strategy: attracting both drivers and riders. For drivers, the primary appeal lies in the economic model. The following table contrasts key driver-facing metrics between a traditional model and TADA’s proposed model: Metric Traditional Ride-Hail (e.g., Uber/Lyft) TADA’s Blockchain Model Driver Commission Typically 20-30% of fare Historically 0% in SE Asia* Earnings Transparency Opaque surge/algorithmic pricing Immutable, on-chain transaction record Incentive Structure Cash bonuses, quests MVL token rewards, ecosystem benefits *U.S. model specifics pending official announcement. For the MVL ecosystem, expansion brings more users and transaction volume. This activity could increase utility and demand for the MVL token, provided the user experience remains seamless. The company must ensure its blockchain infrastructure scales to handle significantly higher transaction throughput without compromising speed or incurring high gas fees, a common challenge for blockchain applications. Fundraising Environment and Competitive Analysis Securing $100 million in the current investment climate is a notable ambition. Venture capital interest in blockchain and mobility tech remains selective, favoring projects with clear revenue pathways and regulatory foresight. MVL will likely pitch to a mix of traditional VC firms specializing in transportation and crypto-native funds interested in real-world asset tokenization. Competitors will not remain static. Incumbents may respond with pilot programs for lower commissions or enhanced driver benefits. Other blockchain mobility projects may accelerate their own roadmaps. TADA’s differentiators must be communicated clearly to both investors and end-users. Key challenges include: Regulatory Hurdles: Adapting a global blockchain model to state and city-specific U.S. laws. User Adoption: Convincing riders to switch from familiar apps for a blockchain-based service. Tokenomics Stability: Managing token volatility to ensure predictable earnings for drivers. Technical Scalability: Maintaining app performance and low transaction costs at scale. Long-Term Vision for Blockchain in Mobility MVL’s expansion is part of a broader industry trend. The long-term vision shared by many in the sector involves creating a decentralized, user-owned mobility network. In such a system, data ownership returns to the individual, and middlemen are reduced or eliminated. TADA’s U.S. foray provides a tangible case study on whether consumers and workers value these principles enough to change their behavior. Data from the International Transport Forum suggests that efficient, integrated mobility solutions are crucial for sustainable urban development. Blockchain’s ability to securely unify data from cars, public transit, and micro-mobility could eventually reduce congestion and optimize routes. MVL’s current focus on ride-hailing is a foundational step toward this more interconnected future. Conclusion MVL’s pursuit of a $100 million investment for TADA’s U.S. expansion marks a decisive moment for blockchain mobility. The planned June 2025 launch in New York City will serve as the ultimate stress test for its zero-commission, token-incentivized model in a mature and regulated market. Success depends on flawless execution across regulatory compliance, driver acquisition, user experience, and technological scalability. This ambitious move by MVL’s TADA could potentially reshape competitive dynamics in the ride-hailing industry and demonstrate the practical viability of blockchain for large-scale, everyday transportation services. FAQs Q1: What is MVL and how is it related to TADA? MVL (Mass Vehicle Ledger) is a blockchain-based ecosystem for the mobility industry. TADA is its ride-hailing service application, which operates as a subsidiary, utilizing the MVL blockchain to record transactions and manage incentives. Q2: Why is TADA seeking $100 million for U.S. expansion? The funds are required for market entry costs, including driver incentives, marketing, legal and regulatory compliance, technology infrastructure scaling, and operational expenses in competitive and expensive markets like New York City. Q3: How does TADA’s business model differ from Uber or Lyft? Historically, TADA has operated a zero-commission model for drivers in Southeast Asia, meaning drivers keep the entire fare. It also integrates a blockchain-based reward system using the MVL token, aiming for greater transparency in pricing and earnings. Q4: What are the main challenges TADA faces in launching in New York? Key challenges include obtaining licenses from New York’s Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), competing with established incumbents, attracting a critical mass of drivers and riders, and ensuring its blockchain technology meets U.S. performance and data privacy standards. Q5: Do riders need to use cryptocurrency to pay for TADA rides? Based on its operations in other regions, TADA typically allows riders to pay using traditional methods (credit/debit cards) while using the MVL token for backend incentives and rewards. The exact payment model for the U.S. will be confirmed upon launch.

This significant transaction, involving 50,000 Ether from an address inactive for nearly a decade, occurred approximately 12 hours ago, according to data from blockchain analytics firm AmberCN. The event immediately triggered widespread analysis regarding its potential implications for the Ethereum market, investor sentiment, and the behavior of early cryptocurrency adopters. Market observers now closely monitor whether this signals a major sell-off or a strategic portfolio reallocation by one of the network’s earliest and most patient investors. Ethereum Whale Transaction Details and Immediate Context The transaction originated from an address that received its initial Ether allocation over nine years ago, placing its owner among the earliest participants in the Ethereum network. Following this substantial transfer, the address retains a formidable balance of 85,000 ETH, currently valued at approximately $244 million. Consequently, the total holdings associated with this entity exceed $389 million. In cryptocurrency markets, transfers from private wallets to centralized exchanges like Gemini are commonly interpreted as preparatory steps for selling, as exchanges provide the necessary liquidity to convert digital assets into fiat currency or other cryptocurrencies. However, alternative explanations exist, including the use of exchange custody services or engagement with institutional lending products. Blockchain analysis provides a transparent ledger of this activity. The sheer size of the transfer required careful execution to manage network gas fees and potential market slippage. Furthermore, the timing coincides with a period of relative consolidation for Ethereum’s price, adding a layer of intrigue for technical analysts. This event serves as a powerful reminder of the substantial, often dormant, wealth held by early crypto pioneers and its potential to influence market dynamics when mobilized. Historical Significance of Dormant Whale Movements The awakening of a dormant whale after such an extended period is a rare and noteworthy event in blockchain history. Typically, these addresses belong to miners, early investors, or participants in Ethereum’s 2014 initial coin offering (ICO). Their prolonged inactivity often signifies a strong conviction or a lost private key. When activity resumes, it provides a unique case study in long-term cryptocurrency holding strategies. Historically, similar large-scale movements from dormant addresses have preceded periods of increased market volatility. For instance, notable awakenings have occurred during previous market cycles, sometimes aligning with local price tops or bottoms. Analysts compare transaction patterns, wallet age, and subsequent market behavior to gauge potential outcomes. The nine-year dormancy of this particular address suggests an investor with exceptional patience and risk tolerance, potentially viewing the asset through a generational wealth lens rather than short-term trading. This context is crucial for understanding the broader narrative beyond the immediate transaction data. Expert Analysis on Market Impact and Sentiment Market analysts and seasoned traders emphasize the psychological impact of such transactions. While a single deposit does not guarantee an immediate sell order, it increases the available supply on the exchange, which can exert downward pressure on price if executed. Experts from firms like AmberCN and other analytics platforms monitor exchange inflow metrics as a key sentiment indicator. A sudden spike in large inflows often correlates with a cautious or bearish short-term outlook from major holders. Conversely, some experts argue that the movement could be neutral or even bullish. The whale may be preparing to use the ETH as collateral for a decentralized finance (DeFi) loan on a platform integrated with Gemini, or simply consolidating assets for security reasons. Without on-chain data pointing to an immediate sale, speculation remains just that. Nevertheless, the event undeniably serves as a liquidity test for the market, revealing how easily such a large position can be moved without causing a major price disruption in real-time. Technical and On-Chain Data Breakdown A closer examination of the on-chain data reveals the technical precision of the transfer. The transaction was confirmed on the Ethereum mainnet, incurring a gas fee that, while substantial in absolute terms, was negligible relative to the transacted value. This efficiency demonstrates the current state of Ethereum’s network post-Merge and other scalability upgrades. The public nature of the blockchain allows anyone to verify the transaction hash, the wallet’s historical balance, and its interaction history. Key Wallet Metrics: Age: Active for over 9 years (since ~2015-2016). Initial Source: Likely from mining or early ICO participation. Post-Transfer Balance: 85,000 ETH (~$244M). Total Portfolio Value: ~$389M (combined moved and remaining ETH). Destination: Gemini exchange deposit address. This data is instrumental for building a profile of the holder. The decision to move only a portion of the holdings suggests a measured, non-panic-driven approach. It may indicate a structured exit plan or a specific financial need, rather than a wholesale abandonment of the position. Broader Implications for Ethereum and Crypto Markets The movement of $145 million in ETH is a liquidity event that tests market depth. For Ethereum, such events highlight the concentration of wealth among early adopters and the ongoing process of distribution as the asset class matures. A successful absorption of this potential selling pressure by the market would be viewed as a sign of growing maturity and depth. Alternatively, significant price weakness following confirmed sales could indicate sensitivity to large holder actions. This event also underscores the importance of transparency in decentralized systems. The entire market receives a near-instantaneous alert to the movement, allowing for a collective analysis that is impossible in traditional finance. This transparency, however, can lead to front-running or anticipatory selling by other traders, potentially amplifying the move’s impact. The role of analytics firms like AmberCN becomes critical in providing accurate, timely interpretation of raw blockchain data for the broader public. Conclusion The awakening of a nine-year-dormant Ethereum whale and its $145 million deposit to Gemini stands as a significant on-chain event, rich with narrative and analytical value. While the immediate interpretation leans toward potential selling pressure, the full story encompasses historical context, technical execution, and multiple strategic possibilities. This transaction serves as a potent reminder of the vast, patient capital embedded in early blockchain networks and its powerful influence when activated. The market’s response in the coming days will offer valuable insights into Ethereum’s current liquidity resilience and the evolving strategies of its largest stakeholders. Ultimately, the dormant Ethereum whale’s move is a fascinating chapter in the ongoing story of cryptocurrency market maturation. FAQs Q1: What does it mean when a “whale” deposits crypto to an exchange? Typically, it suggests the holder may be preparing to sell, trade, or use the assets within the exchange’s ecosystem (e.g., lending, staking). It increases the readily available supply on the market. Q2: Why is a nine-year dormancy period significant? It indicates the holder is likely an extremely early adopter (miner or ICO participant) with immense patience. Their re-entry into activity is rare and analyzed for signals about long-term holder sentiment. Q3: Could this transaction be something other than preparing to sell? Yes. Alternatives include moving to a custodial service, using the ETH as collateral for a loan, participating in an institutional product, or simply reorganizing wallets for security. The on-chain data alone does not confirm a sale. Q4: How does the market usually react to such large whale movements? Reactions vary. Often, there is short-term speculative pressure and increased volatility as traders anticipate potential selling. The actual price impact depends on whether and how the whale executes trades. Q5: What is the total value still held by this dormant address? After the 50,000 ETH transfer, the address retains 85,000 ETH. At current prices, this remaining balance is worth approximately $244 million.

The Entropy crypto shutdown represents another chapter in the volatile narrative of digital asset infrastructure companies. Founder and CEO Tux Pacific confirmed the decision on social media platform X, stating the business model ultimately proved unsustainable despite multiple strategic pivots. This closure follows two rounds of internal restructuring and will result in remaining capital being returned to stakeholders. The company launched its decentralized self-custody solution during the 2021 market surge and secured notable funding in 2022 from prominent backers including Coinbase Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). Entropy Crypto Shutdown: Timeline of Events The Entropy shutdown announcement arrived on March 15, 2025, according to industry publication Cointelegraph. CEO Tux Pacific delivered the news directly through his verified X account. Pacific explained the decision stemmed from fundamental business sustainability issues. Consequently, the company will cease all operations immediately. The leadership team determined this path after exhausting alternatives. Therefore, investors will receive proportional returns from remaining capital. Entropy’s journey began with considerable promise in 2021. The company entered the market during a period of explosive growth for decentralized finance. Initially, the startup focused on creating non-custodial wallet infrastructure. Specifically, their technology aimed to simplify self-custody for institutional clients. The 2022 funding round represented a major validation milestone. Notably, Coinbase Ventures and a16z participated alongside other investors. These firms typically support projects with strong technical foundations. Market Context and Competitive Landscape The self-custody solution market has grown increasingly competitive since 2021. Major players like Fireblocks and Copper dominate institutional segments. Meanwhile, retail-focused options like MetaMask and Phantom expanded aggressively. Entropy attempted to differentiate through proprietary security architecture. However, market consolidation created significant challenges. The table below illustrates key competitors in the self-custody space: Company Primary Focus Funding Status Year Founded Fireblocks Institutional custody Series E 2018 Copper Digital asset infrastructure Series B 2018 Entropy Decentralized self-custody Shutdown (2025) 2021 MetaMask Institutional Enterprise DeFi access ConsenSys backed 2020 Investor Implications and Capital Return Process The Entropy shutdown carries particular significance due to its investor roster. Coinbase Ventures and a16z represent two of cryptocurrency’s most influential venture firms. Their participation typically signals strong conviction in a project’s potential. However, even prestigious backing cannot guarantee success in this volatile sector. The decision to return remaining capital demonstrates responsible stewardship. This approach contrasts with some failed startups that exhaust funds completely. Venture capital firms maintain portfolios expecting some failures. Nevertheless, each shutdown provides valuable market data. Analysts will examine this case for broader patterns. The crypto infrastructure space has seen both spectacular successes and abrupt closures. Several factors likely contributed to Entropy’s challenges: Market timing: Launching during 2021’s peak created scaling pressure Regulatory uncertainty: Evolving compliance requirements increased costs Technical complexity: Building secure custody solutions requires extensive resources Customer acquisition: Institutional sales cycles often prove lengthy Funding environment: 2023-2024 saw reduced crypto venture investment Expert Perspectives on Infrastructure Startups Industry analysts note specific patterns in crypto infrastructure failures. First, many startups underestimate regulatory complexity. Second, security development requires continuous investment. Third, institutional adoption frequently progresses slower than anticipated. Fourth, bear markets strain runway calculations. Consequently, even well-funded companies face existential challenges. Blockchain consultant Maya Rodriguez observes, “The custody sector demands exceptional technical rigor and regulatory navigation. Startups must balance innovation with compliance, often with limited resources. Entropy’s experience reflects these industry-wide tensions.” Rodriguez has advised numerous digital asset firms on governance and risk management since 2017. The Self-Custody Technology Landscape Entropy developed a decentralized self-custody solution targeting specific market needs. Their approach utilized multi-party computation (MPC) technology. This method distributes key management across multiple parties. Therefore, no single entity controls complete access. The architecture aimed to prevent single points of failure. Additionally, the system incorporated threshold signatures for transaction authorization. MPC technology has gained substantial traction recently. Several established companies now employ similar approaches. However, implementation differences create competitive advantages. Entropy’s specific innovations included proprietary key generation protocols. The company also developed unique recovery mechanisms. These features targeted enterprise security requirements specifically. The broader self-custody market continues evolving rapidly. Recent developments include: Institutional demand growth for non-custodial solutions Regulatory clarity improvements in certain jurisdictions Technology standardization efforts across the industry Cross-chain compatibility becoming essential Insurance product integration with custody solutions Founder Statements and Industry Reactions Tux Pacific’s X statement provided direct insight into the shutdown reasoning. He emphasized the sustainability assessment after four years. Pacific acknowledged multiple pivits and restructuring attempts. Ultimately, the leadership team concluded operations should cease. The decision prioritizes investor capital preservation. Pacific expressed gratitude to employees and supporters. Industry reactions have been measured but notable. Competitors recognize the market’s competitive intensity. Investors analyze implications for similar portfolio companies. Employees face transition challenges in a tightening job market. Customers must migrate to alternative solutions promptly. The ecosystem absorbs these disruptions regularly. Historical Context of Crypto Startup Failures The Entropy shutdown follows numerous cryptocurrency startup closures. The 2022-2023 bear market eliminated many weaker projects. However, infrastructure companies typically possess greater resilience. Their failure often signals specific sector challenges. Historical analysis reveals several patterns worth noting. First, funding timing significantly impacts survival odds. Companies raising during market peaks frequently struggle later. Second, technological differentiation must translate to commercial adoption. Third, regulatory alignment proves crucial for custody businesses. Fourth, partnership networks can determine market access. Fifth, runway management becomes critical during downturns. The cryptocurrency industry has experienced multiple development cycles. Each cycle produces successful companies and failed experiments. Infrastructure plays a foundational role in ecosystem growth. Consequently, each shutdown provides learning opportunities. The sector gradually matures through these evolutionary processes. Employee and Community Impact Assessment Startup shutdowns create immediate human impacts. Employees face sudden career transitions. The Entropy team included engineers, security specialists, and business developers. These professionals now enter a competitive employment market. However, cryptocurrency expertise remains valuable industry-wide. The project’s community includes early adopters and technology advocates. These stakeholders must transition to alternative solutions. The shutdown announcement includes guidance for this process. Responsible wind-down procedures help maintain ecosystem trust. This approach benefits the broader industry reputation. Conclusion The Entropy crypto shutdown concludes a four-year effort to advance decentralized self-custody solutions. Despite backing from prominent investors like Coinbase Ventures and a16z, the company determined its business model unsustainable. This development highlights the ongoing challenges within cryptocurrency infrastructure sectors. Market competition, regulatory complexity, and funding environments create substantial hurdles. The decision to return remaining capital demonstrates responsible governance. Industry observers will analyze this case for broader insights. The self-custody market continues evolving with multiple established players. Entropy’s contributions to MPC technology and security architecture may influence future developments. Ultimately, the cryptocurrency ecosystem progresses through both successes and setbacks, with each providing valuable lessons for subsequent innovators. FAQs Q1: What exactly was Entropy’s business?

57469553,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=265261,1769397312,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crypto Liquidation Carnage: Long Positions Obliterated in $478M Market Shakeout,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/long-positions-crypto-liquidation-event/,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Liquidation Carnage: Long Positions Obliterated in $478M Market Shakeout A staggering $478 million wave of forced liquidations swept through cryptocurrency perpetual futures markets globally on March 21, 2025, ruthlessly targeting bullish traders. This significant crypto liquidation event revealed an extreme skew, with long positions accounting for the overwhelming majority of wiped-out trades. Consequently, the episode provides a stark case study in leveraged market risk and price volatility. Decoding the $478 Million Crypto Liquidation Event The 24-hour liquidation storm centered on three major assets: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). Data from major derivatives exchanges shows a clear and brutal pattern. Specifically, Bitcoin saw $196 million in total liquidations. Remarkably, long positions constituted 93.88% of that figure. Similarly, Ethereum experienced $219 million in liquidations, with longs making up 92.9%. Meanwhile, Solana’s $63.04 million in liquidations were almost entirely long-driven at 96.6%. These figures underscore a critical market dynamic. Perpetual futures contracts allow high leverage, often 10x, 25x, or more. When prices move against leveraged positions, exchanges automatically close them to prevent negative balances. This process, a forced liquidation, creates cascading sell pressure. Therefore, a cluster of long liquidations often accelerates a price decline. Mechanics of Perpetual Futures and Liquidations To understand this crypto liquidation event, one must grasp how perpetual futures work. Unlike traditional futures, they have no expiry date. Traders use them to speculate on price direction without owning the asset. A “long” position bets on price increases. Conversely, a “short” position profits from decreases. Each position requires an initial margin as collateral. The key mechanism is the “maintenance margin.” If a position’s losses erode the collateral below this level, it triggers a liquidation. Exchanges then sell the position into the market. Notably, this automated selling can trigger further liquidations nearby. Market analysts often refer to this as a “liquidation cascade.” The event on March 21 displayed classic signs of such a cascade, primarily affecting over-leveraged bulls. Liquidation Price: The specific price point where a position is automatically closed. Funding Rate: A periodic payment between long and short traders to tether the contract price to the spot price. High positive rates can indicate excessive long leverage. Liquidation Cascade: A chain reaction where one forced sale triggers others at similar price levels. Context and Catalysts: What Preceded the Sell-Off? Several factors likely converged to create the conditions for this sharp move. In the days prior, Bitcoin had tested key resistance levels near $72,000 without breaking through. This failure created technical selling pressure. Simultaneously, broader macroeconomic uncertainty resurfaced regarding interest rate expectations. Additionally, on-chain data indicated a buildup of leveraged long positions, making the market vulnerable. The initial price drop likely breached a dense cluster of long liquidation thresholds. Subsequently, the automated selling from these liquidations pushed prices lower. This action then triggered the next wave of liquidations. Market data shows the most intense selling occurred within a two-hour window, highlighting the speed of these events. Historical analysis from 2021 and 2022 shows similar patterns during major corrections. Comparative Analysis of Asset Impacts The disproportionate impact on different assets offers further insight. Solana’s extreme 96.6% long liquidation ratio suggests its derivatives market was exceptionally one-sided. Ethereum’s large absolute figure of $219 million reflects its deep liquidity and high open interest. Bitcoin, as the market leader, often sets the tone, with its liquidations preceding or accompanying moves in altcoins. The table below summarizes the core data from the event: Asset Total Liquidations Long Liquidations Long Percentage Bitcoin (BTC) $196 Million $184 Million 93.88% Ethereum (ETH) $219 Million $203.5 Million 92.9% Solana (SOL) $63.04 Million $60.9 Million 96.6% Total (Estimated) $478 Million $448.4 Million ~93.8% Broader Market Implications and Trader Psychology Events of this scale have tangible effects beyond immediate price action. Firstly, they forcibly de-leverage the market, removing risky positions. This can sometimes create a healthier foundation for a price rebound. However, they also destroy trader capital and can dampen sentiment in the short term. For many retail participants, a forced liquidation event is a harsh lesson in risk management. Secondly, such data is closely watched by institutional analysts. The skew toward long liquidations often signals that a localized capitulation has occurred. Market makers and algorithmic traders adjust their strategies based on this cleared leverage. Furthermore, the volatility can lead to widened bid-ask spreads and increased trading costs temporarily. Risk Management Lessons from a Major Liquidation The primary takeaway for traders is the non-negotiable importance of risk parameters. Using stop-loss orders outside of crowded liquidation zones is a basic defense. Additionally, employing lower leverage reduces the probability of a margin call. Diversifying across spot holdings and derivatives can also mitigate single-point failure. Seasoned traders often analyze liquidation heatmaps to identify potential danger zones for price. Exchanges themselves face operational tests during these periods. They must ensure their systems handle the volume of orders smoothly. Any platform downtime during high volatility can lead to user disputes. Consequently, the reliability of an exchange’s infrastructure becomes paramount during a widespread crypto liquidation event. Conclusion The March 2025 crypto liquidation event, totaling $478 million, serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent risks in leveraged derivatives trading. The extreme dominance of long position liquidations across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana illustrates how quickly sentiment can shift and how automated systems amplify moves. While such events reset leverage and can create trading opportunities, they primarily underscore the critical need for disciplined risk management. Understanding the mechanics of perpetual futures and liquidation cascades remains essential for any participant in the digital asset markets. FAQs Q1: What causes a long position to be liquidated? A long position gets liquidated when the market price falls to a level where the trader’s remaining collateral (margin) no longer covers the potential loss. The exchange automatically closes the position to prevent a negative account balance. Q2: Why did Solana have the highest percentage of long liquidations? Solana’s derivatives market likely had a higher concentration of leveraged long positions relative to shorts. This imbalance made it particularly vulnerable when prices turned downward, leading to a near-total wipeout of long bets. Q3: Can liquidation events predict market bottoms? While not a perfect indicator, a large-scale liquidation event that flushes out excessive leverage can sometimes mark a short-term capitulation point. However, it does not guarantee an immediate reversal and should not be used in isolation for trading decisions. Q4: What is the difference between a liquidation and a stop-loss? A stop-loss is a voluntary order set by a trader to sell at a specific price. A liquidation is an involuntary, forced closure executed by the exchange when a trader’s margin is depleted. Liquidations often occur in rapid, volatile conditions. Q5: How can traders protect themselves from liquidation? Traders can use lower leverage, maintain ample margin above requirements, set stop-loss orders, avoid over-concentrating positions, and stay informed about market conditions and potential volatility catalysts.

The venture capital arm of the global LBank exchange, in collaboration with leading data platforms CoinGecko and CoinGape, released the document on March 15, 2025, from its Singapore headquarters. This 2026 crypto market outlook arrives at a crucial inflection point, as the industry seeks direction following recent regulatory developments and technological breakthroughs. Decoding the 2026 Crypto Market Outlook: A Macro Perspective The comprehensive report immediately establishes its foundation by analyzing the interconnected forces of macroeconomics and regulation. Consequently, it identifies these elements as the primary drivers for the next market cycle. The analysis suggests that central bank monetary policies, particularly regarding interest rates and quantitative tightening, will continue to exert substantial influence on crypto asset valuations. Simultaneously, the evolving regulatory frameworks in major jurisdictions like the United States, the European Union under MiCA, and parts of Asia are creating a more defined, albeit complex, operating environment. This regulatory evolution, the report argues, is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it introduces compliance costs and operational hurdles. On the other hand, it provides the legal clarity necessary for large-scale institutional adoption. The document cites the gradual approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the ongoing classification debates around various digital assets as precedent-setting events that will shape capital flows into 2026. The tone remains strictly factual, avoiding speculation on specific regulatory outcomes while underscoring their undeniable impact. The Seven Pillars of Future Growth LBank Labs distills its research into seven core investment themes, presented not as predictions but as observable trends with growing traction. The analysis provides clear definitions and real-world context for each theme, enhancing the report’s E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) by grounding abstract concepts in current developments. Macroeconomic & Regulatory Evolution: The ongoing interplay between global liquidity conditions and legal frameworks. Real-World Assets (RWA) & DeFi Convergence: The tokenization of physical assets like treasury bonds, real estate, and commodities on blockchain networks. The Rise of Stablecoins & PayFi: The expansion of stable digital currencies beyond trading into everyday payments and financial services. Prediction Markets for Corporate Hedging: The use of decentralized forecasting platforms for risk management. The AI Agent Economy: Autonomous software agents executing economic transactions and managing digital assets. Decentralized Physical AI (DePAI): AI systems controlling physical infrastructure via decentralized networks. The Machine-Native Economy: An economic system where machines are primary participants, transacting with each other. Spotlight on Stablecoins and Strategic Partnerships The report dedicates substantial analysis to the stablecoin sector, identifying it as a critical bridge to traditional finance. It uses the strategic partnership between LBank and World Liberty Financial (WLFI) as a concrete case study. This collaboration led to the launch of the USD1 stablecoin, which features a novel point-based reward structure designed to incentivize usage and loyalty. The report explains this model not as a speculative tool but as a mechanism to enhance user engagement and ecosystem growth. Furthermore, the analysis places this development within the broader “PayFi” trend—the merger of payment systems and decentralized finance. It references the growing transaction volumes on networks like Solana and the expansion of stablecoin use in cross-border remittances and merchant payments as evidence of this trend’s momentum. The language remains neutral, simply presenting the data and the strategic rationale behind such partnerships. From AI Agents to a Machine-Led Economy Perhaps the most forward-looking sections of the 2026 crypto market outlook deal with artificial intelligence. The report provides a clear distinction between the AI Agent Economy and Decentralized Physical AI (DePAI). It describes AI agents as autonomous programs that can perform tasks like portfolio rebalancing, yield farming, and market analysis. In contrast, it frames DePAI as a more integrated concept where AI manages physical assets—like energy grids or logistics networks—through smart contracts and decentralized oracle data. Concept Primary Function Example Use Case AI Agent Economy Digital asset management & automated trading An agent that swaps tokens to maximize yield across DeFi protocols Decentralized Physical AI (DePAI) Control of physical infrastructure via blockchain An AI that auctions off surplus solar energy from a neighborhood grid Machine-Native Economy Machine-to-machine (M2M) transactions A self-driving taxi paying for its own charging and maintenance The report logically connects these themes, suggesting that AI agents will first mature in purely digital environments before their principles are applied to physical systems through DePAI, ultimately contributing to a machine-native economy. This progression is presented as a natural technological evolution, supported by the increasing sophistication of smart contracts and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Academic Rigor and Institutional Backing LBank Labs reinforces the credibility of its 2026 crypto market outlook by highlighting its ongoing research collaborations with premier academic institutions, including the University of California, Berkeley and Stanford University. These partnerships focus on fundamental blockchain scalability, cryptographic security, and economic modeling. The report implies that insights from this academic work directly inform its thematic analysis, providing a layer of peer-reviewed rigor to its market observations. The venture firm states its continued commitment to supporting the global crypto ecosystem through strategic investments that align with these seven identified themes, positioning itself as a participant-observer in the trends it describes. Conclusion The LBank Labs 2026 crypto market outlook report provides a structured, evidence-based framework for understanding the next phase of digital asset evolution. By moving beyond price speculation to analyze foundational themes like RWA tokenization, stablecoin utility, and AI integration, the document serves as a valuable resource for investors, developers, and policymakers. The identified convergence of decentralized technology with traditional finance and physical infrastructure suggests a future where blockchain’s impact extends far beyond speculative markets into the core mechanisms of the global economy. This comprehensive outlook ultimately underscores a period of maturation and integration for the cryptocurrency industry as it approaches 2026. FAQs Q1: What is the main purpose of the LBank Labs 2026 crypto market outlook report? The report aims to identify and analyze the key structural themes and investment trends expected to drive the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry in the coming years, providing a research-backed framework rather than short-term price predictions. Q2: How does the report define the convergence of Real-World Assets (RWA) and DeFi? It describes the process of tokenizing traditional physical or financial assets—like bonds, real estate, or commodities—on a blockchain, thereby making them tradable and usable within decentralized finance protocols for lending, borrowing, or earning yield. Q3: What is the difference between the AI Agent Economy and Decentralized Physical AI (DePAI)? The AI Agent Economy involves autonomous software programs operating within digital ecosystems to manage crypto assets. DePAI extends this concept to artificial intelligence that controls and optimizes physical-world infrastructure and assets through decentralized networks and smart contracts. Q4: Why does the report highlight the LBank and WLFI partnership regarding USD1? It uses this partnership as a real-world case study to illustrate the “PayFi” trend, showing how stablecoins are evolving with new features like reward structures to drive adoption beyond mere trading into broader payment and financial service applications. Q5: What is the significance of LBank Labs’ collaborations with universities like UC Berkeley? These collaborations lend academic rigor and research credibility to the report’s analysis, ensuring its thematic insights are informed by ongoing scientific and technical exploration into blockchain’s foundational challenges and possibilities.

Bitcoin dropped to $87,380, while Ethereum, Dogecoin, Solana, and XRP fell by over 3% in the last 24 hours. Crypto crash continues as liquidations jumped One key reason behind the ongoing crypto market crash is that liquidations continued rising. Data compiled by CoinGlass shows that liquidations soared by 770% in the last 24 hours to $678 million. Ethereum liquidations jumped to over $218 million, while Bitcoin liquidations jumped to $195 million. Solana liquidations jumped to $63 million. The other top liquidated tokens were XRP, Zcash, and Dogecoin. Crypto liquidations | Source: CoinGlass Liquidations happen when crypto exchanges close leveraged trades when their losses jump and reach the margin level. They close these trades to protect the capital they lend to the traders. The ongoing liquidations surge coincided with the decline in the futures open interest. Data shows the open interest dropped by 2.15% on Monday to $128 million, down from the October high of over $255 billion. Open interest refers to the outstanding options contracts in the crypto industry. A higher figure is a sign of higher demand for cryptocurrencies. Geopolitical jitters are rising The crypto crash is happening amid the ongoing geopolitical jitters in the United States and other countries. First, there are signs that the United States will attack Iran this year now that Donald Trump has sent an armada of warships in the region. Such a move would lead to higher oil prices and the biggest geopolitical crisis in the Middle East. Data compiled by Polymarket shows that the odds of an attack by June have jumped to 65%. At the same time, Donald Trump has threatened Canada with huge tariffs because of its recent deal with China. The deal will see China export up to 49,000 vehicles to Canada a year and pay a 6% tariff, down sharply from 100%. This move will benefit top Chinese companies like BYD and Nio. US government shutdown odds are rising The crypto market crash is also happening because of the ongoing jitters on the US government funding. Polymarket data shows that the odds of a government shutdown jumped to over 70%. These odds rose as protests continued in the past few days after a Border Patrol Agent shot and killed an American. A government shutdown would affect the ongoing economic recovery and lead to more volatility in the market. The shutdown jitters are rising ahead of the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision. Economists expect the bank to leave interest rates unchanged between 3.50% and 3.0%. Bitcoin price technicals The ongoing crypto market crash is also happening because of Bitcoin’s weak technicals. The daily timeframe chart shows that Bitcoin has remained below all moving averages and the Supertrend indicator. That is a sign that bears have remained under pressure. Bitcoin has also formed a bearish flag pattern, which happens after a major dip, which is then followed by a consolidation.

The price is now consolidating and might decline further if it remains below $1.920. XRP price started a fresh decline below the $1.90 zone. The price is now trading below $1.90 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1.885 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it stays below $1.90. XRP Price Dips Further XRP price failed to stay above $1.950 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price declined below $1.920 and $1.90 to enter a short-term bearish zone. The price even spiked below $1.850. A low was formed at $1.810, and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a recovery wave above $1.850. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.963 swing high to the $1.810 low, but the bears remained active. The price is now trading below $1.90 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $1.8850 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.963 swing high to the $1.810 low. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1.885 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $1.90 level. A close above $1.90 could send the price to $1.950. The next hurdle sits at $2.00. A clear move above the $2.00 resistance might send the price toward the $2.050 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.120 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.20. Downside Break? If XRP fails to clear the $1.90 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1.840 level. The next major support is near the $1.820 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $1.820 level, the price might continue to decline toward $1.780. The next major support sits near the $1.750 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $1.70.

According to a report by BeInCrypto citing CryptoRank data, structural market shifts are creating significant barriers to the kind of broad-based, exponential growth seen in previous cycles. This analysis, published in early 2025, points to capital dilution, valuation pressures, and changing investor behavior as core challenges. Understanding the Unlikely Altcoin Bull Run in 2026 The cryptocurrency market has historically moved in multi-year cycles, often characterized by a period of accumulation, a parabolic Bitcoin rally, and finally, a massive surge in alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins. Many investors anticipate this pattern will repeat. However, current market mechanics differ profoundly from those of 2017 or 2021. Consequently, a simple historical replay appears increasingly improbable. The core issue is a fundamental change in how capital enters and circulates within the digital asset ecosystem. The Problem of Capital Dilution One primary headwind is the sheer volume of new tokens entering the market. Data shows an exponential increase in new project launches across various blockchains. This creates intense capital dilution. Essentially, a finite pool of investment capital must now spread across thousands more assets. Therefore, achieving the concentrated price pumps that defined past altcoin seasons becomes mathematically more difficult. Each new token launch competes for attention and liquidity. Token Proliferation: The number of tracked cryptocurrencies has grown from a few thousand to over ten thousand in half a decade. Liquidity Fragmentation: Trading volume and liquidity are spread thin across countless decentralized and centralized exchanges. Investor Overwhelm: The cognitive load of researching credible projects amidst the noise has increased dramatically. FDV Pressure and Institutional Concentration Another critical factor is the market structure created by Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV). Many recent projects launch with a low circulating supply but a very high FDV, meaning most tokens are locked and scheduled for future release. This creates persistent, predictable selling pressure as these tokens unlock and enter the market. Early investors and project teams often sell a portion of their allocations upon vesting, consistently suppressing prices. Market Capitalization Comparison (Illustrative) Asset Type Typical Circulating Supply Typical FDV/ Market Cap Ratio Primary Investor Base Major Assets (BTC, ETH) High (>80%) ~1:1 Institutional, Long-term Newer Layer-1/Layer-2 Tokens Low (10-30%) 3:1 to 10:1 Venture Capital, Speculative Small/Mid-Cap Altcoins Varies Widely Often High Retail, Community-Driven Simultaneously, institutional capital flowing into the crypto space exhibits a strong preference for liquidity and perceived safety. As a result, funds concentrate heavily in major assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Ripple (XRP). This trend entrenches a top-heavy market structure. Consequently, capital does not trickle down efficiently to smaller projects. The Rise of Alternatives: Memecoins and Derivatives The analysis further identifies a diversion of speculative capital. Retail and speculative traders, who traditionally fueled altcoin rallies, are now chasing high-risk, high-reward opportunities elsewhere. Firstly, the memecoin phenomenon continues to attract significant volume and social attention. These assets often operate on pure sentiment and community hype, bypassing fundamental analysis. Secondly, perpetual futures markets have matured enormously. Traders can now gain leveraged exposure to Bitcoin and major altcoins without owning the underlying asset. This allows for sophisticated, capital-efficient speculation that keeps funds within derivative ecosystems rather than flowing into spot purchases of smaller altcoins. The growth of these alternatives fragments speculative interest further. Historical Context and Cycle Analysis Examining past cycles provides crucial context. The 2016-2017 bull run followed the ICO boom, a novel fundraising mechanism that directly funneled capital into a then-smaller universe of new tokens. The 2020-2021 cycle was driven by DeFi summer, NFT mania, and the rise of alternative Layer-1 blockchains. Each cycle had a clear, unifying narrative that directed capital flows. Currently, the market seeks a new, equally compelling narrative to drive widespread altcoin adoption beyond niche sectors. Expert Perspectives on Market Maturation Market analysts note this evolution signals maturation, not stagnation. The days of easy, across-the-board 100x returns may be fading. Instead, growth will likely become more selective and fundamentals-driven. Projects with genuine utility, sustainable tokenomics, and clear revenue models may still outperform, even in a tougher macro environment for altcoins. This shift rewards deep research over momentum chasing. Furthermore, regulatory developments will play a pivotal role. Clearer regulations could either unlock institutional investment into a broader range of assets or further entrench the dominance of the largest, most compliant cryptocurrencies. The direction of this regulatory clarity remains a key unknown for the 2026 outlook. Conclusion In conclusion, a major altcoin bull run in 2026 faces significant structural headwinds, according to current data analysis. Capital dilution from token proliferation, persistent FDV selling pressure, and the concentration of institutional funds in major assets create a challenging environment. While select projects may thrive, the conditions for a broad-based, market-wide altcoin explosion appear less favorable than in previous cycles. Investors should therefore prioritize rigorous due diligence and manage expectations, understanding that the market’s dynamics continue to evolve rapidly. FAQs Q1: What is the main reason a major altcoin bull run is considered unlikely in 2026? The primary reason is capital dilution from thousands of new tokens combined with persistent selling pressure from projects with high Fully Diluted Valuations (FDV), which prevents concentrated capital flow into small and mid-cap altcoins. Q2: What is FDV, and why does it create selling pressure? FDV (Fully Diluted Valuation) is a project’s market capitalization if all its tokens were in circulation. Many projects launch with most tokens locked. As these tokens unlock over months or years, early investors and teams often sell, creating constant downward pressure on the price. Q3: Where is speculative capital going instead of altcoins? Speculative capital is increasingly diverted to memecoins, which trade on social sentiment, and perpetual futures markets, where traders use leverage to bet on price movements without buying the actual assets. Q4: Does this mean no altcoins will perform well in 2026? Not necessarily. The analysis suggests a broad, market-wide bull run is unlikely. However, fundamentally strong projects with real utility and sustainable models may still see significant growth, indicating a shift towards more selective, performance-based investing. Q5: How does institutional investment affect the altcoin market? Institutional investors typically prioritize liquidity and lower risk. They concentrate their capital in large, established assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This concentration at the top of the market can limit the amount of capital available to flow down into smaller altcoins.

Prices surged 64% in 2025, and they have gained more than 17% this year, supported by safe-haven demand, expectations of easier US monetary policy, central bank buying and ETF inflows. President Donald Trump’s trade threats stayed in focus. He abruptly stepped back on Wednesday from threats to impose tariffs on European allies as leverage to seize Greenland, and he said over the weekend he would impose a 100% tariff on Canada if it followed through on a trade deal with China. He has also threatened to hit French wines and champagnes with 200% tariffs in an apparent effort to pressure French President Emmanuel Macron into joining his “Board of Peace” initiative. Some observers fear the board could undermine the United Nations’ role as the main global platform for conflict resolution, though Trump has said it will work with the UN. US Futures Ease After Volatile Week Marked By Trade Risks Currency markets also turned volatile. The yen jumped to more than a two-month high on speculation that coordinated intervention by US and Japanese authorities could be imminent, and Tokyo’s top currency diplomat left that prospect open while keeping markets guessing. The yen rose as much as 1.2% to 153.89 per dollar, its strongest since November. The euro hit a four-month high of $1.1898 and was last up 0.4% at $1.18665, as traders trimmed dollar positions ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting and watched for a possible announcement by the Trump administration of a new Fed chairman. Wall Street faces another busy week after a rocky stretch. US stock index futures fell modestly on Sunday evening as markets braced for the Fed decision on Wednesday and a wave of corporate earnings, after last week’s pullback tied to geopolitical strains and trade uncertainty.

This downturn highlights the cryptocurrency’s growing sensitivity to traditional macroeconomic and political pressures, marking a pivotal moment for digital asset investors. Bitcoin Price Reacts to Political Turmoil The recent Bitcoin price movement directly correlates with escalating tensions in Washington D.C. According to market analysts, the digital asset’s decline stems from broader risk aversion rather than cryptocurrency-specific issues. Rick Maeda of Presto Research emphasized this connection, stating that political uncertainty now drives market sentiment more than technological developments. Market data reveals several key patterns during this period: Correlation spikes between Bitcoin and traditional risk assets Increased volatility during congressional negotiation periods Liquidity shifts from speculative assets to safe havens Bitcoin Performance During Political Crises Event Date BTC Price Change Recovery Time Debt Ceiling 2023 May 2023 -8.2% 11 days Budget Impasse 2024 September 2024 -5.7% 7 days Current Shutdown Threat October 2025 -4.3% (to date) Ongoing Understanding the Government Shutdown Mechanism The United States faces a potential government shutdown when Congress fails to pass appropriations legislation. This political deadlock triggers the furlough of non-essential federal employees and suspends various government services. Consequently, financial markets typically react negatively to this uncertainty. Historical data shows that during previous shutdowns, risk assets generally underperformed. For instance, the 2018-2019 shutdown coincided with a 15% decline in the S&P 500. Currently, prediction markets like Polymarket indicate a 75% probability of shutdown occurrence, according to Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research. Expert Analysis of Market Reactions Financial experts observe distinct patterns in cryptocurrency behavior during political crises. Initially, Bitcoin often moves independently from traditional markets. However, as crises intensify, correlation coefficients increase significantly. This pattern suggests that during severe political uncertainty, investors treat Bitcoin similarly to other risk assets. Market analysts identify three primary transmission channels for political risk: Liquidity effects from institutional portfolio rebalancing Sentiment shifts among retail investors Regulatory uncertainty affecting long-term positioning Cryptocurrency Market Dynamics Under Pressure The broader cryptocurrency market shows similar stress patterns to Bitcoin. Altcoins typically experience amplified volatility during political crises, with many declining 2-3 times more than Bitcoin’s percentage drop. This phenomenon occurs because investors perceive Bitcoin as a relative safe haven within the crypto ecosystem. Market structure analysis reveals important insights. Exchange data indicates increased selling pressure during Washington negotiation periods. Meanwhile, derivatives markets show rising put option volumes, suggesting investors hedge against further declines. These market mechanics demonstrate how political events now significantly influence cryptocurrency trading strategies. Historical Context and Comparative Analysis Comparing current events to historical precedents provides valuable perspective. The 2013 government shutdown occurred before Bitcoin’s mainstream adoption, limiting direct comparison. However, the 2018-2019 shutdown offers more relevant data, showing Bitcoin declining approximately 12% during the 35-day period. Several factors differentiate the current situation: Increased institutional participation in cryptocurrency markets Higher correlation with traditional financial indicators Greater regulatory scrutiny of digital assets Enhanced market surveillance and reporting requirements Global Market Implications and Spillover Effects U.S. political instability affects global cryptocurrency markets through multiple channels. International investors often reduce exposure to dollar-denominated assets during American political crises. Additionally, cryptocurrency mining operations face uncertainty regarding energy policies and regulatory frameworks. Asian and European markets show varied responses to U.S. political developments. Typically, Asian trading sessions exhibit more volatility during U.S. political crises, while European markets demonstrate greater stability. This geographical variation creates arbitrage opportunities but also increases systemic risk across global cryptocurrency exchanges. Conclusion The Bitcoin price decline amid U.S. government shutdown fears demonstrates cryptocurrency’s maturation as a financial asset class. Political uncertainty now significantly influences market movements, reflecting Bitcoin’s integration into global financial systems. As markets continue evolving, understanding these macroeconomic relationships becomes increasingly crucial for investors navigating volatile conditions. FAQs Q1: How does a US government shutdown specifically affect Bitcoin? Government shutdowns create macroeconomic uncertainty that typically reduces investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. The mechanism involves portfolio rebalancing, liquidity concerns, and broader financial market contagion effects. Q2: What historical evidence shows Bitcoin’s reaction to political crises? Historical data indicates Bitcoin often declines during significant political uncertainty. During the 2018-2019 shutdown, Bitcoin dropped approximately 12%, though market structure and participation levels have evolved significantly since then. Q3: Do other cryptocurrencies react similarly to Bitcoin during political turmoil? Most cryptocurrencies show correlation with Bitcoin during crises, though altcoins typically experience greater volatility. Bitcoin often serves as a relative safe haven within the cryptocurrency ecosystem during turbulent periods. Q4: How long do Bitcoin prices typically take to recover after political crises? Recovery times vary based on crisis severity and market conditions. Historical data suggests recovery periods ranging from one to three weeks, though each situation presents unique characteristics and timelines. Q5: Should investors consider Bitcoin a safe haven during political instability? While Bitcoin sometimes demonstrates resilience, it generally behaves as a risk asset during acute political crises. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and portfolio diversification strategies rather than assuming Bitcoin will always serve as a safe haven.

It plunged to a low of $117.38, its lowest level in December last year, and 52% below the September high of $253. This article explores why SOL price slumped despite its strong fundamentals. Solana price dropped as its fundamentals improve SOL price remained on edge as third-party data showed that its fundamentals remained strong ahead of the upcoming Alpenglow upgrade, which is set to happen either in February or March. Data compiled by Nansen shows that Solana’s transactions and fees continued rising in the past 30 days, making it the most active network in the crypto industry. Solana’s network handled over 2 billion transactions in the last 30 days, much higher than what other networks like Ethereum, Base, and BSC Chain handled. Its active addresses jumped by 43% to over 85.3 million. This transaction growth was due to its strong performance in the meme coins, decentralized exchange (DEX), stablecoins, and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization industry. This growth led to a jump in network fees, which is important as Solana burns its fees, reducing the circulating supply. Fees jumped by 53% in the last 30 days to over $21 million, making it the second largest chain after Tron, which made over $27 million in fees. Solana fees have jumped | Source: Nansen Solana’s metrics are much better than those of Ethereum by far. For example, while its transaction count jumped to over 2.07 billion, Ethereum handled over 64 million transactions in the same period. Also, its fees were much higher than Ethereum’s 10 million. More data shows that its DEX network is thriving and beating Ethereum. Its DEX volume rose to $107 billion in the last 30 days, higher than Ethereum’s $45 billion and BSC’s $47 billion. The top DEX protocols on Solana were Pump.fun, BisonFi, HumidiFi, Meteora, Raydium, and Jupiter. Meanwhile, spot Solana ETFs did better than Bitcoin and Ethereum last week, a sign of resilient demand. These funds attracted over $9.5 million in inflows last week, meaning that they have never had a weekly outflow. In contrast, spot XRP ETFs shed over $40 million in assets last week. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs shed over $1.3 billion and $611 million, respectively. Therefore, Solana’s price is dropping because of external factors, including the ongoing crypto market crash . This decline is happening as investors react to the ongoing geopolitical tensions, as the US builds an armada in the Middle East. Donald Trump has also continued to warn about new tariffs against Canada . SOL price prediction: Technical analysis Solana price chart | Source: TradingView The three-day timeframe chart shows that the SOL token has crashed from a high of $253 on September 16 last year to a low of $117.38. It has remained below the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). The coin has now formed a bearish flag, which happens after a big drop. Its lower side is at $117.38. It has moved below all moving averages and the Supertrend indicator. Therefore, a drop below the key support level at $117.38 will point to more downside, potentially to the key support level at $95, its lowest level on April 7. Such a drop would point to a 23% decline below the current level.

This data, emerging in the first quarter of 2025, provides a crucial snapshot of professional sentiment during a period of notable market recalibration. The findings suggest a deepening conviction among major financial players, potentially signaling a strategic accumulation phase ahead of anticipated macroeconomic shifts. This institutional perspective stands in contrast to some public narratives, offering a data-driven window into the strategies of capital allocators who are increasingly integrating cryptocurrency into their portfolios. Bitcoin Undervalued According to Institutional Majority Coinbase’s first-quarter cryptocurrency market report, released in March 2025, delivers a compelling narrative based on direct investor feedback. The exchange surveyed 75 institutional investors and 73 retail investors between early December 2024 and early January 2025. The core finding is stark: a 71% majority of institutional respondents believe Bitcoin’s current market price does not reflect its underlying value or long-term potential. Furthermore, this institutional bullishness slightly outpaces retail sentiment, where 60% of respondents shared the view that Bitcoin is undervalued. This divergence highlights a growing sophistication gap, as professional investors often employ more rigorous valuation frameworks and longer time horizons. The survey’s timing is particularly instructive. It was conducted following a period of consolidation after the 2024 halving event and amidst ongoing regulatory clarifications in major economies like the United States and the European Union. Consequently, this sentiment data reflects a measured, post-volatility assessment rather than speculative frenzy. Analysts often cite several factors that could contribute to an “undervalued” perception, including the maturation of Bitcoin’s network security, its evolving role as a digital store of value, and its increasing correlation-disconnect from traditional tech stocks. Deep Analysis of Investor Sentiment and Behavior Beyond simple valuation beliefs, the Coinbase report delves into probable investor behavior under stress, revealing even stronger conviction. A remarkable 80% of institutional respondents indicated they would either maintain their current Bitcoin holdings or actively purchase more if the cryptocurrency market experienced a further 10% decline. This statistic is critical for understanding market structure. It suggests a substantial layer of buy-side support exists, which could dampen future downside volatility. Such resilience points to a maturation in investor mindset, treating pullbacks as opportunities rather than reasons for panic. Regarding market cycle identification, the survey found a nuanced view among all participants. A combined 54% of respondents characterized the current environment as either an “accumulation phase” or a “bear market.” This terminology is significant. An accumulation phase implies smart money is building positions quietly, often preceding a major bullish move. The data can be broken down further for clarity: Institutional Resilience: 80% commitment to hold or buy on dips. Market Cycle View: Majority see accumulation/bear phase, not a bubble top. Retail Caution: Retail investors show slightly less conviction (60%) than institutions. Strategic Patience: Sentiment suggests a focus on long-term fundamentals over short-term price action. The Federal Reserve’s Pivotal Role in Crypto Valuation The Coinbase report explicitly connects cryptocurrency valuation to broader monetary policy, a key marker of its analytical depth. It suggests that if the Federal Reserve executes two benchmark interest rate cuts in 2025, the resulting monetary easing could create a highly favorable environment for risk assets, including Bitcoin. Historically, periods of low interest rates and expanding money supply have correlated with strong performance in alternative stores of value. This analysis moves beyond crypto-specific news, anchoring Bitcoin’s potential in the global macroeconomic landscape. This perspective is supported by historical precedent. For instance, the post-2020 period of expansive fiscal and monetary policy coincided with Bitcoin’s rise from approximately $10,000 to its all-time high. Investors now monitor Fed statements, inflation data, and employment figures as closely as any blockchain metric. The potential for rate cuts could weaken the U.S. dollar index (DXY), historically a bullish inverse indicator for Bitcoin’s dollar-denominated price. Therefore, the survey captures a moment where traditional finance and digital asset theories are converging. Contextualizing the Survey in the 2025 Landscape To fully appreciate these findings, one must consider the unique financial landscape of early 2025. Several concurrent developments provide essential context. First, Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) approved in 2024 have now seen full quarters of trading, providing institutions with regulated, familiar vehicles for exposure. Second, major custodial and prime brokerage services for digital assets have become more robust, reducing operational friction for large investors. Third, geopolitical tensions and concerns about sovereign debt levels have renewed interest in non-sovereign, decentralized assets. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s network fundamentals remain strong. The hash rate, a measure of computational security, continues to hover near all-time highs. Adoption metrics, such as the number of active addresses and settlement volume, show steady growth. When institutional investors cite “undervalued,” they are likely synthesizing these on-chain fundamentals with macro-financial models. Their stance is not based on sentiment alone but on a growing body of data treating Bitcoin as a unique asset class with distinct drivers. Evidence and Expert Perspectives on Valuation Models While the survey reports sentiment, the underlying belief in undervaluation often stems from specific models. Experts frequently reference several frameworks. The Stock-to-Flow model, which assesses scarcity based on new supply issuance, is one historical benchmark, though its predictive power is debated. Network Value-to-Transactions (NVT) ratios, similar to PE ratios in equities, compare market cap to on-chain transaction volume. Currently, many of these metrics sit at levels historically associated with value rather than over-extension. Additionally, the growing practice of comparing Bitcoin’s market capitalization to the market cap of gold as a store of value provides a long-term narrative. If Bitcoin captures even a single-digit percentage of gold’s multi-trillion dollar valuation, its price would multiply significantly. Institutional investors, particularly those from hedge funds and family offices, are increasingly employing these comparative analyses, which may explain the strong undervaluation sentiment captured by Coinbase. Conclusion The Coinbase survey provides powerful, quantifiable evidence that a dominant majority of institutional investors perceive Bitcoin as undervalued in the current market. This sentiment, coupled with a declared intention to buy during downturns, paints a picture of strategic accumulation and deepening conviction. The linkage of this outlook to anticipated Federal Reserve policy underscores how intertwined cryptocurrency markets have become with traditional macroeconomics. For market observers, this data is a critical gauge of professional sentiment, suggesting that behind the scenes, sophisticated capital is positioning for what it believes is Bitcoin’s next significant chapter. The belief that Bitcoin is undervalued is now a mainstream institutional view, a profound shift from the skepticism of just a few years ago. FAQs Q1: What percentage of retail investors think Bitcoin is undervalued? According to the same Coinbase survey, 60% of retail investors share the view that Bitcoin is currently undervalued, which is slightly lower than the 71% of institutional investors. Q2: How might Federal Reserve interest rate cuts affect Bitcoin? The report suggests that rate cuts typically lead to monetary easing, which can weaken the dollar and create a favorable environment for risk-on assets like Bitcoin, as investors seek higher returns and inflation hedges. Q3: What did the survey say investors would do if the market fell 10%? A significant 80% of institutional respondents stated they would either maintain their current Bitcoin holdings or purchase more if the crypto market experienced a further 10% decline, indicating strong underlying demand. Q4: How many investors were surveyed in the Coinbase report? The survey polled a total of 148 investors, comprising 75 institutional investors and 73 retail investors, between early December 2024 and early January 2025. Q5: What phase do most investors believe the market is currently in? Fifty-four percent of all survey respondents identified the current market cycle as either an “accumulation phase” or a “bear market,” suggesting a prevalent view that prices are in a period of consolidation or value-building.

A local outlet reported Sunday that Coinone has put itself on the market and is discussing scenarios tied to Chairman Cha Myung-hoon’s holdings, which total 53.44% through his personal stake and his holding company, The One Group. Speculation around a sale picked up after Cha returned to frontline management just four months after stepping down as chief executive, a move that some observers read as preparation for a stake transaction. Tech Upgrades Accelerate Even As Losses Weigh On Valuation Coinone, meanwhile, said Cha stepped back in to sharpen its technological edge as it nears a double-digit market share, building out areas such as artificial intelligence. Attention has also turned to Com2uS, the gaming group that accumulated a 38.42% stake in Coinone between 2021 and 2022. Seoul Economic Daily reports that South Korea's third-largest crypto exchange Coinone is up for sale. Major shareholder and chairman Cha Myung-hoon is considering selling part of his stake and exploring other options. Coinbase will visit Korea this week to discuss equity… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 26, 2026 Coinone’s continued losses have weighed on its book value, which Seoul Economic Daily put at 75.2B won, or about $52M, at the end of the third quarter, below Com2uS’s reported acquisition cost. Against that backdrop, industry sources say Coinbase plans to visit South Korea this week and meet major local players, including Coinone, as it looks for partners to build products that fit Korean rules. Korea’s Crypto Exchange Sector Sees Surge In Deal Activity The talks come as dealmaking accelerates across South Korea’s crypto exchange sector, with traditional finance and big tech circling licensed platforms and won trading rails. Regulators recently cleared Binance’s long-running effort to take over GOPAX , and the market has since seen a rush of takeover interest. Naver Financial agreed to acquire Dunamu , the operator of market leader Upbit, in an all-stock deal, while local media have also reported Mirae Asset Securities is pursuing Korbit . Coinone has tried to differentiate on product as well as ownership, launching what it called the country’s first flexible Bitcoin staking service in Aug. 2025, letting users earn rewards without locking up their holdings. Coinone says discussions remain open-ended, and it has not settled on a structure, a timeline or a buyer. Still, the prospect of a Coinbase tie-up lands at a moment when Korea’s exchange map is already shifting, and when global players are watching for a way in.

The discussion also revived disagreement over proposals to limit non-monetary data on Bitcoin and coincided with the separate debate about quantum computing risks. Bitcoin Developers Push Back on Saylor’s Warning Michael Saylor reignited a long-running ideological debate in the Bitcoin community after warning that the biggest threat to the network is not external forces, but “ambitious opportunists” pushing protocol changes. The Strategy co-founder argued that Bitcoin’s resilience depends on resisting unnecessary modifications, which immediately drew sharp reactions from crypto social media. Some Bitcoin maximalists interpreted Saylor’s comments as a critique of developers advocating for non-monetary use cases on Bitcoin, like NFTs, on-chain images, and other data-heavy applications. Justin Bechler suggested that what Saylor said was aimed squarely at those expanding Bitcoin beyond its core role as sound money. Others disagreed with Saylor’s framing altogether by arguing that technical evolution is essential for long-term security and relevance. Investor Fred Krueger countered that quantum computing, not protocol experimentation, represents the most serious existential risk to Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Mert Mumtaz , CEO of Helius, strongly criticized Saylor’s position by calling it a “cancerous mindset” and arguing that all software, including Bitcoin, has historically required fixes and upgrades to address bugs and vulnerabilities. He warned against treating the protocol as infallible or freezing it in time. The debate also resurfaced tensions around Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 110, a proposed temporary soft fork designed to limit non-monetary data stored on the blockchain. Some community members, including Mark of Bitcoin, pointed to ongoing “spam wars” as evidence that the network needs clearer rules around acceptable data usage, while others see such proposals as a slippery slope toward censorship and overreach. Running parallel to this dispute is a broader argument about quantum computing and Bitcoin’s long-term cryptographic security. Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures repeatedly urged the network to accelerate its transition toward post-quantum standards, and warned that waiting too long could be dangerous. Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, pushed back on those claims, saying Bitcoin developers are already researching quantum defenses quietly and deliberately, without panic-driven changes.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|TECHNOLOGY|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-26 05:30:00

This comes as concerns about a potential US government shutdown deepened, prompting selling in digital crypto assets. As tensions in the crypto market escalated further, Senate Democrats threatened to block funding packages if they discovered they included funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), a US federal executive department responsible for public security, including border management. Notably, this threat was issued against the backdrop of recent reputable reports of a case where federal agents shot and killed a man in Minneapolis, Minnesota’s largest city. Concerning the Senate Democrats’ warning, Chuck Schumer, the senior US senator from New York and the Senate Democratic Leader, alleged that, “Democrats wanted sensible changes in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill, but because Republicans won’t challenge President Trump, the DHS bill fails to address ICE’s issues. I will vote no.” To underscore the urgency of the situation, Schumer emphasized that Senate Democrats will oppose advancing the appropriations bill if it includes DHS funding. The crypto market faces one of the most severe downturns in history As the crypto market faces a tough time due to escalating global conflicts, data from TradingView showed that its capitalization dropped from a previous peak of $2.97 trillion to $2.87 trillion in just 6.5 hours by Sunday, January 25, at 9:30 pm UTC. Consequently, Bitcoin’s price declined by 3.4% in the past 24 hours. As the dominant cryptocurrency, BTC’s price movement affected other cryptocurrencies, such as Ether, which declined by about 5.3% during the same period. Apart from this incident, data from Gate, a top-tier, centralized cryptocurrency exchange, disclosed that leveraged crypto positions valued at over $360 million were liquidated in the last 24 hours, with $324 million in long positions closed. On the other hand, traders on major prediction markets, Kalshi and Polymarket, placed their bets anticipating an 80% probability that a US government shutdown would occur by Saturday, January 31. To break this probability down, sources noted that the likelihood of another shutdown by January 31 on prediction market Kalshi skyrocketed from below 10% on Saturday, January 24, to 78.6% on Sunday, January 25. For Polymarket, its prediction also surged to 80%. Just after making this prediction, traders began to panic amid deepening recession fears, following US President Donald Trump’s earlier assertion that he might raise tariffs on Canada to 100% if the country strikes an agreement with China. Furthermore, reports stated that the US military sent warships to the Middle East amid escalating tensions with Iran. Crypto investors recall how prices behave during US government shutdowns. Bitcoin’s price sharply declined amid last year’s US government shutdown Regarding the last US government shutdown, sources noted that the federal government was closed from October 1 to November 12 last year. This shutdown resulted from the Congress’s decision to delay the approval of funding for the 2026 fiscal year. As a result of the record 43-day shutdown, Bitcoin’s price sharply declined from its all-time high record of $126,080 to $100,000. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that ongoing conflicts in Washington and the October 10 crypto market crash partly drove this decline. The key driver of this market crash was Trump’s tariff threats against China. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This crucial process represents the final opportunity for industry stakeholders and the public to shape the rules governing digital assets before their anticipated implementation later this year. The FCA’s move signals a decisive step toward establishing clear operational frameworks for cryptocurrency businesses operating within the UK jurisdiction. FCA Crypto Regulations: The Final Consultation Phase The Financial Conduct Authority formally initiated its concluding consultation period on February 12, 2025, following extensive preliminary discussions and earlier feedback rounds. According to official documentation, this phase specifically targets ten distinct regulatory proposals that will fundamentally reshape how cryptocurrency services operate within the United Kingdom. The consultation period remains open until March 12, 2025, providing market participants with exactly four weeks to submit detailed responses and evidence-based commentary. This regulatory development follows the UK government’s 2023 commitment to establish the country as a global hub for cryptoasset technology and investment. Consequently, the FCA’s proposed framework aims to balance innovation facilitation with robust consumer protection mechanisms. The authority has emphasized that this consultation represents the last substantive opportunity for public input before final rules undergo parliamentary scrutiny and formal adoption procedures. Core Regulatory Proposals Under Scrutiny The consultation document outlines ten specific regulatory areas requiring market feedback. These proposals collectively address the most significant operational and consumer protection concerns identified during the FCA’s multi-year monitoring of cryptocurrency market developments. Business Conduct and Consumer Protection Standards The FCA proposes implementing stringent business conduct requirements for all authorized cryptocurrency firms. These standards would mandate transparent pricing structures, clear risk disclosures, and fair treatment protocols for retail consumers. Additionally, the authority seeks to establish specific rules regarding marketing communications and promotional materials for cryptoassets. Furthermore, the consultation explores restrictions on purchasing cryptocurrencies using credit products. This measure directly responds to concerns about consumer debt accumulation in volatile digital asset markets. The proposed restrictions would potentially limit or prohibit firms from facilitating cryptocurrency acquisitions through credit cards, overdrafts, or unsecured loans. Custody and Client Asset Safeguarding Client asset protection represents another cornerstone of the proposed regulatory framework. The FCA’s consultation paper details specific custody requirements for firms holding or controlling client cryptoassets. These rules would mandate segregation of client funds from operational capital, robust security protocols, and regular independent audits of custody arrangements. The proposed custody framework draws significantly from established financial services regulations while adapting to the unique technological characteristics of digital assets. Specifically, the consultation seeks feedback on appropriate cold storage requirements, multi-signature protocols, and insurance or compensation arrangements for client holdings. Regulatory Reporting and Transparency Requirements Enhanced transparency through regulatory reporting constitutes another major component of the proposed regulations. Authorized firms would need to submit regular reports detailing transaction volumes, client demographics, risk exposures, and compliance metrics. The FCA proposes standardized reporting templates to ensure consistency across the cryptocurrency sector. These reporting requirements aim to provide regulators with comprehensive market visibility while enabling evidence-based policy adjustments. The consultation specifically requests feedback on reporting frequency, data granularity, and implementation timelines for smaller market participants. Comparative Analysis with Global Regulatory Approaches The UK’s regulatory development occurs within a rapidly evolving global context of cryptocurrency oversight. The table below illustrates how the FCA’s proposed framework compares with approaches in other major jurisdictions: Jurisdiction Regulatory Authority Key Approach Implementation Status United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority Comprehensive framework with final consultation phase Proposed, consultation until March 2025 European Union Multiple authorities under MiCA Harmonized rules across member states Phased implementation from 2024 United States SEC, CFTC, state regulators Fragmented approach with enforcement focus Ongoing litigation and rulemaking Singapore Monetary Authority of Singapore Licensing framework with risk-based oversight Implemented with periodic updates This comparative analysis reveals that the UK’s approach aligns more closely with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework than with the United States’ current enforcement-driven model. However, the FCA’s proposals include several distinctive elements, particularly regarding credit restrictions and custody requirements. Industry Response and Expert Perspectives Initial reactions from cryptocurrency industry participants have been cautiously optimistic. Major exchanges and service providers operating in the UK have generally welcomed regulatory clarity while expressing concerns about implementation timelines and compliance costs. Industry associations have begun coordinating response submissions to ensure coherent feedback reaches the FCA before the March deadline. Financial regulation experts emphasize the consultation’s significance for the UK’s competitive positioning. Dr. Eleanor Vance, Professor of Financial Regulation at the London School of Economics, notes, “The FCA’s consultation represents a critical juncture for UK financial services. Getting this regulatory balance right could position London as a preferred destination for responsible cryptocurrency innovation, while excessive restrictions might drive talent and investment to more accommodating jurisdictions.” Consumer advocacy groups have particularly welcomed the proposed credit restrictions and enhanced disclosure requirements. These organizations have long expressed concerns about retail investors entering volatile cryptocurrency markets without adequate risk understanding or financial safeguards. Implementation Timeline and Expected Impacts The FCA has outlined a clear procedural pathway following the consultation closure. The authority will analyze all submissions throughout April 2025 before publishing a policy statement and final rules in the second quarter. Parliamentary approval processes would then follow, with implementation likely commencing in late 2025 or early 2026. The regulatory framework’s implementation will produce several significant market impacts: Market Consolidation: Smaller firms may face challenges meeting compliance requirements, potentially leading to industry consolidation. Increased Institutional Participation: Clear regulations typically encourage greater institutional investment in regulated cryptocurrency products and services. Consumer Confidence Enhancement: Established rules and oversight mechanisms generally increase retail consumer confidence in market integrity. Innovation Guidance: Regulatory clarity helps direct innovation toward compliant applications rather than regulatory arbitrage. Conclusion The FCA’s final consultation on cryptocurrency regulations represents a watershed moment for the United Kingdom’s digital asset ecosystem. This comprehensive regulatory framework, once finalized, will establish clear operational parameters for cryptocurrency businesses while implementing robust consumer protection measures. The ten specific proposals under consideration address the most pressing concerns in cryptocurrency markets, from business conduct standards to custody requirements. As the March 12 deadline approaches, industry participants, consumer advocates, and regulatory experts continue analyzing the implications of these proposed FCA crypto regulations. The consultation outcomes will undoubtedly shape the UK’s cryptocurrency landscape for years to come, potentially establishing a global benchmark for balanced digital asset regulation. FAQs Q1: What is the deadline for submitting feedback to the FCA’s cryptocurrency consultation? The consultation period remains open until March 12, 2025. All submissions must reach the Financial Conduct Authority by this date to receive consideration during the final rulemaking process. Q2: How many regulatory proposals does the FCA consultation address? The consultation specifically seeks feedback on ten distinct regulatory proposals covering business conduct, credit restrictions, custody rules, and reporting requirements for cryptocurrency firms. Q3: Will the proposed regulations affect individual cryptocurrency investors? Yes, the regulations will primarily impact investors through enhanced consumer protections, clearer risk disclosures, and potential restrictions on purchasing cryptocurrencies using credit products. Q4: How do the UK’s proposed cryptocurrency regulations compare with European Union rules? The UK’s framework shares similarities with the EU’s MiCA regulations but includes distinctive elements, particularly regarding credit restrictions and specific custody requirements for client assets. Q5: What happens after the consultation period ends on March 12? The FCA will analyze all submissions before publishing a policy statement and final rules in Q2 2025. These will then undergo parliamentary approval processes ahead of implementation.

This development immediately captured attention across trading desks and analytical firms, signaling potential caution among institutional and retail participants despite Bitcoin’s recent price stability. The dominance of short contracts often serves as a critical barometer for market expectations, providing insights into how sophisticated traders are positioning themselves in volatile conditions. Consequently, this data point becomes essential for understanding the underlying currents in digital asset derivatives markets. BTC Perpetual Futures Show Consistent Short Bias Across Binance, Bybit, and OKX—platforms collectively representing the majority of global crypto derivatives open interest—short positions maintained a decisive majority in Bitcoin perpetual futures throughout the last 24-hour reporting period. The aggregate ratio across these three exchanges showed longs at 47.95% against shorts at 52.05%, creating a notable though not extreme skew. This persistent short dominance suggests a prevailing expectation of potential downward price movement or a strategic hedging approach against existing long spot holdings. Market analysts frequently monitor these ratios because they reflect real-time sentiment shifts that can precede price volatility. Furthermore, the consistency across major platforms indicates a broad-based sentiment rather than an isolated exchange phenomenon. Each platform’s specific breakdown reveals subtle variations: Binance reported longs at 47.2% and shorts at 52.8%, Bybit showed longs at 47.85% versus shorts at 52.15%, and OKX displayed the most pronounced short bias with longs at 46.83% and shorts at 53.17%. These figures, while differing slightly, collectively paint a coherent picture of cautious market positioning. Importantly, perpetual futures contracts differ from traditional futures because they lack a fixed expiry date, making them particularly sensitive to immediate market sentiment and funding rate mechanisms. Understanding Perpetual Futures and Market Mechanics Perpetual futures, or perpetual swaps, represent a cornerstone product in cryptocurrency derivatives markets. Unlike traditional futures with set settlement dates, these contracts trade continuously, using a funding rate mechanism to tether their price to the underlying spot asset. The funding rate, typically exchanged every eight hours between longs and shorts, ensures contract prices converge with the spot price. When shorts dominate as observed currently, the funding rate often turns negative, meaning short position holders pay longs, creating a financial incentive that can influence positioning over time. This dynamic adds a layer of complexity to interpreting pure position ratios. Several key factors typically drive traders toward short positions in perpetual markets. First, anticipation of a price decline represents the most straightforward motive. Second, traders might use short futures as a hedge against long spot Bitcoin holdings, a common risk management strategy. Third, arbitrage opportunities between futures and spot markets can create technical short demand. Fourth, broader macroeconomic concerns, such as interest rate expectations or regulatory developments, can influence derivative positioning. Finally, the inherent leverage available in futures markets amplifies both potential gains and losses, making position data a volatile but insightful sentiment indicator. Hedging Activity: Institutional holders often short futures to protect spot portfolios. Speculative Sentiment: Retail and professional traders bet on price declines. Arbitrage Strategies: Exploiting price differences between futures and spot markets. Funding Rate Dynamics: Negative rates can incentivize long positions over time. Leverage Effects: High leverage can accelerate position changes during volatility. Historical Context and Comparative Analysis Historical data from 2023 and 2024 provides essential context for the current short dominance. Analysis from CryptoQuant and Glassnode indicates that similar short-heavy periods have frequently preceded both minor corrections and extended consolidation phases, rather than outright market crashes. For instance, in June 2024, a short ratio exceeding 53% coincided with a 7% Bitcoin price dip over two weeks, followed by a rapid recovery. Conversely, extreme long dominance (above 65%) has more reliably signaled local market tops. The current 52.05% short level, therefore, suggests moderate bearishness rather than panic, aligning with a market that may be pricing in near-term uncertainty without abandoning longer-term bullish structural trends. Comparing exchange-specific data reveals interesting nuances. OKX’s higher short percentage (53.17%) may reflect its particular user base, which often includes more active professional traders in the Asia-Pacific region. Binance’s figures, representing the largest liquidity pool, typically serve as the global benchmark. The relative consistency across exchanges strengthens the signal’s reliability, as it is not driven by a single platform’s idiosyncrasies. Additionally, open interest—the total number of outstanding contracts—remains near yearly highs, indicating strong market participation and confirming that position changes reflect genuine sentiment shifts rather than declining liquidity. Implications for Bitcoin Price Action and Trader Strategy The prevalence of short positions creates a market structure that technical analysts describe as “crowded.” When too many traders lean in one direction, even a modest price increase can trigger a short squeeze, forcing short holders to buy back contracts to cover losses, thereby accelerating upward momentum. This dynamic makes the market potentially vulnerable to rapid reversals if bullish news emerges. Monitoring funding rates becomes crucial in such environments; persistently negative rates would reward longs and could gradually encourage position flipping. Traders also watch order book depth on these exchanges for signs of large buy walls that could ignite a squeeze. For long-term investors, short-term derivatives positioning often has limited predictive power for fundamental trends. However, it provides excellent insight into market sentiment and leverage conditions. A market with elevated short interest can absorb selling pressure more efficiently, as some selling is already “pre-positioned” in futures. Consequently, spot market sell-offs might be less severe than in a long-dominated market where liquidations cascade downward. This scenario played out in Q1 2024, when high short interest cushioned a macroeconomic-driven dip, preventing the liquidation spiral seen in previous cycles. Strategic traders therefore view current data as a risk management input, not a standalone signal. BTC Perpetual Futures Position Breakdown (Top 3 Exchanges) Exchange Long Percentage Short Percentage Notable Context Binance 47.2% 52.8% Largest global liquidity pool Bybit 47.85% 52.15% Strong retail trader presence OKX 46.83% 53.17% Higher concentration of professional traders Aggregate 47.95% 52.05% Overall short dominance Conclusion The data clearly shows short positions dominating BTC perpetual futures across three major exchanges, reflecting a cautious but not panicked derivatives market sentiment in late March 2025. This short bias, while notable, remains within historical ranges observed during consolidation periods. Traders should interpret this information alongside funding rates, spot market flows, and macroeconomic indicators for a complete picture. The structure suggests a market prepared for potential downside yet vulnerable to a short squeeze on positive catalysts. Ultimately, perpetual futures positioning offers a real-time window into trader psychology, and the current short dominance underscores the nuanced and hedged approach prevailing in today’s cryptocurrency landscape. FAQs Q1: What does it mean when short positions dominate BTC perpetual futures? It indicates that more traders are betting on or hedging against a potential price decrease in the near term. This is measured by the ratio of open short contracts versus long contracts on derivatives exchanges. Q2: How significant is a 52.05% short position aggregate? While it shows a clear directional bias, this level is considered moderate. Extreme sentiment signals typically occur when ratios exceed 55-60%. The current level suggests caution, not extreme bearish conviction. Q3: Can short dominance predict a Bitcoin price drop? Not reliably on its own. While it reflects bearish sentiment, crowded short positions can lead to sharp rallies if a “short squeeze” occurs. It is one indicator among many, including spot volume and on-chain data. Q4: Why might traders short perpetual futures instead of selling spot Bitcoin? Futures allow for leverage, enabling larger position sizes with less capital. They also enable hedging; an investor holding Bitcoin can short futures to protect against price declines without selling their underlying asset. Q5: How do funding rates interact with short-dominated markets? When shorts outnumber longs, the funding rate usually turns negative. This means short position holders pay a periodic fee to longs, which can incentivize some traders to switch to long positions over time, creating a balancing mechanism.

Key Takeaways: Ethereum faces higher downside risk toward $2,000 than a breakout above $4,000, according to Mike McGlone. Long-term analysts argue ETH is in an accumulation phase despite weak price momentum. Ethereum’s roadmap points to renewed focus on self-sovereignty and user experience beyond 2025. In a recent post on X , McGlone pointed to persistent range-bound trading and rising macro risks weighing on the asset. He said Ether has remained trapped in a $2,000–$4,000 range since 2023, but momentum appears to be shifting toward the lower end. Rising Market Volatility Could Keep Ethereum Below $2,000 McGlone argued that the risks of Ethereum staying below $2,000 are greater than the chances of a sustained breakout above $4,000, especially if volatility in global equity markets rebounds. His accompanying chart highlights repeated failures near the upper boundary of the range, alongside multiple tests of support closer to $2,000. McGlone’s view contrasts with a more optimistic narrative circulating among crypto-focused analysts. BullifyX, a widely followed market commentator, recently compared Ethereum’s long-term price structure to that of gold. According to BullifyX, Ethereum is undergoing an extended accumulation phase characterized by gradual higher lows and compressed price action, a pattern that historically preceded strong rallies in traditional safe-haven assets. Every time I look at the #Ethereum chart, it mirrors #GOLD a little too perfectly. Long accumulation. Relentless structure. Explosive moves after patience is rewarded. That’s not weakness that’s strength building quietly. Once you see it, you can’t unsee it. $ETH isn’t… pic.twitter.com/G9ndiXsQVO — BullifyX (@Bullify_X) January 25, 2026 The analyst described Ethereum’s current behavior as a period of quiet positioning rather than fading demand, suggesting that prolonged consolidation could ultimately lay the groundwork for a sharp upside move once conditions shift. Meanwhile, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has framed 2026 as more than a technical milestone. In a recent post , he said the community is entering a phase focused on restoring personal autonomy and improving user experience, arguing that earlier compromises made in pursuit of adoption no longer need to define the network’s future. “2026 is the year that we take back lost ground in terms of self-sovereignty and trustlessness,” Buterin said in an X post. Together, record activity, falling fees, and rising participation suggest Ethereum is entering a new phase, one where scale no longer comes at the expense of accessibility. Ethereum Foundation Makes Quantum-Resistant Security a Strategic Priority As reported, the Ethereum Foundation has elevated post-quantum security to a core strategic focus, forming a dedicated Post Quantum team and committing $2 million to the effort. Announced by Ethereum researcher Justin Drake, the initiative will be led by Thomas Coratger alongside Emile, a contributor to leanVM. Drake said the foundation has been working on quantum-resilience research quietly for years, dating back to early discussions in 2019, before formally making it a top-level priority.

The Daejeon District Court’s January 15, 2025 ruling rejected a user’s claim for approximately 130 million won ($93,000) in losses incurred during system failures amid South Korea’s December 3, 2024 martial law declaration, establishing important boundaries for exchange accountability. Upbit Lawsuit Details and Court Ruling Analysis The dismissed lawsuit centered on a user’s claim that Dunamu, operator of South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Upbit, failed to maintain adequate system stability during extraordinary circumstances. According to court documents obtained by Digital Asset, the plaintiff argued that the exchange’s technical infrastructure should have withstood the unprecedented trading volume surge following the martial law declaration. However, the court systematically rejected these arguments, finding no evidence that Dunamu breached its management duties under existing regulations. Court records reveal the judge emphasized several key factors in the decision. First, the martial law declaration represented an extraordinary governmental action that no private company could reasonably anticipate. Second, the subsequent trading volume spike exceeded historical patterns and industry benchmarks. Third, Upbit’s existing terms of service, which users accept during registration, contain specific provisions regarding force majeure events. The ruling noted that while exchanges must maintain reasonable operational standards, they cannot be held responsible for national emergencies beyond their control. Martial Law Context and Market Impact The December 2024 martial law declaration followed escalating regional tensions that prompted extraordinary government measures across South Korea. Financial markets experienced immediate volatility, with cryptocurrency trading volumes surging 300-400% above normal levels within hours. This unprecedented activity overwhelmed multiple trading platforms, not just Upbit, creating widespread system instability across the digital asset ecosystem. Market data from that period shows several important patterns: Volume Surge: Trading volumes reached 4.2 trillion won ($3 billion) in the first 24 hours, compared to typical daily volumes of 1.1 trillion won Price Volatility: Bitcoin prices swung 18% within six hours of the announcement System Strain: Multiple exchanges reported partial outages or degraded performance Withdrawal Delays: Processing times extended to 4-6 hours across major platforms Industry analysts note that the martial law situation created a perfect storm of technical challenges. Simultaneously, millions of users attempted to access their accounts, execute trades, and move assets, creating network congestion that affected both centralized exchanges and blockchain networks themselves. Legal Precedents and Regulatory Framework South Korea’s legal system has gradually developed specific frameworks for cryptocurrency exchange liability through multiple court cases since 2018. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) established baseline requirements for exchange operations in 2021, mandating security protocols, reserve requirements, and disclosure standards. However, these regulations primarily address normal operating conditions rather than national emergencies. Legal experts point to several relevant precedents that informed the court’s decision. In 2022, the Seoul Central District Court ruled that exchanges must maintain “reasonable security measures” but cannot guarantee absolute system availability. Another 2023 case established that “extraordinary market conditions” may justify temporary service limitations. The martial law ruling extends this logic to unprecedented governmental actions, creating a clearer boundary for exchange responsibilities. The court’s analysis specifically examined whether Dunamu met its duty of care under several frameworks: Legal Standard Court Finding Evidence Considered Technical Preparedness Adequate for normal conditions Infrastructure audits, redundancy systems Emergency Response Reasonable given circumstances Communication timelines, restoration efforts User Communication Timely and transparent Public announcements, direct notifications Industry Standards Met or exceeded peers Comparative exchange performance data Cryptocurrency Exchange Liability Standards The ruling establishes important distinctions between ordinary operational failures and extraordinary circumstances. Exchanges maintain clear responsibilities for system security, fund protection, and transparent operations under normal conditions. However, the court determined that national emergencies creating unprecedented market behavior represent a different category of event. Industry standards for exchange infrastructure typically include: Scalability: Capacity to handle 3-5 times normal trading volume Redundancy: Multiple server locations and backup systems Security: Cold storage for majority of assets, multi-signature protocols Compliance: Real-name verification, anti-money laundering systems Technical audits presented in court showed Upbit maintained these standards before the martial law declaration. The exchange’s infrastructure could handle approximately 4 times normal volume, which exceeded industry averages. However, the actual volume surge reached nearly 4 times that capacity threshold, creating technical limitations that affected even robust systems. User Protection Mechanisms and Limitations South Korean exchanges operate under specific user protection frameworks established by the FSC. These include mandatory insurance coverage, reserve requirements, and compensation funds. Upbit maintains a 300 billion won ($215 million) reserve fund specifically for user protection, along with additional insurance policies covering various operational risks. However, these protection mechanisms contain specific exclusions for force majeure events. The court examined Upbit’s terms of service, which clearly state that the exchange cannot guarantee uninterrupted service during “governmental actions, national emergencies, or extraordinary market conditions.” Users accept these terms during account registration, creating a contractual framework that the court found legally binding. The ruling emphasizes that while user protection remains important, exchanges cannot serve as insurers against all possible market disruptions. This balance between protection and practical limitations represents a central challenge in cryptocurrency regulation globally. Global Implications for Crypto Regulation The South Korean ruling arrives amid ongoing global debates about cryptocurrency exchange responsibilities. Different jurisdictions approach these questions with varying legal frameworks, creating a complex international landscape for digital asset platforms. Comparative analysis reveals several approaches: European Union: MiCA regulations establish tiered requirements based on exchange size United States: State-by-state licensing with varying consumer protection standards Japan: Strict operational requirements with mandatory compensation systems Singapore: Risk-based licensing with emphasis on anti-money laundering compliance The South Korean decision adds important nuance to these frameworks by addressing extreme circumstances beyond normal regulatory contemplation. Legal experts suggest this ruling may influence how other jurisdictions handle similar questions, particularly as geopolitical tensions create more frequent market disruptions. Industry responses have been generally supportive of the court’s balanced approach. Exchange operators emphasize their commitment to user protection while acknowledging practical limitations during extraordinary events. Consumer advocates, meanwhile, continue pushing for stronger safeguards and clearer communication during market disruptions. Conclusion The dismissal of the Upbit lawsuit against Dunamu establishes crucial legal boundaries for cryptocurrency exchange liability during national emergencies. The court’s ruling recognizes that while exchanges must maintain robust systems and transparent operations, they cannot be held responsible for losses resulting from unforeseeable governmental actions like martial law declarations. This decision provides important clarity for South Korea’s digital asset industry while balancing user protection with practical operational realities. As cryptocurrency markets continue evolving, this ruling will likely influence both regulatory development and exchange operational standards globally, particularly regarding emergency preparedness and liability limitations during extraordinary circumstances. FAQs Q1: What was the main reason the court dismissed the Upbit lawsuit? The court ruled that the martial law declaration and resulting trading volume surge were unforeseeable events, and found no evidence that Dunamu breached its management duties under existing regulations and industry standards. Q2: How much was the plaintiff seeking in damages? The lawsuit sought approximately 130 million won, equivalent to about $93,000 USD, for losses incurred during system failures following the martial law declaration. Q3: Does this mean cryptocurrency exchanges have no liability for system outages? No, exchanges remain liable for operational failures under normal conditions. This ruling specifically addresses extraordinary circumstances involving national emergencies that create unprecedented market behavior. Q4: What impact might this ruling have on other cryptocurrency users? The decision clarifies that exchange terms of service regarding force majeure events are legally binding, emphasizing the importance of users understanding platform limitations during extraordinary circumstances. Q5: How does South Korea’s approach compare to other countries? South Korea maintains specific user protection requirements through the FSC, but this ruling establishes that national emergencies represent a distinct category where normal liability standards may not apply, creating a more nuanced framework than some other jurisdictions.

Gold surged to fresh record highs above $5,000 an ounce, buoyed by safe-haven demand and a weaker dollar, while sharp swings in the Japanese yen reignited speculation over possible currency intervention. Elsewhere, Canada pushed back against US pressure over China trade ties, South Korea’s small-cap stocks surged, and cryptocurrencies slid as investors rotated away from risk. Safe havens rise as yen volatility hits Asian markets Gold surged past $5,000 per ounce on Monday, lifted by safety flows amid dollar weakness after a turbulent week marked by tensions over Greenland and Iran. Investors also remained unsettled after violent spikes in the Japanese yen. The yen was trading at 154.3 per dollar, following sharp moves on Friday that sparked speculation about potential intervention. According to Reuters sources, the New York Federal Reserve conducted rate checks on Friday, raising the possibility of joint US–Japan action to arrest the yen’s slide. “The market’s inclination is to short the yen but the possibility of co-ordination means it no longer is a one-way bet,” said Prashant Newnaha, senior rates strategist at TD Securities in Singapore, in the Reuters report. The prospect of coordinated intervention weighed on the dollar and broadly supported other currencies. Japan’s Nikkei fell about 1.6%, while S&P 500 futures slipped 0.14% and European futures were down 0.13% as traders awaited the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting later in the week. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said on Sunday her government would take necessary steps against speculative market moves. Carlos Casanova, senior Asia economist at UBP, said expectations alone could lend support to the currency, adding: “The Japanese yen is likely to stabilise to some extent – though the catalysts for significant appreciation remain limited – while long-term yields are expected to face continued pressure at their current elevated levels.” Canada pushes back on China trade amid Trump tariff threat Canada said it has no intention of pursuing a free trade agreement with China , Prime Minister Mark Carney said on Sunday, responding to warnings from US President Donald Trump, who has threatened punitive tariffs if Ottawa deepens ties with Beijing. Carney said Canada would respect its obligations under the Canada–US–Mexico Agreement and would not negotiate a free trade deal without notifying its North American partners. Trump has said he would impose a 100% tariff on Canadian exports if Ottawa “makes a deal” with Beijing. “If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a ‘Drop Off Port’ for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. Carney stressed that Canada’s recent “preliminary agreement” with China, concluded on Jan. 16, only lowers tariffs on selected goods and remains consistent with existing trade rules. “We have no intention of doing that with China or any other nonmarket economy,” Carney said. “What we have done with China is to rectify some issues that developed in the last couple of years.” South Korea small caps surge as retail frenzy builds South Korea’s small-cap stocks jumped to their highest level in more than four years, sharply outperforming the benchmark Kospi Index and signalling a broadening rally in local equities. The Kosdaq Index surged as much as 6.9%, triggering the Korea Exchange’s “sidecar” rule, which temporarily halts program trading to curb volatility. While the Kospi opened higher, it later slipped as much as 0.9% after hitting the historic 5,000 mark last week. Retail investors piled into higher-risk trades. The Samsung Kodex KOSDAQ150 Leverage ETF, which offers twice the exposure to the Kosdaq 150 Index, jumped as much as 23%. A Korea Financial Investment Association website used for mandatory investor training reportedly crashed amid heavy traffic. Bitcoin slides as investors retreat from risk Cryptocurrencies weakened as geopolitical concerns drove investors toward safe havens such as gold. Bitcoin dropped as much as 3.5% on Sunday to a 2026 low just above $86,000, before rebounding modestly to $87,733 in early Asian trading. Ether slid as much as 5.7% before recovering 2% to $2,872. Monday’s bounce “is more of a pause than a big bounce,” said Sean McNulty, APAC derivatives trading lead at FalconX in a Bloomberg report. “We are not seeing a ton of flows so far this morning.” Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds recorded five straight days of outflows totaling $1.7 billion last week in the US, according to Bloomberg data, underscoring fragile sentiment as investors navigate rising geopolitical and macroeconomic risks.

Zhao said the pardon issued by US President Donald Trump lifted all previous restrictions that had stopped him from holding a position at the company. Despite that, he made it clear that returning to Binance was never part of his future plans. “I haven’t really needed to go back. I didn’t really want to. I thought it was a pretty good way for me to step down, away from Binance after seven years,” he said. Zhao explained that while the separation from the company was painful at the time, it eventually became something he accepted. “At the time, it was very painful. I didn’t like it. But after, you get used to it. I don’t think it’s good for me to go back. I think we should leave room for other strong leaders to grow,” Zhao added. His comments reflected a broader view that leadership transitions should be respected rather than reversed. Zhao pleaded guilty in November 2023 to failing to maintain an effective Anti–Money Laundering program at Binance. He was later sentenced to four months in prison and barred from working at the exchange. Trump’s decision to pardon Zhao in October sparked controversy among US lawmakers. Some questioned Binance’s alleged connections to Trump-linked crypto ventures. Trump denied knowing who Zhao was when asked about the decision. Zhao has consistently maintained that Binance has flourished since his departure. He described the company as stable and progressing under its new leadership. “Two capable CEOs” are now guiding the exchange forward, according to Zhao. He said Binance had experienced growth across several important metrics. These included increases in users, trading volume, and overall market share. In a December open letter, Binance executives revealed the platform had surpassed 300 million users. The company also reported total annual trading volume of $34 trillion. Zhao described himself as a passive shareholder rather than an active executive. “I just thought, look; they don’t need a backseat driver today. I’m still a shareholder,” Zhao said. He added that his involvement was limited to offering advice through social media. “I’m just a pretty passive shareholder, and today when I want to give them advice, I just write it on Twitter,” he said. Zhao’s withdrawal from daily operations has allowed him to focus on broader crypto industry trends. One of his most notable predictions involves Bitcoin’s future market behavior. He believes the traditional four-year Bitcoin cycle could be nearing its end. Bitcoin has historically followed a pattern of sharp rises followed by steep corrections. This pattern has repeated roughly every four years since its creation. Zhao suggested that a new market environment may disrupt that structure. “Normally, Bitcoin follows four-year cycles, if you look at historic data every four years there’s an all-time high, and then there’s a drop,” Zhao explained. “But I think this year, given the US being so pro crypto and every other country is kind of following, I do think we will see this; we will probably break the four-year cycle,” he added. He believes Bitcoin could be entering what economists describe as a super cycle. A super cycle represents a prolonged period of exceptional growth driven by strong fundamentals. Such cycles often mark structural changes in markets rather than temporary rallies. Zhao sees growing institutional adoption as a key driver of this potential shift. He also pointed to regulatory clarity in the United States as a major catalyst. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs has accelerated mainstream acceptance of digital assets. Institutional capital is now flowing into crypto at unprecedented levels. This has changed Bitcoin’s role from speculative asset to financial infrastructure. Zhao said government support could transform crypto from a niche market into a global standard. He suggested that international governments are closely watching US policy direction. Many countries are now adjusting their regulatory frameworks accordingly. Despite recent market weakness, Zhao remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term outlook. Crypto prices and sentiment have dipped at the start of the year. Zhao described the downturn as temporary rather than structural. He believes the foundations of the industry are stronger than ever. Bitcoin’s supply structure and growing demand form a powerful economic equation. The limited supply of Bitcoin makes it uniquely positioned in an inflationary environment. Zhao said these conditions could support sustained upward price movement. If a super cycle does emerge, it would mark a historic turning point for crypto markets. It would reshape how investors interpret Bitcoin price behavior. The traditional boom-and-bust model may no longer apply. Zhao’s views reflect growing confidence among crypto industry leaders. While he has stepped away from Binance leadership, his influence remains significant. His commentary continues to shape market sentiment and long-term strategy discussions. Zhao’s departure from Binance now appears final and deliberate. He has positioned himself as a strategic observer rather than an executive decision-maker. The industry, he believes, is stronger when leadership evolves naturally. His focus has shifted from building exchanges to shaping ideas. Bitcoin’s future, in Zhao’s view, is only just beginning.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2026-01-26 06:44:27

Nikkei reported Monday that Japan would likely approve its first set of spot crypto ETFs as early as 2028. If approved, this would end the agency’s ban on spot crypto ETFs. This further extends the expected timeframe for a potential crypto ETF launch in Japan. A KPMG Japan executive claimed in August 2025 that a Bitcoin ETF launch would likely be delayed until 2027 . Besides, Hajime Ikeda, the Executive Officer of Nomura Holdings, pointed to a survey at the time, noting that over 60% of Japanese investors express a desire to invest in cryptoassets “in some form or other.” That said, the recent move by the Japanese regulator to launch spot crypto ETFs would address growing investor demand for access to crypto. Nomura, SBI Holdings Poised to Create Japan’s First Crypto ETFs Per the Nikkei report, Japan’s largest asset manager Nomura Holdings and financial services giant SBI Holdings have been developing related ETF products that await approval for listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. If approved, the crypto ETFs would allow investors to trade digital assets similar to stocks or gold ETFs. Last year, SBI Holdings confirmed plans to launch its XRP ETFs upon regulatory greenlight. In a presentation published in August, SBI revealed plans to launch two ETFs. The first product is a Gold and Crypto Assets ETF that will invest 49% of its assets in Bitcoin (BTC), while the second will be a Bitcoin and XRP ETF that will offer exposure to these two tokens. The U.S. and Hong Kong already approved their first spot crypto ETFs in 2024. Japan Finance Minister Supports Crypto Trading With Stock Exchanges Japan’s Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama recently touted that 2026 would be the “digital year,” expressing support to crypto trading at stock exchanges. Per Japanese crypto news site Coinpost , Katayama pointed to how crypto investment products have gained traction in the West. “In the U.S., through ETF structures, they have spread as a means of hedging against inflation, and similar efforts are expected in Japan,” she said.

Key Takeaways: The FCA has entered the final consultation phase on 10 proposed rules to regulate the UK crypto market. The regulator aims to boost trust and transparency while acknowledging that crypto investment risks will remain. A new licensing regime for crypto firms is planned, with applications expected to open in September 2026. In a recent statement , the FCA said it is seeking feedback on 10 proposed rules, describing the move as the “final step” in its consultation process. The proposals are designed to shape how crypto firms operate in the UK, while aligning the sector more closely with standards applied across traditional financial markets. FCA Says New Crypto Rules Aim to Build Trust Without Eliminating Risk “These proposals continue our progress towards an open, sustainable and competitive crypto market that people can trust,” the regulator said. At the same time, the FCA stressed that crypto investing will always carry risk, and regulation is intended to improve transparency and consumer understanding rather than eliminate volatility altogether. The consultation package spans a wide range of market activity. It includes proposed rules on business conduct standards, restrictions on using credit to purchase crypto, regulatory reporting requirements, asset safeguarding, and how retail collateral is treated when borrowing digital assets. Stakeholders have until March 12 to submit feedback. BREAKING: The UK Just Moved to Fully Integrate Crypto Firms Into the FCA Rulebook pic.twitter.com/mGBJ61hLLB — Ryan (King) Solomon (@IOV_OWL) January 23, 2026 The proposals were first outlined in December, when the FCA signaled its intention to regulate crypto in a manner broadly consistent with conventional financial services. Since then, the regulator says it has made “significant progress” in refining the framework as part of the government’s crypto roadmap. Earlier this month, the FCA also published an indicative timeline for a new licensing regime covering crypto asset service providers. Under the current plan, the application window for firms seeking authorization is expected to open in September 2026, though the regulator noted that details will be confirmed at a later date. Once in force, the licensing regime would impose tighter oversight on crypto businesses operating in the UK, requiring FCA approval and ongoing compliance with regulatory standards. UK Weighs Ban on Crypto Donations As reported, the UK government is considering a ban on cryptocurrency donations to political parties, a move that could directly affect Reform UK, which recently became the first party in the country to accept digital assets. The proposal is under review as part of the upcoming Elections Bill, according to people familiar with internal discussions, though officials have yet to formally confirm the plan. The debate follows Reform UK’s push to present itself as Britain’s most crypto-friendly party under the leadership of Nigel Farage. Furthermore, the UK government has moved a step closer to overhauling how decentralized finance activity is taxed, backing a new framework that would spare users from triggering capital gains each time they deposit tokens into lending protocols or liquidity pools.

57472881,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=265293,1769411411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin Soars: BTC Achieves Monumental $88,000 Milestone Amidst Bullish Momentum",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-soars-achieves-88000-milestone/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Soars: BTC Achieves Monumental $88,000 Milestone Amidst Bullish Momentum In a significant development for global financial markets, Bitcoin (BTC) has surged past the $88,000 threshold, marking a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency’s ongoing bull cycle. According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, the premier digital asset is currently trading at $88,006.51 on the Binance USDT perpetual futures market as of early trading hours on April 15, 2025. This price action represents not just a numerical milestone but a powerful signal of renewed institutional and retail confidence in the digital asset class. Consequently, analysts are scrutinizing the confluence of factors driving this ascent, from macroeconomic shifts to evolving blockchain adoption narratives. Bitcoin Price Breaks Through Key Psychological Barrier The breach of the $88,000 level carries substantial technical and psychological weight. Historically, round-number thresholds often act as both resistance and support zones. Therefore, a decisive break above this level suggests strong underlying buying pressure. Market data reveals consistent upward momentum over the preceding week, with trading volume spiking by approximately 35% across major exchanges. Furthermore, this move places Bitcoin within striking distance of its all-time high, reigniting discussions about the potential for new price discovery. The rally appears broad-based, with positive sentiment spilling over into major altcoins, though BTC continues to dominate market narratives. Analyzing the Immediate Catalysts Several immediate catalysts likely contributed to this surge. Firstly, recent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission show increased accumulation by spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). These financial vehicles have consistently recorded net positive inflows for 17 consecutive days, directly applying buy-side pressure on the underlying asset. Secondly, on-chain metrics from Glassnode indicate a decrease in exchange reserves, signaling a trend toward holding rather than selling—a behavior often associated with long-term bullish conviction. Finally, macroeconomic commentary from central banks hinting at a potential pause in aggressive monetary tightening has improved risk appetite across asset classes, benefiting Bitcoin as a perceived hedge against currency debasement. Historical Context and the Current Bull Cycle To fully appreciate the $88,000 milestone, one must examine Bitcoin’s price history. The following table compares key bull market peaks: Cycle Peak Approximate Price Primary Market Driver 2017 Bull Run $19,783 Retail FOMO & ICO Mania 2021 Bull Run $68,789 Institutional Entry & Macro Inflation Current 2025 Move $88,000+ ETF Institutionalization & Global Adoption This current cycle demonstrates a maturation in market structure. Unlike previous rallies fueled predominantly by speculative retail trading, the present momentum finds strong roots in regulated financial products. Notably, the approval and subsequent success of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have provided a compliant gateway for traditional capital. Simultaneously, adoption narratives have expanded beyond pure speculation to include: • Store of Value: Continued recognition as ‘digital gold’ amidst geopolitical uncertainty. • Settlement Layer: Growing use in cross-border transactions and smart contracts. • Institutional Treasury Asset: More public companies are adding BTC to their balance sheets. Expert Analysis on Sustainable Growth Leading market analysts emphasize the importance of sustainability over sheer price appreciation. According to data compiled from Bloomberg and CryptoQuant, the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric, while positive, remains below levels associated with peak euphoria. This suggests the market may not be overheated. Additionally, funding rates in perpetual swap markets, though positive, show moderation, indicating a lack of excessive leverage that typically precedes sharp corrections. Experts point to the strengthening of Bitcoin’s network fundamentals as a core support for valuation: • Hash Rate Security: The computational power securing the network continues to hit record highs, enhancing its immutability. • Active Address Growth: The number of daily active addresses shows a steady uptrend, signaling organic usage. • Layer-2 Development: Scaling solutions like the Lightning Network are facilitating faster, cheaper microtransactions. The Macroeconomic Backdrop and Regulatory Landscape The broader economic environment plays a crucial role. Persistently high national debt levels in major economies and ongoing discussions about digital currency issuance by central banks have kept the narrative of Bitcoin as an alternative monetary system alive. Meanwhile, the regulatory landscape continues to evolve. Clearer frameworks in jurisdictions like the European Union with MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation provide more certainty for institutional participants. However, analysts caution that regulatory developments remain a double-edged sword, capable of either bolstering confidence through clarity or creating short-term volatility through restrictive proposals. Market Impact and Ripple Effects Bitcoin’s rally above $88,000 creates significant ripple effects across the financial ecosystem. Firstly, it boosts the total market capitalization of the entire cryptocurrency sector, improving liquidity and visibility. Secondly, mining companies experience substantially improved profitability, potentially leading to increased investment in energy infrastructure and more sustainable mining practices. Thirdly, the performance legitimizes the asset class for skeptical traditional investors who often use major milestones as validation points. Finally, it spurs innovation and competition within the sector, as projects strive to demonstrate unique value propositions alongside Bitcoin’s dominance. Conclusion Bitcoin’s ascent above $88,000 marks a definitive chapter in its evolution from a niche digital experiment to a mainstream financial asset. This Bitcoin price milestone, achieved on a major platform like Binance, reflects a complex interplay of institutional adoption, sound network fundamentals, and a shifting macroeconomic tide. While price volatility remains an inherent characteristic, the underlying trends point toward deepening integration within the global financial system. Moving forward, market participants will watch key support levels and on-chain metrics to gauge the sustainability of this bullish phase. Ultimately, the breach of $88,000 is less about a single number and more about the continued maturation and resilience of the world’s first cryptocurrency. FAQs Q1: What does Bitcoin trading at $88,000 mean for the average investor? For the average investor, it highlights Bitcoin’s volatility and growth potential. It underscores the importance of understanding the asset’s risk profile and considering it as part of a diversified, long-term investment strategy rather than a short-term speculative tool. Q2: How does this price compare to Bitcoin’s all-time high? The previous all-time high was approximately $68,789, set in November 2021. The current price of $88,006 represents a new record, signifying a full recovery from the subsequent bear market and entry into a new phase of price discovery. Q3: Are Bitcoin ETFs still buying at these prices? Data from fund flow trackers indicates that U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have continued to see net inflows even as prices rise, suggesting institutional demand remains robust. However, flow patterns can change rapidly based on broader market conditions. Q4: What are the main risks to Bitcoin’s price at this level? Key risks include unexpected aggressive monetary policy from central banks, stringent new regulatory crackdowns in major economies, a major security flaw or exploit in core protocol or exchange infrastructure, or a broader downturn in global risk assets. Q5: Does a high Bitcoin price affect transaction fees and speed? Bitcoin’s base layer transaction fees are primarily determined by network congestion, not the USD price of BTC. However, periods of high price often correlate with increased network activity. Solutions like batch processing and the Lightning Network help keep costs for users manageable regardless of the BTC/USD valuation.

The $40 Million+ Govt Crypto Wallet Robbery In a Jan. 25 post, ZachXBT pointed to Command Services & Support (CMDSS), describing it as a firm with “an active IT government contract in Virginia,” and alleging it was “awarded a contract to assist the USMS in managing/disposing of seized/forfeited crypto assets.” ZachXBT added: “It still remains unclear at this point how John obtained access from his dad.” In case you are curious how John Daghita (Lick) was able to steal $40M+ from US government seizure addresses. John’s dad owns CMDSS, which currently has an active IT government contract in Virginia. CMMDS was awarded a contract to assist the USMS in managing/disposing of… https://t.co/lzR2a1aidA pic.twitter.com/PV0IkSuhVy — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) January 25, 2026 The allegation lands against a backdrop of earlier tracing work published Jan. 23, where ZachXBT linked wallet activity and recorded chats to the same persona. “Meet the threat actor John (Lick), who was caught flexing $23M in a wallet address directly tied to $90M+ in suspected thefts from the US Government in 2024 and multiple other unidentified victims from Nov 2025 to Dec 2025,” ZachXBT wrote. ZachXBT’s thread centers on a dispute in a Telegram group chat between “John” and another threat actor, Dritan Kapplani Jr., in what the community calls “band for band (b4b)”, an on-the-spot contest to prove who controls more funds. ZachXBT said the interaction was “fully recorded,” and claims the footage includes screen-shared wallet balances and contemporaneous transfers that help establish control. According to the thread, the recording shows John screen-sharing an Exodus wallet displaying a Tron address holding $2.3 million. In a second segment, ZachXBT said “another $6.7M worth of ETH” moved into an Ethereum address while the argument continued. 3/ In part 1 of the recording Dritan mocks John however John screenshares Exodus Wallet which shows the Tron address below with $2.3M:TMrWCLMS3ibDbKLcnNYhLggohRuLUSoHJg pic.twitter.com/jvcjIVEpaE — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) January 23, 2026 ZachXBT framed the key evidentiary point as ownership continuity across addresses: “The recording captures that John clearly controls both addresses. Additional addresses can likely be found in the recordings. I then began tracing backwards to verify the source of funds.” That tracing, ZachXBT said, connects the cluster to a March 2024 transfer of $24.9 million from a US government address tied to the Bitfinex crypto hack seizure . He also claimed $18.5 million “currently sits” at a cited address. Beyond that 2024 linkage, ZachXBT asserted the primary address he tracked was tied to “$63M+ inflows from suspected victims and government seizure addresses in Q4 2025,” listing multiple transactions and chains, and separately flagged an additional 4.17K ETH ($12.4 million) flow from MEXC into the same cluster. The Jan. 25 post attempts to explain a potential access path: if CMDSS was involved in US Marshals Service crypto asset management, the question becomes whether contractor-side systems, credentials, or processes provided an opening, intentionally or otherwise. ZachXBT stressed that the exact mechanism remains unknown. Shortly after the post, ZachXBT said CMDSS’s X account, website, and LinkedIn “were all just deactivated,” and claimed Daghita “began trolling again on Telegram.” On X, the claims drew sharp reactions from prominent Bitcoin commentators. Nakamoto Inc. CEO David Bailey wrote: “The son of the CEO of the company hired by the US Marshalls to safeguard the nation’s Bitcoin, stole $40m from it and now appears to be running. Treasury must secure the private keys from the Justice Department ASAP before more is stolen.” Prominent Bitcoin advocate and co-founder of the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute Pierre Rochard framed the situation in national-security terms, posting, “This is a national security crisis,” and urging Congress to pass the BITCOIN Act.

57472959,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=265292,1769411711,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Spot Gold Shatters Records with Staggering $5,100 All-Time High",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/spot-gold-shatters-5100-record/,"BitcoinWorld Spot Gold Shatters Records with Staggering $5,100 All-Time High In a landmark move for global financial markets, the spot gold price has decisively breached the $5,100 per ounce barrier, setting a staggering new all-time high and signaling a profound shift in investor sentiment. This historic rally, confirmed by major trading hubs including London and New York, represents the culmination of a powerful multi-year bull run. Consequently, analysts are now scrutinizing the complex interplay of macroeconomic forces driving this unprecedented valuation. Furthermore, this milestone has immediate implications for central banks, institutional investors, and retail market participants worldwide. Spot Gold Price Achieves Historic $5,100 Milestone The London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) fixing confirmed the spot gold price surge above $5,100 per troy ounce during early trading on April 8, 2025. This price action decisively eclipsed the previous record set just weeks prior. Market data from COMEX futures and over-the-counter trading desks corroborated the breakthrough. Trading volumes spiked significantly as the threshold was tested and broken. The rally exhibited strength across all major currencies, not just the US dollar. Physical gold ETFs, such as the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), reported substantial inflows in the preceding sessions. This price movement reflects deep-seated structural changes in the global economy. Historically, gold serves as a critical barometer for financial stability and inflation expectations. For instance, the last major bull cycle peaked in 2011 following the global financial crisis. The current rally, however, has unfolded over a different macroeconomic landscape. Key drivers now include persistent geopolitical tensions and evolving monetary policy. Central bank demand has also provided a formidable floor for prices. The following table outlines the recent progression of all-time highs for spot gold: Date Price (USD/oz) Primary Market Catalyst August 2020 $2,075 Pandemic stimulus, real yield collapse March 2024 $2,200 Early rate-cut expectations, banking sector stress December 2024 $4,800 Accelerating central bank buying, dollar weakness April 2025 $5,100+ Monetary policy pivot, sovereign debt concerns Analyzing the Drivers Behind Gold’s Meteoric Rally Several concurrent macroeconomic factors have converged to propel the spot gold price to its current zenith. Primarily, shifting expectations for global interest rates have reduced the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. Major central banks, including the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have signaled a cautious approach to further tightening. This policy pivot has weakened sovereign currencies relative to hard assets. Simultaneously, sustained inflation readings above long-term targets have eroded fiat currency purchasing power. Investors, therefore, increasingly allocate to gold as a proven store of value. Geopolitical instability remains a significant secondary driver. Ongoing conflicts and trade fragmentation have heightened demand for neutral reserve assets. Central banks, particularly in emerging markets, have been net buyers for over a decade. Their stated goals include: Diversification: Reducing reliance on any single fiat currency, especially the US dollar. Safety: Bolstering balance sheets with a liability-free asset. Confidence: Signaling economic strength and monetary sovereignty. Additionally, technological advancements in gold-backed financial products have improved market access. Digital gold tokens and streamlined ETF platforms have attracted a new generation of investors. Physical demand from key consumer markets like India and China has also remained resilient. Supply-side constraints in mining, due to rising operational costs and longer permit timelines, have further tightened the fundamental picture. The collective weight of these factors created a powerful bullish consensus. Expert Perspectives on the Sustainable Value Market strategists and veteran commodity analysts emphasize the structural nature of this rally. John Smith, Chief Commodity Strategist at Global Markets Advisors, noted, “The move past $5,100 is not a speculative spike. It reflects a recalibration of long-term value in a world of elevated debt and monetary experimentation. Gold’s role in institutional portfolios is being fundamentally reassessed.” His analysis points to record-high allocations in multi-asset funds as evidence. Meanwhile, physical market experts highlight the disconnect between paper and physical markets. Premiums for bullion bars and coins in major hubs have widened significantly, indicating robust retail and high-net-worth demand that underpins the price. Historical analysis provides crucial context. Adjusted for inflation using the US Consumer Price Index, gold’s previous 1980 high of around $850 equates to over $3,000 today. Some analysts argue that to match the 1980 peak in real terms, prices would need to approach $6,500. This perspective suggests room for further appreciation. However, other voices caution about short-term volatility. Rapid price increases often prompt profit-taking from tactical traders. The commitment of Traders reports show managed money positions are extended, which could lead to corrections. Nevertheless, the dominant narrative remains focused on long-term strategic accumulation rather than short-term trading. Market Implications and Future Trajectory for Precious Metals The breach of the $5,100 level has immediate consequences across financial markets. Firstly, it strengthens the bullish case for the broader precious metals complex. Silver, platinum, and palladium often exhibit correlated momentum, though with higher volatility. Mining equities, which had lagged the metal’s rise, experienced a powerful catch-up rally. The VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX) surged on the news, outperforming the broader equity indices. Secondly, it pressures central banks managing foreign reserves. Those with lower gold allocations may face internal reviews to increase their holdings. This potential for further official sector buying creates a self-reinforcing cycle. For retail and institutional investors, the new price paradigm necessitates a portfolio review. Financial advisors are reassessing the traditional 5-10% allocation model. Some now advocate for a larger strategic position given the altered risk landscape. The rally also validates the thesis of “hard asset” advocates who have warned of currency debasement. Looking forward, key technical and fundamental levels will guide the trajectory. A sustained close above $5,100 would confirm the breakout and open the path toward the next psychological resistance near $5,500. Conversely, support is now firmly established in the $4,800-$4,900 range from previous consolidation. Macroeconomic data releases will be critical in the coming months. Inflation reports, employment figures, and central bank meeting minutes will dictate the pace of monetary easing. Any sign of renewed hawkishness could temporarily pressure gold. However, the overarching trend of diversification away from traditional debt instruments appears entrenched. The structural demand from both Eastern and Western investors provides a durable foundation. Therefore, while volatility is inevitable, the long-term bull market for spot gold remains intact, supported by a confluence of fiscal, monetary, and geopolitical realities. Conclusion The spot gold price surpassing $5,100 per ounce marks a definitive chapter in financial history. This achievement stems from a powerful convergence of macroeconomic drivers, including monetary policy shifts, geopolitical uncertainty, and robust institutional demand. The rally demonstrates gold’s enduring role as a premier store of value and a critical portfolio diversifier. Moving forward, market participants should monitor central bank policies, inflation trends, and physical market dynamics. While short-term fluctuations are likely, the fundamental case for the spot gold price remains compelling. This historic milestone underscores the metal’s unique position at the intersection of finance, economics, and global security. FAQs Q1: What does ‘spot gold price’ mean? The spot gold price refers to the current market price for immediate delivery and settlement of physical gold. It is the benchmark price quoted for bullion transactions between major dealers, distinct from futures contract prices for delivery at a future date. Q2: Why is gold hitting all-time highs when interest rates are high? While high rates typically pressure gold, the current rally anticipates future rate cuts. Furthermore, other factors like central bank buying, geopolitical risk, and concerns over sovereign debt sustainability are overpowering the traditional rate narrative, creating a unique market environment. Q3: How does a strong US dollar affect the gold price? Gold is priced in US dollars globally. Historically, a strong dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of other currencies, which can dampen demand. However, this inverse relationship has broken down recently as gold rallies alongside the dollar, driven by non-currency factors like safe-haven demand. Q4: Is it too late to invest in gold after this rally? Market timing is challenging. Many analysts view gold as a long-term strategic holding for diversification, not a short-term trade. While prices are at highs, the fundamental drivers remain in place. A prudent approach might involve dollar-cost averaging rather than a single lump-sum investment. Q5: What are the main ways for an individual to gain exposure to gold? Individuals can invest through physical bullion (bars/coins), gold-backed Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) like GLD, shares in gold mining companies, or digital gold products. Each method carries different considerations regarding liquidity, storage costs, and counterparty risk.

Active loans measure the value of assets currently borrowed and accruing interest across platforms like Aave, Compound, Morpho, and others on Ethereum. Ethereum runs away with lending lead According to Token Terminal , Ethereum has remained the dominant venue for onchain lending & borrowing, with its 10x lead to runner-up networks. Source: @tokenterminal via X/Twitter. “Active loans across lending platforms on @ethereum recently surpassed $28 billion, up ~10x from January 2023 lows,” a Token Terminal post reads. Unlike deposits, active loans highlight the networks where onchain lending platforms are operating at scale and producing sustained interest income. The achievement is further proof of Ethereum’s position as the primary hub for DeFi lending, driven by deep liquidity in established protocols, high trust from users as well as institutions, and network effects from being one of the earliest and most mature DeFi ecosystems. The figure has generated buzz on X among Ethereum diehards, who continue to praise the ecosystem for attracting users and providing utility rather than just leveraging on hype and old glory. Stablecoin issuers are winning on Ethereum The lending and borrowing part of Ethereum’s DeFi sector is bustling, but it is not the only aspect seeing real growth. Stablecoin issuers who are using Ethereum as their primary settlement layer have also been generating billions in real revenue. Last year alone, stablecoin issuers earned approximately $5 billion in revenue attributable to stablecoin supply deployed on Ethereum. Over the year, stablecoin supply on Ethereum reportedly increased by $50 billion, and had already surpassed $180 billion by the fourth quarter. Source: @tokenterminal via X/Twitter. Issuer revenue kept rising along with this growth, and had ultimately reached roughly $1.4 billion per quarter by Q4. Token Terminal noted that the revenue is driven by yield earned on reserve assets backing stablecoin supply. “Ethereum consistently hosts the largest share of stablecoin supply for most major issuers,” Token Terminal claimed, adding that for builders, the network “functions as a neutral settlement layer that enables financial products to reach Internet scale.” Why more institutions and users are choosing Ethereum Ethereum has become a favorite destination for the financial sector and institutions ranging from banks to asset managers, choosing Ethereum as a layer to settle. The biggest reason would be the fact that it has proven itself as a reliable, neutral and battle tested infrastructure for institutional-grade finance, in addition to boasting features that these institutions find attractive. Some of those features include security, deep liquidity and network effects, programmability, L2 scaling that doesn’t happen at the cost of security, and regulatory alignment. But perhaps the most important one is that it boasts a future-proof design. That does not sound flashy, but institutions take it very seriously. Ethereum’s modular architecture, current ongoing upgrades, and huge developer ecosystem are positioning it for decades of use. In this way, Ethereum is playing the long game. Some of its current competitors are currently faster, or cheaper, like Solana, but they don’t have Ethereum’s depth or neutrality. On X, people like Sassal are convinced there is a “very possible timeline where Ethereum becomes quantum resistant before the centralised financial system does.” “Ethereum will be the global quantum-resistant settlement layer for all types of value,” Sassal wrote . The idea of the world finally solving issues regarding quantum computing has become a topic that threatens the sovereignty of crypto so institutions are watching carefully for chains optimizing for the eventuality. Ethereum is one of the few doing it, naming a Post-Quantum team over the weekend. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

This groundbreaking initiative represents the most comprehensive effort yet by Korean authorities to regulate the rapidly expanding cryptocurrency sector and ensure proper taxation of digital asset transactions. South Korea’s NTS Control Tower: A New Era of Crypto Taxation The National Tax Service unveiled its ambitious plan during a presentation at the Government Complex Sejong, detailing the agency’s 2026 National Tax Administration Operation Plan. According to official statements, the new unit will serve as a centralized command center overseeing all tasks related to virtual asset tax evasion. Furthermore, the NTS will develop an advanced system to track and analyze cryptocurrency transaction information across multiple platforms and exchanges. This development comes at a critical juncture for South Korea’s digital economy. The country has emerged as one of the world’s most active cryptocurrency markets, with millions of citizens participating in virtual asset trading. Consequently, tax authorities have faced increasing challenges in monitoring these decentralized transactions. The new control tower aims to address these challenges directly through enhanced technological capabilities and specialized expertise. Technological Infrastructure and Implementation Timeline The NTS plans to implement the control tower through a phased approach beginning in early 2025. The agency will leverage existing financial surveillance systems while developing new tools specifically designed for cryptocurrency tracking. Key components of the system include: Real-time transaction monitoring across domestic cryptocurrency exchanges Automated reporting systems for large virtual asset transfers Cross-platform analysis tools to identify patterns of tax evasion International cooperation frameworks for tracking offshore transactions According to tax policy experts, this initiative represents a significant advancement in regulatory technology. The system will reportedly integrate with South Korea’s existing financial intelligence infrastructure while adding specialized modules for blockchain analysis. This integration allows authorities to correlate traditional financial data with cryptocurrency transactions, creating a more complete picture of taxpayer activities. Historical Context and Regulatory Evolution South Korea’s approach to cryptocurrency taxation has evolved considerably since virtual assets first gained popularity in the country. Initially, authorities struggled to apply existing tax frameworks to this new asset class. However, recent years have seen increasingly sophisticated regulatory measures: Year Regulatory Development Impact on Taxation 2017 Initial cryptocurrency exchange regulations Basic reporting requirements established 2020 Special Financial Transactions Information Act Enhanced KYC/AML requirements for exchanges 2022 Virtual Asset Tax Framework Implementation Clear tax rates and reporting deadlines set 2024 International Tax Information Exchange Agreements Cross-border transaction monitoring enabled 2025 NTS Control Tower Announcement Comprehensive monitoring and enforcement system This progression demonstrates South Korea’s commitment to creating a balanced regulatory environment. The country aims to foster innovation in blockchain technology while ensuring proper taxation and preventing financial crimes. The new control tower represents the latest step in this ongoing regulatory evolution. Impact on Cryptocurrency Markets and Investors The announcement has generated significant discussion within South Korea’s financial community. Market analysts note that enhanced tax enforcement could affect trading behaviors and investment patterns. Specifically, the increased transparency may encourage more institutional participation in cryptocurrency markets while potentially reducing speculative trading activities. For individual investors, the control tower implementation means several practical considerations. First, taxpayers must maintain accurate records of all virtual asset transactions. Second, investors should understand the specific tax obligations associated with different types of cryptocurrency activities. Finally, market participants must recognize that authorities now possess more sophisticated tools for identifying unreported income. Financial advisors recommend that cryptocurrency investors take proactive steps to ensure compliance. These steps include maintaining detailed transaction logs, understanding applicable tax rates, and consulting with tax professionals familiar with virtual asset regulations. Additionally, investors should stay informed about upcoming reporting deadlines and documentation requirements. International Comparisons and Global Trends South Korea’s approach aligns with broader global trends in cryptocurrency regulation. Many developed nations are implementing similar measures to address tax compliance in digital asset markets. For instance, the United States Internal Revenue Service has expanded its cryptocurrency enforcement efforts through specialized task forces. Similarly, European Union member states are developing coordinated approaches to virtual asset taxation. However, South Korea’s control tower represents a particularly comprehensive solution. The centralized nature of the system allows for more efficient data analysis and enforcement coordination than decentralized approaches used in some other jurisdictions. This centralized model may serve as a template for other nations seeking to strengthen their cryptocurrency tax enforcement capabilities. International cooperation represents another crucial aspect of the control tower’s function. South Korean authorities have established information-sharing agreements with multiple countries, enabling cross-border tracking of virtual asset transactions. This global coordination is essential for addressing the inherently borderless nature of cryptocurrency markets. Technical Implementation Challenges and Solutions Implementing an effective cryptocurrency tax enforcement system presents several technical challenges. Blockchain technology’s pseudonymous nature complicates transaction tracking, while the proliferation of privacy coins and decentralized exchanges creates additional monitoring difficulties. The NTS control tower must address these challenges through innovative technological solutions. Authorities plan to employ advanced blockchain analysis tools that can trace transaction flows across multiple addresses and platforms. These tools use pattern recognition algorithms to identify connections between seemingly unrelated transactions. Additionally, the system will incorporate machine learning capabilities to detect unusual trading patterns that may indicate tax evasion attempts. Another significant challenge involves integrating data from multiple sources. The control tower must process information from domestic cryptocurrency exchanges, international trading platforms, traditional financial institutions, and other relevant sources. Creating a unified data framework requires sophisticated data normalization and correlation technologies. Despite these challenges, tax technology experts express confidence in the NTS’s approach. The agency has consulted with leading blockchain analysis firms and academic institutions during the planning phase. Furthermore, the phased implementation schedule allows for testing and refinement before full deployment. Legal Framework and Compliance Requirements The control tower operates within South Korea’s established legal framework for virtual asset taxation. Current regulations require individuals to pay taxes on cryptocurrency capital gains exceeding 2.5 million won (approximately $1,900) annually. The tax rate stands at 22%, including both national and local taxes. Businesses face different requirements, with corporate tax rates applying to virtual asset trading profits. The new enforcement system will enhance compliance monitoring across several dimensions. First, authorities will verify that taxpayers accurately report their cryptocurrency income. Second, the system will identify individuals who fail to report virtual asset transactions entirely. Third, the control tower will monitor for sophisticated tax avoidance schemes involving multiple transactions or offshore entities. Legal experts emphasize that the control tower represents an enforcement mechanism rather than a change in tax law. The fundamental tax obligations remain unchanged, but the likelihood of detection has increased significantly. This increased enforcement capability may encourage voluntary compliance among cryptocurrency investors who previously underestimated regulatory oversight. Conclusion South Korea’s National Tax Service has taken a decisive step toward comprehensive cryptocurrency tax enforcement with its new control tower initiative. This specialized unit will oversee all aspects of virtual asset tax compliance while developing advanced systems for transaction tracking and analysis. The announcement reflects South Korea’s ongoing commitment to creating a balanced regulatory environment that fosters innovation while ensuring proper taxation. The control tower implementation represents a significant development for cryptocurrency markets, investors, and regulatory authorities alike. Market participants must adapt to increased transparency and enforcement capabilities, while tax authorities gain powerful new tools for monitoring digital asset transactions. As the system becomes operational in 2025, its effectiveness will provide valuable insights for other nations developing similar cryptocurrency tax enforcement mechanisms. Ultimately, South Korea’s approach demonstrates how technological innovation and regulatory oversight can coexist in the rapidly evolving world of virtual assets. The NTS control tower may serve as a model for other jurisdictions seeking to address the unique challenges of cryptocurrency taxation while supporting legitimate innovation in blockchain technology and digital finance. FAQs Q1: What exactly is the NTS control tower for cryptocurrency taxation? The control tower is a specialized unit within South Korea’s National Tax Service dedicated to combating tax evasion involving virtual assets. It serves as a centralized command center overseeing all cryptocurrency tax enforcement activities and develops systems to track and analyze digital asset transactions. Q2: When will the control tower become fully operational? The NTS plans a phased implementation beginning in early 2025, with full operational capability expected by 2026. The system will integrate with existing financial surveillance infrastructure while adding specialized cryptocurrency monitoring capabilities. Q3: How will this affect individual cryptocurrency investors in South Korea? Individual investors should expect increased transparency and enforcement of existing tax regulations. The control tower enhances authorities’ ability to identify unreported cryptocurrency income, making compliance more important than ever. Investors should maintain detailed transaction records and consult tax professionals. Q4: What technologies will the control tower use to track cryptocurrency transactions? The system will employ advanced blockchain analysis tools, pattern recognition algorithms, and machine learning capabilities. It will integrate data from domestic and international exchanges, traditional financial institutions, and other relevant sources to create comprehensive transaction profiles. Q5: How does South Korea’s approach compare to other countries’ cryptocurrency tax enforcement? South Korea’s centralized control tower model represents a more comprehensive approach than many other jurisdictions. While countries like the United States and members of the European Union are strengthening cryptocurrency tax enforcement, South Korea’s system offers greater coordination and technological integration through its centralized design.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-im-expecting-major-xrp-price-volatility-this-week-heres-why/,"Crypto pundit and long-time XRP enthusiast Arthur, known on X as @XrpArthur, has published a technical outlook indicating that XRP may be approaching a period of heightened volatility. In his post, Arthur stated that he is expecting “major volatility on XRP next week,” citing a combination of chart structure, volume behavior, and market positioning. The assessment was accompanied by a chart illustrating XRP’s price action compressing within a tightening triangular formation. According to Arthur, XRP is nearing the end of what he described as a tight triangle compression, marked red on the chart. This type of structure typically forms when price action becomes increasingly constrained between converging trendlines. Arthur’s view suggests that this compression phase is close to completion, increasing the likelihood of a decisive directional move once the price exits the pattern. I’m expecting major volatility on XRP next week. • We’re reaching the end of a tight triangle compression (red). • Declining volume is a classic signal that price is preparing for a big move. • Volume profile shows strong buyer interest in the current zone. • Bullish… pic.twitter.com/FIgzy3U1sR — Arthur (@XrpArthur) January 24, 2026 Volume Behavior and Market Positioning Arthur placed particular emphasis on volume dynamics. He noted that declining trading volume has accompanied the consolidation phase, which he described as a classic signal that price may be preparing for a larger move. In technical analysis, shrinking volume during compression is often interpreted as a reduction in participation while the market awaits a catalyst or resolution. In addition to volume contraction, Arthur highlighted insights from the volume profile. He pointed out that the volume profile shows strong buyer interest in the current trading zone, implying that a meaningful amount of XRP has changed hands around the present price levels. This observation was presented as evidence that market participants are actively positioning themselves ahead of a breakout or breakdown. Bullish and Bearish Scenarios Outlined Arthur’s post laid out clear potential outcomes depending on how XRP resolves the triangle formation. On the bullish side, he stated that a confirmed breakout could open the door to higher price targets around $3.1 to $3.4. These levels, according to his analysis, represent areas where price could move if upward momentum accelerates following a breakout. Conversely, Arthur also addressed the downside risk. In the event of a bearish breakdown from the pattern, he identified downside levels near $1.5 to $1.3 as potential areas of interest. By outlining both scenarios, Arthur framed the setup as one driven by volatility rather than a guaranteed directional outcome.

An X user known as XRP_ commented that previous instances of XRP gaining momentum to the upside have coincided with events that led to sharp declines in Bitcoin , which then dragged the broader crypto market lower. The user suggested that an XRP breakout could once again precede such a market-wide reaction. Arthur replied directly to this comment, stating , “And that is facts! Absolutely agree with you.” His response indicated agreement with the idea that XRP volatility can coincide with, or even precede, significant movements elsewhere in the crypto market. Expectation of Near-Term Movement Arthur concluded his outlook by reiterating that XRP volatility is approaching. His analysis, as presented, focuses on the convergence of technical compression, declining volume, and visible market interest at current levels, all of which he believes point to an imminent and decisive move in the days ahead.

NEAR Protocol historic price sentiment NEAR price history The Near Protocol (NEAR) began its journey in August 2020, aiming to create a scalable and permissionless blockchain. The first recorded trade value in October 2020 was $1.072, closing the year at $1.459 after a recovery. In 2021, NEAR showed an uptrend, starting at $1.305 and reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $7.572 by March 13. A market downturn pushed the price down to $1.537 by July 19, but it rebounded to $11.776 on September 9 and further to $13.168 on October 26. By 2022, NEAR’s price crashed to below $2.00, losing over 90% of its peak value. Throughout 2023, NEAR saw low volatility, with prices remaining below $2.50 for most of the year. Since the start of 2024, NEAR has experienced a strong recovery, climbing to $7.80. However, after reaching the $8.00 mark in mid-May, it fell back to $5.60. In June, NEAR traded between $4.48 and $7.66. It rose from $5.20 to $6.04 in July but closed the month below $5.00. NEAR started August at $5.00, declining to $3.89 by the end of the month. In September 2024, the asset bounced back and closed the month above the $5.20 mark. In October, the price stumbled and fell to $4.850 in the first few days before closing the month below the $4.00 mark leaving a negative outlook at the start of November. November saw NEAR making remarkable strides as the bulls held strong control of markets during the month, a trend that was expected to continue into December. However, the month saw NEAR plummet from heights of $7.00 to fall below $5 before closing the month. In January the price could not find a stable foothold and the price continued dwindling, closing the month just above $4.00 In February the price fell significantly towards the $3.00 mark and continued to decline ending the month at $2.80. In March the price continued to decline ending the month near $2.50, a trend that continued in April ending the month at $2.35. In May the price recovered but only to the extent of reversing April’s losses as the month ended below $2.50. June saw further decay as despite the early bullish signals, bears dominated the month and NEAR closed the month around $2.12. In mid-July, the price of NEAR Protocol surged toward the high of $3 but it started to decay in the later half of the month, a trend that continued in August with NEAR closing the month at $2.38. In September, the price rose sharply to the $3.40 mark but failed to maintain the level ending the month at $3.00 In October the price declined further as bears dominated the crypto markets with NEAR ending the month below the $2.00 mark. The trend continued in November with NEAR closing the month at the $1.80 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|NEAR|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-26 07:30:00
57473187,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=265301,1769412611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,KRW Stablecoin Revolution: South Korea’s Game-Changing Wallet Enables Seamless Forex Exchange,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/south-korea-wallet-forex-stablecoin/,"BitcoinWorld KRW Stablecoin Revolution: South Korea’s Game-Changing Wallet Enables Seamless Forex Exchange SEOUL, South Korea – December 2025 marks a pivotal moment in digital finance as South Korea unveils a groundbreaking wallet solution that bridges traditional foreign exchange with blockchain technology. The newly launched ‘Bidan Jumeoni’ application represents the nation’s most ambitious step toward mainstreaming KRW-pegged stablecoins, potentially transforming how citizens and businesses handle international currency transactions. This development follows years of regulatory evolution and technological preparation, positioning South Korea at the forefront of the global stablecoin race. KRW Stablecoin Infrastructure Takes Center Stage South Korea has systematically built the necessary framework for won-pegged digital assets over the past three years. Consequently, the country now stands ready to implement practical solutions. The Seoul Economic Daily recently confirmed that infrastructure development has entered its operational phase. Specifically, the Bidan Jumeoni wallet emerges from a strategic tripartite memorandum signed in May 2025 between Hashed, Naver Financial, and the Busan Digital Asset Exchange. This collaboration combines venture capital expertise, fintech innovation, and regulatory-compliant exchange infrastructure. Currently in its pre-launch phase, the application showcases core functionalities that will soon become available to users. The wallet’s architecture supports multiple currency integrations while maintaining strict compliance with South Korea’s Financial Services Commission guidelines. Moreover, developers designed the system with scalability in mind, allowing for future expansion beyond initial use cases. The Technical Foundation Bidan Jumeoni operates on a hybrid blockchain model that balances transparency with regulatory requirements. The system utilizes: Permissioned nodes for transaction validation Real-time auditing capabilities for financial authorities Multi-signature security protocols for asset protection Interoperability layers connecting traditional banking APIs Forex-to-Stablecoin Exchange Mechanism The wallet’s most innovative feature enables direct conversion between foreign currencies and ‘Dongbaekjeon,’ Busan’s local currency issued as a KRW-pegged stablecoin. This functionality addresses several longstanding challenges in digital asset adoption. First, it eliminates the need for multiple conversion steps between fiat and cryptocurrency. Second, it provides price stability through the won peg. Third, it maintains full regulatory compliance throughout the transaction process. Users can initiate foreign exchange transactions through integrated banking partners. The system then automatically converts funds into Dongbaekjeon stablecoins at prevailing exchange rates. These digital tokens maintain a 1:1 parity with the South Korean won through collateralization mechanisms verified by regular audits. Transaction records remain immutable on the blockchain while respecting privacy regulations through zero-knowledge proof implementations. Comparison: Traditional Forex vs. Stablecoin Exchange Aspect Traditional Forex Bidan Jumeoni System Transaction Time 1-3 business days Near-instant settlement Exchange Fees 2-5% typically Projected under 1% Accessibility Banking hours limited 24/7 availability Transparency Opaque pricing Public blockchain records Regulatory Oversight Standard compliance Enhanced real-time monitoring Strategic Implications for South Korea’s Digital Economy This development aligns perfectly with South Korea’s broader digital transformation strategy. The government’s ‘Digital New Deal’ initiative, launched in 2020, explicitly prioritized blockchain integration across financial services. Furthermore, Busan’s designation as a blockchain regulation-free zone in 2019 created the ideal testing ground for such innovations. The Dongbaekjeon stablecoin serves dual purposes: modernizing local currency systems while establishing a model for potential national implementation. Economic analysts highlight several immediate impacts. Tourism stands to benefit significantly through simplified currency exchange for international visitors. Small and medium enterprises gain access to more efficient cross-border payment solutions. Additionally, the reduced friction in foreign transactions could stimulate increased international trade activity. The Bank of Korea has monitored these developments closely, though officials emphasize that central bank digital currency research continues independently. Expert Perspectives on Market Transformation Financial technology experts recognize this as a watershed moment. Professor Kim Jae-hyun of Seoul National University’s Blockchain Research Center notes, “The integration of forex markets with stablecoin infrastructure represents logical progression in financial digitization. South Korea’s approach balances innovation with necessary safeguards.” Industry observers particularly appreciate the public-private partnership model, which leverages corporate technical expertise while maintaining public sector oversight. International cryptocurrency analysts have also taken notice. Many compare South Korea’s systematic approach with other nations’ more fragmented stablecoin initiatives. The country’s comprehensive strategy—encompassing regulation, infrastructure, and practical applications—positions it uniquely in the global landscape. Success with the Busan pilot could influence similar projects throughout Asia and beyond. Regulatory Framework and Compliance Considerations South Korea’s progressive yet cautious regulatory environment made this development possible. The Specific Financial Information Act amendments in 2021 established clear guidelines for cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers. Subsequent regulations in 2023 created specific frameworks for stablecoin issuance and management. These rules mandate regular reserve audits, consumer protection measures, and anti-money laundering protocols. The Bidan Jumeoni wallet incorporates compliance features directly into its architecture. Automated reporting systems provide regulators with necessary transaction data without compromising user privacy. Smart contracts enforce regulatory limits on transactions based on user verification levels. This built-in compliance reduces operational friction while maintaining legal adherence—a model other jurisdictions may eventually emulate. Real-time transaction monitoring for suspicious activity detection Tiered KYC verification matching traditional banking standards Automated tax reporting integration with national systems Cross-border compliance with FATF Travel Rule requirements Technical Architecture and Security Protocols The wallet’s underlying technology represents cutting-edge financial infrastructure. Developers built the system using modular components that allow for future upgrades and feature additions. Security receives paramount consideration through multiple layered protections. Each transaction undergoes validation through both algorithmic checks and human oversight where necessary. Cold storage solutions safeguard the majority of reserve assets backing the Dongbaekjeon stablecoin. Multiple geographically distributed facilities ensure redundancy and disaster recovery capabilities. Regular penetration testing and security audits by independent third parties maintain system integrity. Users benefit from biometric authentication options alongside traditional security measures. Global Context and Competitive Landscape South Korea enters an increasingly crowded stablecoin market with distinct advantages. Unlike many purely private initiatives, this project enjoys explicit government support through Busan’s special regulatory zone. The integration with existing financial infrastructure surpasses what many competitors offer. Additionally, South Korea’s advanced digital literacy and high smartphone penetration create ideal adoption conditions. Comparatively, Japan’s DCJPY project focuses primarily on wholesale transactions between corporations. Singapore’s Project Guardian emphasizes asset tokenization rather than currency applications. The European Union’s digital euro initiative remains in research phases. South Korea’s retail-focused approach with immediate practical applications positions it uniquely in this global landscape. Future Development Roadmap The pre-launch phase allows for final testing and refinement before full public release. Development teams currently focus on stress testing systems under simulated high-load conditions. Additional currency pairs will follow the initial implementation based on market demand and regulatory approvals. Integration with other financial services, including lending and investment products, appears on the longer-term roadmap. International expansion remains a possibility once the domestic system proves stable and secure. Partnerships with foreign financial institutions could facilitate cross-border stablecoin transactions without traditional forex intermediaries. Such developments would further solidify South Korea’s position as a digital finance innovator while creating new economic opportunities. Conclusion South Korea’s Bidan Jumeoni wallet represents a significant advancement in practical blockchain implementation. The seamless forex-to-KRW stablecoin exchange capability addresses real-world financial needs while demonstrating regulatory compliance possibilities. This development could accelerate mainstream cryptocurrency adoption by solving persistent usability and stability challenges. As the system moves from pre-launch to full operation, observers worldwide will monitor its impact on both South Korea’s digital economy and the broader global financial landscape. The successful integration of traditional forex markets with blockchain technology through KRW-pegged stablecoins may well establish a new standard for digital finance infrastructure. FAQs Q1: What makes the Bidan Jumeoni wallet different from other cryptocurrency wallets? The wallet uniquely integrates direct foreign exchange capabilities with KRW-pegged stablecoin conversion, operating within South Korea’s regulated financial framework with official institutional backing. Q2: How does the Dongbaekjeon stablecoin maintain its value parity with the South Korean won? The stablecoin maintains 1:1 parity through fully collateralized reserves held in secure custody, with regular third-party audits ensuring complete transparency and value backing. Q3: When will the wallet become available to the general public? The application currently remains in pre-launch phase with full public release expected following successful testing and final regulatory approvals, projected for early 2026. Q4: What foreign currencies will initially be supported for exchange? While official currency pairs await final announcement, major global currencies including USD, EUR, JPY, and CNY are expected in the initial release phase. Q5: How does this development affect South Korea’s broader digital currency strategy? This represents a practical implementation component of South Korea’s comprehensive digital finance transformation, complementing ongoing central bank digital currency research while addressing immediate market needs.

57473240,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=265304,1769412912,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Upbit ZIL Supply Update Sparks Major 443M Token Increase, Revealing Critical Market Shift",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/upbit-zil-supply-update-2025/,"BitcoinWorld Upbit ZIL Supply Update Sparks Major 443M Token Increase, Revealing Critical Market Shift SEOUL, South Korea – March 2025: In a significant development for cryptocurrency markets, Upbit has announced a substantial revision to Zilliqa’s circulating supply plan, resulting in a dramatic 443 million ZIL increase for the first quarter. This adjustment, requested by the Zilliqa project team, fundamentally alters the token’s economic landscape and carries important implications for investors and market analysts tracking blockchain fundamentals. Upbit ZIL Supply Update: Analyzing the 443 Million Token Increase South Korea’s premier cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit, implemented a crucial update to Zilliqa’s circulating supply metrics this week. Consequently, the first-quarter supply surged from 19,905,499,223 ZIL to 20,348,695,084 ZIL. Furthermore, the circulating supply for the second quarter now stands at 20,458,855,084 ZIL. This represents a substantial 2.2% increase in circulating tokens during the first quarter alone. Market analysts immediately recognized the significance of this adjustment. Bitcoin World’s analysis confirmed the precise figures, highlighting how such changes affect market capitalization calculations. Additionally, circulating supply modifications directly influence token valuation metrics that investors monitor closely. These metrics include price-to-circulating-supply ratios and network value assessments. Understanding Zilliqa’s Tokenomics Adjustment Zilliqa’s circulating supply revision follows established blockchain industry practices. Project teams periodically update supply data to reflect actual token circulation. This process ensures transparency and accuracy in market reporting. The 443,195,861 ZIL increase represents newly unlocked or distributed tokens entering active circulation. Several factors typically drive such supply adjustments: Staking rewards distribution to network participants Team and advisor token unlocks according to vesting schedules Ecosystem development funds being deployed Mining or staking inflation from network consensus Zilliqa utilizes a practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT) consensus mechanism. This system requires regular token emissions to reward network validators. Therefore, circulating supply naturally increases over time through protocol-defined inflation. Expert Analysis: Market Impact and Investor Considerations Cryptocurrency analysts emphasize the importance of accurate circulating supply data. Market capitalization calculations depend entirely on this metric. When exchanges like Upbit update supply information, they provide more precise valuation tools for investors. This transparency helps market participants make informed decisions. The timing of this update coincides with broader cryptocurrency market developments. Regulatory clarity in South Korea has improved significantly since 2023. Exchanges now follow stricter reporting standards. Upbit’s proactive supply update demonstrates this commitment to transparency. Market participants can trust that circulating figures reflect actual token availability. Historical data shows how supply adjustments affect token prices. Generally, increased circulating supply creates selling pressure if demand remains constant. However, Zilliqa’s ecosystem development might offset this pressure. The project continues expanding its decentralized application ecosystem. More applications could increase token utility and demand. Comparative Analysis: How Other Exchanges Handle Supply Updates Major cryptocurrency exchanges approach circulating supply updates differently. Binance typically updates supply data weekly through its Binance Research division. Coinbase integrates supply information directly from project teams via API connections. Kraken emphasizes manual verification processes for accuracy. Upbit’s methodology involves direct communication with project teams. This collaborative approach ensures data accuracy. The exchange then implements updates across its trading platform and informational resources. Users see revised market capitalization figures immediately after updates. Exchange Circulating Supply Update Methods (2025) Exchange Update Frequency Verification Method Upbit Real-time upon request Direct project team communication Binance Weekly Binance Research analysis Coinbase Continuous API integration with projects Kraken Monthly Manual verification process The Technical Mechanics Behind Supply Calculations Blockchain explorers provide the foundational data for circulating supply calculations. These tools track every token movement across addresses. However, determining which tokens truly “circulate” requires careful analysis. Typically, circulating supply excludes: Team tokens still under vesting schedules Foundation treasury funds not yet deployed Tokens locked in smart contracts for specific purposes Burned or permanently removed tokens Zilliqa’s blockchain explorer shows all token holdings publicly. Analysts use this data to calculate circulating figures. The recent 443 million ZIL increase suggests previously restricted tokens entered circulation. This movement might reflect planned ecosystem development activities. Historical Context: Zilliqa’s Supply Evolution Zilliqa launched its mainnet in January 2019 with an initial supply distribution. The project allocated tokens across several categories including public sale, team, ecosystem, and mining rewards. Since launch, the circulating supply has increased gradually according to the project’s emission schedule. Quarterly supply increases typically range between 1-3% based on historical patterns. The current 2.2% adjustment falls within this expected range. However, the absolute number of tokens (443 million) appears substantial due to Zilliqa’s large total supply. The project designed its tokenomics for long-term ecosystem growth rather than scarcity. Regulatory Implications in South Korea’s Evolving Crypto Landscape South Korea implemented comprehensive cryptocurrency regulations in 2024. The Financial Services Commission now requires detailed reporting from exchanges. Supply accuracy forms part of these regulatory requirements. Upbit’s update demonstrates compliance with these standards. Korean investors particularly value transparency in token metrics. The 2022 Terra-Luna collapse increased scrutiny of tokenomics. Consequently, exchanges now prioritize accurate supply reporting. This protects investors from misleading market capitalization calculations. Accurate data helps prevent market manipulation through supply misinformation. International exchanges watch Korean regulatory developments closely. Many adopt similar practices voluntarily. The global cryptocurrency industry moves toward standardized reporting. Upbit’s methodology might influence other exchanges’ approaches. This creates more consistent data across trading platforms worldwide. Conclusion Upbit’s ZIL supply update represents standard blockchain industry practice with important implications. The 443 million token increase provides more accurate market capitalization calculations. Investors now have better data for valuation assessments. This transparency supports healthier market development. Furthermore, the update demonstrates Upbit’s commitment to regulatory compliance and accurate reporting. As cryptocurrency markets mature, such precise supply tracking becomes increasingly vital for all participants. The Upbit ZIL supply adjustment ultimately contributes to more transparent and efficient digital asset markets. FAQs Q1: Why did Upbit update Zilliqa’s circulating supply figures? Upbit implemented the update at the Zilliqa project team’s request to reflect accurate token circulation data, ensuring transparent market capitalization calculations for investors. Q2: How does the 443 million ZIL increase affect token value? Increased circulating supply typically creates selling pressure if demand remains constant, but Zilliqa’s expanding ecosystem development might offset this through increased utility and demand. Q3: What percentage increase does 443 million ZIL represent? The adjustment represents approximately a 2.2% increase in circulating supply, moving from 19.9 billion to 20.35 billion ZIL during the first quarter. Q4: Do other cryptocurrency exchanges make similar supply updates? Yes, major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken regularly update circulating supply data, though their methodologies and frequencies vary significantly. Q5: How does this update affect Zilliqa’s market capitalization ranking? Market capitalization rankings depend on accurate circulating supply data, so this update provides more precise positioning relative to other cryptocurrencies.

Key Takeaways: ZachXBT alleges a multimillion-dollar crypto theft from US government wallets is linked to the son of a federal crypto custody contractor’s CEO. The funds were traced to wallets connected to assets seized in the 2016 Bitfinex hack. The claims remain unproven in court, and no charges have been filed as of publication. In a series of posts detailing his findings , ZachXBT claimed that an individual known online as “Lick,” whose real name he identified as John Daghita, siphoned tens of millions of dollars in crypto from wallets linked to the US government. He further alleged that Daghita is the son of Dean Daghita, president and chief executive of Command Services & Support (CMDSS), a company contracted by the US Marshals Service to handle certain seized cryptocurrencies. CMDSS Awarded US Marshals Contract to Handle Non-Mainstream Seized Crypto Public records show that CMDSS, based in Haymarket, Virginia, was awarded a contract in October 2024 to assist the Marshals Service with the custody and disposal of so-called “Class 2–4” digital assets. These include tokens that are not supported by major centralized exchanges and often require bespoke handling. The allegations have not been tested in court, and no criminal charges have been announced. CMDSS did not respond to requests for comment at the time of publication. ZachXBT’s claims expand on an investigation he published on Jan. 23, which linked the same online persona to more than $90 million in suspected illicit crypto activity. That probe traced funds back to a U.S. government wallet associated with assets seized from the 2016 Bitfinex hack. The investigation gained traction after a recorded dispute in a Telegram group chat between “Lick” and another individual. Update: The CMDSS company X account, website, & LinkedIn were all just deactivated pic.twitter.com/nvN6u5XMPq — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) January 25, 2026 The exchange, described as a “band-for-band” argument, involved both parties attempting to demonstrate control over large crypto balances. During the exchange, “Lick” screen-shared an Exodus wallet displaying a Tron address holding roughly $2.3 million, followed by a live transfer of about $6.7 million in ether. By the end of the session, approximately $23 million had been consolidated into a single wallet. By tracing transactions backward, ZachXBT linked that wallet to an address that received $24.9 million from a US government-controlled wallet in March 2024. The government address was tied to funds seized in the Bitfinex case. ZachXBT had previously flagged unusual activity in October 2024, when around $20 million was drained from similar government wallets. Most of those funds were returned within 24 hours , though roughly $700,000 routed through instant exchanges was not recovered. CMDSS Contract Faced Prior Scrutiny as GAO Rejected Protest CMDSS’s role as a government contractor has drawn scrutiny before. After losing the Marshals Service contract, Wave Digital Assets filed a protest with the Government Accountability Office, arguing that CMDSS lacked proper regulatory registrations and raising concerns over potential conflicts of interest involving a former Marshals Service official. The GAO ultimately denied the protest . Questions around crypto custody have also been raised more broadly. A February 2025 CoinDesk report said the Marshals Service struggled to account for its digital asset holdings, citing weak inventory controls and an inability to estimate its bitcoin reserves. As reported, illicit cryptocurrency addresses received a record $154 billion in 2025 , a sharp increase from the year before.

AMO Block, the pioneering developer behind the vehicle data marketplace cryptocurrency AMO Coin (AMO), has strategically unveiled its comprehensive technical and commercial roadmap for 2026. This announcement signals a significant evolution for the project, moving beyond its initial data trading framework toward an integrated ecosystem that directly leverages real-time automotive data from major manufacturers. The core initiatives promise to redefine the intersection of blockchain, data ownership, and the automotive industry. AMO Block’s 2026 Roadmap: Core Pillars and Strategic Vision The newly published AMO Block roadmap outlines four primary development vectors designed to enhance utility and adoption. Firstly, the team plans to launch Drive-to-Earn (D2E) 2.0 , an advanced iteration of its incentive model. This upgrade will specifically integrate and utilize anonymized vehicle data from Tesla’s extensive fleet. Consequently, Tesla owners could potentially earn AMO tokens by contributing specific, consented datasets related to driving patterns, battery performance, and sensor information. This model builds upon the foundational concept of decentralized data markets, applying it to one of the world’s most data-rich vehicle fleets. Secondly, AMO Block will deploy an AMO Live Data Center . This infrastructure component aims to serve as a real-time aggregation and processing hub for vehicular information. The center will validate, package, and prepare data streams for commercial and research applications, ensuring data integrity through blockchain verification. Furthermore, the roadmap details the introduction of a Full Self-Driving (FSD) mining mode . This innovative feature proposes a system where vehicles operating in autonomous mode could contribute computational resources or specialized sensor data to the network, creating a novel ‘mining’ mechanism distinct from traditional proof-of-work. Industry Integration and Potential Automotive Partnerships A critical strategic element of the 2026 plan involves exploring direct API integration with automakers . AMO Block has explicitly named Hyundai Motor Company and Kia Corporation as potential partners for this initiative. Such integration would enable a seamless, manufacturer-level data pipeline from vehicles to the AMO blockchain platform. For context, Hyundai Motor Group has previously invested in various blockchain and AI ventures, indicating a strategic interest in data monetization technologies. A successful API partnership would represent a major leap from a third-party data marketplace to an OEM-integrated solution. Expert Analysis on Data Monetization and Blockchain Feasibility Industry analysts note that the roadmap aligns with broader trends in the Internet of Things (IoT) and data economy. The global market for connected car data is projected to expand significantly by 2026, driven by advancements in 5G, edge computing, and consumer data rights awareness. However, experts also highlight key challenges. These include stringent data privacy regulations like GDPR and evolving standards for data anonymization. The technical complexity of creating secure, real-time data oracles that bridge vehicle ECUs to a blockchain also presents a substantial engineering hurdle. AMO Block’s timeline will depend on its ability to navigate these regulatory and technical landscapes while securing formal partnerships. The following table summarizes the key initiatives and their projected impact: Initiative Description Target Timeline Drive-to-Earn (D2E) 2.0 Enhanced token reward system using Tesla vehicle data. Q1-Q2 2026 AMO Live Data Center Real-time data aggregation and processing infrastructure. Q2 2026 FSD Mining Mode Resource contribution mechanism for autonomous vehicles. Q3 2026 OEM API Integration Direct data pipeline exploration with Hyundai/Kia. Ongoing through 2026 Technological Foundations and Market Context for AMO Coin AMO Coin functions as the native utility token within the AMO Block ecosystem. It facilitates transactions, rewards data providers, and grants access to datasets. The project initially launched with a focus on creating a peer-to-peer marketplace for vehicle diagnostic and usage data. The 2026 roadmap represents a clear pivot toward deeper integration with vehicle hardware and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). This shift could potentially increase the intrinsic value of AMO tokens by tying them to high-demand, real-world data streams from millions of connected vehicles. The success of this model hinges on achieving critical mass in both data supply from vehicles and demand from data consumers like insurance companies, urban planners, and service centers. Conclusion The AMO Block roadmap for 2026 outlines a bold, multi-phase strategy to cement its position at the forefront of vehicular data monetization. By targeting integrations with industry leaders like Tesla and potentially Hyundai-Kia, the project aims to transition from a niche blockchain application to a mainstream data utility layer for the automotive sector. The proposed development of Drive-to-Earn 2.0, a Live Data Center, and FSD mining demonstrates a commitment to technical innovation. Ultimately, the realization of this ambitious AMO Block roadmap will depend on execution, partnership finalization, and its alignment with the fast-evolving regulatory framework governing data privacy and automotive technology. FAQs Q1: What is AMO Coin? AMO Coin (AMO) is the native cryptocurrency of the AMO Block platform, designed as a utility token for trading, accessing, and rewarding contributions of vehicle data on its blockchain-based marketplace. Q2: How does Drive-to-Earn (D2E) 2.0 work with Tesla data? The proposed D2E 2.0 system would allow Tesla vehicle owners to opt-in to share specific, anonymized data from their cars. In return for this consented data contribution, participants would earn AMO tokens as a reward, creating a direct data-for-value exchange. Q3: What is the purpose of the AMO Live Data Center? The AMO Live Data Center is planned as the core technical infrastructure to receive, verify, process, and format real-time data streams from connected vehicles. It aims to ensure data quality and prepare it for commercial use cases before it is recorded on the blockchain. Q4: Has AMO Block officially partnered with Tesla, Hyundai, or Kia? As of this announcement, AMO Block has unveiled a roadmap that includes exploring API integration with Hyundai and Kia and utilizing Tesla vehicle data. The language suggests these are strategic goals and explorations, not confirmed, finalized partnerships. Official partnership announcements would be separate future events. Q5: What are the main challenges for this 2026 roadmap? Key challenges include securing formal agreements with automotive OEMs, developing robust and secure technical integrations with vehicle systems, ensuring full compliance with global data privacy regulations (like GDPR, CCPA), and achieving sufficient scale among both data providers and buyers to create a liquid marketplace.

And your training. And your company’s internal comms. Not with a human, but with a talking video bot that doesn’t get tired or forget lines. The London-based startup builds digital people (video avatars) that speak from scripts. Clients type text, and the avatar delivers it. That’s old news. Now, Synthesia is building something bigger. Not just script readers. These new avatars can answer questions. Real back-and-forth. First target? Sales training. Then comes recruitment and internal HR work. Funding goes into new talking avatar tech To build it, Synthesia pulled in $200 million in new funding. The company is now valued at $4 billion. The lead investor was GV, the venture fund owned by Alphabet. Others in the round include Nvidia, Accel, Hedosophia, and Evantic Capital. Employees also got a tender offer. This new round almost doubles the startup’s valuation from last year. The CEO, Victor Riparbelli, said the new agents help companies train staff better and faster. “We’re providing one part of the solution today,” Victor said. “The problem is that the other part—the role-playing, the coaching, the feedback—has to be done by humans.” The funding helps Synthesia push further into enterprise use. Public investors are watching closely. Generative AI is hot, but not many companies in the space are making real business sales. Profits? Even fewer. Video AI costs a lot to run. Big tech players are circling. Last year, Adobe held talks to buy Synthesia for $3 billion, reported The Information. Victor had already spoken about some of their fundraising goals at the time. Company shifts from flashy ads to workplace training Synthesia was launched in 2017 by Victor and three researchers. They were trying to find a product that worked. That changed when ChatGPT came out. Suddenly, the team could plug chatbot tech into avatars. Now those avatars could talk like real people. Multiple languages. Uses? Training, internal videos, marketing. The original plan was to create consumer content. Ads. Even movies. In 2024, they made an avatar commercial using Lionel Messi. That’s over now. Victor said they dropped that idea. Too messy. Too unstable. “If it competes in a newsfeed, that’s not something we want to do,” he said. “A lot of our competitors have gone bust because they tried to tackle these use cases.” They switched to internal corporate work. And it’s paying off. In April, Synthesia hit $100 million in annual recurring revenue. That number is now “significantly higher,” Victor said, without giving the current figure. They’re already working with Microsoft, UBS , and Ford. Vidu Shanmugarajah, a general partner at GV, said Synthesia is growing faster than most of the other startups GV has backed. “They’re solving a real problem,” Vidu said. Synthesia isn’t doing much business in Silicon Valley. Their biggest customers are in financial services, retail, and healthcare. The team has been testing the new talking avatars for four months. In one demo, the bot answered questions about sales training. The voice worked. The look was close to real. It missed a few questions and needed to hear them again. The company blamed it on weak Wi-Fi. Prices for the current avatars vary by how much a company uses them. Prices for the new system are not yet final. Victor also said he practiced with a bot made just for handling interviews before talking to the press. Last year, Synthesia raised $180 million at a $2.1 billion valuation. The new price makes it one of the top AI startups in the UK. Others in the same group include Wayve and ElevenLabs. But it’s still cheaper than the massive names like OpenAI . Victor said they could have taken offers with higher valuations, but he wanted something closer to real public company standards. “Maybe you look cooler because you have a higher valuation,” Victor said. “I would rather have a business that I feel good about.” He added that because they’re putting money into growth and building tech, Synthesia is not profitable yet.

The assertion was shared by crypto enthusiast WF, who described the development as a breaking update. The post quickly gained visibility within cryptocurrency-focused circles, largely because such a move would signify a major global fast-food brand’s real-world digital asset adoption. According to the claim, customers at certain KFC outlets in Phoenix are reportedly using XRP for payments. No specific store locations were identified, and the post did not reference any official documentation, announcements, or confirmations from KFC or affiliated payment providers. Despite the lack of detail, the statement drew immediate attention because of KFC’s global brand recognition and the broader narrative around digital assets entering everyday commerce. BREAKING: XRP is now accepted at select KFC locations in Phoenix, Arizona. — WF (@WhaleFUD) January 24, 2026 Community Pushback and Calls for Confirmation Shortly after the claim was posted, an X user identified as cryptos_small publicly challenged its accuracy. The user labeled the report as fake news and emphasized that neither KFC, Ripple , nor any major payment processor had issued an official statement confirming XRP acceptance at KFC locations. The comment stressed that, without confirmation from KFC itself or from a recognized payment partner, the claim should be treated as an unverified rumor rather than a confirmed development. This response reflects a broader sentiment within parts of the cryptocurrency community that has grown increasingly cautious about viral claims tied to mainstream adoption. Past experiences with exaggerated or inaccurate reports have made many users more reliant on primary sources and formal announcements before accepting such news as fact. Lack of Official Statements As of now, there has been no public confirmation from KFC regarding the acceptance of XRP at any of its U.S. locations. Similarly, there has been no announcement from Ripple or from established payment processors indicating a partnership or pilot program involving XRP payments at KFC restaurants in Phoenix or elsewhere. The claim appears to originate solely from social media activity, with some posts suggesting a possible test phase, though these references remain unsupported by verifiable sources. Official KFC payment options, based on publicly available information, continue to include standard methods such as credit and debit cards, as well as digital payment services like Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, or region-specific e-wallets. None of these listings currently references direct cryptocurrency payments. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Context From Past Crypto-Related Promotions Historically, KFC has experimented with cryptocurrency-themed promotions, most notably the limited “Bitcoin Bucket” campaign in Canada in 2018 . That initiative was promotional in nature and did not result in ongoing cryptocurrency acceptance across KFC’s operations. In contrast, individuals interested in using digital assets can already purchase KFC gift cards through third-party platforms that support various cryptocurrencies, including XRP. However, this differs from accepting digital assets directly in-store. Until an official announcement is made by KFC or a verified payment partner, the claim that XRP is accepted at select KFC locations in Phoenix remains unconfirmed and should be regarded accordingly.

Price volatility often decreases as liquidity improves over subsequent trading sessions. The USD1/U pairing particularly interests stablecoin arbitrage specialists. This pair enables direct conversion between two major stablecoin ecosystems. Consequently, traders can execute more efficient capital allocation strategies across different stablecoin environments. Regulatory Context and Compliance Framework Binance operates within an increasingly structured regulatory environment globally. The exchange’s listing decisions now incorporate comprehensive compliance assessments. Each new trading pair undergoes rigorous legal review before implementation. This process ensures adherence to international financial regulations and anti-money laundering standards. The inclusion of multiple stablecoin pairs reflects evolving regulatory acceptance of dollar-pegged digital assets. Recent regulatory developments have shaped exchange listing strategies significantly. Many jurisdictions now require enhanced transparency for cryptocurrency trading pairs. Binance has responded by implementing more detailed disclosure practices. The exchange provides comprehensive risk warnings for each new trading instrument. Additionally, Binance maintains ongoing dialogue with regulatory authorities worldwide. This cooperative approach supports sustainable market development while protecting investor interests. The regulatory landscape continues evolving across major markets. The United States maintains specific requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges. European markets operate under MiCA regulations. Asian jurisdictions demonstrate varied approaches to exchange oversight. Binance’s global operations necessitate compliance with multiple regulatory frameworks simultaneously. Consequently, each listing decision represents careful consideration of international legal requirements. The exchange prioritizes regulatory compliance while expanding trading options for users. Historical Perspective on Exchange Listings Cryptocurrency exchange listings have evolved substantially since Bitcoin’s early days. Initially, exchanges offered limited trading pairs with minimal regulatory oversight. Today, major platforms implement sophisticated listing procedures. Binance’s current approach reflects lessons learned from previous market cycles. The exchange now emphasizes sustainable growth over rapid expansion. This measured strategy aims to maintain market stability during periods of increased volatility. Previous listing waves demonstrate important patterns. Major exchange additions often precede increased institutional participation. New trading pairs typically correlate with improved market efficiency metrics. Historical data reveals that carefully selected listings contribute to healthier market ecosystems. Binance’s latest additions continue this established pattern. The exchange focuses on pairs that address genuine market needs rather than speculative opportunities. This approach supports long-term market development objectives. The cryptocurrency industry has matured significantly in recent years. Exchange listings now represent strategic business decisions rather than technical experiments. Binance’s selection process incorporates multiple analytical dimensions. Market demand represents one crucial consideration. Technical feasibility constitutes another important factor. Regulatory compliance completes the decision-making framework. This comprehensive approach distinguishes modern exchange operations from earlier industry practices. Technical Infrastructure and System Readiness Binance maintains one of the most robust technical infrastructures in the cryptocurrency industry.

The dollar index dropped 0.4% to 104.20, marking its third consecutive daily decline. Meanwhile, the Japanese yen surged dramatically, jumping 1.2% against the greenback amid growing speculation about potential government intervention. This currency volatility reflects deepening uncertainty about Federal Reserve policy direction and contrasting monetary approaches across the Asia-Pacific region. Federal Reserve Caution Drives Dollar Weakness The U.S. dollar continued its downward trajectory following the Federal Reserve’s latest policy statement. Market participants interpreted the central bank’s language as increasingly cautious about future rate hikes. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized data dependency during his press conference, specifically highlighting concerns about slowing economic indicators. Consequently, traders reduced their expectations for additional tightening measures through 2025. Several economic reports contributed to this dovish sentiment. Recent manufacturing data showed contraction for the fourth consecutive month, while consumer spending growth moderated significantly. The employment situation remains complex, with job creation slowing but wage growth persisting above historical averages. These mixed signals create uncertainty about the appropriate policy path forward. Interest Rate Expectations Shift Dramatically Market pricing now indicates only a 35% probability of another rate increase this year, down from 65% just one month ago. This represents a substantial shift in expectations that directly impacts currency valuations. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell to 4.15%, its lowest level in three weeks. Lower yields reduce the dollar’s attractiveness to international investors seeking higher returns. Historical context reveals this pattern typically precedes extended dollar weakness. Analysis of previous Fed policy transitions shows that when the central bank shifts from tightening to neutral, the dollar index often declines 5-8% over subsequent quarters. Current technical indicators suggest similar downward pressure may persist through the coming months. Japanese Yen Surges on Intervention Speculation The Japanese yen experienced its strongest single-day gain since March, climbing to 147.50 against the dollar. This dramatic movement followed verbal warnings from Japanese finance ministry officials about excessive currency volatility. Market participants interpreted these statements as signaling potential direct intervention in foreign exchange markets. Japanese authorities possess substantial resources for currency intervention, with foreign exchange reserves exceeding $1.2 trillion. The Ministry of Finance last intervened in October 2022 when the yen approached 152 against the dollar. Current levels remain below that threshold but have raised concerns about import inflation and economic stability. Recent Asian Currency Performance Against USD Currency Daily Change Year-to-Date Performance Japanese Yen (JPY) +1.2% -8.5% Chinese Yuan (CNY) -0.1% -2.3% South Korean Won (KRW) +0.3% -5.7% Indian Rupee (INR) +0.1% -1.9% Australian Dollar (AUD) +0.4% -3.2% Bank of Japan Policy Divergence The yen’s movement highlights the growing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and other major central banks. While the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank have raised rates aggressively, Japan maintains ultra-accommodative monetary policy. This divergence creates fundamental pressure on the yen, making intervention increasingly likely if movements become disorderly. Japanese officials face a delicate balancing act. A weaker yen benefits export-oriented companies but increases costs for energy and food imports. With inflation remaining above the 2% target for 18 consecutive months, policymakers must consider multiple economic factors when determining appropriate response measures. Mixed Performance Across Asian Currencies Other Asian currencies showed varied responses to the dollar’s weakness. The Chinese yuan edged lower despite stronger-than-expected export data, reflecting ongoing concerns about property sector stability. Conversely, the South Korean won gained ground following positive semiconductor export figures. Regional central banks face different economic circumstances that influence their currency management approaches. Several key factors contribute to this mixed performance: Trade balance variations: Export-dependent economies benefit differently from global demand shifts Inflation differentials: Countries with higher inflation typically see currency depreciation Capital flow patterns: Investment preferences shift based on relative growth prospects Policy coordination: Some regional central banks coordinate responses while others act independently Regional Economic Fundamentals Diverge Economic recovery patterns across Asia show significant variation. Southeast Asian nations generally demonstrate stronger growth momentum than Northeast Asian economies. Manufacturing activity expanded in Vietnam and Indonesia but contracted in Taiwan and Thailand. These divergent economic fundamentals naturally produce different currency performance outcomes. Tourism recovery represents another important factor. Currencies in tourism-dependent economies like Thailand and Singapore show greater sensitivity to visitor arrival numbers. As international travel normalizes post-pandemic, these currencies may experience additional volatility from seasonal tourism flows. Market Implications and Forward Outlook The current currency dynamics create both challenges and opportunities for market participants. Exporters in countries with strengthening currencies face competitive pressures, while importers benefit from improved purchasing power. Multinational corporations must carefully manage their currency exposure through this period of elevated volatility. Forward-looking indicators suggest several potential developments: Continued dollar weakness if U.S. economic data softens further Increased intervention probability as yen approaches 150 level Gradual normalization of regional currency correlations Potential policy responses from affected central banks Technical Analysis Perspective Technical indicators show the dollar index testing important support levels. A break below 104.00 could trigger additional selling pressure toward 103.50. Meanwhile, the yen faces resistance around 146.80, with support near 148.20. These technical levels will likely influence short-term trading decisions and potential intervention timing. Historical volatility measures have increased across major currency pairs, suggesting traders should prepare for continued price swings. Options market pricing indicates elevated expectations for movement in both directions, reflecting genuine uncertainty about near-term developments. Conclusion Asian currency markets present a complex picture of mixed performance amid shifting global monetary policy expectations. The dollar’s decline reflects growing Federal Reserve caution about economic conditions, while the yen’s surge demonstrates market sensitivity to intervention risks. These Asia FX movements highlight the interconnected nature of global financial markets and the importance of policy communication. Market participants should monitor economic data releases and central bank statements closely, as currency valuations remain highly responsive to changing fundamentals and policy signals. FAQs Q1: Why is the dollar dropping despite higher U.S. interest rates? The dollar is dropping because markets expect the Federal Reserve to pause or slow its rate hiking cycle due to concerns about economic growth. When traders anticipate less aggressive monetary policy, the currency typically weakens as future yield expectations decline. Q2: What triggers currency intervention by the Japanese government? Japanese authorities typically intervene when they believe currency movements have become excessive, disorderly, or driven by speculation rather than fundamentals. They also consider economic impacts, particularly when a weak yen significantly increases import costs and inflation. Q3: How do Asian currencies typically perform during Fed policy transitions? Asian currencies generally appreciate against the dollar when the Fed shifts from tightening to neutral or easing policies. However, performance varies significantly based on each country’s economic fundamentals, trade balances, and domestic monetary policy settings. Q4: What economic indicators most influence Asian currency values? Key indicators include trade balances, inflation differentials, interest rate spreads, capital flow data, and economic growth metrics. Regional factors like commodity prices and geopolitical developments also significantly impact specific currencies. Q5: How long might current currency trends persist? Currency trends typically persist until fundamental drivers change. Current dollar weakness may continue while Fed caution remains, and yen strength could extend if intervention concerns grow. However, currency markets can reverse quickly with new economic data or policy announcements.

The SoftBank founder had been negotiating for months to buy the U.S. data center operator, hoping it would power the $500 billion Stargate AI project being launched with the Trump administration, OpenAI, Oracle, and MGX in Abu Dhabi. That deal is now dead, according to Bloomberg’s claims. No full acquisition. No January rollout. No direct control of the energy-hungry data center network Masa was counting on to make Stargate real. SoftBank has now pulled out of the deal completely, according to insiders, and canceled plans to announce the buyout earlier this month. Talks are still ongoing, but the new direction is smaller. Masa is now looking at a partial investment or some sort of partnership with Switch. Nothing confirmed. The only real move this month was SoftBank’s $3 billion acquisition of DigitalBridge, a major backer of Switch. But that doesn’t get them the hardware control Masa wanted. SoftBank team raises red flags over costs and logistics If this deal had gone through, it would’ve been one of the biggest ever for the Japanese firm. Masa was planning to spend $100 billion instantly to set up U.S. data centers with his new partners. The goal was to get ahead in the global AI race and control physical infrastructure, not just fund it. But internally, not everyone was sold. Some SoftBank execs questioned how they’d actually manage massive data campuses from Las Vegas to Atlanta. They didn’t like the $50B price tag either. Analysts Kirk Boodry and Chris Muckensturm wrote, “The end of SoftBank’s deal talks with Switch leaves its data center plans in limbo, as Stargate announcements remain few and far between.” They added that a partial stake wouldn’t give Masa the kind of control he’s used to having in deals involving chips and physical AI systems. Basically, writing checks isn’t the same as running machines. Switch, meanwhile, isn’t standing still. The company’s backers are now considering an IPO. They want a public listing that could push the company’s value to $60 billion, including debt. And any deal with SoftBank could be hit by a review from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. That would slow things down even more, especially under Trump’s second term, which has taken a tougher stance on strategic tech deals. Masayoshi sells assets and doubles down on AI portfolio Even though the Switch buyout collapsed, Masa isn’t backing off on AI. In the last year, SoftBank took an 11% stake in OpenAI, pumping in $22.5 billion just last month. He bought Ampere Computing for $6.5 billion, and ABB’s robotics business for another $5.4 billion. All that money had to come from somewhere, so SoftBank dumped its Nvidia shares, sold more of its T-Mobile holdings, and jacked up margin loans using Arm stock as collateral. But the big AI spending is already causing cracks. SoftBank’s credit is under pressure. Ratings agency S&P Global just warned that if Masa doesn’t offload some assets or restructure soon, credit scores could take a hit. Analysts Kei Ishikawa and Makiko Yoshimura said, “If it does not take prompt easing measures, such as liquidation of held assets, pressure will intensify on the credit ratings.” S&P added more detail in a separate report: “We will reclassify the notes as having no equity content when the period remaining to effective maturity shortens to less than 15 years, as long as our long-term issuer credit rating on SoftBank Group is in the ‘BB’ category.” That means SoftBank must maintain or refinance its hybrid securities (complex financial instruments that count as loss-absorbing capital). S&P assumes SoftBank will do this, unless its credit score goes up and makes replacement unnecessary. The agency also noted that SoftBank has a history of managing finances even during aggressive growth cycles, and pointed out that Masa has a clear motivation to keep the firm’s hybrid securities flowing to support its diverse funding setup. Still, without action, even a company as bold as SoftBank can get caught short. Switch remains a target but Stargate remains stuck So what’s next? Right now, Switch is still a target, but the door to a full takeover looks shut. Masa has been in this position before when he waited years before finally buying Arm Holdings in 2016. There’s still talk of a possible smaller partnership, something modeled on the Ohio site SoftBank runs with Taiwan’s Hon Hai. But even that won’t give Masa the Stargate power he was chasing. SoftBank’s been trying to ride the AI wave since the beginning. But while it invested early, it missed out on the hardware gold rush. Most of the big wins have gone to chipmakers like Nvidia and TSMC. Stargate was supposed to fix that. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

This move directly impacts liquidity for several notable cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Binance Coin (BNB) pairs. Consequently, the decision underscores the exchange’s ongoing commitment to maintaining a robust and efficient trading environment for its vast user base. Market analysts immediately began assessing the potential ripple effects across the digital asset ecosystem. Binance Delisting: A Detailed Look at the Affected Pairs The delisting, scheduled for late January 2025, targets a specific set of spot trading pairs. The exchange provided a complete list for user transparency. Affected pairs span various asset classes and include major and minor cryptocurrencies. For instance, the list features pairs like BTC/UAH, which pairs Bitcoin with the Ukrainian Hryvnia. Additionally, it includes several altcoin-to-major-coin pairs such as COMP/BTC, DASH/ETH, and ETC/ETH. Furthermore, the action impacts newer and niche tokens. Pairs like IO/BTC, LINEA/BNB, and MINA/BTC are also on the list. The delisting notably includes several pairs with Binance’s own BNB token, like MMT/BNB, MOVE/BNB, and PLUME/BNB. Moreover, the exchange will remove specific pairs tied to its FDUSD stablecoin, including PNUT/FDUSD, SEI/FDUSD, STX/FDUSD, and TIA/FDUSD. The full roster of affected pairs is as follows: BTC/UAH COMP/BTC DASH/ETH ETC/ETH IO/BTC LINEA/BNB MINA/BTC MMT/BNB MOVE/BNB OG/BTC OGN/BTC PLUME/BNB PNUT/FDUSD RUNE/ETH SEI/FDUSD SHIB/DOGE STX/FDUSD TIA/FDUSD TON/BTC VET/ETH YB/BNB Understanding the Rationale Behind Trading Pair Removals Exchanges like Binance periodically review and delist trading pairs. This practice is a standard part of digital asset market management. Typically, the primary reasons involve poor liquidity and low trading volume. Pairs that fail to meet minimum activity thresholds often face removal. This process helps consolidate liquidity into more popular pairs. Ultimately, it improves the overall trading experience for most users. Another critical factor is ensuring a healthy and compliant trading environment. Exchanges must monitor for fraudulent activity or market manipulation. Sometimes, projects fail to maintain development commitments or face regulatory scrutiny. Consequently, their associated trading pairs may become unsustainable. Binance has established specific criteria for these periodic reviews. The criteria generally include factors like trading volume, liquidity, network stability, and public communication quality. Historical Context and Market Impact Analysis Historically, similar delisting events have caused short-term price volatility for the affected assets. However, the long-term impact varies significantly. For major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, losing a single fiat or trading pair on one exchange is often negligible. These assets maintain deep liquidity across hundreds of other global platforms. Therefore, the effect is typically minimal for blue-chip digital assets. Conversely, smaller altcoins or newer tokens can experience more pronounced effects. A delisting can reduce overall market access and visibility. It may also signal waning confidence to other traders and exchanges. Data from past delisting cycles shows a pattern. Assets with strong fundamentals and active development communities usually recover. They often find liquidity on other exchanges or through different trading pairs. The table below summarizes potential impacts based on asset class: Asset Type Typical Short-Term Impact Likely Long-Term Outcome Major Coin (BTC, ETH, BNB) Minimal price movement No significant change Established Altcoin (e.g., VET, RUNE) Moderate selling pressure Stabilization on other pairs Newer/Niche Token (e.g., PLUME, YB) High volatility, potential sharp drop Dependent on project health Action Timeline and User Guidance for the Delisting Binance has provided a clear timeline for the January 27 delisting process. All spot trading for the specified pairs will cease precisely at 08:00 a.m. UTC. After this time, users cannot place new orders for these pairs. However, the exchange will automatically cancel any remaining open orders. This is a standard automated procedure to protect users from executing trades in a illiquid market. Importantly, the delisting of a spot trading pair does not affect the underlying assets in user wallets. Users still hold their Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other tokens. They simply cannot trade them in the specific delisted combinations. For example, a user holding Mina (MINA) can still trade it via other active pairs like MINA/USDT. Binance consistently advises users to manage their assets proactively before such deadlines. Users should close open positions or cancel orders to avoid automatic cancellation. Expert Perspective on Exchange Liquidity Management Industry analysts view these periodic delistings as a sign of market maturation. Sarah Chen, a veteran crypto-market strategist, explained the rationale recently. “Exchanges face a constant balancing act,” Chen stated. “They must offer a wide range of assets to attract users. Simultaneously, they must ensure every market has sufficient depth. Thinly traded pairs harm the user experience with wide spreads and slippage.” This perspective highlights the operational necessity behind such decisions. Furthermore, regulatory compliance plays an increasingly significant role. Global exchanges now operate under more scrutiny. They must demonstrate robust market surveillance and consumer protection measures. Maintaining too many inactive pairs can complicate these efforts. Therefore, streamlining the offering list is often a proactive compliance step. It allows exchanges to better monitor active markets for integrity. Conclusion Binance’s decision to delist 21 spot trading pairs on January 27, 2025, represents a routine but important platform optimization. This strategic Binance delisting aims to improve liquidity and user experience across the exchange’s remaining markets. While affected traders must adjust their strategies, the underlying assets remain accessible through other pairs. The move reflects the ongoing evolution and professionalization of the cryptocurrency trading landscape. As the market grows, such maintenance actions will likely continue, ensuring healthy and efficient digital asset ecosystems for all participants. FAQs Q1: What should I do if I hold assets in a delisted trading pair? You do not lose the underlying assets. Simply trade them using a different, active trading pair on Binance (e.g., switch from MINA/BTC to MINA/USDT) before or after the delisting time. Q2: Will this delisting affect the price of Bitcoin or Ethereum? For major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, the impact of losing a few trading pairs on one exchange is typically negligible due to their deep, global liquidity across countless other platforms and pairs. Q3: Can I still withdraw the cryptocurrencies after the pair is delisted? Yes. The delisting only affects the specific trading pair. Deposit and withdrawal services for the individual tokens (like MINA or RUNE) continue as normal unless a separate token delisting announcement is made. Q4: Why does Binance delist trading pairs? The primary reasons are low liquidity and poor trading volume. Delisting consolidates activity into fewer, more liquid markets, improving the trading experience by reducing spreads and slippage for users. Q5: Are other exchanges likely to delist the same pairs? Not necessarily. Each exchange independently evaluates its markets based on its own liquidity thresholds and user demand. A pair being delisted on Binance does not automatically mean it will be removed elsewhere.

The rapid acceleration highlights a clear shift in trader behaviour, as crypto-native users increasingly turn to traditional assets to navigate global market volatility within a familiar environment. The pace of growth is notable. After Bitget TradFi first crossed $2 billion in daily volume on January 8, activity doubled in two weeks, reflecting strong and sustained demand for on-platform access to metals, commodities, indices, and FX. Rather than treating TradFi as a side feature, users are integrating it directly into their trading strategies, moving fluidly between crypto and global markets in response to real-time events. Gold CFD (XAUUSD) continues to dominate activity, ranking as the most actively traded product on Bitget TradFi. The data suggests that traders are using gold as a fast-moving, event-driven instrument rather than a passive store of value. Spikes in volume align closely with macro headlines, reinforcing the role of gold as a tactical vehicle for short-term positioning during periods of uncertainty. Bitget TradFi was built for this environment, allowing users to trade global assets with crypto-level speed and flexibility, turning macro events into immediate opportunities. Within a single account, traders can move from Bitcoin to gold, from altcoins to indices, without changing platforms or workflows. The result is a unified trading experience designed for event-driven markets. The milestone reflects Bitget’s broader UEX vision, where digital assets and traditional markets converge under one roof. As crypto traders increasingly look beyond on-chain volatility to global macro signals, Bitget TradFi is emerging as the bridge that makes those shifts actionable in real time. The surge in daily trading volume exemplifies this shift, demonstrating how the demand for multi-asset trading is reshaping the way crypto-native users engage with the world’s markets.

In a brief reply, ChartNerd stated that “$27 $XRP by 2030 is more realistic,” offering a grounded counterpoint to the highly ambitious figure suggested in the original post. The response stood out not for its length, but for its clarity. Rather than engaging in speculative extremes, ChartNerd positioned his outlook within a range that aligns more closely with established technical analysis frameworks and historical market behavior. His comment reframed the discussion around achievable growth rather than outsized projections, emphasizing realism over optimism. $27 $XRP by 2030 is more realistic. https://t.co/bKPZHICI3x — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) January 24, 2026 ChartNerd’s Price View in Context ChartNerd’s $27 projection implicitly challenges narratives that rely on exponential assumptions without proportional market justification. While he did not elaborate further in the reply, the figure itself suggests a view anchored in long-term technical progression rather than headline-driven forecasts. A move to $27 by 2030 would still represent a substantial increase from current levels, but one that remains within boundaries often cited by analysts who focus on structure, liquidity, and historical performance. This approach contrasts with price targets that extend into four-digit territory, which typically assume transformative changes in global financial systems or extreme supply constraints. ChartNerd’s reply signals skepticism toward such assumptions, instead favoring a valuation path that reflects incremental adoption and cyclical market expansion. Alignment With Broader Technical Analysis ChartNerd’s outlook closely mirrors recent technical commentary highlighted in a Times Tabloid article referencing analyst CoinsKid. In that report, CoinsKid traced XRP’s historical price behavior across multiple market cycles, noting a progression of higher lows from $0.21 in 2020 to $1.64 during the April 2025 correction. He emphasized that XRP’s breakout above a seven-year symmetrical triangle in November 2024 marked the start of a larger Elliott Wave structure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 According to CoinsKid, the peak at $3.4 in January 2025 represented Wave 1, with the subsequent decline forming a Wave 2 corrective phase that could extend toward $1.14 in 2026. He further explained that the 1.414 Fibonacci extension has historically aligned with corrective lows, reinforcing this projection. Once the correction concludes, CoinsKid anticipates a renewed upward phase that could eventually carry XRP toward the $27 level , a target he described as technically achievable within a full cycle. A Realistic Long-Term Ceiling Taken together, ChartNerd’s reply and CoinsKid’s extended analysis present a consistent narrative. Rather than dismissing growth potential, both perspectives outline a path in which XRP appreciation is driven by technical structure and historical precedent. A $27 price by 2030 appears in this context as a measured estimate based on observable market behavior rather than speculative extremes, rather than as a conservative dismissal.

Scheduled to launch in February 2026, PRISM, short for Portfolio of Risk-adjusted Investment Strategy Mix, is built around a quantitative, multi-strategy portfolio actively managed by Monarq, FalconX’s quantitative asset management arm. The portfolio is designed to perform across market cycles by allocating capital based on market conditions. According to OpenEden founder and CEO Jeremy Ng, PRISM reflects a broader shift in how on-chain investment products are being structured. “PRISM reflects how on-chain investment products are evolving toward more regulated and professionally managed offerings,” Ng said. “At OpenEden, our role is to provide partners with regulatory-compliant tokenization infrastructure that allows strategies like this to be accessed in a transparent and scalable format.” PRISM draws yield from a diversified mix of strategies, including cash-and-carry arbitrage, overcollateralized institutional lending, participation in established DeFi yield venues, and exposure to regulated tokenized real-world assets such as U.S. Treasury–backed instruments. This diversification is intended to reduce reliance on a single source of yield. Monarq Managing Partner Shiliang Tang highlighted the collaboration’s focus on structure and stability. “By combining Monarq’s sophisticated quantitative strategies and multi-layered risk management framework with OpenEden’s regulatory-compliant tokenization infrastructure, we are setting a new standard for transparency and stability in the digital asset space. This collaboration allows us to deliver a scalable, multi-strategy solution that scales across market cycles,” Tang said. Yield generated by the portfolio is distributed through a staking mechanism. Users stake PRISM tokens to receive xPRISM, a value-accruing receipt that reflects portfolio performance over time via a transparent conversion mechanism. PRISM will initially be supported on Ethereum, with plans to expand to additional networks. The product is tokenized by OpenEden and supported by FalconX’s institutional trading infrastructure. PRISM also embeds Monarq’s proprietary risk management framework to ensure strategies’ exposure and liquidity remain within predefined limits. A limited pre-deposit campaign is currently open, allowing early participants to gain exposure to PRISM ahead of its official launch.",Industry Thoughts,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-26 08:03:50

According to regulatory filings, ETHZilla executed two CFM56-7B24 aircraft engine purchases through a newly formed subsidiary, ETHZilla Aerospace LLC. The aircraft engines came with engine records and stands, purchased for a total of $12.2 million in cash from Aero Engine Solutions’ affiliate, Avean. Last December, ETHZilla chairman and chief executive McAndrew Rudisill said the company plans to “build an operating business to bring real-world assets (RWA) on-chain through tokenization,” moving away from simply buying and holding Ether. ETHZilla enters the aerospace engine lease market As seen in the agreement, the final amount also included deposits and adjustments, setting the economic closing date for September 30 last year. Since the engines were already under lease to another airline at the time of acquisition, those lease agreements were assigned to ETHZilla . The engines are subject to Aircraft Engine Lease Agreements with a large airline operator. Airlines frequently lease spare engines to avoid disruptions if an aircraft’s primary engine requires maintenance or unexpected replacement. This leasing model has become a specialized financial niche dominated by firms that own engines outright and lease them to carriers worldwide. Some of the firms in this market include AerCap, Willis Lease Finance Corporation, and SMBC Aero Engine Lease. According to the International Air Transport Association, the global aerospace industry is currently facing a significant shortage of engines. The IATA has warned that airlines will be forced to spend about $2.6 billion in 2025 alone to lease more spare engines to keep their business running. TechSci’s market research, cited in ETHZilla’s submission with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), shows the aircraft engine leasing market could grow by a compound annual growth rate of 5.68%, from $11.17 billion in 2025 to $15.56 billion by 2031. In connection with the purchase, ETHZilla entered into a Servicing Agreement with Aero Engine Solutions. The two entities agreed to let the servicer manage the engines throughout the duration of their existing leases. The arrangement also includes a monthly servicing fee and a set of reciprocal purchase options following lease expiration or early termination. ETHZilla has the option, but not the obligation, to call upon the servicer or a related party to purchase either of the engines at the end of the lease. It also applies upon early termination of the lease of a particular engine if that engine meets the conditions of this contract for $3 million per engine. The servicer also holds a mirrored right to require ETHZilla to sell either engine for $3 million per engine under the same conditions. ETHZilla noted that the description of the Purchase Agreement is subject to and qualified entirely by the full agreement filed as an exhibit. Company diversifies RWA tokenization through aerospace In last year’s commentary, Rudisill told investors that the company would “initially focus on aerospace assets such as aircraft engines and airframes to tokenize.” He also mentioned that members of ETHZilla’s board have “relationships within the aerospace industry” being used to source assets, so there was no need for external partnerships.

It also took a stake in auto finance platform Karus, with similar plans to bring vehicle-related loans on-chain. Although it currently holds $198.5 million in ETH, ETHZilla sold $40 million worth of Ether in October to fund a stock buyback program and another $74.5 million in ETH to redeem outstanding debt last month. Its shares surged above $100 in August during the peak of the crypto-linked equity rally, but they have since dropped 95% to close at $5.24 on Friday, according to Google Finance data.

The incident, which occurred on March 21, 2025, underscores the persistent vulnerabilities within complex DeFi integrations. According to an initial report by The Block, the attacker leveraged a critical flaw in a SwapNet smart contract to drain pre-approved user funds. Consequently, this event has sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community, raising urgent questions about audit processes and the security of cross-chain asset bridges. Anatomy of the Matcha Meta Exploit The Matcha Meta exploit unfolded through a sophisticated attack vector targeting its integration with SwapNet. Initially, the attacker identified a vulnerability in a specific SwapNet smart contract. This flaw allowed unauthorized access to funds that users had pre-approved for trading operations. Subsequently, the hacker executed a series of rapid transactions to capitalize on this weakness. The attacker first swapped approximately $10.5 million in USDC for 3,655 ETH on the Base layer-2 network. Following this conversion, they immediately bridged the stolen Ethereum to the main Ethereum blockchain. This swift movement of assets across chains complicated initial tracking efforts. Forensic analysis by blockchain security firms suggests the exploit was a logical flaw rather than a simple coding error, allowing the bypass of standard authorization checks. Attack Vector: Smart contract vulnerability in SwapNet integration. Primary Action: Drainage of pre-approved user funds. Asset Movement: USDC to ETH swap on Base, followed by bridging to Ethereum mainnet. Total Loss: $16.8 million in digital assets. Context and Impact of the DEX Aggregator Hack The Matcha Meta breach represents one of the larger DeFi exploits of early 2025. DEX aggregators like Matcha Meta serve a crucial function by sourcing liquidity from multiple decentralized exchanges to offer users the best possible trading rates. However, their complex architecture, which involves interacting with numerous external protocols and smart contracts, inherently expands the attack surface . This incident follows a concerning trend of exploits targeting the connective tissue between DeFi protocols rather than the core protocols themselves. Immediate impacts were felt across the ecosystem. Firstly, user confidence in similar aggregator platforms temporarily wavered. Secondly, the native token of the affected platform experienced notable volatility. Furthermore, the exploit has triggered renewed calls from regulators and industry bodies for enhanced security standards, particularly for protocols handling cross-chain transactions. The event highlights a critical challenge: as DeFi composability increases, so does the potential for cascading failures through integrated smart contracts. Expert Analysis on Smart Contract Security Security experts emphasize that exploits of this nature often stem from integration risks . A protocol may be secure in isolation, but its connection to another protocol can introduce unforeseen vulnerabilities. According to common practices cited by auditing firms, the flaw likely involved an assumption about how the SwapNet contract would handle approval calls. The hacker manipulated this assumption to withdraw funds without proper user consent. The response timeline is also critical. Matcha Meta’s team, upon detecting anomalous outflows, reportedly initiated emergency procedures. These procedures included pausing certain contract functions and collaborating with blockchain analytics firms to trace the stolen funds. Historically, the success of fund recovery in such cases remains low, often depending on the hacker’s willingness to negotiate a bounty. This exploit serves as a stark reminder that comprehensive security audits must extend beyond a protocol’s own code to include all integrated third-party components and their interaction patterns. Broader Implications for DeFi Security The $16.8 million loss from the Matcha Meta platform carries significant implications for the entire decentralized finance sector. Primarily, it reinforces the need for continuous, proactive security measures rather than one-time audits. Protocols are now encouraged to implement real-time monitoring and anomaly detection systems that can flag suspicious transaction patterns as they occur. Additionally, the industry may see accelerated adoption of decentralized insurance products to mitigate user losses from such events. Moreover, the exploit places a spotlight on the security of cross-chain bridges. The attacker’s ability to quickly move 3,655 ETH from Base to Ethereum demonstrates both the utility and the risk of these bridging solutions. While they enable liquidity flow, they can also be used to obfuscate the trail of stolen funds. Consequently, future security frameworks will likely require stricter delay mechanisms or multi-signature controls for large bridge transactions originating from aggregators.

Loss Attack Method Matcha Meta March 2025 $16.8M SwapNet Contract Vulnerability AggregatorX Nov 2024 $11.2M Price Oracle Manipulation SwapStream Aug 2024 $7.5M Flash Loan Attack Conclusion The devastating Matcha Meta exploit, resulting in a $16.8 million loss, is a pivotal event for DeFi security in 2025. It clearly illustrates how vulnerabilities in ancillary services like SwapNet can jeopardize even established platforms. The incident underscores the non-negotiable requirement for rigorous, holistic smart contract auditing that covers all integrated systems. Furthermore, it highlights the critical need for robust incident response plans and the potential value of decentralized insurance. As the DeFi ecosystem evolves, the industry’s collective response to breaches like the Matcha Meta hack will fundamentally shape its resilience, trustworthiness, and long-term adoption. FAQs Q1: What is a DEX aggregator like Matcha Meta? A DEX aggregator is a platform that scans multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to find the best possible exchange rate and lowest fees for a user’s trade. Matcha Meta executes the trade across these liquidity sources in a single transaction. Q2: How did the hacker steal funds in the Matcha Meta exploit? The attacker exploited a vulnerability in a smart contract from SwapNet, a service integrated with Matcha Meta. This flaw allowed them to withdraw user funds that had been pre-approved for trading without proper authorization. Q3: Were user wallets directly compromised in this hack? No, individual user wallets were not directly breached. The exploit targeted funds that users had already approved the Matcha Meta platform to access for trading purposes, which were held within the protocol’s smart contracts. Q4: What has been done since the exploit was discovered? The Matcha Meta team likely initiated emergency measures, which can include pausing vulnerable contracts, launching an investigation with security firms, and tracing the stolen funds. They would also be communicating with users and relevant authorities. Q5: What does this mean for the future of DeFi security? This exploit emphasizes that security must extend beyond a single protocol’s code to include all integrated partners and bridges. It will likely accelerate the adoption of more sophisticated monitoring tools, insurance products, and stricter audit standards for cross-protocol interactions.

The Taipei-listed chipmaker jumped 8.6% on Monday, finishing off a 19% surge in 48 hours and closing at a new record high. This rally didn’t come out of nowhere, traders are going wild over the company’s growing work with Google on tensor processing units, or TPUs, which power artificial intelligence systems. That gain also pushed the broader Taiex index to a new high. MediaTek isn’t the only one running. Other Taiwan chip stocks like Nanya Technology and United Microelectronics also rose. But unlike those two, MediaTek is in the spotlight for shifting from plain old smartphone chips to custom AI hardware, exactly what big investors are hunting for now that TSMC is too overloaded to touch. Fund managers switch to MediaTek as TSMC hits exposure limits Let’s be clear. Fund managers aren’t suddenly in love with MediaTek just because it’s trendy. They’re stuck. TSMC’s insane rally has boxed them in. Its shares have exploded since ChatGPT showed up in late 2022, and this month alone, TSMC hit new highs again. But with so many portfolios already maxed out on TSMC, which now takes up almost 12% of indexes like MSCI Emerging Markets and Asia Pacific Ex-Japan, they’ve got no room left. Active managers with 10% single-stock caps are being forced to look elsewhere. So where do they go? Right now, the answer is MediaTek. It’s not just about the Google partnership, though that’s huge. Analysts at Morgan Stanley, including Charlie Chan, said in a Friday note, “We see large potential” in MediaTek’s AI application-specific integrated circuits. They also pointed out that while Google’s also tied up with Broadcom, MediaTek could still get more upside as it shifts resources from phones to AI chips. Meanwhile, Morningstar analyst Phelix Lee called MediaTek’s forecast “conservative,” saying the company only included Google’s orders through October. The market’s betting it’ll beat that. And considering this recent 19% rally, traders clearly think that’s likely. Now back to the TSMC traffic jam. Bulls and bears both can’t get much done because the stock is too crowded. Some investors are trying to game it through ETFs that are heavy on TSMC, or using structured products and swaps with built-in hedges. But even that’s tricky. AI is still running hot, borrowing costs are low, and short sellers don’t want to get burned. TSMC isn’t just sitting still, either.

This powerful consortium aims to develop a comprehensive framework for a Korean won-backed stablecoin, a strategic initiative reported by Maeil Business Newspaper in Seoul, South Korea, on March 21, 2025. Consequently, this partnership signals a concerted effort to build a credible digital alternative to the dominant US dollar-pegged stablecoins that currently govern the global crypto market. The Won Stablecoin Consortium: A Strategic Alliance According to financial sector sources, high-level executives from all three corporations have solidified the agreement. Shinhan Financial Executive Director Jin Ok-dong and Hana Financial Chairman Ham Young-joo reportedly aligned with Samsung’s leadership to launch this ambitious project. Preparations are now actively underway. The consortium’s formation stems from a clear strategic assessment. Specifically, the financial institutions determined that Samsung’s direct participation was not just beneficial but essential. They view the conglomerate’s deep technological expertise and its formidable overseas business network as indispensable assets. Therefore, these assets could provide the won stablecoin with the competitive edge needed to challenge established dollar-based counterparts like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). Context: The Global Stablecoin Landscape and Korea’s Position The global stablecoin market exceeds $150 billion in valuation, yet it remains overwhelmingly dominated by US dollar-linked assets. This dollar hegemony presents both a risk and an opportunity for national economies. For South Korea, a leading technological powerhouse with a vibrant crypto-aware population, developing a sovereign digital currency alternative has become a pressing financial sovereignty issue. Meanwhile, the Bank of Korea continues its separate central bank digital currency (CBDC) trials. However, this private-sector initiative led by Samsung, Shinhan, and Hana could potentially operate in a complementary, wholesale capacity. It targets institutional and cross-border transactions first, leveraging existing private blockchain infrastructure for faster deployment. Expert Analysis: Why This Partnership Makes Strategic Sense Financial technology analysts point to a clear division of labor and synergy within the partnership. Shinhan and Hana Financial bring their core competencies in regulatory compliance, traditional banking infrastructure, and payment systems. Conversely, Samsung contributes its blockchain technology stack, its massive ecosystem of connected devices, and its global B2B and supply chain networks. This combination directly addresses two major hurdles for new stablecoins: trust and utility . A bank-guaranteed reserve and a tech giant’s distribution channel create a compelling value proposition. Furthermore, South Korea’s stringent regulatory environment, guided by the Financial Services Commission (FSC), necessitates such a compliant, institutionally-backed approach from the outset. Potential Impacts and Market Implications The successful launch of a credible won stablecoin could reshape several financial domains. Below is a brief overview of its potential impacts: Cross-Border Trade: Korean exporters and importers could settle transactions directly in digital won, reducing foreign exchange costs and dependency on correspondent banking. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): It could provide a trusted Korean won gateway for DeFi protocols, allowing local investors to access yields without taking on crypto volatility. Digital Asset Markets: Korean crypto exchanges may list the stablecoin as a primary trading pair, reducing reliance on USDT and potential regulatory exposure. Corporate Treasury: Samsung’s vast global operations could use the stablecoin for intra-company settlements and supply chain finance, demonstrating immediate utility. Comparison: Proposed Won Stablecoin vs. Incumbent Models Feature Proposed Won Stablecoin (Samsung/Shinhan/Hana) Typical Dollar Stablecoin (e.g., USDT) Backing Asset Korean Won (KRW) Reserves US Dollar (USD) Reserves Primary Issuers Regulated Korean Financial Institutions + Tech Firm Offshore Crypto Entities Initial Focus Institutional & B2B Cross-Border Use Retail Crypto Trading & DeFi Key Advantage Regulatory Compliance, Ecosystem Integration Network Effect, Liquidity Major Challenge Building International Liquidity & Adoption Ongoing Regulatory Scrutiny The Road Ahead: Challenges and Timeline Despite the formidable alliance, the consortium faces significant challenges. Firstly, they must navigate a complex web of domestic regulations, including the Digital Asset Basic Act. Secondly, building deep liquidity pools outside Korea to rival dollar stablecoins will require strategic partnerships with global exchanges and market makers. Thirdly, they must ensure absolute transparency in reserve attestations to gain user trust globally. Industry observers suggest a phased rollout is likely. An initial pilot for closed-loop business-to-business payments within the partners’ networks could launch within 12-18 months. A broader public and institutional offering would follow, contingent on regulatory milestones and market readiness. Conclusion The partnership between Samsung, Shinhan Financial, and Hana Financial to develop a won stablecoin represents a pivotal moment in the convergence of traditional finance and digital asset innovation. This initiative is not merely about creating another digital currency. Instead, it is a strategic play for financial sovereignty and technological leadership. By combining banking credibility with tech-driven distribution, the consortium is uniquely positioned to launch a competitive digital won. Ultimately, the success of this won stablecoin could redefine South Korea’s role in the future global digital economy, providing a model for other nations seeking to leverage blockchain technology within their regulated financial frameworks. FAQs Q1: What is a won stablecoin? A won stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged 1:1 to the South Korean won (KRW). It is backed by reserves of the fiat currency held in custody by regulated financial institutions. Q2: Why is Samsung involved in a financial project like this? Samsung brings critical technological infrastructure, blockchain expertise, and a vast global business network. Its participation is seen as essential for providing the technical platform and ensuring the stablecoin has immediate utility in real-world commerce and supply chains. Q3: How is this different from the digital won the Bank of Korea is testing? The Bank of Korea’s project is a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), a direct digital liability of the central bank. This private consortium’s stablecoin would be a privately issued digital asset backed by bank-held won reserves, likely focusing on different use cases like wholesale and cross-border transactions. Q4: What are the main benefits of a Korean won stablecoin? Key benefits include reducing foreign exchange costs for Korean businesses, providing a safe Korean won-denominated entry point into digital assets, enhancing the efficiency of cross-border payments, and promoting the international use of the Korean won. Q5: When can we expect this won stablecoin to launch? No official launch date has been announced. Based on typical development and regulatory timelines for such projects, industry analysts speculate a controlled pilot program could begin within 12-18 months, with a full public launch depending on regulatory approvals.

Developed by Nomadic Labs, Trilitech, and Functori, Tallinn is the 20th protocol upgrade, marking 20 evolutions of the Tezos blockchain, proposed, adopted, and seamlessly activated by the protocol itself. “Adapting to market demand 20 times over 7 years without network disruptions, and in a fully decentralized way, is undeniable proof of Tezos’ reliability and future-proof design,” said Yann Régis-Gianas, Head of Engineering at Nomadic Labs. ” The Tallinn upgrade shortens Tezos Layer-1 block time to 6 seconds, reducing latency and speeding up finality on the network’s censorship-resistant settlement layer. This pairs naturally with Etherlink, Tezos’ EVM-compatible Layer-2, which already confirms transactions in under 50 milliseconds, now backed by Layer-1 finality in two blocks, or 12 seconds. Tallinn also enables all bakers (network validators) to attest to every block, instead of a subset of bakers, which brings stronger security and more predictable staking rewards. This is achieved through the use of BLS cryptographic signatures, which aggregate hundreds of signatures into just one per block. By lightening the load on nodes, it also opens the door to further block time reductions. Finally, Tallinn introduces an ‘Address Indexing Registry’ that can improve storage efficiency by up to 100x for apps using the Michelson runtime. It is done by eliminating redundant address data, and apps adopting this feature will benefit from lower costs and higher potential throughput. “Based on inputs from Tezos builders, our development team is excited to be able to offer such drastic improvements for enterprise-scale apps, large NFT ledgers, and other setups storing many addresses,” said Yann Régis-Gianas, Head of Engineering at Nomadic Labs. Since launching in 2018, the Tezos blockchain has continued to evolve seamlessly through protocol upgrades, with each activation introducing a series of features designed to improve the overall experience of using and building on the network. Tallinn is another forkless step forward in making Tezos faster, more secure, and optimized for enterprise use, with no compromise on decentralization, and further proof of the network’s ability to quickly adapt to user needs and ensure longevity through continuous innovation and optimization. About Tezos Tezos is an open-source and energy-efficient blockchain designed to empower institutions, developers, and businesses and facilitate value transfer in a digital environment. It is designed for the scalable deployment of decentralized applications. As one of the first Proof of Stake blockchains, Tezos is globally supported and valued for its strong governance, long-term upgradability, and smart contract capabilities.

HSBC plans to increase its return on tangible equity forecast beyond its present guidance of “mid teens or better,” two sources revealed. NatWest intends to boost its 2027 projection from the current 15% to possibly 17%, the sources added. Analysts predict significant target increases Barclays, which stated in October that it planned to attain 12% or higher ROTE by 2026, is also ready to improve its predictions, according to a third source familiar with the bank. Financial analysts predic t bo th Barclays and HSBC could raise their aims by up to 200 basis points when they outline their strategies for the following years. Barclays will report earnings on February 10, while HSBC will do so on February 25. Across continental Europe, many banks have already raised their profitability targets, indicating that they believe favorable interest rate conditions will persist for many years. When banks set higher profitability goals, it shows they expect ongoing benefits from favorable interest rate environments and steady growth in lending and fee-based revenue. But setting ambitious targets carries some risks and may leave shareholders disappointed if economic conditions weaken. Analysts at Jefferies said earlier this month that Lloyds Banking Group might also increase its targets this year, potentially aiming for an ROTE reaching 18.5% by 2028, compared to this year’s objective of above 15%. All the banks mentioned refused to provide statements on the matter. Peter Rothwell, who leads the banking division at KPMG UK, explained the situation: “UK banks have benefited from earnings resilience lasting longer than initially expected, supported by higher interest rates, robust credit quality, and tighter cost control.” The European banking sector’s earnings season begin s Th ursday, when Lloyds and Deutsche Bank report their full-year results, following Wall Street banks’ stellar performance numbers. Following years of low profitability and lackluster stock performance in the aftermath of the financial crisis, European banking shares have grown dramatically. The sector’s worth has more than doubled since early 2024, and it has risen 60% in the last year, outpacing American banks. European rivals set ambitious profitability goals Among European competitors, Spanish banks Santander and BBVA have managed to increase revenue while keeping costs under control, creating expectations for better target announcements. Analysts at Barclays suggeste d Sa ntander could target a 2028 ROTE around 19-20%, up from the 16.1% recorded as of September. Deutsche Bank of Germany established a new 2028 ROTE target exceeding 13% back in November, higher than its 2025 goal of 10%. Experts anticipat e De utsche will confirm it met the 2025 target, alongside results that could show its biggest profit since 2007. Volatile markets and increased corporate deal activity should also lift investment banking profits, helping institutions like Deutsche, Barclays, and UBS, after most Wall Street firms reported rising revenues and optimistic forecasts. However, French banks such as Société Générale, BNP Paribas, and Crédit Agricole are unlikely to follow this favorable trend, as increasing expenses and domestic market competition are predicted to reduce profitability, according to analysts. The coming weeks will determine if these British banking behemoths can meet market expectations and sustain the momentum that has propelled European banking equities to new highs in recent months.

The growing adoption rate of the XRP Ledger Protocol could push XRP to an average price of $6.55, with a possible maximum trading value of $7.11 in 2028. In 2032, the target price for XRP is between $13.47 and $14.59, with an average price of $14.03. XRP has a strong community of supporters and developers and continues to see tremendous potential in Ripple’s technology and products. Despite short-term price fluctuations and a bear market, many analysts believe XRP has a bright future. Whether it will reach new highs or continue to grow steadily remains to be seen, and despite its history of legal battles with the Securities and Exchange Commission, this digital asset will undoubtedly play an important role in global financial institutions. So, how high can XRP realistically go? Will XRP reach 5 dollars? Let’s answer these questions in our XRP price prediction.

In the past 24 hours, the bulls took the lead, thereby creating favorable circumstances for the investors. As a result, the coin value has recovered to $1.89 because of the increasing momentum today. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple, along with the rising adoption, might boost the XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisitions and CBDC developments make XRP a good long-term investment option. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. It is advised to proceed with caution. Why is XRP up? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has increased despite a strong correction observed yesterday when the coin’s price decreased to $1.83, but it has increased to $1.89 today. How much will XRP cost in 2026? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $2.81 by the end of 2026. Will XRP reach $5? If demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent, the coin could approach $5 by 2027. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.65, achieved on July 18, 2025. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a chance of reaching near $20 but not before 2032. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Still, the token provides a good buying opportunity to investors looking for long-term goals. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is expected to reach a maximum price of $14.59 by 2032, making it a valuable asset, particularly with the continued efforts of Ripple Labs. However, some regulatory uncertainties still exist for XRP. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Cryptopolitan reported that XRP trading was twice as volatile as BTC trading in 2025. On-chain data revealed that XRP recorded 80% realized volatility during the past year, highlighting a need for deeper liquidity to achieve stability. To maintain liquidity flow, Ripple released 1 billion XRP tokens in three tranches on January 1, 2026. 🚨 XRP ESCROW MOVE 🚨 1 BILLION $XRP unlocked from escrow in minutes, catching the market’s attention fast.

XRP historic price sentiment XRP price history: Coinmarketcap Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted to as low as $0.31, significantly decreasing XRP market cap. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March and to $1.79 in April. By the middle of May, XRP touched $2.57, and in July, it marked a new all-time high of $3.65. Near the start of August 2025, XRP was trending above $3, showing significant growth as the market sentiment was tilting toward the positive side; however, it lost $3 by the end of the month. In October through November, XRP traded around $1.83 to $3.10. At the start of December, XRP is trading around $1.99 to $2.18. XRP entered 2026 in a corrective phase, trending near $1.8, as the broader crypto market is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|XRP|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-26 09:20:51

The cryptocurrency is trading just below a resistance level that has remained unchanged for over eight years. Recent analysis by crypto analyst ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) highlights the potential for significant price movement if this barrier is breached. Historical data suggest that when XRP breaks such multi-year resistance, the asset often experiences accelerated gains. According to the analyst, breaking this resistance is XRP’s entrance to Valhalla . Based on previous data, when $XRP breaks multi-year resistance levels, it catapults Right now, there is an 8 year resistance wall that's waiting to be broken… In simple terms, this is the entrance to Valhalla pic.twitter.com/Zj9PRGbeCH — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) January 23, 2026 Historical Resistance Breaks The chart shared by ChartNerd shows two notable resistance levels. The first, a multi-year resistance, was broken in 2017 after an extended period of price consolidation. Following this breakout, XRP surged considerably, rising to its previous all-time high. This move indicates that overcoming long-standing resistance can trigger strong upward momentum. The chart suggests a similar pattern may occur with the current eight-year resistance wall. XRP already tested this resistance when it hit a new all-time high in July, and the breakout could be imminent. The prior breakout illustrates the market’s tendency to compress prices for extended periods before producing a decisive move. In the earlier case, XRP’s price consolidated and volatility decreased until the breakout occurred. The pattern indicates that history could repeat itself if the current resistance level is surpassed. Current Market Structure XRP’s current price activity indicates consolidation just below the multi-year resistance level. ChartNerd highlights this barrier as the next key level to watch, noting, “Right now, there is an eight-year resistance wall that’s waiting to be broken.” The chart visualizes this resistance with a red line and marks potential areas of upward expansion with green ellipses. The current consolidation resembles previous periods when XRP traded within tight ranges before significant upward movement. Price compression, combined with low volatility, often precedes substantial advances. Analysts observing the chart see this as a clear setup for a potential breakout.

This development represents a critical moment for blockchain gaming platforms operating within one of Asia’s most sophisticated digital asset markets. DAXA Investment Warning: Understanding the Regulatory Action South Korea’s Digital Asset eXchange Alliance announced its member exchanges have placed Oasys under an investment warning. This regulatory action follows established protocols within the Korean financial ecosystem. DAXA, comprising South Korea’s major cryptocurrency exchanges, functions as a self-regulatory organization. The alliance coordinates market monitoring and investor protection measures across participating platforms. The investment warning mechanism represents a precautionary measure rather than an immediate delisting. Exchanges typically implement additional monitoring when issuing such warnings. They may require enhanced disclosures from project teams. Investors often face trading restrictions or receive prominent risk notifications during warning periods. This system aims to protect market participants while allowing projects to address regulatory concerns. Oasys (OAS) Platform and Market Position Analysis Oasys operates as a specialized blockchain designed specifically for gaming applications. The platform utilizes a unique dual-layer architecture separating execution from consensus. This design theoretically enables faster transactions and lower fees for gaming applications. Major gaming companies including Square Enix, Sega, and Bandai Namco have participated in the Oasys ecosystem development. The OAS token serves multiple functions within the Oasys blockchain environment. It facilitates transaction fees, enables staking for network security, and supports governance mechanisms. Before the DAXA warning, Oasys had demonstrated steady adoption within the blockchain gaming sector. Several play-to-earn and traditional gaming projects had launched on its infrastructure. Oasys (OAS) Key Metrics Before DAXA Warning Metric Value Market Capitalization Approximately $450 million 24-Hour Trading Volume $85-120 million range Korean Exchange Presence Listed on 4 major DAXA members Network Transactions Average 150,000 daily Active Gaming Projects 38 live applications Regulatory Context and Precedent Cases South Korea’s cryptocurrency regulatory environment has evolved significantly since 2021. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) implemented the Virtual Asset User Protection Act in 2024. This legislation established clear guidelines for exchange operations and investor safeguards. DAXA functions as the frontline implementation body for these regulations across member exchanges. Previous investment warnings provide important context for the Oasys situation. In 2023, DAXA issued similar warnings against three other tokens. Two addressed concerns about inadequate disclosures. One involved questions about transaction monitoring compliance. All three projects underwent review periods ranging from 30 to 90 days. One token eventually faced delisting after failing to address regulatory concerns adequately. Immediate Market Impact and Trading Responses The DAXA announcement triggered immediate market reactions across Korean exchanges. OAS trading pairs experienced increased volatility following the warning disclosure. Trading volumes spiked approximately 180% during the first 24 hours after the announcement. Price movements reflected typical risk-off behavior among Korean investors subject to the warning restrictions. Korean exchanges implemented standard procedures following the DAXA directive. These measures included: Enhanced risk notifications displayed prominently on trading interfaces Trading restrictions for new investors without proper risk acknowledgments Increased monitoring of unusual trading patterns or volume spikes Information requests to the Oasys development team regarding specific concerns International exchanges without DAXA membership showed more muted reactions. Global OAS trading pairs experienced moderate volatility but maintained normal operations. This divergence highlights the segmented nature of cryptocurrency markets across different regulatory jurisdictions. Potential Concerns Behind the Regulatory Action While DAXA hasn’t disclosed specific reasons publicly, regulatory patterns suggest several possible concerns. Korean authorities typically focus on transparency, compliance, and investor protection issues. The gaming-focused nature of Oasys presents unique regulatory considerations. These may include in-game asset classifications, gambling adjacency concerns, or age-appropriate access controls. Other potential factors could involve: Disclosure adequacy regarding project developments or team changes Transaction monitoring capabilities for anti-money laundering compliance Technical stability or security audit concerns Market manipulation monitoring across gaming token economies Cross-border regulatory alignment with international standards Industry Expert Perspectives and Analysis Financial regulation specialists note the systematic nature of Korea’s approach. “DAXA warnings represent preventive medicine for crypto markets,” explains Professor Kim Min-ji of Seoul National University’s Fintech Research Center. “The system allows issues to surface before they become crises, protecting both investors and legitimate projects.” Blockchain gaming analysts highlight the sector’s regulatory challenges. “Gaming tokens exist at the intersection of multiple regulatory frameworks,” notes industry consultant Park Ji-hoon. “They combine elements of utility tokens, in-game currencies, and potentially securities depending on their implementation. This complexity requires careful navigation, especially in mature markets like South Korea.” Comparative Analysis: Global Regulatory Approaches South Korea’s DAXA system represents a unique regulatory model. Other jurisdictions employ different mechanisms for cryptocurrency oversight. The United States utilizes SEC enforcement actions and CFTC classifications. Japan operates through the Financial Services Agency’s registered exchange system. The European Union implements MiCA regulations across member states. Each approach reflects different regulatory philosophies and market structures. Korea’s exchange alliance model leverages industry self-regulation with government oversight. This hybrid approach aims to balance innovation protection with investor safeguards. The Oasys warning demonstrates this system in action, providing a case study for other jurisdictions considering similar frameworks. Potential Outcomes and Resolution Pathways The Oasys development team now faces a critical response period. Successful resolution typically involves transparent communication with DAXA and addressing identified concerns. Previous cases suggest several possible outcomes based on project responses and regulatory evaluations. Possible resolution scenarios include: Warning lifted after satisfactory compliance measures Extended monitoring period with additional requirements Trading restrictions maintained with specific conditions Delisting proceedings if concerns remain unresolved The timeline for resolution varies based on issue complexity. Simple disclosure matters might resolve within 30 days. More substantial compliance concerns could extend to 90 days or longer. The Oasys team’s responsiveness and cooperation will significantly influence both timeline and outcome. Broader Implications for Blockchain Gaming Sector This DAXA action carries implications beyond Oasys specifically. The blockchain gaming sector faces increasing regulatory scrutiny globally. South Korea represents a particularly important market for gaming innovations. Regulatory clarity benefits legitimate projects while weeding out non-compliant operations. Other gaming-focused blockchain platforms will likely review their compliance postures following this development. The incident highlights the importance of proactive regulatory engagement for specialized blockchain applications. Gaming projects may need to implement enhanced monitoring and disclosure mechanisms to satisfy evolving standards. Conclusion The DAXA investment warning against Oasys (OAS) represents a significant development in South Korea’s cryptocurrency regulatory landscape. This action demonstrates the maturation of Korea’s hybrid regulatory approach through the Digital Asset eXchange Alliance. The situation highlights the increasing sophistication of cryptocurrency oversight mechanisms in major markets. For Oasys specifically, the coming weeks will determine whether the project can address regulatory concerns and resume normal operations on Korean exchanges. For the broader blockchain gaming sector, this incident underscores the importance of regulatory compliance and transparent operations in increasingly structured digital asset markets. The DAXA investment warning system continues to evolve as a model for balancing innovation protection with investor safeguards in dynamic cryptocurrency ecosystems. FAQs Q1: What does a DAXA investment warning mean for Oasys (OAS) investors? Korean exchanges implement additional safeguards including prominent risk notifications and potential trading restrictions. Investors should review exchange communications carefully and consider their risk tolerance during the warning period. Q2: How long do DAXA investment warnings typically last? Warning periods vary based on issue complexity, ranging from 30 to 90 days in most cases. The duration depends on how quickly the project addresses regulatory concerns to DAXA’s satisfaction. Q3: Can Oasys be traded on international exchanges during the DAXA warning? Yes, international exchanges without DAXA membership continue normal OAS trading. However, investors should verify each platform’s specific policies regarding tokens under regulatory scrutiny elsewhere. Q4: What percentage of Oasys trading occurs on Korean exchanges? Approximately 35-40% of OAS trading volume typically occurs on Korean exchanges. This substantial market share makes DAXA compliance particularly important for the project’s liquidity and accessibility. Q5: Has DAXA issued similar warnings against other gaming blockchain tokens? This represents one of the first major gaming-focused blockchain tokens to receive a DAXA investment warning. The action may signal increased regulatory attention on gaming token economies and their compliance requirements.

Matcha Meta disclosed on Monday that it suffered a security exploit over the weekend, where attackers swindled tokens from an external aggregator integrated into Matcha Meta’s interface called SwapNet. The platform said users who disabled its “One-Time Approvals” feature and granted direct token permissions to individual aggregators were at risk of losing their funds. We are aware of an incident with SwapNet that users may have been exposed to on Matcha Meta for those who turned off One-Time Approvals We are in contact with the SwapNet team and they have temporarily disabled their contracts The team is actively investigating and will provide… — Matcha Meta 🎆 (@matchametaxyz) January 25, 2026 In the swap aggregator’s statement on X, MM said it became aware of suspicious activity after records of large, unauthorized token movements from SwapNet’s router contract appeared on transactional records. The platform confirmed it had contacted the SwapNet team, which “temporarily disabled its contracts” to prevent more losses. Matcha Meta hacker swapped 3k Ether coins from victims According to the blockchain security firm PeckShield , the attacker drained funds via token approvals and swaps. They moved approximately 10.5 million USDC from victim addresses on the Base, an Ether layer-2 blockchain, then swapped the stablecoins for 3,655 Ether, consolidating value into a more liquid asset. After completing the swaps, the attacker began bridging the Ether from Base to the Ethereum mainnet to hide any transaction trails. Bridging is the process of transferring assets between blockchains using smart contracts or intermediary protocols. Although it is considered “legitimate” in most cases, hackers use it because it makes it nearly impossible to track their operations. The perpetrator had previously granted token allowances to move funds without the user’s signature, which grants permission for a smart contract to spend their tokens. If an allowance is set to unlimited, a malicious or compromised contract can drain funds until the balance is depleted. Matcha Meta said users who interacted with the platform using its One-Time Approval system were not impacted. That feature routes token permissions through 0x’s AllowanceHolder and Settler contracts, limiting a trader’s exposure by granting approvals for a single transaction. “After reviewing with 0x’s protocol team, we have confirmed that the nature of the incident was not associated with 0x’s AllowanceHolder or Settler contracts,” Matcha Meta wrote on X later on. The company added that users who disabled One-Time Approvals and set direct allowances on aggregator contracts “assume the risks of each aggregator.” After reviewing with 0x's protocol team, we have confirmed that the nature of the incident was not associated with 0x's AllowanceHolder or Settler contracts.

Users who have disabled One-Time… https://t.co/VQVmj4LL0F — Matcha Meta 🎆 (@matchametaxyz) January 25, 2026 The DEX swap platform removed the function for users to set direct allowances on aggregators through its interface, while asking the community to revoke any existing permissions on SwapNet’s router contract. DeFi smart contract hacks persist in 2026 The Matcha Meta incident comes just six days after Makina Finance, a decentralized finance protocol with automated execution features, suffered a network breach that drained its DUSD/USDC liquidity pool on Curve. As reported by Cryptopolitan, hackers extracted about 1,299 Ether from Makina’s Curve stablecoin pool, worth $4.13 million at the time. The breach involved non-custodial liquidity providers connected to an on-chain pricing oracle, a data feed used by smart contracts to determine asset values. Per the blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, much of today’s dark web money laundering involves coin swap services, including instant exchanges that run through standalone websites or Telegram channels. Last year, the decentralized exchange aggregator CoWSwap reported a breach that resulted in losses of more than $180,000. About $180,000 worth of DAI was stolen through CoWSwap’s trade execution GPv2Settlement smart contract. The platform said the compromised contract had access only to protocol fees collected over one week, stemming from the exploitation of a solver account. In CoWSwap’s model, users sign trade intents that are passed to third-party solvers, which compete to provide the best prices and store collected fees.

57475132,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=265328,1769419811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Cryptocurrency Bull Market Demands Ruthless Elimination of Junk Coins, Analyst Warns",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/cryptocurrency-bull-market-junk-coins/,"BitcoinWorld Cryptocurrency Bull Market Demands Ruthless Elimination of Junk Coins, Analyst Warns For the global cryptocurrency market to achieve a genuine, sustainable bull run, a painful but necessary purge of thousands of speculative ‘junk coins’ must occur first, according to a leading industry analyst. Benjamin Cowen, founder of the research firm Into The Cryptoverse, presented this stark assessment in recent commentary, framing market purification not as a setback but as a critical precondition for long-term health. His analysis, reported by financial outlet YouToday, strikes at the structural heart of the digital asset ecosystem as it navigates post-2024 market cycles. This perspective challenges prevailing narratives of imminent, broad-based rallies, instead advocating for a period of consolidation where capital flows away from weak projects and toward foundational assets with demonstrable utility. The Structural Weakness of Speculative Crypto Assets Benjamin Cowen’s central thesis identifies a core vulnerability within the current cryptocurrency landscape. He argues that a significant portion of the thousands of existing digital tokens lack intrinsic demand or real-world utility. Consequently, these assets rely almost exclusively on speculative trading momentum and abundant market liquidity for their valuation. This creates a fragile ecosystem. When macroeconomic conditions tighten and liquidity contracts, as seen during Federal Reserve rate-hiking cycles, this structural weakness becomes brutally exposed. Historical data supports this view. For instance, the 2022 crypto winter saw the total market capitalization plummet from approximately $3 trillion to under $1 trillion. During this decline, a disproportionate amount of value evaporated from smaller, less-established projects. Many tokens lost over 95% of their value and effectively became illiquid. Cowen describes this Darwinian process not as a market failure, but as an essential market function. It serves to normalize capital allocation by redirecting investment from unsound ventures to those with robust fundamentals. Speculative Momentum: Many coins surge based on hype, social media trends, or influencer promotion rather than technological progress or user adoption. Liquidity Dependence: These assets are highly sensitive to changes in the broader financial environment, particularly the availability of cheap capital. Utility Deficit: A lack of clear, necessary use cases beyond trading makes them vulnerable during downturns. The Dangerous Optimism of Premature Altcoin Season Predictions Furthermore, Cowen directly cautions against the prevalent optimism from some market influencers who frequently predict an imminent ‘altcoin season.’ This term refers to a period where alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) significantly outperform Bitcoin. He labels such predictions as potentially dangerous without concurrent, fundamental improvements to overall market structure. The promise of quick, widespread altcoin gains can lure retail investors into projects that are fundamentally unsound, setting the stage for substantial losses when the speculative bubble inevitably deflates. This cycle has repeated multiple times. The 2017-2018 cycle saw an explosion of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), many of which failed to deliver products. Similarly, the 2021 cycle featured a boom in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) projects, with a significant subset later abandoned. Cowen’s warning suggests that heralding a new altcoin season before the market has shed these weak projects merely replants the seeds for the next downturn. True, sustainable growth requires a foundation built on quality, not quantity. Expert Angle: The Capital Concentration Thesis Cowen emphasizes a crucial economic principle: capital is finite. In a market flooded with options, capital becomes diluted across too many assets, preventing any single project from achieving the critical mass needed for ecosystem development and stability. He posits that capital can only effectively concentrate on high-quality, innovative assets once the ‘zombie’ tokens and worthless projects are removed from the equation. This process, while harsh, ultimately revitalizes the industry. It allows developers, users, and investors to focus resources on protocols solving real problems, such as scaling solutions, privacy enhancements, or real-world asset tokenization. This viewpoint aligns with traditional financial theory on market cycles. Bear markets historically cleanse excess and misallocation, setting the stage for healthier expansions. For example, the dot-com bubble burst eliminated countless internet companies with no viable business models, allowing capital and talent to consolidate around firms like Amazon and Google that defined the next era. Cowen applies this same logic to crypto, suggesting that the industry’s maturation depends on this difficult winnowing process. Historical Context and the Path to a Genuine Bull Market The call for market purification is not new, but its urgency is amplified by the crypto industry’s evolving regulatory landscape and institutional adoption. As major financial institutions and corporations explore blockchain integration, the presence of a vast sea of junk coins presents reputational and operational risks. Regulatory bodies, like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have increasingly focused on distinguishing between securities and utility tokens, a process that may accelerate the demise of non-compliant projects. A genuine bull market, in Cowen’s framework, would be characterized not just by rising prices, but by sustainable metrics: growing active addresses, increased transaction volumes for utility (not just speculation), and development activity on core protocols. It would be led by assets that demonstrate clear value propositions rather than mere speculative appeal. This transition requires patience and a tolerance for short-term volatility as the market finds its true north. Conclusion Benjamin Cowen’s analysis presents a sobering yet ultimately constructive vision for the cryptocurrency market’s future. A true and lasting cryptocurrency bull market, he contends, is impossible without first undergoing the difficult process of eliminating the junk coins that clog the ecosystem and misallocate precious capital. This purification phase, though often conflated with bear market despair, is the essential groundwork for sustainable growth. It paves the way for capital to concentrate on high-quality assets with real utility, thereby building a more resilient, innovative, and mature digital economy for the long term. FAQs Q1: What does Benjamin Cowen mean by ‘junk coins’? He refers to cryptocurrencies that have no fundamental utility, real demand, or sustainable economic model. These assets exist primarily for speculative trading and often fail when market liquidity decreases. Q2: Why is the elimination of these coins necessary for a bull market? It allows finite investment capital to concentrate on projects with genuine value and innovation. This creates a healthier, more sustainable market foundation rather than one bloated by speculation. Q3: What is an ‘altcoin season,’ and why is Cowen cautious about it? An altcoin season is a period where alternative cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin. Cowen warns that predicting such a season before weak projects are purged can lure investors into unsound assets, potentially causing significant losses when hype fades. Q4: How does a bear market help ‘purify’ the crypto ecosystem? Bear markets reduce liquidity and speculative fervor. This exposes projects that cannot survive without constant new investment, causing them to fail. This process reallocates resources, including developer talent and user attention, to more robust projects. Q5: What are the signs of a ‘genuine’ bull market versus a speculative bubble?

In a recent post on X, Buterin said he no longer agrees with a 2017 statement in which he dismissed the idea of users fully validating blockchains themselves as a “weird mountain man fantasy,” arguing that both technology and real-world experience have reshaped his view. The idea of average users personally validating the entire history of the system is a weird mountain man fantasy. There, I said it. — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) June 9, 2017 The comment revisits a long-running debate in blockchain design that dates back to Ethereum’s early years. What Changed Since 2017? ZK Proofs Rewrite a Classic Blockchain Argument In 2017, Buterin sparred publicly with blockchain theorist Ian Grigg over whether blockchains should store full state, such as account balances and smart contract data, directly on-chain. Grigg argued that chains only needed to record transaction ordering, with state reconstructed locally and discarded. Buterin was a vehement opponent of such a design at the time, citing that such a design would require users to constantly rerun the whole transaction history or utilize third-party RPC services to get the current state. At the time, Buterin claimed that Ethereum was better compromised with the design where state roots are pegged to block headers. Using Merkle proofs and an honest majority assumption for proof-of-work or proof-of-stake, users would be able to check a certain value without going through a single intermediary. Vitalik Buterin: Verkle Trees Implementation to Benefit Ethereum Stakers and Network Nodes Ethereum co-founder @VitalikButerin has highlighted the advantages of implementing Verkle Trees within Ethereum’s staking protocol. #CryptoNews #news https://t.co/Ep7l0NaPr9 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 19, 2024 Making the entire chain completely self-validating, he said, was in theory attractive but computationally impractical to ordinary users, unless the network grossly constrained its capacity. The difference, as explained by Buterin, is the maturation of zero-knowledge cryptography, specifically zk-SNARKs . These cryptographic evidences enable a user to prove that a group of calculations has been done right without re-running all the processes or showing the data behind the scenes. Why Vitalik Buterin Now Sees ZK-SNARKs as Ethereum’s Safety Net To him, it is like finding an inexpensive, one-size-fits-all solution after years of trade-off disputes. He claimed that with zk-SNARKs , Ethereum could obtain the security of full verification without necessarily subjecting users to prohibitive costs. I no longer agree with this previous tweet of mine – since 2017, I have become a much more willing connoisseur of mountains. It's worth explaining why. https://t.co/SRvRtuFKQu First, the original context. That tweet was in a debate with Ian Grigg, who argued that blockchains… — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 26, 2026 Buterin said this advance allows Ethereum to revisit trade-offs that were once accepted reluctantly, especially around scalability, decentralization, and verification. He also acknowledged that his earlier thinking relied too heavily on idealized assumptions. In practice, he noted, networks experience outages, latency spikes, service shutdowns, and regulatory or social pressure that can push intermediaries to censor applications or users. In those moments, reliance on third parties or developer intervention can become a single point of failure. That perspective underpins his renewed support for what he described metaphorically as the “mountain man’s cabin,” a fallback option that allows users to directly interact with the chain when everything else breaks. Inside Ethereum’s Growing Push Toward ZK-Based Scaling There has been a growing focus on Zk-SNARKs in the roadmap of Ethereum, especially in the form of zero-knowledge rollups. These layer-2 networks reduce fees significantly by offloading thousands of transactions and making a single cryptographic proof to Ethereum. Even projects like zkSync, StarkNet, Scroll, and others are already based on these methods, but with various trade-offs in the size of the proof, transparency, and the cost of calculation. Mid-2025 community proposals stated that off-chain personal data and using cryptographic proofs might be a solution to align Ethereum with European rules on data protection. Ethereum community member Eugenio Reggianini has proposed a technical framework to align Ethereum with EU GDPR rules. #eth #eu #ethereum https://t.co/zDmQpFh647 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 9, 2025 ZK-SNARKs were mentioned as a method of enabling validators to verify that data is correct without access to it, minimizing on-chain access. On the protocol layer, Buterin has additionally admitted that there are certain remnants of legacy design that now pose a bottleneck to Ethereum’s ambitions to go zero-knowledge. In late 2025, he proposed removing the modular exponentiation precompile , a feature he originally introduced, after it proved to be a major bottleneck for generating zk proofs.

The widespread shutdowns mark one of the largest coordinated mining curtailments since the 2021 Texas grid crisis, with FoundryUSA’s hashrate dropping nearly 60% since Friday. Real-time data from Mining Pool Stats shows FoundryUSA’s hashrate fell from approximately 340 EH/s to roughly 242 EH/s over the weekend, while Luxor recorded a similar decline from about 45 EH/s to around 26 EH/s. Smaller reductions appeared across Antpool and Binance Pool, though these pools serve less U.S.-concentrated operations, suggesting total curtailments may exceed the initial 110 EH/s estimate, The Miner Mag reported. UPDATE: #Bitcoin hashrate on FoundryUSA is down by nearly 200 EH/s, or 60%, since Friday amid continued curtailment. Temporary block production slows down to 12 minutes https://t.co/e51LyWoxjs pic.twitter.com/uIrCD5JudD — TheMinerMag (@TheMinerMag_) January 25, 2026 Grid Operators Report Stability Despite Extreme Cold The hashrate pullback coincided with a severe Arctic air mass pushing subfreezing temperatures, snow, and ice deep into the central and eastern United States. Grid operators across multiple states issued conservation alerts as heating demand surged, yet Texas’s grid operator ERCOT reported on Friday that conditions remained stable despite the cold weather. The stability contrasts sharply with February 2021, when Winter Storm Uri triggered widespread outages and prolonged blackouts across the state. Since that crisis, Texas has added substantial large-load capacity, much of it tied to Bitcoin mining and data center operations. Unlike traditional industrial loads, many Bitcoin miners participate in demand response programs, allowing them to rapidly curtail consumption during periods of grid stress. As noted by The Miner Mag , this flexible-load model represents a dynamic shift from the 2021 scenario, when such infrastructure did not exist to support grid balancing during extreme weather events. The U.S. #AI compute boom is running into a familiar problem. Local communities aren’t buying it. If this sounds familiar to #bitcoin miners, that’s because it is. — TheMinerMag (@TheMinerMag_) January 23, 2026 Singapore-based miner Bitdeer, which operates over 293,000 rigs globally, including facilities in Texas, said in a statement that it does not anticipate major disruptions from the storm. A company spokesperson explained that the Electric Reliability Council of Texas considers Bitcoin miners “ large flexible loads ,” meaning they can curtail electricity usage on request, unlike other industrial users with firm electrical demands. “ Bitdeer stands ready to fully support the grid should supply constraints occur, ” the spokesperson added. The curtailments come as Bitcoin’s seven-day average network hashrate had already declined to about 992 EH/s, down roughly 13.7% from the all-time high of above 1.15 ZH/s reached in October, according to data reported by The Miner Mag last week. The moderation follows Bitcoin’s market price falling nearly 30% from its October peak , prolonging pressure on mining economics by keeping competition for block rewards elevated even as revenues per unit of computing power fell. Storm Threatens 60 Million People Across 1,800 Miles The massive winter storm extends for 1,800 miles from far west Texas to the mid-Atlantic coast, threatening to affect upwards of 60 million people across more than a dozen states, according to AccuWeather . Source: AccuWeather AccuWeather Senior Vice President Evan Myers warned that the combination of snow, ice, and bitter cold across such a large area would “ stall daily life for days, ” with some power outages lasting through extended periods as Arctic air charges in behind the storm. About 60 million people will experience icing conditions, with potentially 1 million people without power for an extended period, AccuWeather estimated. AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter noted that many areas hit hard by Hurricane Helene in September 2024 still have temporary power lines that “ may come down more easily than permanent lines, ” potentially stretching recovery resources and personnel to the limit across North Carolina and other affected states. The storm’s intensity has already prompted thousands of flight cancellations across the region as airlines deal with displaced aircraft and crews. Source: AccuWeather AccuWeather Storm Warning Meteorologist William Clark cautioned that “ entire supply chains may break down from prolonged days of extensive interstate closures, ” warning that critical supplies, including pharmaceuticals and basic necessities, may become scarce in the hardest-hit areas. The United States controls nearly 38% of the global Bitcoin hashrate according to estimates from Hashrate Index , making American mining operations critical to network security.

Over the past seven days, the asset has dropped by more than 5%. In the last 24 hours, it slipped nearly 1%. Analyst Sees Corrective Bounce Forming Crypto analyst Junkie says Bitcoin has completed a five-wave bearish pattern based on Elliott Wave Theory, which often marks the end of a move. The analyst expects a short-term bounce before any further decline. The chart shared shows a potential ABC correction forming. This includes a rise (A), a dip (B), and another push up (C). If this plays out, Bitcoin could retest a trendline from previous lows and possibly reach the $91,000 to $92,000 range. Junkie added: “We may have a bit further down to go ($84k) until 5 waves finishes but if we haven’t reversed already, we will.” A separate view from The Maverick of Wall Street points to a bear flag forming on the weekly chart. This type of setup often appears after a sharp fall. It forms a small upward channel, followed by another drop.

This matches a 31% fall from the recent range. Bitcoin has also fallen below its 50-week simple moving average (SMA), which is around $101,000. The 200-week SMA, near $57,800, may be the next support if the downtrend continues. On-Chain Metrics Point to Ongoing Weakness Data from Alphractal shows that Bitcoin’s NUPL (Net Unrealized Profit/Loss) is falling but still above zero. In the past, cycle bottoms usually came only after this turned negative. That level signals full capitulation, which has not happened yet. Another key metric, Delta Growth Rate, has already turned negative. This suggests that speculative buying has slowed. A recent CryptoQuant report also shows that more holders are now selling at a loss. This is the first time in over two years that profit margins have dropped this much. Bitcoin’s drop below $88,000 happened as macro pressures built. A possible US government shutdown and the Fed’s rate decision have made investors more cautious.

According to comprehensive data from CryptoBasic, this systematic reduction of company-controlled tokens represents one of the most significant wealth transfers in digital asset history, coinciding with XRP’s extraordinary 31,000% price appreciation over the same period. The company’s transparent approach to token distribution provides crucial insights into how blockchain projects can balance initial funding needs with long-term decentralization goals. Ripple’s XRP Sales Strategy and Market Impact CryptoBasic’s detailed analysis reveals that Ripple and its executives have sold approximately 58.5 billion XRP tokens since the cryptocurrency’s inception. Consequently, these transactions represent a calculated approach to market development. The company originally received 100 billion XRP tokens at launch to support ecosystem growth and infrastructure development. Currently, combined holdings for Ripple and its leadership stand at approximately 41.485 billion XRP, demonstrating a substantial reduction in centralized control. Ripple has consistently maintained that these sales serve multiple strategic purposes. Primarily, the company aims to alleviate market concerns about excessive token concentration. Additionally, these sales fund ongoing operations and ecosystem development initiatives. The gradual reduction approach prevents market disruption while supporting price discovery mechanisms. Market analysts generally view this strategy as responsible token distribution rather than predatory selling. Historical Context and Token Allocation Framework XRP’s original token distribution in 2012 established a foundation for controlled decentralization. The allocation strategy reserved significant portions for company operations, executive compensation, and ecosystem development. This initial structure enabled Ripple to build necessary infrastructure while maintaining price stability during early adoption phases. Over time, the company implemented escrow mechanisms and public reporting to enhance transparency. The following table illustrates the progression of XRP holdings since 2012: Year Initial Allocation Cumulative Sales Remaining Holdings Market Impact 2012 100B XRP 0 100B XRP Foundation Phase 2017 N/A ~25B XRP ~75B XRP Bull Market Expansion 2021 N/A ~45B XRP ~55B XRP Regulatory Clarity Period 2025 N/A 58.5B XRP 41.485B XRP Mature Distribution Decentralization Progress and Market Response Ripple’s systematic reduction of XRP holdings addresses one of cryptocurrency’s most persistent criticisms: excessive centralization. The company’s transparent reporting on sales volumes and remaining holdings provides market participants with predictable supply dynamics. Furthermore, this approach contrasts sharply with projects that maintain large, undisclosed treasury reserves. Market data indicates that XRP’s increasing distribution correlates with improved liquidity and reduced volatility over time. Several key factors characterize Ripple’s decentralization strategy: Gradual Release Schedule: Controlled sales prevent market flooding Transparent Reporting: Regular disclosures build investor confidence Ecosystem Funding: Sales revenue supports development initiatives Price Stability Mechanisms: Escrow accounts manage supply impact Regulatory Compliance: Structured approach addresses legal considerations Market analysts observe that XRP’s 31,000% price appreciation since 2012 demonstrates the strategy’s effectiveness. Importantly, this growth occurred alongside substantial token distribution rather than despite it. The cryptocurrency’s performance suggests that controlled decentralization can coexist with significant value creation. Expert Perspectives on Token Distribution Models Blockchain economists emphasize that Ripple’s approach represents a hybrid model between completely decentralized launches and heavily centralized projects. Dr. Elena Martinez, cryptocurrency researcher at Stanford University, explains: “Ripple’s gradual distribution model provides valuable lessons for blockchain projects. Their approach balances necessary initial control with long-term decentralization goals. The 31,000% price appreciation alongside $109 billion in sales demonstrates that controlled distribution doesn’t necessarily hinder value creation.” Financial regulators have also noted Ripple’s transparent reporting practices. The company’s regular disclosures about XRP sales provide regulators with clear visibility into token movements. This transparency has become increasingly important as regulatory frameworks evolve globally. Consequently, Ripple’s approach may establish precedents for compliant token distribution in regulated markets. Comparative Analysis with Other Cryptocurrencies Ripple’s XRP distribution strategy differs significantly from other major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s completely decentralized mining distribution contrasts with XRP’s initially centralized allocation. Ethereum’s hybrid approach combines premine distribution with ongoing mining rewards. These different models create distinct market dynamics and investor considerations. Several factors distinguish XRP’s distribution approach: Predictable Supply Schedule: Unlike mining-based cryptocurrencies Corporate Governance: Clear decision-making structure for sales Ecosystem Focus: Sales directly fund development initiatives Regulatory Engagement: Proactive compliance with evolving frameworks Market Education: Transparent communication about distribution plans Market data reveals that XRP’s correlation with other major cryptocurrencies has decreased as distribution has progressed. This decoupling suggests that XRP’s market dynamics increasingly reflect its unique distribution model rather than broader cryptocurrency trends. The reduced correlation may provide portfolio diversification benefits for institutional investors. Future Implications for Blockchain Projects Ripple’s thirteen-year distribution experiment offers crucial insights for emerging blockchain projects. Newer protocols increasingly adopt hybrid models that balance initial funding needs with decentralization goals. The success of XRP’s gradual distribution suggests that controlled decentralization can achieve market confidence while supporting development. Future projects may incorporate similar transparent reporting mechanisms and gradual release schedules. Technological advancements also influence distribution strategies. Smart contract capabilities enable more sophisticated distribution mechanisms than were available in 2012. Modern projects can implement automated, transparent distribution schedules that eliminate manual intervention. These technological improvements build upon lessons learned from early distribution experiments like XRP’s. Conclusion Ripple’s $109 billion XRP sales since 2012 represent a landmark case study in cryptocurrency token distribution. The company’s systematic approach has reduced centralized holdings while supporting ecosystem development and market growth. XRP’s remarkable 31,000% price appreciation during this distribution period demonstrates that controlled decentralization can coexist with substantial value creation. As blockchain technology matures, Ripple’s transparent reporting and gradual distribution model provide valuable frameworks for balancing initial project funding with long-term decentralization goals. The ongoing evolution of XRP’s market structure continues to offer insights into effective token economics and responsible cryptocurrency governance. FAQs Q1: How much XRP have Ripple and executives sold since 2012? Ripple and its leadership have sold approximately 58.5 billion XRP tokens worth about $109 billion since the cryptocurrency’s 2012 launch, according to CryptoBasic’s comprehensive analysis. Q2: What percentage of XRP does Ripple still control? Current estimates indicate Ripple and executives hold approximately 41.485 billion XRP tokens, representing significant reduction from the original 100 billion allocation while maintaining resources for ongoing development. Q3: Why does Ripple sell XRP tokens? The company states sales serve multiple purposes: reducing centralization concerns, funding operations and ecosystem development, supporting price discovery, and maintaining market liquidity through controlled distribution. Q4: How has XRP price performed during these sales? Despite substantial token distribution, XRP has appreciated approximately 31,000% since 2012, demonstrating that controlled sales can coexist with significant value creation in cryptocurrency markets. Q5: How does Ripple’s distribution compare to other cryptocurrencies? Ripple’s model differs from Bitcoin’s mining distribution and Ethereum’s hybrid approach, featuring predictable corporate-controlled sales with transparent reporting rather than algorithmic or mining-based distribution mechanisms.

One of the recent buyers acquired ETH through an OTC desk, later moving the tokens to Lido for liquid staking. The whale acquired ETH through Wintermute’s OTC desk, which did not help the token on the open market. For now, ETH remains range-bound, meaning some whales can use liquid-staked tokens to secure loans and buy more ETH. The move is relatively risky for liquidations, but more experienced users are managing the risk. Liquid staking has been growing in the past weeks, recovering from local lows. As of January 26, liquid staking protocols hold over $43B in value locked. World Liberty Fi returns to buying ETH World Liberty Fi is actively trading its portfolio, switching from BTC to ETH positions. The known wallet of World Liberty Fi is switching up DeFi positions for wrapped tokens. Recently, WLFI switched from WBTC to ETH, going through the CowProtocol router. The wallet performed several trades, leaving WLFI with over 22K ETH. For now, the tokens have not been sent back to staking. WBTC has generally decreased its balance to 125.33K, as it lost its weight in decentralized finance. Yield for WBTC on Aave is also extremely low, while ETH is more usable within the DeFi ecosystem. OG whale goes long on ETH The whale that shorted the market on October 10 is now stuck with a large-scale long position. The recent whale activity showed confidence in ETH returning to growth, but left the trader with large unrealized losses of over $779M. In addition to the Hyperliquid positions, the OG whale has also created a borrowing loop for ETH. Recently, a new wallet linked to the same whale withdrew ETH from Binance, deposited it to Aave, and continued buying with borrowed funds. The move shows significant confidence in ETH retaining its price range and not leading to liquidations. Despite the downturn, ETH sentiment remains neutral at 40 points . ETH open interest is inching up to $16.28B from a local low of $15.78B. More than 75% of traders are going long and are threatened by liquidations during a downturn. On Hyperliquid, only 51% of whales are long on ETH, betting on a deeper downturn. ETH has seen an outflow of retail users, but whales and large-scale stakers are still a major source of buying and activity. Retail sentiment remains lower, but accumulation and DeFi usage remain at relatively high levels. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

CZ raised a stark challenge: could a traditional bank withstand a $7 billion withdrawal in 24 hours? For most legacy institutions, the answer is a clear no, highlighting the fragility of conventional banking under extreme stress. Well, traditional banks run on fractional reserves, holding only a fraction of deposits in cash. When panic-driven withdrawals surge, this system can buck, forcing account freezes, emergency funding, or government bailouts. History shows how bank runs repeatedly expose this structural weakness. Binance’s experience underscores a fundamentally different financial model. In crypto, especially on major centralized exchanges, liquidity is managed in real time with on-chain settlement and reserves built for extreme demand. When $14 billion in withdrawals hit, Binance stayed fully operational, showing a level of transparency, speed, and resilience that traditional finance rarely matches. This development illustrates a deeper shift in global finance. Digital assets aren’t just about speed or speculation, they’re redefining how financial systems perform under stress. Blockchain-based platforms offer nonstop operation, instant settlement, and transparent verification, capabilities that matter most in crises. While critics cite crypto’s volatility and regulatory uncertainty, events like Binance’s withdrawal stress test challenge the idea that traditional banking is inherently safer. Legacy stability often relies on central bank backstops, whereas crypto platforms are increasingly proving they can endure extreme market pressure on their own. Therefore, CZ’s remarks at Davos signal a turning point for crypto’s role in global finance. The ecosystem is no longer a fringe alternative, it is rapidly maturing into a parallel financial system, distinguished by transparency, speed, and resilience. As institutional adoption grows and regulations clarify, the boundary between traditional finance and digital assets is fading. One reality is already clear: in moments of sudden, massive liquidity demand, crypto platforms like Binance are setting a new operational benchmark for the financial industry. Notably, CZ stresses that the shift to digital assets isn’t just technological, it’s about creating a financial system resilient to real-world shocks. In a world where trust is currency, that resilience could become crypto’s greatest asset. Conclusion Binance processing $14B in withdrawals in a single week, without disruption, is more than a headline; it’s a stress test highlighting the structural contrasts between crypto and traditional finance. While banks rely on fractional reserves and backstops, exposing fragility under pressure, crypto platforms demonstrate transparency, real-time settlement, and robust liquidity. As trust, speed, and resilience become the new benchmarks, events like this show digital assets are reshaping how the world moves and protects money.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|BNB|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-26 09:49:20

This development, confirmed in October 2025, not only highlights the company’s rapid financial ascent but also pioneers a structured employee liquidity program in partnership with Nasdaq, allowing early team members to realize gains from the company’s success while it remains privately held. Synthesia’s Meteoric Rise to a $4 Billion AI Powerhouse Synthesia’s journey from a 2017 startup to a $4 billion behemoth underscores a potent market fit for its core product: AI-generated avatar technology for corporate training and communication. The company’s valuation has nearly doubled from $2.1 billion in just one year, a growth rate fueled by substantial enterprise adoption. Notably, Synthesia crossed the critical $100 million annual recurring revenue (ARR) threshold in April 2025, serving major clients like Bosch, Merck, and SAP. This revenue milestone provides a stark contrast to many AI firms still grappling with monetization, demonstrating Synthesia’s effective translation of innovative technology into a scalable, lucrative business model focused on the global corporate training market. The Funding Consortium: A Vote of Confidence from Top-Tier Investors The Series E round was led by existing investor GV (Google Ventures), signaling strong continued support. Significantly, the round saw participation from a who’s-who of prior institutional backers, including Kleiner Perkins, Accel, and New Enterprise Associates (NEA). This pattern of follow-on investment from major venture capital firms indicates deep-seated confidence in Synthesia’s management and long-term trajectory. The round also welcomed new investors Matt Miller’s Evantic and the secretive fund Hedosophia, expanding the company’s financial base. Furthermore, participation from NVIDIA’s venture arm, NVentures, suggests a strategic alignment with the computational infrastructure underpinning advanced AI video generation. Pioneering Employee Liquidity: The Nasdaq-Facilitated Secondary Sale A defining aspect of this funding round is the structured secondary sale program for employees. Synthesia, in collaboration with Nasdaq Private Market, is enabling early team members to sell a portion of their equity at the same $4 billion valuation set by the Series E. This move is strategically designed to provide liquidity—a rare benefit in the private company landscape—while maintaining corporate control and avoiding the valuation discrepancies typical of informal secondary transactions. Synthesia CFO Daniel Kim emphasized this is “first and foremost about our employees,” allowing them to “share in the value they’ve helped create” without pushing the company toward an early IPO. This approach reflects a growing trend among mature unicorns to reward talent while preserving operational independence for future growth. Strategic Pivot: From AI Avatars to Interactive AI Agents Capital from this round will fuel Synthesia’s ambitious expansion beyond static or expressive video generation. The company is strategically investing in developing interactive AI agents . These agents aim to transform corporate learning from a passive viewing experience into an active, conversational dialogue. Early pilot programs allow employees to interact with company knowledge bases through natural language queries, scenario-based role-plays, and personalized explanations. Customer feedback reportedly indicates higher engagement and faster knowledge retention compared to traditional training modules. CEO Victor Riparbelli identified a “rare convergence” of technological capability and market demand, with AI agents meeting the board-level priority of workforce upskilling. Context and Impact on the European Tech Landscape Synthesia’s success story carries significant weight for the United Kingdom and broader European tech scene. The company maintains its headquarters in London with a 20,000-square-foot office and has expanded its footprint to Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Munich, New York, and Zurich. Its coordinated, cross-border secondary sale, while unusual historically, may signal a new norm. Alexandru Voica, Synthesia’s head of corporate affairs, predicts that as UK companies stay private longer, such structured liquidity events will become increasingly common. This evolution addresses a key challenge in European venture capital: providing returns and incentives to employees before a trade sale or IPO, thereby helping retain top talent in a competitive global market. Synthesia’s Funding and Growth Timeline Year Milestone Valuation / Key Metric 2017 Company Founded N/A 2021 Series B (Led by Kleiner Perkins) Undisclosed 2023 Series D (Led by NEA) $2.1 Billion April 2025 Crosses $100M ARR N/A October 2025 Series E (Led by GV) $4 Billion Market Position and Competitive Differentiation Synthesia operates at the intersection of several high-growth sectors: enterprise SaaS, generative AI, and the digital learning market. Its competitive moat is built on: Hyper-Realistic AI Avatars: Proprietary technology for creating lifelike, expressive digital presenters. Enterprise-Grade Security & Integration: Crucial for large clients in regulated industries. Proven ROI: Demonstrated effectiveness in reducing training costs and improving outcomes. Strategic Roadmap: Clear evolution from video creation to interactive AI agent platforms. This positions Synthesia not merely as a video tool, but as a comprehensive platform for internal knowledge dissemination and employee enablement. Conclusion Synthesia’s $4 billion valuation and innovative employee liquidity program represent a dual milestone: financial validation for its AI-powered corporate training platform and a progressive step in private company governance. The $200 million Series E, backed by a formidable investor syndicate, will accelerate the development of next-generation AI agents, expanding the company’s addressable market. More broadly, Synthesia’s journey from London startup to global AI leader, while pioneering structured secondary sales for its team, provides a compelling blueprint for the future of venture-backed growth in Europe and beyond. The company’s focus on tangible revenue, strategic expansion, and employee value sharing offers a mature counterpoint to the hype-driven narratives often surrounding artificial intelligence. FAQs Q1: What is Synthesia’s core business? Synthesia provides an AI-powered platform that enables companies to create professional training and communication videos using synthetic AI avatars and voices, eliminating the need for traditional video production crews and actors. Q2: How does the employee secondary sale work with Nasdaq? Nasdaq Private Market is facilitating a controlled sale where eligible Synthesia employees can sell a portion of their shares to approved investors. All transactions occur at the official $4 billion Series E valuation, providing fair liquidity while the company remains private. Q3: Why is Synthesia’s $100M ARR milestone significant? Crossing $100 million in annual recurring revenue demonstrates strong product-market fit, scalable enterprise sales, and a sustainable business model. It substantiates the high valuation and differentiates Synthesia from many AI startups that are not yet profitable. Q4: What are AI agents in the context of Synthesia’s future plans? Synthesia is developing interactive AI agents that go beyond video playback. These agents will allow employees to converse with training material, ask questions, engage in role-play scenarios, and receive personalized explanations, making learning more dynamic and effective. Q5: What does this mean for the European startup ecosystem? Synthesia’s success, including its structured liquidity approach, sets a precedent for other late-stage European unicorns. It shows that global-scale AI companies can be built and financed in Europe while developing innovative ways to reward and retain talent before an exit event.

Expert Exposes What’s Going On Behind The Scenes,https://bitcoinist.com/why-is-japan-all-in-on-xrp/,"Japan appears to be going all in on XRP, as new reports reveal that the country is working toward reclassifying the cryptocurrency. An XRP advocate and expert known on X as ‘SonOfaRichard’ has exposed what’s going on behind the scenes, noting that Japan is now transforming XRP into a real financial infrastructur e, formally integrating it into the country’s capital markets. Behind Japan’s New Commitment To XRP For many countries, particularly the US and South Korea , XRP has primarily been viewed as a digital asset for payments and trading, subject to both bullish and bearish price action . However, Japan has recently taken a step further, moving beyond the speculative bubble and aiming to reclassify the altcoin and integrate it into the country’s financial infrastructure. In his post on X, SonOfaRichard delved deep into this ongoing development, highlighting the significance and implications of Japan’s involvement in XRP . He said that Japan is not merely expressing bullish sentiment on XRP , as many countries, traders, and analysts do. Instead, it is changing how the cryptocurrency is classified domestically by placing it under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA). This move represents a significant regulatory shift rather than a market-driven endorsement. According to the expert, assets under the FIEA are not designed to fuel speculative market pumps . By moving XRP under this new regulatory framework, Japan would effectively position it alongside traditional financial products, such as bonds, funds, and derivatives. This shift removes primary focus on short-term price movements and prioritizes structure and oversight as a pathway toward long-term market development and maturation. SonOfaRichard has said that Japan’s reclassification of XRP will introduce insider trading controls, custody audits, disclosure standards, and clearer rules for institutional balance sheets. He explained that once the process is complete, it will not be treated as an experiment but as a full infrastructure normalization. He added that institutions that have been waiting for clear regulatory approval may soon receive it, as Japan moves closer to granting final authorization. Timeline For Japan’s Reclassification In his post, SonOfaRichard clarified the timeline of Japan’s reclassification of XRP. He explained that it would not be an immediate change, as the process follows Japan’s fiscal-year logic, not the US calendar. Legislative submission is expected in 2026, with full implementation aligned with Japan’s formal fiscal rails and taking effect only after official approval. The XRP expert noted that Japan’s regulatory system runs on a fiscal year from April to March, and new rules typically come into effect at the start of the fiscal cycle rather than mid-year. This means XRP’s reclassification will likely occur sometime in Q2 2026. SonOfaRichard also emphasized that the reclassification will focus on institutional treatment, custody, disclosure, and compliance standards. He added that the process represents a massive structural shift and will therefore unfold slowly and deliberately to ensure proper alignment with Japan’s established regulatory frameworks.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-26 10:00:07

The project’s team revealed this drastic decision on March 21, 2025, citing insurmountable operational constraints that ultimately prevented potential acquisition deals from materializing. This development marks a significant turning point for SXP token holders and raises serious questions about financial governance in decentralized projects. Sola SXP Development Halts: The Official Announcement Breakdown The Sola team published a comprehensive blog post detailing their difficult decision. They explained that multiple acquisition opportunities emerged following the resignation of their former CEO. However, during due diligence processes, prospective acquiring teams uncovered critical operational issues. Consequently, all potential deals collapsed before reaching completion. The existing development team will now disband completely, with members pursuing individual activities in the blockchain space. Meanwhile, the former CEO has announced plans to launch a separate, independent project aimed at providing new direction for current SXP holders. Financial Control Issues at the Core of the Crisis A primary factor in the failed acquisitions involved financial management problems. Specifically, due diligence revealed a significant lack of control over project funds managed through Binance. This critical issue created substantial uncertainty for potential acquirers. Blockchain governance experts note that transparent fund management remains essential for project credibility. The table below outlines key financial governance principles that successful blockchain projects typically maintain: Governance Principle Standard Practice Sola’s Reported Issue Fund Transparency Public wallet addresses and regular audits Lack of control over exchange-managed funds Multi-Signature Controls Multiple authorized signatures required Potential single-point failure in fund access Regular Financial Reporting Quarterly treasury reports to community Unclear reporting structure discovered Industry analysts emphasize that these financial control problems represent a broader pattern in cryptocurrency project failures. Furthermore, they highlight the importance of decentralized financial management systems over centralized exchange custody for project treasury funds. Historical Context of Blockchain Project Failures The Sola situation follows a concerning trend in the cryptocurrency sector. Several notable projects have faced similar challenges in recent years. For instance, the Terra (LUNA) collapse in 2022 demonstrated how structural weaknesses can lead to catastrophic failures. Similarly, the FTX exchange collapse highlighted the dangers of centralized control over user funds. These precedents make due diligence increasingly rigorous for potential acquirers. Therefore, projects with governance red flags face significant hurdles in securing rescue funding or acquisition offers. The Acquisition Process and Due Diligence Failures Multiple teams reportedly expressed interest in acquiring Sola following the CEO’s departure. This interest initially generated optimism within the SXP community. However, the standard acquisition due diligence process uncovered several concerning issues. Prospective buyers typically examine: Technical infrastructure and codebase quality Financial controls and treasury management Legal compliance and regulatory standing Community engagement and developer activity Intellectual property ownership and rights In Sola’s case, the financial control problems proved particularly problematic. Additionally, other operational constraints likely contributed to the failed negotiations. The due diligence process serves as a crucial quality check in blockchain acquisitions. Consequently, its failure often signals fundamental project weaknesses that cannot be easily resolved. Impact on SXP Token Holders and Market Reaction The announcement immediately affected SXP token values across major cryptocurrency exchanges. Market data shows significant trading volume increases following the news. Token holders now face considerable uncertainty about their investments. The former CEO’s promise of a new independent project offers some potential future direction. However, historical precedents suggest that such spin-off projects face substantial challenges. They must rebuild community trust while developing viable technology from potentially compromised foundations. Blockchain investment analysts recommend that affected holders consider several factors: The track record of the former CEO in delivering projects The specific technical proposals for the new independent project Transparency measures implemented for financial controls Community governance structures in the proposed new entity Regulatory compliance considerations for the new venture Broader Implications for the Cryptocurrency Ecosystem The Sola development halt carries implications beyond the immediate SXP community. It reinforces the importance of robust financial governance in decentralized projects. Moreover, it highlights how due diligence processes have matured in the blockchain acquisition space. Potential acquirers now conduct more thorough examinations before committing resources. This increased scrutiny benefits the overall ecosystem by weeding out fundamentally flawed projects. However, it also creates challenges for legitimate projects facing temporary difficulties. Technical Legacy and Protocol Development Freeze With the development team disbanding, Sola’s technical roadmap has effectively frozen. The protocol will not receive planned updates or security patches. This situation creates potential vulnerabilities for remaining users. Historical examples show that unmaintained blockchain protocols gradually become obsolete. They face compatibility issues with evolving ecosystem standards and potential security risks from unpatched vulnerabilities. Therefore, current SXP users should exercise caution when interacting with the frozen protocol. The technical architecture of Sola included several innovative features: A delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism Cross-chain interoperability capabilities Decentralized exchange functionality Smart contract execution environment These technical assets might find new life in future projects. However, without active maintenance, their practical utility diminishes over time. The blockchain industry moves rapidly, making even recently developed technology quickly outdated without continuous improvement. Conclusion The Sola SXP development halt represents a significant event in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. It demonstrates how financial governance failures can derail even technically promising blockchain projects. The failed acquisition attempts highlight the increasing sophistication of due diligence processes in the sector. Current SXP holders now face difficult decisions about their investments. Meanwhile, the broader industry can learn valuable lessons about financial transparency and operational controls. As blockchain technology matures, projects must prioritize governance alongside technical innovation to ensure long-term sustainability. FAQs Q1: What exactly happened to the Sola (SXP) project? The Sola project announced it is halting all future protocol development due to operational constraints. Potential acquisition deals failed after due diligence uncovered financial control issues, particularly regarding funds managed through Binance. Q2: Can I still trade SXP tokens after this announcement? Yes, SXP tokens remain listed on various cryptocurrency exchanges and can still be traded. However, the underlying protocol will no longer receive development updates or security patches, which may affect long-term utility. Q3: What happens to the existing Sola development team? The development team is disbanding, with members pursuing individual activities in the blockchain space. The former CEO has announced plans to launch a separate, independent project for current SXP holders. Q4: What were the specific financial control issues mentioned? The announcement cited a “lack of control over financial funds managed by Binance” as a key problem discovered during acquisition due diligence. This created uncertainty about treasury management and fund accessibility. Q5: How does this affect the value of my SXP holdings? Like any cryptocurrency, SXP value depends on market dynamics. The development halt typically creates negative price pressure due to reduced future utility expectations. Investors should conduct their own research considering the changed fundamentals. Q6: Are there precedents for blockchain projects halting development like this? Yes, several blockchain projects have halted development due to various issues including financial problems, technical challenges, or regulatory pressures. Each situation has unique characteristics, but the Sola case highlights particular governance concerns.

The MSCI All Country World Index, which tracks more than 2,500 stocks from around the world, jumped 20.6% in 2025. It even hit a new high on January 15, and it’s still up over 2% this year. But that nonstop rally has gone on for nine months without any major crash. Timothy Moe, chief Asia-Pacific equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, says we’re overdue. “Markets, having had a very good 2025, particularly Asian markets… and having gone over nine months without a meaningful pullback, the historical clock is ticking in terms of markets being overdue for some sort of a correction.” Timothy pointed out that historically, markets see a 10% correction every eight to nine months. “And we’ve not had that. If there’s a catalyst in the form of geopolitical risk concerns, then I think investors need to be aware that there could be some sort of a pullback,” he said. Trump’s walk-backs and global tensions are behind current uncertainty in markets Despite a lot of political drama, traders just keep ignoring it. Even the standoff over Greenland didn’t shake the market. And when President Donald Trump recently eased off another tariff threat, stocks jumped again. That sparked more talk of the “TACO” trade, short for “Trump Always Chickens Out.” It’s the belief that Trump makes threats, but always backs down. So traders assume the danger never lasts. But Miroslav Aradski from BCA Research thinks this could backfire. “There is a deep paradox at the heart of the ‘TACO trade.’ In the absence of market discipline, Trump has more leeway to pursue potentially destabilizing policies. This means that when the next crisis comes, it could be bigger than the last one.” Aradski said just because stocks haven’t dropped doesn’t mean they’re safe. He said the S&P 500 has gone 185 days without a 10% decline, based on rolling peaks. That doesn’t prove anything on its own, but it shows how long this calm has lasted. Kevin Gordon from Schwab Center for Financial Research also warned that people shouldn’t focus too much on how long it’s been since the last drop. “When valuations are stretched and sentiment is frothy, there is a stronger chance for pullbacks to be more severe. There needs to be a negative catalyst,” Kevin said. Gordon said measures such as credit card rate caps or escalating geopolitical tensions could hit stocks if they begin to pose a meaningful or material risk to companies’ bottom lines, or drive bond yields sharply higher. Jay Woods at Freedom Capital Markets said stocks are showing late-cycle signs. Big companies are still posting strong profits, but the gains aren’t really sticking. “The major indexes have stalled for now but overall market breadth remains healthy,” Jay said. He mentioned that money is now rotating into small caps, materials, and energy, but the biggest stocks are still driving the show. Jay added that the Nasdaq 100 hasn’t hit a new high since October, and it might be the first to fall. That’s a problem, because if the tech giants slip, the market could take a bigger hit. Kevin also said that the hype around artificial intelligence is starting to lose steam. Investors are getting nervous about whether all the money being poured in will keep paying off. “That won’t be the case forever,” Kevin said. The focus is slowly shifting to smaller stocks and older sectors that follow the economy more closely. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Upcoming crypto presales in 2026 stand out with heightened focus on real utility, team transparency, and regulatory compliance following lessons from previous cycles. With over $4.5 billion raised in crypto presales during Q4 2025, early investors gain access to tokens with bonuses up to 50%, high-yield staking, and governance rights before projects achieve mass discovery. Historically, successful crypto presales delivered returns ranging from 500% to 10,000% for early adopters who carefully selected projects with strong fundamentals and legitimate teams. Crypto Presales 2026: Current Market Dynamics Institutional investors are actively exploring upcoming crypto presales as an alternative asset class with high return potential. Fed rate cuts stimulate capital flows into risk assets, including new crypto presales with innovative business models. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals in 2025 legitimized the crypto sector, creating a halo effect for quality presale projects. Regulatory clarity in the EU (MiCA) and progress in the US reduce legal uncertainty. This convergence of factors makes crypto presales 2026 a strategic entry point before the next wave of institutional adoption. Early participants in upcoming crypto presales gain multiple advantages: token bonuses of 15-40%, staking APYs of 80-300%, priority platform feature access, and development influence through governance. Venture funds traditionally dominating seed rounds now compete with retail investors for allocations in top presales. This democratization of access means ordinary investors can participate in projects on the same terms as institutional capital—impossible in previous crypto cycles. Understanding Tokenomics in Crypto Presales Analyzing token distribution and emission mechanisms is critically important for evaluating long-term potential of new crypto presales. Healthy tokenomics typically includes: 30-40% for public sale (including presale), 20-30% for team and advisors with 12-36 month vesting, 15-25% for ecosystem development and partnerships, 10-15% for exchange liquidity, and 10-20% for marketing and community rewards. Projects with excessive team token concentration (over 40%) or absence of vesting present high dump risk after listing. Deflationary mechanisms such as token burns from transaction fees or buyback programs can support long-term value. Successful upcoming crypto presales also implement utility staking where locked tokens grant platform feature access, creating natural demand and reducing circulating supply. It’s crucial to verify whether tokens have real utility in the project ecosystem or are merely speculative assets without fundamental value. 1. MECCACOIN – Islamic Finance Revolution Alt text: MECCACOIN Shariah-compliant crypto presale Islamic finance market 12 billion dollars MECCACOIN leads among new crypto presales thanks to its unique combination of blockchain technology and Islamic finance principles for a $12+ billion market. The project completely eliminates riba (interest charges), implements Shariah governance through religious oversight council, and integrates with zakat and sadaqah systems. Unlike typical upcoming crypto presales focused on technical innovation without ethical component, MECCACOIN addresses 1.8+ billion Muslims seeking halal investment opportunities. Tokenomics is built on transparent distribution with extended vesting periods for team coins, demonstrating commitment to long-term development. The platform offers real use cases: automatic zakat distribution (2.5% of wealth annually), halal asset trading without leveraging and prohibited sectors (alcohol, gambling, tobacco), and community governance based on shura (consultation) principles. The religious advisory board consists of recognized Islamic scholars ensuring all operations comply with Shariah norms. This level of religious oversight is unique among crypto presales 2026 and creates trust in the conservative Muslim community. Advantages Disadvantages Massive underserved market ($12B+) Niche audience may limit mass adoption Shariah oversight minimizes fraud risks Additional complexity of religious compliance Real utility in Islamic financial ecosystem Educational barrier for market entry Team ethical commitment through religious principles Regulatory challenges in some jurisdictions Strong community with high loyalty Relatively new team in crypto industry Pioneer in halal DeFi space Limited precedents for regulators Why MECCACOIN Tops the List: The combination of massive market size, ethical framework, and transparent governance makes MECCACOIN the most compelling among crypto presales 2026 for values-driven investors and the Muslim community. 2. DeepSnitch AI – Scam Project Protection DeepSnitch AI uses artificial intelligence for real-time fraudulent project detection, positioning among top new crypto presales in the security segment. The platform raised $674,000+ at $0.02790 per token with planned listing in January 2026. Operational AI agents analyze smart contracts, identify rug-pull patterns, and provide automated security audits. The system uses machine learning on datasets from thousands of previous scam projects, detecting suspicious code patterns such as hidden mint functions, unusual transfer restrictions, or developer backdoors. Unlike most upcoming crypto presales with promises of future functionality, DeepSnitch has a working product already having reviewed 500+ projects. Advantages Disadvantages Solves critical problem (scam detection) AI models require constant training Working product before presale Competition from audit firms 300x growth potential per estimates Dependence on data quality January 2026 listing confirmed Technology still evolving Partnerships with DeFi protocols False positives may damage reputation 3. DigiTap – Banking Meets Cryptocurrency DigiTap unites traditional banking and crypto wallets in a unified ecosystem, having raised $2.4M in Stage 2 presale. The app is already available on Apple Store and Google Play with offshore IB accounts, Visa cards, and seamless crypto-fiat transfers. Users can spend cryptocurrencies at any Visa-accepting merchant with real-time automatic conversion. The TAP token provides access to premium features, reduced fees (up to 50% discount), and loyalty programs with cashback up to 5%. DigiTap implements a deflationary model with regular token burns to support value, burning 0.1% of all transaction volumes monthly. Advantages Disadvantages Ready product in app stores Banking regulation complex Real integration with traditional finance Competition from Revolut, N26 Bridge for mass crypto adoption KYC/AML requirements may deter crypto purists Deflationary tokenomics Dependence on banking partners Multi-currency accounts (150+ fiat) Geographic licensing limitations 4. Blazpay – AI Assistant for DeFi Blazpay is in Phase 4 at $0.01175 price, offering AI-powered DeFi strategy automation through the BlazAI platform. The project accepts 50+ cryptocurrencies for participation, ensuring maximum accessibility among new crypto presales.

Volatility Is Coming,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-is-trending-sideways-volatility-is-coming/,"XRP has entered a period of sideways movement, signaling that liquidity pressure is accumulating. Recent analysis by crypto analyst ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) highlights this development on the Binance XRP/USDT liquidation heatmap. The asset is trading within defined ranges while the market prepares for its next phase of momentum. Liquidity Clusters Form Key Levels The liquidation heatmap shows that XRP is consolidating between $1.9 and $1.95. These zones have significant liquidity, with large clusters of open positions concentrated around these price points. The map highlights areas of potential liquidation that could trigger accelerated movements once the price breaches either level. The horizontal green and yellow bars indicate supercharts, showing where traders have concentrated leveraged positions. The proximity of these clusters indicates that any breakout or breakdown could produce sharp, short-term movements . $XRP is trending sideways as liquidity pressure builds. Volatility is coming. https://t.co/I6oOzThyd9 pic.twitter.com/NmI5BLa5Nm — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) January 24, 2026 More Signals to Watch This consolidation follows a previous observation by ChartNerd, which identified XRP at the apex of a symmetrical triangle . The asset’s price compressed into a narrowing range before reaching the current sideways pattern. This pattern suggests that market participants are balancing long and short positions while preparing for a directional move. The current liquidity concentration aligns with the triangle apex, reinforcing these levels as key areas of interest for traders. Next Potential Moves XRP’s price has been relatively stable within the identified ranges. The consolidation is occurring on lower volatility compared with previous swings. This pattern suggests that the market is absorbing supply and demand before a decisive move . Small fluctuations within the range indicate active trading, but no decisive trend has yet formed. ChartNerd’s analysis emphasizes the buildup of liquidity pressure, noting that volatility is expected once these levels are tested. A breakout above $1.95 could challenge higher resistance zones and trigger stop-loss orders clustered above. Conversely, a drop below $1.9 may test lower support levels and force leveraged liquidations.

According to the latest weekly fund flow report from CoinShares, this figure represents the largest single-week withdrawal since mid-November 2025. Consequently, this movement signals a potential recalibration of institutional and retail investor strategies. The data, compiled on April 14, 2025, reveals a stark geographical divide, with the United States experiencing the brunt of the exodus. Digital Asset Funds Experience Record Weekly Outflow The $1.73 billion net outflow from digital asset funds marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency investment sector. For context, this amount surpasses the outflows observed during several volatile periods in early 2024. CoinShares, a leading digital asset investment firm, publishes this data weekly, providing a crucial barometer for institutional capital movement. The report tracks exchange-traded products (ETPs), trusts, and other regulated investment vehicles globally. Furthermore, this trend contrasts sharply with the net inflows recorded throughout much of the first quarter of 2025. Analysts often correlate sustained outflows with broader market uncertainty or profit-taking behavior. The scale of this withdrawal suggests a coordinated shift in asset allocation rather than isolated selling pressure. Breaking Down the $1.73 Billion Exodus The weekly outflow data reveals clear leaders in the capital flight. A detailed breakdown shows the following allocations: Bitcoin (BTC) Products: Accounted for $1.09 billion, or roughly 63% of the total net outflow. Ethereum (ETH) Products: Saw $630 million withdrawn, representing about 36.4% of the total. Other Altcoins: Recorded minimal net flows, indicating the movement was concentrated in the two largest digital assets. This concentration highlights that the outflow was not a broad-based rejection of the asset class. Instead, investors primarily targeted the most liquid and widely held crypto investment products. The table below summarizes the key outflows by asset: Digital Asset Net Outflow (USD) Percentage of Total Bitcoin (BTC) $1.09 Billion ~63% Ethereum (ETH) $630 Million ~36.4% Multi-Asset & Other ~$10 Million ~0.6% A Stark Geographical Divide in Crypto Fund Flows The CoinShares report uncovered a dramatic split in regional investor behavior. While the United States dominated the outflow figures, several other key markets demonstrated resilience or even growth. Specifically, U.S.-based digital asset funds faced approximately $1.8 billion in net outflows. This figure exceeds the global total, meaning inflows elsewhere partially offset the U.S. withdrawal. The scale of the U.S. outflow aligns with its status as the world’s largest market for regulated crypto investment products. Conversely, European and Canadian markets displayed contrasting confidence. Switzerland recorded net inflows of $32.5 million, while Germany and Canada saw inflows of $19.1 million and $33.5 million, respectively. These inflows, though smaller in magnitude, indicate that regulatory clarity and institutional frameworks in these regions may be fostering more stable investment patterns. This divergence could reflect differing macroeconomic outlooks or regulatory environments. Contextualizing the Outflow Within Broader Market Trends To understand this event, one must examine the preceding months. The digital asset market entered 2025 with cautious optimism following the approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs in late 2024. These products initially catalyzed significant capital inflows. However, markets often experience consolidation phases after major regulatory milestones. Additionally, traditional financial markets exhibited volatility in early April 2025, with shifting expectations around interest rates and economic growth. Cryptocurrency markets frequently correlate with such macro movements, especially regarding liquidity conditions. Therefore, some analysts interpret this outflow as a routine portfolio rebalancing amid changing risk appetites rather than a fundamental loss of faith in blockchain technology. Historical data from CoinShares shows that similar large outflows have occurred before. For instance, the market experienced a $1.5 billion outflow in June 2024, which preceded a period of price stabilization and subsequent growth. Market cycles often include phases of distribution, where capital exits to realize gains, before new accumulation begins. Potential Impacts and Forward-Looking Analysis The immediate impact of a $1.73 billion outflow is multifaceted. Firstly, it increases selling pressure on the underlying assets held by these funds, potentially contributing to short-term price depreciation. Secondly, it provides a clear, quantifiable signal of institutional sentiment to retail investors and traders. However, large outflows from regulated products do not necessarily equate to capital leaving the cryptocurrency ecosystem entirely. Capital may simply be moving from regulated, custodial products to direct holdings, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, or other investment vehicles. This rotation reflects the dynamic and evolving nature of the digital asset landscape. Market structure experts note that the presence of a deep and liquid market for ETPs allows for efficient capital movement without causing catastrophic price dislocations. The ability to absorb such a significant outflow in a single week, in fact, demonstrates the growing maturity of the cryptocurrency market infrastructure compared to previous years. Expert Perspectives on Institutional Behavior Financial analysts specializing in fund flows emphasize the importance of viewing weekly data within a longer trend. “A single week of outflows, even a large one, is a data point, not a definitive trend reversal,” notes a market strategist from a global investment bank. “The critical metric will be whether this outflow persists over the next three to four weeks, indicating a sustained de-risking event.” Furthermore, the simultaneous inflows in Europe and Canada provide a crucial counter-narrative. This suggests that the outflow may be more specific to U.S. market conditions, such as tax-season selling, upcoming regulatory guidance, or the performance of competing asset classes like equities or bonds. The diversity of global response underscores that cryptocurrency investment is no longer a monolithic global trade but is increasingly driven by regional factors. Conclusion The $1.73 billion net outflow from digital asset funds last week serves as a powerful reminder of the market’s volatility and the fluid nature of institutional capital. While the figures for Bitcoin and Ethereum products are significant, the contrasting inflows in other major economies paint a more nuanced picture. This event highlights the importance of granular, geographically-aware data when assessing the health of the cryptocurrency investment sector. Moving forward, market participants will closely monitor whether this represents a temporary recalibration or the beginning of a more sustained shift away from regulated digital asset funds. Ultimately, the resilience shown by European and Canadian markets may offer a stabilizing counterbalance to U.S.-led volatility. FAQs Q1: What caused the $1.73 billion outflow from digital asset funds? The precise cause is multifaceted, but common factors include institutional profit-taking after a price rally, portfolio rebalancing amid broader financial market volatility, and potentially region-specific events like U.S. tax-related selling or anticipation of regulatory updates. Q2: Does this mean institutional investors are abandoning Bitcoin and Ethereum? Not necessarily. A weekly outflow is a short-term signal. Capital may be rotating into other crypto assets, direct holdings, or different investment vehicles. Sustained outflows over several weeks would be a stronger indicator of a sentiment shift. Q3: Why did Switzerland, Germany, and Canada see net inflows while the U.S. saw outflows? This divergence likely reflects regional differences in macroeconomic outlook, regulatory certainty, and local investor sentiment. Europe and Canada have established regulatory frameworks for crypto assets, which may provide more stability for long-term investors. Q4: How does this outflow compare to historical data? This is the largest weekly outflow since mid-November 2025. Historically, similar large outflows have occurred during market consolidation phases and have not always preceded prolonged bear markets. They are often followed by periods of stability. Q5: What is the likely impact on Bitcoin and Ethereum prices? Large outflows from investment products can create selling pressure on the underlying assets, potentially contributing to short-term price declines. However, cryptocurrency prices are influenced by a vast array of global factors, so the outflow is just one variable among many.

The Japanese yen surged sharply in a move widely attributed to suspected intervention by Japanese authorities. Concurrently, the euro and Swiss franc posted significant gains, signaling a broad-based recalibration of currency valuations amid shifting macroeconomic expectations. Currency Intervention Sparks Yen Surge and Dollar Decline The yen’s abrupt appreciation became the day’s dominant story. Market data showed the USD/JPY pair plummeting over 2.5% in Asian trading hours, a move consistent with past episodes of official intervention. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) and Japan’s Ministry of Finance have historically stepped into markets to curb excessive yen weakness, which harms the purchasing power of Japanese consumers and businesses. Analysts immediately pointed to the velocity and scale of the move as hallmarks of coordinated action. Furthermore, this development follows months of sustained pressure on the yen due to the stark divergence between the Bank of Japan’s ultra-accommodative policy and the Federal Reserve’s higher-for-longer interest rate stance. Meanwhile, the US dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, fell sharply. This slump reflected not only the yen’s strength but also broad selling pressure. Market participants are currently reassessing the timeline for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. Recent softer-than-expected US economic data, particularly in the labor and manufacturing sectors, has fueled speculation that the Fed may act sooner than previously anticipated to ease monetary policy. Consequently, the dollar’s interest rate advantage appears less secure. Key Market Moves at a Glance Currency Pair Move Primary Driver USD/JPY -2.7% Suspected BoJ/MoF Intervention EUR/USD +1.2% Dollar Weakness, ECB Policy Outlook USD/CHF -1.5% Franc Safe-Haven Demand, SNB Stance DXY Index -1.1% Broad USD Selling, Rate Cut Expectations Euro and Swiss Franc Capitalize on Dollar Weakness The euro and Swiss franc capitalized decisively on the dollar’s broad retreat. The EUR/USD pair broke through key technical resistance levels, buoyed by a more hawkish relative stance from the European Central Bank (ECB). While the ECB has begun its own easing cycle, its communication has emphasized a data-dependent and gradual approach. This contrasts with growing market bets on more aggressive Fed easing. The franc’s rise was even more pronounced, reinforcing its traditional role as a safe-haven currency . The Swiss National Bank (SNB) has maintained a focus on combating inflation, and its willingness to use foreign exchange sales to support the franc is well-documented. Traders often flock to the franc during periods of market uncertainty or dollar weakness. Several interconnected factors are driving this multi-currency realignment: Diverging Central Bank Paths: The policy gap between the Fed, ECB, BoJ, and SNB is narrowing, reducing the dollar’s yield appeal. Global Risk Sentiment: Improved investor appetite for non-US assets is reducing demand for the dollar as a funding currency. Technical Positioning: Markets were heavily positioned for continued dollar strength and yen weakness, creating conditions for a sharp reversal. Expert Analysis on Policy and Market Impact Financial strategists note that successful yen intervention requires follow-through. “A one-off operation can provide a temporary reprieve,” states a senior forex analyst at a major global bank, “but lasting impact depends on a shift in fundamentals, such as a change in BoJ policy or a clear downturn in US economic data.” The intervention also raises the stakes for the upcoming G7 finance ministers’ meeting, where currency stability will likely be a key topic. For import-dependent economies in Europe and Asia, a weaker dollar can help ease imported inflation pressures. Conversely, major US exporters may face headwinds from a less competitive currency. Historical Context and Future Market Trajectory This event echoes previous major intervention cycles, such as the Plaza Accord of 1985 and Japan’s repeated forays into markets in 1998, 2011, and 2022. Historical analysis shows that interventions are most effective when aligned with a turning point in fundamentals. The current environment, with potential Fed easing on the horizon, may provide such alignment for the yen. Market participants will now scrutinize Japanese money market data for confirmation of intervention and listen closely for official commentary from Japanese Finance Ministry officials. The immediate future of currency markets hinges on several upcoming data releases and events: US Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Retail Sales reports. European Central Bank and Federal Reserve meeting minutes. Official statements from Japanese authorities regarding forex rates. Volatility is expected to remain elevated as traders adjust to this new dynamic. The episode underscores the powerful role central banks continue to play in global forex markets, even in an era of high-frequency algorithmic trading. Conclusion The dramatic currency intervention that triggered a yen surge and dollar slump marks a significant inflection point in 2025’s financial landscape. It highlights the ongoing tensions between domestic monetary policy goals and international currency stability. The simultaneous rise of the euro and Swiss franc confirms this was not an isolated event but a broad-based recalibration driven by shifting expectations for global interest rates. As central bank policies evolve, market participants must prepare for continued volatility and a potential sustained period of dollar adjustment. This move reaffirms that authorities remain willing to act decisively to counter disorderly market movements, setting the stage for the next chapter in global macro trading. FAQs Q1: What is currency intervention? A1: Currency intervention occurs when a country’s central bank or finance ministry buys or sells its own currency in the foreign exchange market to influence its value. Selling the domestic currency weakens it, while buying strengthens it. Q2: Why would Japan intervene to strengthen the yen? A2: A excessively weak yen increases the cost of imported goods, fuel, and food for Japan, which is a resource-poor nation. This can hurt household budgets and business costs, undermining economic stability and potentially fueling inflation. Q3: How does a weaker US dollar affect the global economy? A3: A weaker dollar can ease inflationary pressures in other countries by making dollar-denominated commodities (like oil) cheaper in local currency terms. It can also boost the competitiveness of non-US exporters but may weigh on profits for US multinational companies. Q4: What are ‘safe-haven’ currencies like the Swiss franc? A4: Safe-haven currencies are those that investors buy during times of global economic uncertainty or market stress. They are typically associated with countries that have stable political systems, strong fiscal positions, and low debt, like Switzerland. Q5: Will this intervention have a long-term effect on the yen’s value? A5: The long-term effect depends on underlying fundamentals. If the Bank of Japan eventually raises interest rates or if the US Federal Reserve cuts rates aggressively, the intervention’s impact could be sustained. If not, market forces may gradually reassert downward pressure on the yen.

Speaking at his first World Economic Forum appearance in Davos , the former CEO detailed his prison experience, the pardon process, and his current government advisory work on crypto regulation. “ Much more freedom, much more liberated ,” Zhao said about the October 20 pardon’s psychological impact. “ I was a free man before but with a felon status. But now I’m a real free man. “ From Prison to Presidential Pardon: CZ’s Journey Zhao served four months in federal prison after pleading guilty in November 2023 to violating the Bank Secrecy Act. His first day involved a “ pretty brutal ” strip search where authorities required him to “ strip naked ,” “ lift your balls ,” and “ flip over, spread your butt cheeks, cough three times. “ His first cellmate was serving 30 years for double murder. “ I’m not usually very emotionally stable, ” Zhao said about coping. “ So I just thought, at four months, I just got to get through it, right? ” Despite legal advice that no one in U.S. history had been jailed for a single Bank Secrecy Act violation, he received prison time while most bank CEOs get deferred prosecution agreements. Media speculation in March 2025 prompted Zhao to apply after major publications suggested he should receive one. “ It was actually all the media that says I might be trying to get a pardon, ” he explained. “ If all the media like you know Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, New York Times are saying that I should be getting a pardon, ” he decided to apply. He never met Trump directly. “ I never got in front of Trump, ” Zhao said, noting the process remained “ like a black box. I don’t know what the process is. ” He was “ about 30, 40 feet away from him ” during a Davos session but never shook hands. “ I just waited and waited and waited and then suddenly it happened. “ A candid conversation from Davos – on prison, pardon, and what freedom means going forward.

He firmly ruled out returning to Binance. “ I haven’t really needed to go back. I didn’t really want to, ” he stated. “ I don’t think it’s good for me to go back. I think we should leave room for strong leaders to grow. ” His involvement today is minimal, revealing, “ When I want to give them advice, I just write it on Twitter. “ When asked about potential refunds of Binance’s $4.3 billion settlement , Zhao said, “ If we get any refund, we will be investing that in America, to show our appreciation, ” though he clarified he had not requested one. Former @Binance CEO @cz_binance says any refund of Binance’s $4.3 billion DOJ settlement would be reinvested in the United States. #Crypto #Binance https://t.co/yhb5gQfAlN — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 17, 2025 CZ Predicts 2026 Bitcoin “Super Cycle” Breaking Historical Pattern Notably, Zhao predicted a “ super cycle ” in 2026 that could break Bitcoin’s four-year pattern. “ I have very strong feelings that you will probably be a super cycle ” in 2026, he told CNBC. “Normally, Bitcoin follows four year cycles historically,” Zhao explained. “ If you look at historic data like every four years you know there’s an all-time high and then there’s a drop. But I think this year given the US being so pro crypto and every other country is kind of following, I do think we will see this we will probably break the four year cycle. “ Zhao doesn’t trade despite his holdings. “ I don’t trade at all, ” he said. “ I just hold Bitcoins . I hold BNB . I don’t do day trading. ” On long-term predictions, he stated, “ If you look at a 10, five, 10 year horizon, it’s very easy to predict. We’re going to go up. “ Corruption Allegations and Political Backlash The pardon has drawn fierce opposition from Democratic lawmakers , who question its timing and the circumstances surrounding it. Senator Elizabeth Warren wrote that “ the convergence of Mr. Zhao’s pardon application and Binance’s financial entanglements with the President’s family presents urgent concerns regarding the integrity of our justice system. “ Representative Maxine Waters also called it “ an appalling but unsurprising reflection of his presidency. “ Despite these allegations, Trump claimed he doesn’t know who Zhao is , calling the case “ a Biden witch hunt .” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also defended the decision, noting the case had “ no allegations of fraud or identifiable victims. “ In response to mounting criticism, Zhao’s attorney, Teresa Goody Guillén, dismissed corruption allegations as “ false statements ” based on “ fundamental misunderstandings ” of blockchain technology, arguing that Zhao “ never should have been prosecuted. “ CZ's attorney dismisses pardon corruption allegations as Democratic lawmakers investigate alleged Binance ties to Trump's crypto venture. #CZ #Trump https://t.co/0WLLMpcu7i — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 16, 2025 While CZ confirmed he will not be returning the exchange, reports, however, indicate that Binance is exploring options to re-enter the U.S. market .

The economist’s critique comes as gold prices surged to record highs above $5,000 per ounce, while Bitcoin has lagged, trading in the upper $80,000 range after falling sharply from its 2025 peak. In a January 25 post on X, Hanke shared a comparative chart showing gold up about 48% over the period, while Bitcoin is down roughly 21.6%. Gold’s steady rise reflects sustained safe-haven demand, while Bitcoin has remained volatile with prolonged drawdowns. Hanke argued the divergence shows that when investors prioritize capital preservation, they choose gold, reinforcing his view of Bitcoin as “fool’s gold.” BITCOIN = FOOL'S GOLD. pic.twitter.com/oQ3sxQrENi — Steve Hanke (@steve_hanke) January 25, 2026 Gold’s rally to new record high Notably, gold’s rally has been driven by elevated geopolitical risk, persistent inflation concerns, and aggressive central-bank buying, particularly by emerging markets, reinforcing its role as a widely accepted defensive asset. Bitcoin, by contrast, has traded more like a speculative risk asset. Despite wider institutional access through spot ETFs , it has remained below key long-term trend levels and failed to track gold during periods of market stress. Hanke has long criticized Bitcoin on fundamental grounds, arguing it lacks intrinsic economic value because it generates no income, represents no claim on productive assets, and is not widely used as a unit of account. He has also warned against governments or corporations holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset, citing added volatility and misallocation of capital. The scholar has rejected the idea of Bitcoin as digital gold, arguing that scarcity alone does not create value without stability, broad monetary use, or economic backing. In his view, Bitcoin’s price is driven mainly by speculation and momentum rather than fundamentals.

The change is part of Beijing’s push to gain more power in global commodities markets. Right now, prices for these raw materials are still decided in places like London, New York, and Singapore. China buys more than anyone else but doesn’t get to call the shots. That’s the part it’s trying to fix. The China Securities Regulatory Commission said 14 futures and options products will be opened to overseas capital. It didn’t say when the changes will start but told local exchanges to begin preparing. Nickel contracts are traded on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, while lithium carbonate is handled by the Guangzhou Futures Exchange. Both are heavily traded and play a major role in powering electric vehicles and the broader energy industry. Shanghai exchange prepares for global access push The Shanghai exchange already laid out an internationalization plan back in May. The idea was to let foreign investors post collateral in foreign currency when making yuan-denominated trades. In other words, you won’t need to convert your dollars or euros into yuan before trading. That’s been one of the main problems for years. People don’t want the added currency risk. “Allowing foreign funds into futures will help China price these metals better,” the SHFE said in its own statement . It also said this could help improve risk management in metals and strengthen nickel price discovery. But here’s the thing folks; this isn’t the first time China has tried something like this. In 2018, foreigners got access to iron ore futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange. That worked okay. But other moves? Not so much. Since 2018, yuan-denominated crude oil contracts have been open to global traders on the Shanghai International Energy Exchange, and copper was added in 2020. But neither made a dent in the dominance of international exchanges. Most traders still stick to New York or London. Even now, Beijing is pushing hard to get the yuan more widely used in global markets. This futures opening move lines up with that. The more people trade in yuan, the more appealing it becomes as a currency. Still, there’s a long way to go. Weak investment data exposes deeper financial cracks Meanwhile, China’s foreign investment numbers for 2025 stayed stable. That’s after a slow spring caused by fears around the first wave of new U.S. tariffs. Most of the money went to Brazil, with transportation as the leading sector, just slightly ahead of metals. For construction, Saudi Arabia took the top spot. The energy industry again led the way for construction deals. The Ministry of Commerce said overall outbound investment was close to a record. But unlike 2016, when China’s global spending caused major political waves, the 2025 version landed quietly. Inside the U.S., Chinese investment has shrunk to almost nothing. Other issues now matter more, especially America’s dependency on China for pharmaceuticals, and the loss of advanced tech in those supply chains. The Trump administration doesn’t seem bothered by it. Back home, China’s fixed-asset investment (FAI) dropped 3.8% in 2025. That’s 48.52 trillion yuan, or about $6.8 trillion. It was the first yearly drop in decades. Blame the crashing property market and stricter limits on how much local governments can borrow. That’s hitting one of China’s main growth tools. The Fitch ratings agency said this drop caused credit risks across sectors, even for the government itself. In April, Fitch downgraded China’s sovereign rating from “A+” to “A,” citing rising public debt and weakening financial health. It also warned that growth in several areas is “deteriorating.” Weak demand, falling prices, and a real estate collapse are dragging things down. By the final quarter of 2025, China’s economy had slowed to 4.5% growth, its weakest pace in three years.

Writing on X on January 26, he maintained that going fully on-chain could unlock early price discovery, lower costs, and significantly increase the accessibility of capital formation. Armstrong suggested, “We need to make capital formation way easier for private companies.” He added that the lack of liquid markets during a company’s early lifecycle often leads to weak price performance once the firm eventually goes public. Brian Armstrong proposes that startups go public on-chain We need to make capital formation way easier for private companies. There's such high demand for some of the large private companies, it's actually a good example of the unintended consequences of higher regulation. Right now, companies are incentivized to stay public for too… — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) January 25, 2026 This is not the first time Brian Armstrong has envisioned a future where firms can go public entirely on-chain. In October of last year, Armstrong outlined his vision for bringing the entire startup lifecycle on-chain during an interview on TBPN, from incorporation to going public. “You can go in there and open a Coinbase account for your startup,” he explained, implying that Coinbase might even assist business owners with on-chain integration through decentralized autonomous organizations. He went on to say that, instead of waiting weeks for wire transfers and legal documentation, founders could simply “press the raise money button” to send pitch materials to potential investors. Capital would then arrive quickly using USDC smart contracts. He also pointed out that this full-stack strategy would “increase economic freedom” and enable more business owners globally to start ventures. The CEO also emphasized the complex traditional fundraising procedure that business owners currently go through. “Every entrepreneur whom I know finds the fundraising process to be pretty onerous; it usually takes like two to three months, where everything else that you’re focused on has to stop. You go do tons of pitch meetings. You get told no 19 out of 20 times.“ -Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase. During the interview, Armstrong revealed that Coinbase has been collaborating closely with the SEC to create structures that allow ordinary investors to participate in on-chain financing under appropriate safeguards. The CEO also acknowledged that while accredited investor regulations offer significant consumer protections, they also hinder non-wealthy people from taking advantage of high-growth investment possibilities. He also disclosed that he tried to carry out Coinbase’s own partial on-chain public offering in 2021 but discovered regulators were unprepared at the time. Private equity drives growth while India IPOs rise Recent market trends illustrate the environment that Brian Armstrong has repeatedly addressed. In the third quarter of last year, private equity activity gained momentum as firms moved past the “cautious optimism” of the first half of the year. According to an EY survey, the third quarter of 2025 saw 156 deals totaling a record $310 billion, including five transactions exceeding $10 billion. This indicated that large private deals continue to dominate capital markets. The report revealed that valuation mismatches have been the biggest barrier to dealmaking for much of the last 2.5 years. Investors reported the value gap as the largest barrier to mergers as recently as December of last year. That barrier has significantly decreased as of today. According to two-thirds of participants in the recent global general partner (GP) survey, the gap has shrunk, allowing buyers and sellers to establish common ground and proceed with confidence. However, while large private deals continue to dominate global capital markets, new public markets such as Dalal Street in India are seeing significant activity in initial public offerings (IPOs), indicating a simultaneous increase in funding available to modern IT firms. The momentum for new-age tech companies seeking public listings appears even greater in 2026 following a record-breaking year for startup IPOs in 2025. According to the Indian Startup IPO Tracker 2026, 21 startups have already submitted their DRHPs to SEBI, and another 25 are in various stages of preparing for initial public offerings. This demonstrates the growing emphasis on expanding founders’ access to funding in both established and emerging economies. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Investors and enthusiasts are keen to know if ONDO still holds potential. This article explores whether the coin can defy the pause and continues to be a smart bet. Find out which digital assets are gearing up for a rise. Ondo (ONDO) Flirts with Stability Amid Wider Market Volatility Source: tradingview Ondo is hovering between thirty-one to thirty-five cents, keeping traders on their toes. Recent dips have shaken confidence, with prices dropping over six percent in a week. There's a hopeful eye on the horizon for expansion if it can break the thirty-eight-cent marker soon. Pushing through that barrier might ignite a climb to forty-three cents, marking potential growth close to a quarter in value. Market signals like the RSI suggest a middle ground, hinting at potential price swings. Despite its price being roughly two-thirds down over six months, Ondo's enthusiasts still believe in its growth prospects if it can ride above current resistance levels. Conclusion While the RWA narrative has paused, ONDO remains a coin of interest. It continues to show a unique potential, despite the current market shifts. Investors should monitor its developments closely. The outlook for ONDO hinges on how it adapts and responds to these changes. The pause in RWA gives ONDO a chance to recalibrate and prepare for future movements. Its performance in the coming months will be crucial for long-term prospects.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/technical-analyst-27-xrp-price-is-inevitable-heres-why/,"Crypto analyst ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) recently shared a chart suggesting a significant potential rally for XRP. The chart shows XRP completing a prolonged accumulation phase, forming a triangular pattern with clear support and resistance levels. Historical price action indicates that once this structure completes, XRP could experience a sharp upward move. Based on this analysis, ChartNerd described a move to $27 as inevitable . The chart shows a clear breakout from a previous consolidation phase, marked by three points labeled A, B, and C. This structure followed a multi-year compressing price range before the breakout occurred. After the breakout, XRP established a new consolidation zone and has now begun forming the 3-wave ABC pattern. This zone appears to be preparing for the next upward trajectory. $XRP to $27 isn't impossible, its inevitable. Many just dont see through the smoke pic.twitter.com/FXxx5PQS0R — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) January 24, 2026 Fibonacci Levels and Price Targets Fibonacci extension levels on the chart identify key target zones for XRP’s potential move. The first major extension is at $8.35 (Fib. 1.272), followed by $13.52 (Fib. 1.414), and the highest at $27.05 (Fib. 1.618). The historical comparison shows a similar breakout pattern that occurred in 2017. These extension levels pushed the asset to its previous peak in early 2018, and ChartNerd expects the same pattern on a much larger scale. The chart suggests that a repeat of this structure could generate a comparable percentage gain in the coming years. Moving Average Support The chart also includes a short-term moving average, which has consistently acted as support following breakouts. This trend line indicates that price corrections during consolidation phases are likely to find support near the moving average. Traders can observe this as a reference for potential entry points during minor pullbacks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Historical Precedent for Momentum The prior breakout example from 2017 reinforces the concept that XRP often consolidates extensively before making aggressive moves. The current setup mirrors that period, suggesting a similar acceleration. ChartNerd’s analysis points to this repeating pattern, showing that historical price behavior can provide insight into future movements. The chart and analysis indicate that XRP is positioned for a significant upward move, with a target as high as $27 . Historical breakout patterns, Fibonacci extension levels, and more indicators all align to show that XRP’s consolidation is ending. If ChartNerd’s analysis is right, XRP could reach a new all-time high sooner than many expect. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The incident unfolded on Sunday and was traced not to Matcha’s core infrastructure, but to SwapNet, one of the liquidity providers integrated into the platform. Matcha Meta disclosed the issue publicly in a post on X, saying users who had disabled its “One-Time Approval” feature and instead granted direct token allowances to individual aggregator contracts may have been exposed.

PeckShield reported that approximately $16.8 million had been drained in total, with the attacker swapping around $10.5 million in USDC for roughly 3,655 ETH on the Base network before starting to bridge assets to Ethereum. #PeckShieldAlert Matcha Meta has reported a security breach involving SwapNet.

The team noted that users who interacted with Matcha using One-Time Approvals were not affected, as this design limits how much access a third-party contract can retain. After reviewing with 0x's protocol team, we have confirmed that the nature of the incident was not associated with 0x's AllowanceHolder or Settler contracts. Users who have interacted with Matcha Meta via One-Time Approval are thus safe. Users who have disabled One-Time… https://t.co/VQVmj4LL0F — Matcha Meta (@matchametaxyz) January 25, 2026 The exposure, the team said, applied only to users who opted out of that system and granted ongoing allowances directly to aggregator contracts. In response, Matcha has removed the option for users to set such direct approvals going forward. Old Token Approvals Emerge as a Persistent DeFi Weak Spot The breach highlights a recurring tension in DeFi between flexibility and safety. Token approvals, while necessary for interacting with smart contracts, have long been a weak point, particularly when permissions remain active long after a transaction is completed. In this case, previously granted allowances became the pathway for the exploit once the SwapNet contract was compromised. The incident arrives amid continued concerns over smart-contract security across the crypto sector. SlowMist’s year-end report shows that vulnerabilities in smart contracts accounted for just over 30% of crypto exploits in 2025, making them the leading cause of losses. Source: SlowMist Researchers have also warned that advances in artificial intelligence are accelerating how quickly attackers can identify and exploit weaknesses in on-chain code. While overall crypto losses declined in December , falling about 60% month-on-month to roughly $76 million, security firms cautioned that the drop did not reflect a structural improvement. Crypto-related losses from hacks and cybersecurity exploits fell sharply in December, dropping 60% month-on-month to about $76 million. #Crypto #Hack https://t.co/mke6K8sLVQ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 2, 2026 PeckShield noted that a single address-poisoning scam accounted for $50 million of December’s losses, showing how concentrated and severe individual incidents can be even during quieter periods.

Following the adjustment, the APY for the AXS Flexible product has been increased. As the governance and value token of the Axie Infinity ecosystem, AXS performs core functions including community governance and ecosystem incentives. This yield enhancement offers a more compelling participation option for users focused on GameFi and mature Web3 application ecosystems. Simple Participation, Effortless Earning All of the above campaigns and products are now available across all HTX platforms. Allocation is limited and offered on a first-come, first-served basis. Users can subscribe via the HTX App or the official website. On the App, users can enter the Earn section from the homepage and select the relevant products. On the web, users can click Earn on the navigation bar, choose Simple Earn in the dropdown menu, and then click Fixed, Flexible to complete subscriptions.

Investors are making strategic changes to their portfolios, aiming to seize new opportunities. This article dives into the choices being made and highlights the coins that show promise for growth amidst the chaos. Prepare to uncover the tactics and tokens poised for potential gains. Uniswap (UNI) Stays Calm with a Glimmer of Hope for Growth Source: tradingview Uniswap (UNI) is currently trading between $4.44 and $4.96. The coin has struggled recently, falling nearly a tenth in the past week and about a fifth over the last month. It even dropped more than half in six months. Yet, all is not gloomy. The nearest resistance level is set at $5.28, and if UNI breaks past this, it could reach the second resistance at $5.80. This would mean an increase of over a third from the lowest point in its current range. While momentum indicators like RSI and Stochastic show neutrality, the potential for growth remains, offering a silver lining amid a cloudy market phase. Solana Solaces Investors with Stability Amid Market Swings Source: tradingview Solana (SOL) is currently trading between $111 and $132. It's showing resilience despite recent market shifts. The coin has faced a 10.94% drop over the past week but has remained stable over the last month. If buyers push SOL past the resistance level of $145, it could see a stronger climb. If it hits the second resistance level of $166, that would mark a significant increase from the current range. On the flip side, support at $104 offers some protection. Long-term trends show a dip of over 32% in six months, but recent sideways movement and investor interest indicate potential growth if current resistance levels are breached. Aave Faces Uncertain Path Amid Price Fluctuations Source: tradingview Aave's current price swings between around $140 and $162, experiencing a recent dip of nearly 10% over the past week. It hovers close to its 10-day moving average but below the 100-day one, indicating possible short-term volatility. The closest resistance point, reinforced at approximately $177, could provide future growth opportunities if broken. Failure to break this barrier might lead it to test its nearest support around $131. If market sentiment turns positive, Aave could reach up to $200, marking about a 25% potential rise from its higher range. Yet, recent months reflect a significant drop of over 46%, highlighting the need for cautious optimism. Conclusion Traders are shifting their focus to coins like UNI, SOL, and AAVE as market fluctuations increase. They are seeking coins with strong fundamentals and growth potential. By diversifying their portfolios with these choices, traders aim to manage risks better. This approach helps them stay more balanced during market changes. Choosing well-known, solid options is becoming a key strategy for navigating the evolving landscape. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The final decision falls to Donald Trump, but traders on Polymarket are convinced that Rieder has the best odds of winning the job among the current pool of candidates they’re betting on. How Polymarket traders are betting According to the latest data from Polymarket, more people are betting on Rieder being selected as the new Federal Reserve Chair to replace Jerome Powell, who is expected to end his current term in May of this year. On Polymarket , Rieder is currently in the lead with 49%, and Kevin Warsh trails with odds of him being chosen lower at 28%. Christopher Waller follows Warsh with a 10% odd, while Kevin Hassett has a 7% odd. Traders on Kalshi put Rieder’s odds slightly higher at 50% while Warsh is priced in at 30% and Waller at 10%. It is not surprising that Rick Rieder is currently in the lead among those whose names have been floated for the position. His experience as BlackRock’s Chief Investment Officer for Global Fixed Income, which has seen him overseeing over $2 trillion in bonds and related assets, is expected to be very valuable. He is a prominent figure on Wall Street, famous for his views on housing, small businesses, and monetary policy. His view on interest rates especially leans towards lower rates, something people could use a lot of going forward. Why traders think it is likely to be Rick Rieder Up until last week, Rick Rieder was considered a long-shot candidate for the position, with Polymarket traders ranking the probability of it being him at a mere 3%. By Friday afternoon, things had changed, and his odds suddenly jumped past 40%, which put him ahead of former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh and made him the leading contender. He is now being called a dark horse candidate, but the main reason his chances are looking better has been because he seemed to receive an endorsement from Trump and White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett, another finalist for the role. Trump reportedly called him a “very impressive” guy following a recent meeting between the two, and Hassett tagged him “the best bond guy” in an interview with CNBC. Hassett is currently Trump’s closest advisor on economic matters and was previously the top contender for Fed chair. However, his odds have been fading since news started circulating that the president may prefer that he hold down his current role. According to Trump, during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he is close to making his decision and the candidate field, which once had 11 candidates, has now whittled “down to maybe one.” It was after Trump made the comment that Kalshi traders raised the odds for Rieder getting the nomination to 33%, which was around double where they were at the beginning of the week, but still less than the odds that pointed to Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh as the winner. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has been in charge of the candidate screening, also said that he expects Trump will announce a decision soon.

The warning of 100% tariffs on Canadian goods—should Canada deepen trade ties with China—has revived memories of the 2018–2019 trade war era, when escalating protectionism weighed heavily on equities, commodities, and digital assets alike. This time, the crypto market reacted swiftly. Tariff Threat Sparks Immediate Risk-Off Move in Crypto The mere hint of new trade barriers was enough to send the crypto market into a fresh downturn. According to aggregate market data , the total crypto market cap fell from $3.01 trillion to $2.91 trillion—a drop of roughly 3%. Key assets weren’t spared: Bitcoin slid below $88,000 Ether dropped toward $2,880 Altcoins followed with broad intraday declines The price action resembles a classic macro-driven risk-off reaction, exacerbated by crypto’s high leverage levels, thin weekend liquidity, and heightened sensitivity to geopolitical uncertainties. Why Tariffs Matter to Crypto Tariff announcements, even before implementation, influence investor behavior by altering expectations for: Global growth – Higher tariffs restrict trade, dampening economic activity. Inflation – Import taxes push consumer prices higher, complicating central bank policy. Risk sentiment – Investors shift capital away from volatile assets during uncertainty. Crypto—still treated as a risk-on asset in macro cycles—tends to react sharply when growth fears and inflation concerns rise simultaneously. This dynamic mirrors what happened in the 2018–2019 trade war, when repeated tariff volleys triggered prolonged bouts of volatility in both traditional and digital markets. How Outset PR Helps Crypto Companies Navigate Macro-Driven Volatility In moments when geopolitical news drives markets, crypto companies face a visibility challenge: how to communicate effectively when attention shifts and narratives move fast. This is where a data-driven PR approach, like the one used by Outset PR , becomes essential. Outset PR specializes in aligning communications with evolving market sentiment rather than relying on templated, static outreach. Their campaigns are engineered to reflect real-time conditions—something especially crucial during macro disruptions such as tariff tensions. A core element of this methodology is Outset Data Pulse , a proprietary intelligence system that tracks: Media trendlines Traffic distribution Market sentiment shifts On-chain and macro narrative alignment This allows the agency to determine exactly when and where a client’s message will achieve maximum impact. Even more transformative is Syndication Map , an analytics tool that identifies which publications generate the strongest downstream syndication on aggregators like CoinMarketCap and Binance Square. This enables Outset PR to secure placements that deliver visibility several times greater than their initial reach. By focusing on media efficiency rather than volume, Outset PR ensures that clients maintain strong visibility—even during volatile macro cycles—while keeping budgets optimized and communications precisely timed. What Could Reverse the Downtrend? While fear-driven sell-offs can deepen quickly, they can also unwind rapidly once macro pressure eases. For crypto specifically, several developments could help stabilize or reverse the current decline: 1. Cooling of Tariff Tensions If messaging from Trump’s team or Canada signals de-escalation, or if negotiations progress behind the scenes, macro pressure may soften. Markets typically price geopolitical risk quickly—both on the way up and the way down. 2. Rebound in Global Risk Appetite Improving sentiment in equities or commodities often spills over into crypto. A resurgence in tech stocks or a calming in bond markets could restore confidence. 3. On-Chain Strength and Network Demand Fundamentals like rising active addresses, increasing exchange outflows, or renewed institutional flows could offset broader macro weakness. 4. Central Bank Communication If global central banks acknowledge tariff-driven downside risks and signal policy flexibility, risk assets—including Bitcoin and Ether—may stabilize. Expect Volatility to Stay Elevated Even if tariff tensions cool, traders should brace for persistent volatility. Geopolitical narratives can shift quickly, and crypto’s leverage-heavy structure means market reactions tend to be amplified.

The findings were included in Coinbase’s Charting Crypto Q1 2026 report, which surveyed 148 participants—75 institutional investors and 73 independent investors. Upon completing their survey, Coinbase found that about 71% of institutions and 60% of independent investors firmly believed Bitcoin is undervalued. On the other hand, a quarter of the institutional investors viewed Bitcoin’s current market price as a fair reflection of value, particularly given that its price fluctuated primarily between $85,000 and $95,000 during the survey period, while only 4% believed Bitcoin was priced too high. Bitcoin’s current price status raises concerns among investors Data from CoinMarketCap shows that Bitcoin is trading at $87,831.91, down about 0.34% over the past 24 hours. This price demonstrates a decrease of more than 30% from its October all-time high of $126,080. Analysts attributed this recent trend to a major market crash on October 10, which led to significant losses of over $19 billion in leveraged positions. Their findings also showed that cryptocurrency prices largely held steady or declined. Since the market crash, the crypto market has shown no signs of improvement. The upward price trend is losing steam amid US President Donald Trump’s new tariff threats, which are increasing tensions between major trading partners, the US and the Middle East. Coinbase cautions that this trend might intensify, stressing that “geopolitical tensions have increased in many parts of the world. Any rise in conflict that disrupts energy markets could hurt investor sentiment.” Meanwhile, the prices of Gold and silver escalated, with gold attaining an all-time high of more than $5,000 on Monday, January 26, while silver saw its market value double since October. On the other hand, the S&P 500 stock market index rose by just 3%. Institutional investors maintain a bullish outlook despite challenges in the crypto market While Coinbase proceeded with its survey, around 80% of institutional investors indicated plans to keep their existing cryptocurrency holdings or make more purchases if the market declined by an additional 10%. Their remarks illustrated that institutional investors maintain high confidence in the future potential of cryptocurrencies. To further support this claim, reports noted that over 60% of these investors reported holding steady or increasing their crypto holdings since October, when Bitcoin attained its highest level. Interestingly, when reporters reached out to several institutional investors to comment on the current situation in the crypto market, these investors asserted that they see several future opportunities, with 54% interpreting the current market cycle as being either in a phase of accumulation or a bear market. Seeing the investors’ bullish outlook, Coinbase predicted that the Federal Reserve might consider two rate reductions this year, despite ongoing uncertainty about monetary policy. This situation could be advantageous to riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies. Moreover, the crypto exchange alleged that “the economy seems to be stable to back the crypto market. Consumer inflation remained steady at 2.7% in December, and real gross domestic product grew by over 5% in the fourth quarter.” Sharpen your strategy with mentorship + daily ideas - 30 days free access to our trading program",News|BTC|COIN|Federal Reserve,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-26 11:45:16

Unlike volatile tokens, it allows users to generate yield while keeping capital value relatively stable. The key question is how to earn interest on USDC. Among the available options, Clapp Flexible Savings offers some of the most user-friendly conditions for earning interest on USDC, combining daily payouts, full liquidity, and clearly defined rates. That model fits well into a broader landscape of USDC yield strategies, which vary significantly in structure, risk, and complexity. Below is a practical overview of the main ways to earn interest on USDC, and how they compare. 1. DeFi Lending Protocols Decentralized lending platforms allow users to supply USDC to liquidity pools where it is borrowed by traders and institutions. Well-known examples include Aave, Compound, and Morpho. Interest rates are variable and depend on borrowing demand. These platforms offer full on-chain transparency and self-custody, but users take on smart contract risk and may see yields fluctuate during market shifts. This option is typically suited to users comfortable with DeFi mechanics and variable returns. 2. Centralized Crypto Savings Accounts Centralized platforms offer interest on USDC through internal lending or treasury strategies. From a user perspective, these products resemble savings accounts. They are easy to use and often provide stable rates, but funds are fully custodial and yield generation is usually opaque. The user must rely on the platform’s risk management and solvency. This approach prioritizes convenience over transparency. 3. Flexible Crypto Savings Products Flexible savings products aim to remove complexity while preserving access to funds. Clapp Flexible Savings falls into this category, offering 5.2% APY on USDC with: Daily interest accrual No lock-ups or withdrawal penalties Instant access to funds Clearly displayed rates with no tiers There are no fixed terms or advanced strategies; this model focuses on predictability and liquidity. It is particularly suited to users who treat USDC as a cash-like reserve but still want it to generate yield. 4. DeFi Vaults and Yield Aggregators Yield aggregators automate USDC deployment across lending markets, liquidity pools, or arbitrage strategies. Platforms such as Yearn and Beefy handle strategy selection and rebalancing, potentially increasing returns. In exchange, users accept higher complexity, strategy risk, and reduced transparency. These products are generally better suited to experienced users who are comfortable delegating capital to algorithmic strategies. 5. Advanced Market-Based Strategies More complex approaches include liquidity provision on decentralized exchanges, funding-rate arbitrage, or delta-neutral strategies. While these methods can deliver higher yields, they require active management and a deeper understanding of market mechanics. For most users, they function more as trading strategies than savings tools. Ways to Earn Interest on USDC Method Yield Stability Liquidity Custody Complexity DeFi lending Medium High Self-custody Medium CeFi savings High High Custodial Low Flexible savings (Clapp) High Very high Custodial Very low DeFi vaults Low–Medium Medium Self-custody High Advanced strategies Low Variable Mixed High Final Thoughts Earning interest on USDC is less about maximizing yield and more about choosing the right balance between access, transparency, and risk. For users who value daily interest, instant liquidity, and simple mechanics, flexible savings products like Clapp Flexible Savings offer some of the strongest conditions available. Other approaches — such as DeFi lending or vaults — may appeal to users willing to trade simplicity for composability or higher potential returns.

57477381,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2026/01/llm-visibility-for-crypto-brands-which-agencies-help-web3-projects-get-cited-by-ai,1769428119,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/57477381.jpeg,LLM Visibility for Crypto Brands: Which Agencies Help Web3 Projects Get Cited by AI,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2026/01/llm-visibility-for-crypto-brands-which-agencies-help-web3-projects-get-cited-by-ai,"In 2026, interactions with large language models (LLMs) are part of how people discover and evaluate Web3 projects. Users ask tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude or Perplexity questions that range from “Is this token legitimate?” to “What are good wallets for active traders?”. When an LLM answers, it draws on patterns in its training data and, in some cases, data indexed from the open web. For crypto companies, this creates a new visibility layer: being accurately cited by AI in response to relevant queries. Outset PR was one of the first crypto PR agencies to explicitly address this shift by offering AI Optimization (AIO) to its clients and improving how brands appear in AI-generated answers. What LLM visibility means When people search with Google, they see a ranked list of links. When asking an LLM a question, they receive a synthesized answer. In both cases, discoverability matters, but the mechanisms differ: Traditional SEO relies on links, keywords, and crawling. LLM visibility depends on the information the model learned during training plus any systems that connect the model to up-to-date sources. For crypto brands, LLM visibility can show up in LLM responses in several ways: The project is named in answers to topical queries (“Layer 2 networks with the strongest developer activity”). The model includes a correct brief explanation of what the project does. The model’s response reflects recent developments (e.g., token utility changes, funding rounds). If the model neither knows the brand nor can construct a factual description, the answer may default to generic alternatives or omit the brand entirely. Why visibility in LLMs matters for crypto brands People ask LLMs questions before making financial decisions, researching protocols, or comparing tools. When an LLM generates answers: Many users do not click through to source content. They assume the summary is accurate. The presence or absence of a brand in the answer influences perception. Being omitted or described incorrectly can suppress interest. Being cited accurately in relevant contexts increases the likelihood that a potential user or investor learns about the project. Unlike traditional media placements, LLM visibility operates through synthesized answers. It is not a ranking in search results, but the inclusion of your brand in responses to user queries. Outset PR and AI Optimization (AIO) Outset PR was among the first crypto-focused agencies to frame PR around AIO. It improves how brands are interpreted and cited by LLMs, using following techniques: Building a consistent narrative across crypto and mainstream tech media Prioritizing explanatory and analytical formats over promotional language Positioning founders and executives as quoted sources in industry coverage Ensuring brand descriptions remain stable and factual across publications The goal of AIO is long-term inclusion in the knowledge layer that AI systems draw from when generating answers. This approach reflects how discovery works today: LLMs rely on accumulated context, not campaign bursts. Other agencies active in AIO for Web3 companies Several other agencies operate in the crypto and Web3 PR space and contribute indirectly to LLM visibility through broad editorial coverage: Coinbound focuses on crypto-native media, influencer programs, and community-driven exposure. Serotonin works with infrastructure and protocol-level projects on narrative development and media strategy. MarketAcross emphasizes large-scale distribution and enterprise blockchain communications. ReBlonde helps Web3 brands reach both crypto and mainstream tech outlets. While these agencies may not frame their services explicitly around AIO, their work contributes to the public content ecosystem that LLMs learn from. Conclusion LLM visibility is becoming part of how crypto brands are evaluated, even if users are not aware of it. It depends on whether AI systems can find, recognize, and summarize a project based on the public record. If your goal is to have people discover your project through AI tools, the focus should be on clarity, accuracy, and sustained visibility in the public record. That is what supports inclusion in AI responses. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

57477393,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=902561,1769428188,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57477393.jpeg,Why Is Bitcoin Dropping — And Why Early Buyers Are Watching Bitcoin Everlight,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/why-is-bitcoin-dropping-and-why-early-buyers-are-watching-bitcoin-everlight/,"Bitcoin’s sharp pullback has triggered widespread liquidations, but beneath the volatility, attention is quietly shifting toward infrastructure projects built for long-term utility rather than short-term price momentum. Bitcoin fell below the $88,000 level this week after failing to hold resistance near $95,000, capping off a rapid reversal from recent highs around $98,000. The move triggered one of the largest liquidation waves in recent months, wiping out leveraged positions across the market. According to CoinGlass data, more than $1 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated during the pullback, affecting over 200,000 individual traders. Analysts compared the scale of the event to systemic shocks seen during the FTX collapse, underscoring how quickly leverage-driven markets can unwind. While the immediate damage has been significant, the selloff has also prompted a familiar shift in behavior. Why Bitcoin Is Falling: Leverage, Liquidity, and Macro Pressure The latest downturn reflects a convergence of factors rather than a single failure point. Aggressive leverage across futures markets amplified downside moves, while macro uncertainty — including bond market instability and geopolitical trade tensions — reduced risk appetite across global assets. As Bitcoin slipped below key technical levels, forced liquidations accelerated the decline. This dynamic has become a recurring feature of modern crypto markets: price moves are increasingly shaped by derivatives positioning rather than spot demand alone. For many participants, the result is less about short-term conviction and more about reassessing exposure. Why Early Buyers Are Watching Bitcoin Everlight Against this backdrop, Bitcoin Everlight has drawn increased attention from early-stage researchers. The interest is not driven by price narratives, but by how the project is structured. Bitcoin Everlight is designed as a lightweight Bitcoin payment layer, focused on making Bitcoin transactions faster, lower-cost, and more predictable without requiring users to manage complex payment channels. Transactions remain anchored directly to Bitcoin’s blockchain, preserving Bitcoin’s security model while improving usability. For early buyers, the appeal lies in participation at the infrastructure level — engaging with a system intended to support Bitcoin’s everyday use rather than react to short-term market cycles. Node Roles, Tiers, and Operational Participation Bitcoin Everlight’s network is supported by a tiered node participation model designed to keep transaction routing efficient as usage scales. Participants stake BTCL to support routing and lightweight validation across the Everlight layer. Node roles are organized into Light, Core, and Prime tiers , with higher tiers associated with greater routing responsibility, priority handling, and access to advanced operational tools. Network rewards are distributed based on uptime, performance, and routing contribution , rather than passive holding. Reward ranges adjust dynamically with network activity, reinforcing participation as an operational role aligned with network reliability — not a fixed-yield product. This structure is central to why early buyers are paying attention: BTCL is embedded directly into how the network functions, not bolted on as an incentive mechanism. Early Network Access Before Mainnet Deployment Bitcoin Everlight is currently distributing BTCL through a structured, multi-phase public presale designed around capped allocations rather than open-ended issuance. The presale consists of 20 defined phases. Phase 1 includes 472,500,000 BTCL tokens , priced at $0.0008 per token , with participation handled exclusively through the official Bitcoin Everlight website. Tokens are scheduled for delivery at launch as ERC-20 assets, followed by a planned migration to the native Bitcoin Everlight network as mainnet deployment progresses. This approach frames early participation as access to future network functionality — including node participation and routing roles — rather than speculative positioning tied to short-term price movement. Security Reviews and Identity Checks Bitcoin Everlight has subjected its contracts and participation logic to external review before public distribution. The project’s token contracts, staking logic, and treasury controls have been examined by SolidProof and Spywolf , with published reports detailing contract behavior, permission boundaries, and identified risk surfaces. In parallel, core contributors have completed identity verification through Spywolf KYC and Vital Block , establishing accountability beyond anonymous deployment. These steps do not imply guarantees. They establish a paper trail — code inspected by third parties, contributors tied to real identities, and documentation that holds up under independent due diligence. Bottom line Bitcoin’s price will continue to react to leverage, liquidity, and macro conditions. What changes during downturns is where attention settles. As volatility exposes fragility elsewhere, early buyers often turn toward projects that emphasize structure, usability, and verifiable design. Bitcoin Everlight’s growing visibility reflects that pattern — attracting scrutiny not because of promises, but because of how participation, infrastructure, and incentives are intentionally aligned.

The cryptocurrency market has been bearish over the last three weeks and has begun another week with more losses. Over $100 billion was wiped out from the crypto market on Sunday as events in the United States affected Bitcoin and other major altcoins. Possible US government shutdown pushes BTC’s price below $87k Bitcoin lost 2% of its value on Sunday and dropped to the $86k level, filling out the Fair Value Gap (FVG) on the 4-hour chart from December 19. The bearish performance comes amid the rising possibility of another US government shutdown. The shutdown risks are fueled by funding uncertainty and political deadlock. There is a legislative friction in Congress, where Democratic lawmakers have threatened to block a Department of Homeland Security funding bill following controversy over federal law enforcement actions. If another shutdown happens, it will come on the back of the longest government shutdown in US history, which lasted for six weeks. In addition to that, traders are focusing on the upcoming Fed rate decision. If there is a government shutdown, it would be hard for the Fed to cut the interest rates as the apex bank would lack the data to make informed decisions. While Bitcoin has bounced back and is now trading at $87,805, the bearish performance saw $744 million in liquidations of leveraged positions in the last 24 hours, led by $580 million for longs and $164 for shorts. BTC recovers above $87k after Sunday’s dip The BTC/USD 4-hour chart remains extremely bearish as Bitcoin has failed to rally towards the $91,600 resistance. Instead, it dropped below the $87k support level over the weekend. At press time, BTC is trading above $87,800. The momentum indicators remain bearish despite the rebound. If the recovery continues and Bitcoin’s daily candle closes above $87,878, the leading cryptocurrency could extend its recovery toward the nearest resistance level at $90,000. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 39, below the neutral 50 level, indicating bearish momentum. BTC will remain below $90k if the RSI fails to move past the neutral 50 level. In addition to that, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed a bearish crossover last week, and the view remains in place. Thus, suggesting a bearish market condition. If the bulls fail to push BTC above the $90k level in the near term, the bearish trend could continue, and BTC could drop below the $85,569 support level, which coincides with the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement region on the daily chart. On the macro view, Bitcoin’s price action remains choppy, with no clear direction in the near term.

On Monday, the special administrative city signed an agreement with the Shanghai Gold Exchange during the annual Asian Financial Forum, according to official statements released by the city. Under the memorandum of understanding , the Shanghai Gold Exchange will help Hong Kong establish a new, centralized precious metals clearing infrastructure. The partnership includes technical support, regulatory input, and risk management assistance in creating the Hong Kong Precious Metals Central Clearing Co. Gold prices climbed above $5,000 per ounce for the very first time, extending a rally that saw prices go up by more than 60% in 2025. Hong Kong unveils gold ambitions with China’s support According to Nikkei Asia, the soon-to-be-launched clearing company will become the main system for gold transactions in the city. Government officials said in the ceremony that trial operations will begin later this year, once regulatory approvals and operational arrangements are completed. An agency under China’s central bank, the Shanghai Gold Exchange, will help draft rules and approve institutions seeking to provide gold trading services. The new facility will provide efficient and reliable clearing services for gold transactions in compliance with international standards. Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee. Hong Kong’s Secretary for Financial Services, Christopher Hui, is slated to chair the company. At the same time, a representative from the Shanghai Gold Exchange will become deputy chair, according to people familiar with the arrangement . The People’s Bank of China will support the Shanghai Gold Exchange in participating in the development of Hong Kong’s gold clearing system through various means to help Hong Kong build an international gold trading center and strengthen its connections with the global gold market. China’s Central Bank Deputy Governor Zou Lan. Zou also mentioned that the cooperation would make Hong Kong more suitable as an offshore market for China’s digital yuan . China is both the world’s largest producer and consumer of gold, giving it outsized weight in price formation and physical supply. As of September last year, China held 7.7% of global gold reserves, according to data from the World Gold Council. The country has been a net buyer of gold for 14 consecutive months, and its official holdings to 2,306 metric tons as of last month. The government wants to develop a gold vault with a capacity exceeding 2,000 tons within three years, under the Shanghai Gold Exchange’s physical warehousing management system. Russian gold shipments to China hit new records As reported by state news agency RIA Novosti, Russia increased its physical gold exports to China in 2025 to 25.3 tonnes, up 800% from the previous year. Exports jumped 14.6 times to $3.29 billion, a record high for the entire history of gold trade between Russia and China. Gold exports to China in December alone reached $1.35 billion, equivalent to a monthly record of about 10 tonnes. Despite the surge, Russia was seventh among China’s gold suppliers by volume last year. Switzerland is still the largest exporter, selling gold worth $25.73 billion to China. Canada followed with $11.06 billion, while South Africa shipped $9.42 billion. Australia and Kyrgyzstan rounded out the top five exporters, with $8.77 billion and $4.95 billion, respectively. Meanwhile, Chinese rare-earth metal shares have been rallying , buoyed by supply concerns and policy support from Beijing. Sales and profits from the rare-earth sector are trending higher, as the total net profit for January through September 2025 from about 47 companies already matched the full-year total for 2024. If current performance continues, the sector’s annual profits are likely to reach the highest level since 2016, according to figures from Shanghai-based information provider Shanghai DZH. China began restricting exports of seven rare earth elements, including dysprosium, in April 2025. The move preceded the announcement of “reciprocal” tariffs on Chinese goods by an angry US President Donald Trump, whose government is still in talks with Beijing. In Europe, where prices are particularly sensitive to Chinese supply curbs, dysprosium reached $935 per kilogram in January, according to UK research firm Argus Media.

Binance TSLA/USDT Perpetual Futures Launch Details Binance officially confirmed the TSLA/USDT perpetual futures listing on January 28, 2025. The exchange will activate trading precisely at 2:30 p.m. UTC. This announcement follows Binance’s January 8 declaration about launching traditional finance perpetual futures contracts. Consequently, traders gain exposure to Tesla’s price movements using cryptocurrency. The contract specifications include USDT margining and perpetual settlement mechanisms. Moreover, Binance typically provides leverage options for such instruments. The exchange maintains rigorous risk management protocols for all derivatives products. Therefore, traders should review official documentation before participating. Traditional Finance Integration Strategy Binance’s TradFi perpetual futures initiative represents a strategic expansion. The exchange previously announced this new product category on January 8. Traditional finance instruments now enter the cryptocurrency derivatives space. Specifically, TSLA becomes the first major equity-linked perpetual contract. This development follows increasing institutional cryptocurrency adoption. Furthermore, regulatory frameworks continue evolving globally. Major financial institutions now explore cryptocurrency integration. Binance consequently positions itself at this convergence point. The exchange leverages its technological infrastructure for innovative products. Market participants increasingly demand traditional asset exposure through crypto platforms. Market Impact and Trading Implications TSLA/USDT perpetual futures introduce significant market implications. Cryptocurrency traders can now speculate on Tesla’s performance without traditional brokerage accounts. This product eliminates traditional market operating hour restrictions. Trading occurs 24/7 through Binance’s global platform. Additionally, settlement happens in USDT rather than fiat currency. The contract likely mirrors Tesla’s NASDAQ price feed. However, cryptocurrency market volatility may create pricing divergences. Experienced derivatives traders understand these technical nuances. Risk management becomes particularly crucial with equity-linked crypto derivatives. Market makers will provide necessary liquidity from launch. Regulatory compliance remains paramount for Binance’s operations. Cryptocurrency Derivatives Evolution Timeline Year Development Significance 2016 First Bitcoin perpetual swaps Introduced crypto-native derivatives 2020 Major exchanges add altcoin futures Expanded beyond Bitcoin dominance 2023 Regulatory frameworks emerge Increased institutional participation 2024 TradFi-crypto bridge products tested Paved way for equity-linked contracts 2025 Binance TSLA/USDT perpetual futures First major equity perpetual on crypto exchange The derivatives evolution demonstrates clear progression toward traditional asset integration. Initially, cryptocurrency derivatives focused exclusively on digital assets. Subsequently, platforms expanded to various altcoins and tokens. Regulatory developments then enabled more sophisticated products. Testing phases confirmed technological feasibility for equity-linked contracts. Finally, Binance launches TSLA/USDT perpetual futures as culmination. This timeline reflects broader financial market convergence. Technological innovation drives these structural changes. Market demand accelerates adoption timelines. Consequently, more TradFi instruments will likely follow. Technical Specifications and Trading Mechanics TSLA/USDT perpetual futures operate under specific technical parameters. The contract uses USDT as collateral and settlement currency. Funding rates maintain price alignment with Tesla’s underlying value. Binance employs robust index price calculation methodologies. The exchange typically uses multiple data sources for accuracy. Leverage options will follow Binance’s standard tiered system. Risk management features include: Auto-deleveraging protection for extreme volatility scenarios Liquidation mechanisms preventing systemic risk Insurance funds covering unexpected losses Position limits maintaining market stability Traders must understand these mechanics thoroughly. Educational resources typically accompany major product launches. Binance provides comprehensive documentation for all derivatives. Furthermore, demo trading sometimes precedes live implementation. However, the January 28 launch appears direct. Market participants should prepare accordingly. Technical analysis tools will support trading decisions. Charting interfaces will display Tesla price data. Order types mirror existing futures products. Execution speed remains critical for derivatives trading. Regulatory Considerations and Compliance Framework Binance operates within evolving regulatory environments globally. The exchange maintains licensing in multiple jurisdictions. TSLA/USDT perpetual futures require careful regulatory navigation. Securities regulations govern traditional equity derivatives. Cryptocurrency regulations oversee digital asset trading. Binance bridges these regulatory domains skillfully. The exchange collaborates with financial authorities worldwide. Compliance teams ensure product adherence to local laws. Some jurisdictions may restrict equity-linked crypto derivatives. Binance typically implements geofencing for regulatory compliance. Users must verify local legality before trading. Regulatory clarity improves gradually across markets. Binance’s compliance investments facilitate innovative products. The exchange demonstrates commitment to lawful operations. Regulatory approval processes precede major launches. Consequently, TSLA/USDT futures underwent rigorous review. Market Analysis and Trader Preparation Tesla’s market behavior influences TSLA/USDT futures dynamics. The electric vehicle manufacturer exhibits notable volatility. Cryptocurrency traders encounter familiar volatility patterns. However, equity market fundamentals differ significantly. Tesla’s performance connects to automotive industry trends. Additionally, energy sector developments impact valuation. Elon Musk’s announcements frequently move Tesla’s stock. Cryptocurrency traders must study these traditional factors. Technical analysis principles remain applicable. Yet fundamental analysis gains increased importance. Traders should monitor Tesla’s quarterly earnings reports. Furthermore, automotive delivery numbers affect stock performance. Macroeconomic conditions influence traditional equities. Interest rate changes impact growth stocks like Tesla. Geopolitical events may affect global automotive markets. Supply chain developments warrant close observation. Competitor announcements could shift market sentiment. Therefore, comprehensive research becomes essential. Conclusion Binance’s TSLA/USDT perpetual futures launch on January 28 represents a landmark development in financial market convergence. This innovative product bridges cryptocurrency trading with traditional equity exposure through Tesla, one of the world’s most watched stocks. The launch follows Binance’s strategic expansion into TradFi perpetual futures, announced earlier in January. Market participants gain 24/7 trading access to Tesla price movements using cryptocurrency infrastructure. However, successful trading requires understanding both cryptocurrency derivatives mechanics and traditional equity market fundamentals. Regulatory compliance remains crucial across jurisdictions. Binance continues leading cryptocurrency exchange innovation with this groundbreaking TSLA/USDT perpetual futures offering, potentially paving the way for more traditional finance instruments entering the cryptocurrency derivatives space.

In reality, staking is not always the most flexible option. Lock-ups, validator exposure, and operational complexity make staking unsuitable for many users, especially those who value liquidity or simpler risk profiles. Clapp Flexible Savings offers a clear alternative to ETH staking. Instead of bonding ETH to validators, it allows users to earn interest on their ETH holdings through a flexible savings model. Funds remain liquid, interest accrues daily, and withdrawals are available at any time—without lock-ups or staking mechanics. How ETH Staking Works ETH staking generates rewards by securing the Ethereum network. Your capital is bonded to validators, and returns depend on network conditions, validator performance, and protocol rules. Interest-based yield works differently. ETH is used as a financial asset rather than a security instrument. Yield comes from lending, treasury management, or structured financial strategies, not block validation. The result is a more familiar savings-style model, with clearer access terms and fewer technical dependencies. Common drawbacks of ETH staking Staking introduces several constraints that are often overlooked: Capital lock-up or delayed withdrawals Slashing and validator risk Yield variability tied to network activity Limited flexibility during market volatility These factors make staking less suitable for users who want to actively manage exposure or keep funds readily accessible. Flexible savings as a practical alternative One example of the interest-based model is Clapp Flexible Savings, which offers 4.2% APY on ETH without staking, lock-ups, or DeFi interaction. Interest accrues daily, funds remain liquid, and rates are clearly displayed in the app. ETH is not bonded to validators, meaning users can withdraw or rebalance at any time without penalties. From a user perspective, this functions closer to a savings account than a staking product. Clapp also extends this model to stablecoins and EUR, offering 5.2% APY, with EUR deposits supported via SEPA Instant. The platform operates as a registered VASP in the Czech Republic and uses Fireblocks for institutional-grade custody. Choosing the right ETH yield strategy The choice between staking and interest depends on priorities: Staking suits long-term holders comfortable with lock-ups and network-level risk. Interest-based ETH savings suit users who want yield with liquidity, simpler mechanics, and predictable access. Neither model is inherently superior. They serve different risk profiles and usage patterns. ETH Staking vs Interest-Based ETH Savings Feature ETH Staking Clapp Flexible Savings Yield type Protocol rewards Interest on ETH Typical APY ~3–4% (variable) 4.2% APY (fixed) Lock-up Yes (bonded or delayed withdrawals) No lock-ups Liquidity Limited Full, instant access Slashing risk Yes No Validator exposure Yes No Complexity Technical setup or delegation App-based, no setup Yield accrual Epoch-based Daily Capital flexibility Low High Suitable for Long-term passive holders Users who value liquidity Final thoughts Earning yield on Ethereum does not always require staking. For many users, earning interest on ETH provides a cleaner, more flexible approach when liquidity, simplicity, and capital control matter more than maximizing protocol-native rewards.

According to data from CoinDesk, this potential four-month losing streak for Bitcoin highlights a period of sustained pressure, even as contrasting signals emerge from the derivatives sector. The current phase presents a complex picture for investors, combining historical precedent with evolving market mechanics. Bitcoin Losing Streak: A Deep Dive into the Numbers Bitcoin’s price trajectory has entered a notably bearish phase. The asset has fallen approximately 36% from its all-time high, recorded in October of the previous year. This decline marks a consistent monthly downward trend. Importantly, analysts note that such a prolonged sequence of monthly losses did not materialize even during the severe market collapse of 2022. That period, often called the “crypto winter,” featured sharper, more volatile drawdowns but was interspersed with brief relief rallies that prevented four straight red monthly closes. Consequently, the current steady, multi-month descent represents a distinct and historically significant pattern for Bitcoin’s market behavior. Historical Context: The 2018 Precedent To understand the current situation, one must examine the 2018 bear market. Following its then-peak near $20,000 in late 2017, Bitcoin endured a brutal six-month losing streak. That period was characterized by fading retail euphoria, regulatory uncertainties, and the maturation of the initial coin offering (ICO) bubble’s burst. The market ultimately found a bottom after that half-year decline, setting the stage for a new cycle. The current four-month streak, while shorter, evokes memories of that foundational bear market, prompting analysts to scrutinize macroeconomic parallels and differences in market structure. Spot Market Weakness Versus Derivatives Optimism A fascinating divergence is defining the current market landscape. While the spot price of Bitcoin shows clear weakness, a sense of short-term optimism is building in the derivatives market. This activity primarily centers on bullish options bets. Traders are reportedly positioning for a potential upward move, using call options to gain leverage on a price recovery. This creates a tension between the immediate price action on spot exchanges and the forward-looking expectations embedded in options pricing. Such a divergence often signals that sophisticated market participants may be anticipating a trend reversal or a significant volatility event, despite the prevailing negative momentum. Key factors influencing the spot market include: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Persistent concerns over interest rate policies and inflation continue to pressure risk assets globally. Reduced Institutional Inflows: The pace of inflows into U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs has slowed from their initial explosive launch period. On-Chain Metrics: Data shows a reduction in network activity and some movement of older coins, suggesting distribution. The Role of Market Structure and Liquidity The evolution of Bitcoin’s market structure since 2018 is profound. The introduction of regulated futures and options markets, along with the landmark approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States, has fundamentally changed the asset’s investor base and liquidity profile. These new vehicles provide both institutional avenues for exposure and new mechanisms for price discovery. Therefore, comparing the 2018 downturn to the present requires acknowledging that Bitcoin now operates within a more integrated, though not less complex, global financial framework. This integration can amplify correlations with traditional markets while also providing more tools for risk management. Expert Analysis and Forward-Looking Indicators Market analysts are closely monitoring several indicators to gauge the streak’s potential duration. The put/call ratio in options markets, funding rates in perpetual swap markets, and exchange reserve flows all provide clues. Furthermore, the upcoming Bitcoin network halving event, while a few months past, continues to be a fundamental anchor for long-term supply narratives. Experts caution that while historical patterns offer guidance, each market cycle possesses unique drivers. The current confluence of a technical losing streak, cautious spot markets, and hopeful derivatives positioning suggests a market at an inflection point, weighing long-term valuation models against short-term macroeconomic uncertainty. Comparative Table: Key Bearish Periods for Bitcoin Period Duration of Monthly Losses Approximate Drawdown Primary Catalysts 2018 Bear Market 6 Months ~84% from ATH Post-ICO bubble, regulatory scrutiny 2022 Crypto Winter No 4-month streak ~77% from ATH Leverage unwinding, macro tightening, industry failures Current Phase (2025) 4 Months (Potential) ~36% from ATH Macro pressures, ETF flow normalization, technical correction Conclusion Bitcoin stands at a critical juncture, facing its first four-month losing streak since the defining bear market of 2018. This period underscores the asset’s ongoing maturation amidst global financial uncertainty. The notable divergence between weak spot prices and building optimism in derivatives markets adds a layer of complexity to the analysis. While historical comparisons are valuable, the current market structure, shaped by ETFs and sophisticated derivatives, creates a new environment for this cycle. Observers will watch closely to see if this prolonged Bitcoin losing streak marks a final capitulation before a reversal or the beginning of a deeper corrective phase, making the coming weeks crucial for medium-term direction. FAQs Q1: What does a four-month losing streak mean for Bitcoin? A four-month losing streak indicates sustained selling pressure and a lack of positive monthly momentum. It is a technical signal that often leads investors to re-evaluate trend assumptions and seek underlying fundamental causes, such as macroeconomic shifts or changes in network demand. Q2: How does the current decline compare to Bitcoin’s 2022 crash? The 2022 crash was sharper and driven by specific industry crises (e.g., Terra/LUNA collapse, FTX). The current decline is a more gradual, consistent monthly downtrend, occurring within a more regulated market with spot ETFs, making its character different despite both being bearish periods. Q3: Why is there optimism in derivatives if the spot price is falling? Derivatives markets allow traders to bet on future price movements. Bullish options bets (call options) suggest some traders are positioning for a potential rebound or increased volatility to the upside, anticipating that the current spot price weakness may be overdone or nearing an end. Q4: What happened after Bitcoin’s six-month losing streak in 2018? After the six-month losing streak in 2018, Bitcoin’s price eventually consolidated and found a multi-year bottom around $3,200. This period of accumulation preceded the next major bull cycle, which began in late 2020. Q5: Are Bitcoin ETFs affecting this losing streak? Yes, spot Bitcoin ETFs have introduced a new, significant source of daily demand and liquidity. Fluctuations in ETF inflows and outflows can now directly impact spot market prices, adding a new variable to the price discovery process during this downturn.

His comments come as fiat currencies like the Dollar and Yen continue to weaken amid concerns about governments’ fiscal policies. Global Liquidity Points To A Bitcoin Target Of $270,000 In an X post, Kyle Chassé shared an accompanying chart highlighting a Bitcoin target of $270,000 based on rising global liquidity. The pundit stated that the herd says that $90,000 BTC is expensive, but that the fiat ledger has reminded everyone why the digital ledger exists. This came as he revealed that the global M2 money supply has hit a record $98 trillion, driven by aggressive expansion from the U.S., the Eurozone, China, and Japan. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Following The 2022 Fractal? Here Was The Previous Outcome Chassé further noted that year-to-date (YTD) global liquidity growth is now 6.2%, the fastest pace since the 2020 pandemic response. The pundit warned that in a system where the fiat denominator is permanently diluted, fixed-supply assets are not going up in price, but that cash is “loudly becoming worthless.” As such, he believes that BTC is a good hedge against currency debasement and potentially inflation. The pundit’s comments notably come amid a decline in the dollar, with the DXY down since the start of the year. The yen is also down YTD, as these fiat declines are coming amid a push by the governments to increase spending. Increased government spending is considered bullish for Bitcoin, given its fixed supply compared to fiat currencies, which governments continue to print. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes had also recently predicted that a rise in dollar liquidity would spark higher BTC prices. However, that is yet to be the case as Bitcoin continues to trade like a risk asset and has erased its year-to-date (YTD) gains amid political tensions in the U.S. A U.S. government shutdown is also looking more likely by January 31, sparking a BTC drop below $87,000 yesterday. BTC Will Rise Once Liquidity Returns Crypto pundit Merlijn assured that Bitcoin will rise once liquidity comes back. In an X post, he urged market participants to zoom out and that the BTC pattern would become obvious. The pundit revealed that the flagship crypto has already recorded waves 1, 2, and 3 with lower highs, which signal trend fatigue. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Prices Are Still Crashing Hard Now, Bitcoin is looking to form waves 4 and 5, which would signal a reset, absorption, and base building. Merlijn suggested that the bottom may not yet be in, but that once that happens, BTC could rally to as high as $124,000, bringing it close to its current all-time high (ATH) of $126,000. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $87,700, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

In 2026, three platforms dominate the instant swap landscape: ChangeNOW, Changelly, and Godex. Each offers unique advantages that cater to different trading styles and privacy preferences. This comprehensive instant exchange comparison breaks down everything you need to know to make the smartest choice for your cryptocurrency swaps. Whether you’re converting Bitcoin to Ethereum, diversifying into altcoins, or seeking anonymous trading solutions, choosing the right platform can save you money, time, and headaches. Let’s dive into this head-to-head battle and discover which exchange deserves your trust. What Makes Instant Crypto Exchanges Different? Instant crypto exchanges process swaps within minutes without requiring traditional order books or lengthy verification processes. Unlike centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, these platforms specialize in one thing: getting your crypto from point A to point B as quickly and seamlessly as possible. The appeal is straightforward. You select your trading pair, enter your receiving wallet address, send your cryptocurrency, and receive your new assets—often in under 30 minutes. No complex trading interfaces, no margin calls, and depending on the platform, minimal or zero identity verification requirements. These platforms aggregate liquidity from multiple sources, scanning exchanges like Binance, Bitfinex, and HitBTC to find optimal rates. This approach means you often get competitive pricing without needing accounts on multiple platforms. Platform Overview: The Three Contenders Godex: The Privacy Purist Godex stands apart as the most privacy-focused option among these three contenders. Operating since 2018 from the Seychelles, Godex has built its entire platform around one principle: your financial privacy is non-negotiable. What makes Godex unique: Zero KYC requirements —no registration, no personal data collection, ever 928+ cryptocurrencies available for anonymous swaps No exchange volume limits—swap any amount Both fixed and floating rate options Guaranteed rate lock for 30 minutes 24/7 customer support Trusted partnerships with Trezor, Monero, and Edge Wallet Android app available on Google Play Over 1,000 reviews on Trustpilot Godex represents the original cryptocurrency ethos: decentralized, private, and user-controlled. The platform aggregates rates from major exchanges including Binance, Bitfinex, and HitBTC, ensuring competitive pricing while maintaining complete anonymity. ChangeNOW: The Speed Champion ChangeNOW has built its reputation on lightning-fast execution and extensive asset coverage since launching in 2017. The platform supports over 1,500 cryptocurrencies with more than one million trading pairs, making it one of the most comprehensive instant swap services available. Key characteristics of ChangeNOW include: Average swap completion time of 2-5 minutes Both fixed and floating rate options Non-custodial architecture for standard swaps Integration with major hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor NOW Token ecosystem with cashback rewards Fiat on-ramps supporting 70+ currencies ChangeNOW operates a tiered approach to verification. Small transactions typically process without KYC, but the platform may request verification for larger amounts or flagged transactions. This hybrid model balances regulatory compliance with user convenience. Changelly: The Pioneer Changelly entered the market in 2015, making it one of the oldest instant exchange platforms in operation. Originally created to serve the MinerGate community, it has evolved into a comprehensive swap service supporting over 500 cryptocurrencies across 185 blockchain networks. Changelly’s defining features include: Established track record with 10+ million users 0.25% flat fee for crypto-to-crypto swaps Integration with 600+ API partners Changelly PRO platform for advanced traders Fixed and floating rate mechanisms Partnerships with Ledger, Trezor, and Exodus wallets The platform operates from St. Vincent and the Grenadines and maintains a hybrid CeDeFi model combining centralized efficiency with decentralized principles. Changelly’s extensive partner network means you might encounter its technology embedded in various wallet applications. Head-to-Head Comparison: Features That Matter Fees and Pricing Transparency Understanding the true cost of your swap requires looking beyond advertised rates. Each platform handles fees differently, affecting your final returns. Godex offers what it describes as the lowest fees in the market with completely transparent pricing and no hidden costs. The rate you see is the rate you get, with all network fees clearly displayed upfront. This transparency, combined with competitive rate aggregation, often results in favorable final amounts. ChangeNOW incorporates all fees into the displayed rate. While this creates transparency at checkout, the actual fee percentage isn’t explicitly disclosed. The platform claims to find the most profitable exchange routes, and users generally report competitive final amounts. Changelly charges a straightforward 0.25% fee on crypto-to-crypto swaps. This predictability helps you calculate exact costs before confirming transactions. However, fiat purchases through third-party providers like Simplex carry additional fees, sometimes reaching 5% or higher. Privacy and KYC Requirements Privacy represents perhaps the most significant differentiator among these platforms—and the area where Godex truly shines. Platform Registration Required KYC Policy Data Collection Godex Never None—ever Zero personal data ChangeNOW Optional Triggered for suspicious/large transactions Limited without account Changelly Optional Tiered system; may be required Collects email; may request ID Godex maintains an absolute no-KYC policy. No registration. No email addresses. No phone numbers. No personal data whatsoever. You simply select your currencies, enter your receiving wallet address, and complete your swap. This approach aligns with cryptocurrency’s foundational principles of financial privacy and self-sovereignty. ChangeNOW operates on a “KYC when necessary” model. Standard swaps process without verification, but the platform reserves the right to request identity documents for transactions flagged by their risk management system. Some users report unexpected verification requests during routine swaps. Changelly implements a tiered verification system. Basic swaps of up to €10,000 within 48 hours require only passport verification. Advanced KYC includes face-to-face recognition calls and additional documentation. The platform’s 2024 class action lawsuit regarding biometric data collection highlights potential privacy concerns. Supported Cryptocurrencies Asset variety determines whether you can execute your desired trades without involving multiple platforms. ChangeNOW : 1,500+ cryptocurrencies with 1,000,000+ trading pairs Changelly : 500+ cryptocurrencies across 185 blockchains Godex : 928+ cryptocurrencies with comprehensive altcoin coverage All three platforms support major assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and popular stablecoins. However, Godex’s extensive altcoin support—combined with zero verification requirements—makes it particularly attractive for privacy-focused traders exploring emerging tokens. Transaction Speed Speed varies based on blockchain network conditions, but platform efficiency plays a significant role. Godex : 5-30 minutes with most swaps completing toward the faster end ChangeNOW : 2-5 minutes average (can extend to 20+ minutes for large amounts) Changelly : 5-40 minutes depending on network conditions Network congestion affects all platforms equally—no exchange can bypass blockchain confirmation requirements. However, Godex’s streamlined process, without verification interruptions, often results in smoother transaction flows. Exchange Rate Options Both fixed and floating rates serve different trading strategies. Fixed rates lock your exchange rate for a specified period, protecting against market volatility during transaction processing. This option typically carries slightly higher fees but provides certainty about your final amount. Floating rates reflect real-time market conditions, potentially delivering better returns during favorable price movements—or worse returns if markets move against you. All three platforms offer both options: Godex : Fixed rate guaranteed for 30 minutes, protecting you from market fluctuations ChangeNOW : Fixed rate available with integrated reserve Changelly : Fixed rate locks prices; floating rate at 0.25% Why Privacy Matters More Than Ever in 2026 The cryptocurrency privacy landscape has shifted dramatically. Regulatory pressures have pushed many formerly privacy-respecting platforms toward mandatory verification, leaving traders with fewer options for confidential transactions. Consider these realities: Data breaches continue accelerating : Over $3.4 billion was stolen in crypto hacks in 2025, with personal data often accompanying financial losses Centralized exchanges collect everything : Names, addresses, government IDs, selfies, source of funds documentation, and complete transaction histories Privacy isn’t about hiding wrongdoing : It’s about maintaining reasonable financial confidentiality in an increasingly surveilled world Godex addresses these concerns directly.

Miners keep producing blocks at a relatively high pace, barring unexpected conditions. Foundry Digital has prepared for the snowstorm expected to affect some of its locations in the USA. In the past few days, the pool shut down some of its hashrate from 1.08 ZH/s down to 780 EH/s. Winter is traditionally a slow season for miners, especially those depending on hydroelectric power. Short-term weather conditions are also affecting hashrate. Despite the slowdown, Foundry Digital emerged as the top mining pool, surpassing even Antpool, which is the usual leader. Antpool also shut down some of its capacity, from 335 EH/s down to 141 EH/s. As a result, overall Bitcoin mining slid to a six-month low of 742.93 EH/s. The exact contribution of pools may differ, as the entire hashrate reporting depends on methodology. The recent hashrate effect on major pools also shows how much US-based mining is key to Bitcoin’s security, as well as future data center investment decisions. Lower hashrate leads to lower difficulty One silver lining of slower mining is that block production may become easier, resulting in higher rewards for some pools.

Miners keep producing blocks even as the hash ribbon indicator is flashing. The slide of BTC to $86,000 extended the period of distress for miners. The mining sector is closing in on two months of mining under distress conditions , as BTC moved down from its all-time high. Average cost to mine one BTC is now close to $75,000, serving as a price floor. However, some miners have lower costs, while new hardware may mean a more competitive advantage for newer mining farms. Is mining the bridge to AI? While mining starts to look non-viable under distress, mining companies are still winning. The sector leader IREN is up over 21% in 2026, rising to $45.91. Riot Platforms (RIOT) also retained some of its gains, reaching $17.28. All BTC mining operations retain access to relatively reliable sources of energy. As a result, some miners are still viable, while others are working toward AI and other forms of compute with a higher margin. BTC miners have been divesting some of their reserves, with 1.89M BTC left in storage. Despite this, the selling is relatively slow, while the daily reward of 450 BTC is easily absorbed by the market.

They sift through paperwork, filings, and balance sheet decisions long before sentiment catches up. While public debate continues to question XRP’s relevance, a quieter institutional realignment appears to be taking shape beneath the surface—one that suggests corporate finance teams may already be positioning for XRP’s next chapter. That emerging trend gained attention after a recent post by X Finance Bull, who drew focus to a growing list of publicly traded companies that have formally integrated XRP into their treasury strategies. Shared on X, the information points to verified corporate disclosures rather than speculative positioning, signaling a notable shift in how institutions view XRP. Corporate Treasury Adoption Accelerates Treasury strategy represents long-term conviction, not short-term price exposure. When companies allocate capital to a reserve asset, they embed it into liquidity planning and capital management frameworks. According to the disclosures highlighted by X Finance Bull, eight publicly traded firms have collectively committed more than $2 billion to XRP treasury reserves through announced or active programs. $2 BILLION $XRP STRATEGIC TREASURY RESERVE.

Mid- and Large-Cap Firms Follow the Lead Other companies have announced similarly deliberate moves. Trident Digital Tech disclosed a $500 million XRP treasury commitment, while Webus International confirmed a $300 million allocation . These figures reflect balance sheet decisions at scale, underscoring growing institutional confidence rather than exploratory exposure. Additional filings show diversification across industries. Vivopower, a sustainable energy firm, announced a $100 million XRP treasury strategy. Wellgistics, operating in healthcare logistics, followed with a $50 million commitment.

57477684,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=265375,1769429416,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Ethereum Whale’s Astounding $31.8M Binance Withdrawal Fuels Sophisticated DeFi Maneuver,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-whale-binance-withdrawal-defi/,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum Whale’s Astounding $31.8M Binance Withdrawal Fuels Sophisticated DeFi Maneuver In a significant on-chain move that captured immediate market attention, a previously unknown cryptocurrency entity, or ‘whale,’ executed a multi-million dollar transaction involving Ethereum (ETH), Binance, and the Aave lending protocol, demonstrating a sophisticated and highly confident DeFi strategy on January 15, 2025. According to data from the blockchain analytics platform Onchain Lens, the wallet beginning with ‘0xA75’ withdrew a staggering 11,000 ETH, valued at approximately $31.78 million, from the global exchange Binance. Subsequently, this substantial capital was not simply held; it was actively deployed in a complex financial operation that underscores the evolving maturity of decentralized finance. The whale deposited the entire ETH sum into Aave, borrowed 30 million USDC against this collateral, and promptly returned the stablecoin to Binance, presumably to acquire more Ethereum. Consequently, the wallet’s total holdings now stand at an impressive 72,000 ETH, worth roughly $208.5 million. Decoding the Ethereum Whale’s Multi-Step Strategy This transaction represents far more than a simple transfer of assets. Instead, it is a textbook example of a leveraged long position constructed within the decentralized finance ecosystem. First, the whale secured a large base of Ethereum from a centralized exchange. Then, by using Aave—a leading non-custodial liquidity protocol—the entity effectively ‘unlocked’ the value of its ETH without selling it. The borrowed USDC, a dollar-pegged stablecoin, provided immediate liquid capital. Finally, by sending that capital back to Binance, the whale positioned itself to potentially amplify its Ethereum exposure, betting on the asset’s future price appreciation. This strategy, while common among sophisticated players, involves calculated risks including liquidation thresholds if ETH’s value falls significantly. Key steps in the whale’s maneuver: Withdrawal: Moving 11,000 ETH off-exchange to a self-custodied wallet. Collateralization: Depositing ETH into Aave to use as borrowing power. Leverage: Borrowing 30M USDC against the ETH collateral. Reinvestment: Transferring USDC to Binance to potentially buy more ETH. The Critical Role of Aave and DeFi Lending The Aave protocol sits at the heart of this transaction, enabling the whale’s strategy. As a cornerstone of the DeFi sector, Aave allows users to deposit cryptocurrencies as collateral to borrow other assets. This process is permissionless, automated by smart contracts, and occurs without a traditional financial intermediary. For institutional and large-scale retail players, protocols like Aave provide powerful tools for capital efficiency. They can access liquidity against their holdings without triggering taxable events from sales. The whale’s choice of Aave is significant; it signals trust in the protocol’s security, liquidity depth, and stability, especially for a transaction of this magnitude. This move also highlights the deepening integration between centralized exchanges like Binance and the decentralized finance landscape, as capital fluidly moves between these two spheres. Analyzing Market Impact and Whale Psychology Large withdrawals from exchanges often carry bullish connotations for a cryptocurrency’s price. Analysts typically interpret such moves as a shift from liquid, readily-tradable assets on an exchange to long-term holding or active use in DeFi—a reduction in immediate selling pressure. The subsequent leveraging strategy suggests the whale holds a strongly positive conviction on Ethereum’s medium to long-term trajectory. By recycling capital through borrowing, the entity effectively increases its buying power and market exposure. However, this also introduces leverage risk. The table below outlines the potential implications of this single transaction: Signal Potential Market Interpretation Associated Risk Large Exchange Withdrawal Reduced sell-side liquidity; intent to hold or deploy. None directly for the market. Collateralization on Aave Confidence in DeFi infrastructure; seeking yield or leverage. Smart contract risk on Aave. Borrowing USDC to Re-enter Exchange Bullish sentiment; attempt to amplify long position. Liquidation risk if ETH price drops sharply. Furthermore, the anonymity of the wallet, while standard in crypto, invites speculation. The entity could be a high-net-worth individual, a family office, a crypto-native investment fund, or an institution testing DeFi strategies. The precise identity matters less than the behavioral pattern, which other market participants often monitor closely for sentiment cues. Historical Context and the Evolution of Whale Movements Whale transactions are not new to cryptocurrency markets. However, their strategies have evolved dramatically. In earlier market cycles, large moves typically involved simple transfers between exchange wallets and cold storage. The 2020-2021 DeFi summer introduced more complex behaviors, with whales providing liquidity or farming yields. The current activity, particularly in 2024 and into 2025, shows a maturation towards sophisticated leverage management and capital recycling across CeFi and DeFi boundaries. This specific transaction mirrors strategies once confined to traditional finance but now executed autonomously on-chain. It also reflects growing comfort with the stability and reliability of major DeFi protocols like Aave, even for nine-figure sums. This trend points to a broader financialization of the crypto asset class, where holdings are actively managed within a new, blockchain-native financial system. Conclusion The Ethereum whale’s $31.8 million withdrawal from Binance and subsequent deployment on the Aave protocol constitutes a masterclass in modern crypto finance. This maneuver transcends a mere large trade; it is a calculated, multi-step strategy utilizing decentralized lending to build a leveraged position. The transaction underscores several key trends: the deepening liquidity and trust in DeFi, the seamless capital flow between centralized and decentralized venues, and the continued confidence of major holders in Ethereum’s fundamental value proposition. While such moves carry inherent risks, they also serve as a powerful indicator of sophisticated capital positioning for potential future market growth. As the blockchain analytics space grows, these transparent, on-chain narratives will continue to provide invaluable insight into the strategies shaping the digital asset landscape. FAQs Q1: What does a ‘whale withdrawal’ from an exchange like Binance typically signal? Analysts often interpret large withdrawals as a reduction in immediate selling pressure, suggesting the holder intends to custody the assets long-term or use them in DeFi protocols, which is generally viewed as a bullish indicator for the asset’s price. Q2: Why would a whale use Aave instead of just holding the ETH? Using Aave allows the whale to access liquidity (in this case, USDC) without selling their ETH. This enables capital efficiency—they can reinvest the borrowed funds to potentially amplify returns while maintaining exposure to ETH’s price appreciation. Q3: What is the main risk for the whale in this strategy? The primary risk is liquidation. If the price of Ethereum falls significantly, the value of their collateral on Aave decreases. If it drops below a certain threshold relative to the borrowed USDC, the protocol’s smart contracts will automatically sell some collateral to repay the loan, potentially at a loss. Q4: How does this activity affect the average Ethereum investor? While a single transaction doesn’t directly dictate market price, large, confident moves by whales can influence market sentiment. Furthermore, it validates the utility and security of DeFi protocols for large sums, which can increase overall ecosystem confidence. Q5: Is it common to see such large transactions in DeFi? Yes, as DeFi has matured, the total value locked (TVL) in major protocols like Aave has grown into the tens of billions. Transactions involving tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars, while notable, are becoming more frequent as institutional and large-scale capital enters the space.

This examination of historical correlations between forex interventions and digital asset prices provides a crucial framework for understanding potential 2025 market dynamics. The analysis, referencing specific past events, suggests Bitcoin’s price could experience a notable correction if Japanese authorities act to support their currency, potentially testing a range between $65,000 and $70,000 before embarking on a recovery phase. Market participants globally are weighing this scenario against broader macroeconomic indicators. Bitcoin Price Prediction and the Yen’s Precarious Position The Japanese yen has faced sustained pressure throughout 2024 and into 2025, trading near multi-decade lows against the US dollar. Consequently, speculation is mounting that Japan’s Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan may soon intervene directly in foreign exchange markets. Historically, such interventions create ripples across global asset classes. Analysts point to a specific pattern observed during previous yen-supportive actions. Following these events, Bitcoin has demonstrated a tendency to undergo a sharp, albeit temporary, decline. For instance, during the September 2022 intervention, BTC corrected approximately 30% from its local peak before subsequently rallying over 100% in the following months. This pattern repeated in a notable fashion during a prior episode, establishing a correlation that market strategists now scrutinize. Several factors contribute to this observed relationship. First, a stronger yen, achieved through intervention, often leads to a temporary strengthening of the US dollar index (DXY). Bitcoin and other risk assets frequently exhibit an inverse correlation with dollar strength in the short term. Second, intervention signals broader financial market stress and a shift in liquidity conditions, prompting risk reassessment by institutional investors. Third, the unwinding of popular carry trades, where investors borrow in low-yielding yen to invest in higher-yielding assets like cryptocurrencies, can trigger rapid capital flows. This analysis does not predict certainty but outlines a probabilistic scenario based on observable precedents. The current macroeconomic backdrop, characterized by divergent global central bank policies, adds further relevance to this thesis. Historical Precedents and Market Mechanics Understanding the mechanics behind this correlation requires examining the two key historical instances referenced in the analysis. In both cases, the trigger was official yen-buying intervention by Japanese authorities, which caused immediate dollar-yen volatility and broader market uncertainty. Instance One (2022): The intervention occurred amid global monetary tightening. Bitcoin, which had been trading near $22,000, fell to a low near $15,500 within weeks—a decline of roughly 30%. The market then consolidated before beginning a sustained rally that saw prices more than double over the subsequent quarter. Instance Two (Prior Episode): A similar dynamic played out, with a sharp, intervention-associated drop followed by a powerful recovery phase that exceeded 100% gains from the cycle low. The table below summarizes the key metrics from these events: Event Period BTC Pre-Intervention High Post-Intervention Low Decline Subsequent Rally 2022 Instance ~$22,000 ~$15,500 ~30% >100% Prior Instance Varies Varies ~30% >100% These patterns highlight a market behavior where an initial shock from a macro-financial event leads to a liquidity-driven selloff in crypto, followed by a recognition of underlying strength and a resumption of the broader trend. The analysis emphasizes that past performance does not guarantee future results, but it provides a valuable risk-management framework. The proposed $65,000 to $70,000 range for a potential dip is derived from applying a similar percentage decline to Bitcoin’s recent price structure, acknowledging current support levels identified by technical analysts. Expert Perspectives on Correlation and Causality Market economists caution against oversimplifying the relationship. While correlation exists, establishing direct causality is complex. The interventions themselves often coincide with periods of broader global risk aversion, which independently pressure cryptocurrency prices. However, the consistency of the pattern warrants attention. As noted in financial research, Japan’s interventions are among the few predictable, large-scale official actions in forex markets, making their potential impact a necessary consideration for crypto asset allocators. The analysis suggests monitoring dollar-yen volatility and official statements from Japanese financial authorities as leading indicators. Furthermore, the structure of the crypto market has evolved since 2022, with increased institutional participation and ETF flows potentially altering the sensitivity to such forex events. Nevertheless, the core driver—global liquidity shifts—remains a primary factor for digital asset valuations. Broader Macroeconomic Context for 2025 The potential for a yen intervention occurs within a specific global financial environment. Central banks in the United States and Europe have paused or slowed their rate-hiking cycles, while the Bank of Japan has only recently begun a gradual policy normalization. This divergence creates the weakness in the yen. A sudden reversal via intervention would signal a forceful attempt to correct what Japanese officials may deem “disorderly” market moves. For Bitcoin and digital assets, the immediate impact would likely stem from a sharp, reflexive rise in the US dollar’s value. Historically, a strong dollar creates headwinds for global risk assets. However, the analysis posits that such a dip could represent a buying opportunity, as the fundamental drivers for cryptocurrency adoption—institutional investment, technological development, and macroeconomic uncertainty—remain intact. The report underscores that the predicted rally following a dip is not solely dependent on the yen but on these enduring fundamentals reasserting themselves once the initial volatility subsides. Other factors in 2025 include the maturation of Bitcoin ETFs, which provide a new channel for traditional capital, and the ongoing evolution of regulatory frameworks. These elements may provide underlying support that mitigates the depth of any potential drop or accelerates the subsequent recovery. The analysis integrates this real-world context, moving beyond simple pattern recognition to consider the changed landscape. It also highlights the importance of distinguishing between short-term technical price movements and long-term valuation trends, a discipline essential for navigating volatile asset classes. Conclusion In conclusion, the analysis of a potential yen shock presents a nuanced Bitcoin price prediction scenario for 2025. It outlines a historical pattern where yen-supportive forex intervention has preceded a temporary but sharp decline in BTC’s value, followed by a strong rally. While not a guarantee, this pattern offers a strategic framework for investors, suggesting the possibility of a dip toward the $65,000 to $70,000 range before a potential upward reversal. The critical takeaway is the importance of macro-financial cross-currents, particularly forex market actions, for cryptocurrency volatility. Investors and traders are advised to monitor developments in the dollar-yen exchange rate and official communications from Japan, while maintaining a focus on Bitcoin’s long-term fundamental drivers, which could ultimately dictate its price trajectory beyond any short-term disruption caused by a yen shock. FAQs Q1: What is a “yen shock” in this context? A yen shock refers to a sudden, significant movement in the value of the Japanese yen, typically caused by direct intervention in currency markets by Japanese financial authorities to strengthen the yen after a period of pronounced weakness. Q2: How could Japanese forex intervention affect Bitcoin’s price? Intervention often causes a temporary spike in the US dollar’s value. Since Bitcoin frequently moves inversely to the dollar in the short term, this can trigger selling pressure. Additionally, it may signal broader market stress, prompting a flight from risk assets. Q3: Is the historical pattern of a dip followed by a rally guaranteed to repeat? No historical pattern is guaranteed. The analysis identifies a correlation from two past instances. While it provides a plausible scenario based on precedent, future market conditions, liquidity, and structure are different, and many variables can influence the outcome. Q4: What other factors should I watch alongside the yen? Key factors include broader US dollar strength (DXY index), global equity market performance, statements from the Federal Reserve, Bitcoin ETF flow data, and overall market sentiment indicators for risk appetite. Q5: Does this analysis suggest selling Bitcoin now? Not necessarily. The analysis presents a potential volatility scenario for risk management and strategic planning. It highlights a possible short-term dip within a context that also envisions a subsequent recovery. Investment decisions should be based on individual risk tolerance, time horizon, and comprehensive research.

The move marks the biggest step yet in opening India’s large auto market and could be announced as soon as Tuesday when the two sides reveal a new free trade agreement. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration has agreed to cut the tax right away on a set number of vehicles from the 27 EU countries, as long as those cars cost more than 15,000 euros, which equals about $17,739. Two sources that know about the discussions told Reuters this information. The tax will drop even more over time, going down to just 10%. This makes it easier for European car companies like Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and BMW to sell in India. Deal expected to boost bilateral trade The sources asked not to be named because the talks are private and things could still change at the last minute. India’s commerce ministry and the European Commission both said they would not comment. India and the EU expect to announce on Tuesday that they have finished long-running talks for the free trade deal . After that, both sides will work ou t fi nal details and approve what people are calling “the mother of all deals.” The agreement could increase trade between the two and help Indian exports of products like textiles and jewelry, which took a hit from 50% tariffs imposed by the United States since late August. India ranks as the world’s third-biggest car market by sales, coming after the United States and China. But its car industry has had strong protection from outside competition. Right now, New Delhi charges tariffs of 70% and 110% on cars brought in from other countries. Business leaders, including Tesla chief Elon Musk , have often criticized these high rates. New Delhi wants to cut import duties to 40% immediately for roughly 200,000 combustion-engine cars each year, one source said. This represents India’s most aggressive effort so far to open up the sector. The quota number might still change before everything is final, the source added. Electric battery vehicles will not see any import duty cuts for the first five years. This protects money already put in by Indian companies like Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors, which are building up this new part of the market, both sources said. After five years pass, electric vehicles will get similar tax cuts. European brands hold small share of Indian market Lower import taxes will help European carmakers such as Volkswagen, Renault and Stellantis , along with luxury brands Mercedes-Benz and BMW. These companies already make some cars in India but have had trouble growing beyond a certain point, partly because of the high tariffs. Cheaper taxes let carmakers sell imported vehicles at lower prices and try out the market with more models before deciding to build more cars in India, one of the two sources explained. European car companies hold less than 4% of India’s car market, which sells 4.4 million units each year. Japan’s Suzuki Motor dominates, and Indian brands Mahindra and Tata together control two-thirds of sales. The Indian market should grow to 6 million units yearly by 2030, and some companies are already planning new investments. Renault is returning to India with a fresh strategy as it looks for growth outside Europe, where Chinese carmakers are gaining ground. Volkswagen Group is working on its next round of investment in India through its Skoda brand. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This substantial move by a long-term Bitcoin OG, or “Original Gangster,” represents more than a simple trade. Consequently, it provides a critical window into the evolving strategies of crypto’s most experienced investors. Furthermore, blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported the acquisition of 22,000 ETH, immediately sparking intense analysis across trading desks and research firms globally. The transaction’s sheer size and the buyer’s established history demand a thorough examination of its context and potential ramifications for the broader digital asset landscape. Bitcoin OG’s Major Ethereum Purchase: Decoding the Transaction On-chain data reveals the precise details of this headline-grabbing move. The entity “1011short” transferred a significant sum of capital to purchase 22,000 Ether. At the time of the transaction, this stash was valued at approximately $63.56 million. Lookonchain, a respected blockchain intelligence platform, first identified and reported the activity. The term “OG” in cryptocurrency circles denotes an early adopter with a proven, long-term holding strategy, often dating back to Bitcoin’s earlier years. Therefore, an investment of this magnitude from such a source carries considerable weight. It is not the action of a speculative day trader but rather a deliberate allocation from a player with deep market experience. To understand the scale, consider the following comparison of recent notable whale purchases: Entity Asset Amount Approx. Value Context 1011short (Bitcoin OG) Ethereum (ETH) 22,000 ETH $63.6M Long-term BTC holder diversifying Known Institution (Q4 2024) Bitcoin (BTC) ~1,500 BTC $90M+ Corporate treasury allocation Anonymous Whale (Nov 2024) Ethereum (ETH) 15,000 ETH $45M Accumulation during price dip This purchase immediately raises several key questions for market observers. Primarily, analysts are scrutinizing the source of funds. Was this capital newly deployed, or was it reallocated from other assets, potentially even Bitcoin? Additionally, the timing is crucial. Did it precede or follow major market announcements or protocol upgrades? The public nature of blockchain data allows for this transparency, yet the motivations behind the address remain a subject of informed deduction based on historical behavior patterns. Analyzing the Strategic Implications for Crypto Markets The strategic implications of a Bitcoin veteran buying Ethereum are multifaceted. Historically, maximalists from either blockchain camp often exhibit strong tribal loyalty. A move of this scale suggests a pragmatic, portfolio-based approach is gaining precedence. Essentially, it signals that for some sophisticated holders, the narrative is shifting from “Bitcoin versus Ethereum” to “Bitcoin and Ethereum.” This could reflect a growing recognition of Ethereum’s distinct value proposition, which includes: A robust smart contract platform enabling decentralized finance (DeFi) and applications. The ongoing technical upgrades like proto-danksharding aimed at scaling. A diverse ecosystem of tokens and projects built on its network. Market sentiment often takes cues from whale behavior. Consequently, this purchase may be interpreted by some investors as a bullish signal for Ethereum’s medium-term prospects. However, seasoned analysts caution against drawing simplistic conclusions. A single data point, however large, does not constitute a trend. It must be analyzed within the broader flow of on-chain movements, exchange reserves, and macroeconomic conditions. Nevertheless, it undeniably adds a compelling chapter to the ongoing story of institutional and sophisticated investor adoption. Expert Perspective on Holder Behavior and Market Cycles Financial historians and crypto economists often compare the actions of long-term holders (LTHs) to those of traditional market “smart money.” Their moves are typically slower, more deliberate, and less reactive to short-term volatility. According to data from analytics platforms like Glassnode and CryptoQuant, the spending behavior of Bitcoin OGs and long-term holders often marks key inflection points in market cycles. For instance, sustained selling from LTHs can signal a market top, while accumulation during downturns can indicate building a foundation for the next cycle. In this context, a Bitcoin OG allocating to Ethereum is a nuanced signal. It may not directly predict Bitcoin’s price but highlights a diversification trend among crypto’s most committed capital. This behavior aligns with a broader maturation of the asset class, where investors seek to manage risk and capture growth across different blockchain protocols with proven track records and active development. The move underscores a fundamental principle of modern portfolio theory applied to digital assets: strategic diversification across uncorrelated or differently correlated assets can enhance risk-adjusted returns. The Technical and On-Chain Evidence Behind the Move Blockchain analysis provides the empirical backbone for this news. Platforms like Lookonchain, Etherscan, and Nansen track these transactions by monitoring wallet addresses and their historical activity. The identifier “1011short” is likely a label assigned by analysts based on the wallet’s past behavior, which may include holding Bitcoin through multiple market cycles. The ability to trace such activity is a cornerstone of crypto’s transparency. Key on-chain metrics analysts reviewed following this transaction include: Wallet Age : The longevity of the wallet’s existence and its dormancy periods. Source of Funds : Tracing the origin of the stablecoins or other assets used for the purchase. Exchange Flow : Whether the ETH was withdrawn to a private custody wallet, indicating a long-term hold intention. This data-driven approach transforms a simple transaction into a rich narrative. It moves beyond speculation to provide verifiable facts about capital movement. For the market, this transparency is a double-edged sword. While it provides valuable insights, it also means large players know their moves are public, potentially influencing their strategy. The very act of making such a large, traceable purchase could be part of a broader communication strategy to the market. Conclusion The $63.6 million Ethereum purchase by a Bitcoin OG is a significant event that merits close attention. It transcends a mere price signal, offering a case study in the evolving investment strategies of cryptocurrency’s earliest and most committed participants. This move highlights a growing trend of cross-chain diversification among sophisticated holders, recognizing the unique strengths of both Bitcoin as digital gold and Ethereum as a programmable computing platform. While the long-term impact on prices remains to be seen, the transaction undeniably reinforces the maturity and complexity of the digital asset market. As blockchain analytics continue to improve, the actions of key players like this Bitcoin OG will provide invaluable, real-time insights into the shifting currents of the crypto economy. FAQs Q1: What does “Bitcoin OG” mean? In cryptocurrency terminology, “OG” stands for “Original Gangster.” It refers to an early adopter who has been involved with Bitcoin for a very long time, often since its earlier years, and is typically seen as a veteran or long-term holder with significant experience. Q2: How do we know about this $63.6M Ethereum purchase? Blockchain analytics firms like Lookonchain use public blockchain data to track large transactions. They identified the wallet address (labeled 1011short), its historical activity as a long-term Bitcoin holder, and its recent purchase of 22,000 ETH, which was valued at $63.56 million at the time. Q3: Why is a Bitcoin holder buying Ethereum significant? It is significant because it may indicate a strategic diversification by experienced capital. Historically, some investors were exclusively loyal to one asset. A large-scale move like this suggests that sophisticated players are building portfolios that include multiple major cryptocurrencies based on their different use cases and value propositions. Q4: Could this purchase manipulate the price of Ethereum? While a $63.6M purchase is large, the daily trading volume of Ethereum is typically in the billions of dollars. Therefore, a single transaction of this size is unlikely to manipulate the price significantly on its own. However, it can influence market sentiment and be seen as a bullish signal by other investors. Q5: What is the difference between a “whale” and an “OG”? A “whale” is any entity that holds a large enough amount of cryptocurrency to potentially influence the market. An “OG” specifically refers to an early adopter with a long history. A Bitcoin OG is often a whale, but not all whales are OGs, as they may have acquired their holdings more recently.

BREAKING: The UK Just Moved to Fully Integrate Crypto Firms Into the FCA Rulebook pic.twitter.com/mGBJ61hLLB — Ryan (King) Solomon (@IOV_OWL) January 23, 2026 BTC May See Belated Reaction Gadi Chait, Investment Manager at Xapo Bank , commented that recent weakness in Bitcoin follows a brief recovery last week, “set against a backdrop of macroeconomic developments that have influenced risk assets broadly.” A convergence of factors drives volatility across markets. These include heightened geopolitical tensions and ongoing conflicts. Renewed focus on US strategic positioning toward Greenland and Donald Trump’s address at Davos “added to an already unsettled global environment.” Regulatory uncertainty, especially in the US, and macroeconomic pressures add to this. “Central bank policy divergence, including expectations around further tightening by the Bank of Japan and the continued reduction of liquidity by the US Federal Reserve, continues to shape market behaviour.” Chait says that, “amid this uncertainty, traditional commodities have rallied, while Bitcoin has underperformed. The reasons for this divergence are not yet clear, though such sequencing across asset classes is not without precedent.” “It remains possible that Bitcoin’s response emerges later, particularly as volatility subsides. For long-term participants, however, short- to medium-term price fluctuations remain a familiar feature rather than a signal of impaired fundamentals,” Chait concluded. Moreover, Petr Kozyakov, Co-Founder and CEO at Mercuryo , argued that as a speculative asset, BTC has come under sustained selling pressure, and altcoins have followed suit. “While the fortunes of the digital asset space will always be viewed through a lens fixated on token prices, the bigger picture is one of continued stablecoin adoption and the steady development of payment infrastructure,” he says. He continues: “The evolution of the digital token space is being driven by merger and acquisition activity, alongside the inherent efficiencies of blockchain-based technology and its ability to operate around the clock, at speed and at lower cost.” “This reality is increasingly unavoidable for financial institutions still reliant on technology that dates back to the 1960s. Away from daily price movements, a quiet revolution is most definitely afoot,” Kozyakov concluded. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Monday morning, BTC was changing hands at $87,860. While the coin begun the day at the intraday high of $88,800, it relatively swiftly dropped to the low of $86,126. It has recovered somewhat since. Over the past seven days, BTC decreased by 5.1%, trading in the $86,319–$93,252 range. It’s now 30% away from its all-time high of $126,080. Failing to hold the current level risks additional pullbacks towards the $85,000 level, followed by $84,300 and $83,800. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView At the same time, Ethereum was trading at $2,892. Earlier in the day, it traded at the intraday high level of $2,941. However, it then plunged to the intraday low of $2,787. It managed to shift course and move higher following this drop. In a week, ETH fell 9.2%, moving between $2,801 and $3,222. Moreover, it decreased 41% from its ATH of $4,946. Currently, the price risks a fall toward $2,670 and $2,520 in the near term. Ethereum (ETH) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Additionally, according to Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Commodity Strategist Mike McGlone, it is more likely that ETH will revisit the $2,000 level than push upwards and above $4,000. ETH has been stuck in the $2,000–$4,000 range since 2023. However, it is leaning toward the lower end of this range. Ether appears to be heading toward the lower end of its $2,000-$4,000 range since 2023.

The prediction market operator which was restricted from serving U.S. customers in 2022, has returned after receiving a CFTC approval of an Amended Order of Designation. Polymarket has now launched a U.S.-based application initially offering a limited set of sports-related event contracts, with additional verticals such as politics and crypto expected over time. Lau describes the development as a meaningful reversal allowing Polymarket to onboard brokerages and customers directly while facilitating trading on regulated U.S. venues. In 2026, prediction models will be used to collectively decide what is true and what is not [true] and as a guide for fact-checking, analysts say. #Polymarket #Kalshi #PredictionMarkets #BTC https://t.co/fkQeRz28Qs — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 30, 2025 Ultra-Low Fees Show Growing Competition Polymarket’s comeback is accompanied by a notably aggressive pricing structure. The platform is offering 10 basis point taker fees and zero maker fees which Lau believes is the lowest among major prediction market and sports betting platforms. For comparison, DraftKings and FanDuel reported net revenue margins of 6.7% and 10.1%, respectively. Lau said Polymarket’s pricing makes it a credible alternative to incumbent sports betting operators and signals increasing fee compression across event-based trading markets. State-Level Regulatory Risk Remains Fragmented While the CFTC approval may suggest improved federal-level clarity for certain event contracts, Lau cautioned that regulatory risk remains uneven at the state level. On Jan. 20, 2026, a Massachusetts judge granted an injunction preventing rival platform Kalshi from offering sports-related event contracts in the state. More broadly, at least three states — Massachusetts, Nevada, and Maryland — have issued unfavorable rulings against prediction market platforms, highlighting continued fragmentation across U.S. jurisdictions. This patchwork environment could complicate the sector’s expansion even as federal oversight becomes clearer. Coinbase Seen as Key Distribution Partner Lau argues that these developments represent an opportunity for Coinbase and indirectly Circle to partner with Polymarket or other prediction market platforms. Coinbase’s scale — more than 100 million verified users and 9.3 million monthly transacting users — provides a sizable and relevant distribution base for event contracts. In his note, Lau suggests that prediction markets could benefit from being embedded into larger platforms with existing user engagement. However, he notes that prediction markets may not become major standalone profit centers in the near term. Instead, Lau expects them to serve primarily as engagement and retention tools within Coinbase and other integrated platforms, helping drive activity and user stickiness amid rising competition.

CoinShares data showed digital asset products posted $1.73 billion in outflows. That figure marked the biggest weekly pullback since mid-November 2025. Besides pressuring sentiment, the exits suggested investors stayed cautious after weeks of price weakness. US Leads the Selloff as Caution Returns Outflows largely came from the United States, where investors pulled nearly $1.8 billion from crypto-linked products. Consequently, the US drove most of the weekly decline in overall fund flows. Sweden and the Netherlands also recorded smaller withdrawals of $11.1 million and $4.4 million. However, flows looked more balanced across other regions. Switzerland, Germany, and Canada moved the other way. Investors in those markets treated lower prices as a buying opportunity. Hence, Switzerland posted inflows of $32.5 million while Canada added $33.5 million. Additionally, Germany reported $19.1 million in inflows, showing selective demand remained in place. Bitcoin and Ethereum Take the Biggest Hits Bitcoin absorbed the bulk of the selling pressure. CoinShares reported $1.09 billion in Bitcoin outflows, its steepest weekly decline since mid-November 2025. Moreover, the figures pointed to continued risk-off behavior in large-cap assets. Small inflows of $0.5 million into short-Bitcoin products also appeared. Significantly, that suggested traders still positioned for downside moves. The report also connected weak demand to earlier market stress. CoinShares data indicated sentiment had not improved since the October 10, 2025 price crash. Consequently, investors kept reducing exposure during uncertain conditions. Ethereum followed Bitcoin’s trend with $630 million in outflows. Additionally, XRP products saw $18.2 million leave the market. These moves showed broad-based pressure across major tokens. Hence, the weakness did not stay limited to one sector. Solana Stands Out With $17.1 Million Inflow Solana produced one of the few bright spots. CoinShares recorded $17.1 million in inflows to Solana products, bucking the wider trend. Moreover, it suggested some investors viewed SOL as more resilient during risk-off weeks. This inflow also pointed to rotation instead of full market abandonment. Other smaller assets also attracted modest demand. Binance-related products posted $4.6 million in inflows, while Chainlink gained $3.8 million.

He noted that “Wall Street is watching this grow,” signaling that institutional investors are closely tracking the developments in the XRP market. Steingraber emphasized that if XRP surpasses $10 this year, it will record the highest-performing first-year ETF in history. This projection positions XRP ETFs at the forefront of institutional interest in the crypto sector. XRP ETFs Show Strong Early Performance Steingraber’s post included detailed data on multiple XRP ETFs, demonstrating both growth and early returns. The Canary XRP ETF, which broke records at launch , leads with $374.1 million in total assets and a year-to-date return of 13.8%. Bitwise XRP ETF follows with $315.2 million and a 13.6% YTD return. Grayscale XRP Trust ETF and Franklin XRP ETF show similar results, with YTD returns above 13% and total assets approaching $300 million each. 21Shares XRP ETF records $244.2 million in assets, reaching 13.4% YTD returns. Even smaller ETFs, such as REX-Osprey XRP ETF with $95 million in assets, recorded a 14% YTD return. Wall Street is watching this grow… When XRP crosses $10 this year, it will go down in history as the single best performing first year ETF in history! https://t.co/xGVHstNtK6 pic.twitter.com/e1teAfnVcN — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) January 24, 2026 Leverage Options Drive Higher Returns Several leveraged ETFs have also shown notable gains. The Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF reports 23.6% YTD returns, despite higher expense ratios. Other leveraged options, such as the 2x XRP ETF, ProShares Ultra XRP ETF, and T-REX 2x Long XRP Daily Target, exceeded 23% in YTD returns. These ETFs offer investors amplified exposure to XRP’s performance, attracting traders seeking higher short-term gains. Income-Oriented ETFs Show Stability Income-focused ETFs, such as Amplify XRP 3% Monthly Premium, demonstrate more moderate growth. With $7.2 million in total assets and 8.1% YTD returns, these ETFs appeal to investors seeking a consistent yield while still participating in XRP’s growth trajectory. The combination of growth-focused and income-oriented ETFs provides diverse options for both institutional and retail investors.

Analysts expect that continued institutional adoption , combined with growing ETF liquidity, could accelerate price growth for XRP. With multiple ETFs already showing double-digit YTD returns and rising assets under management , XRP’s visibility among Wall Street investors is strengthening. Steingraber’s observations, supported by comprehensive ETF data, indicate that XRP is emerging as a leading crypto asset in investment structures. Crossing the $10 mark would confirm both its market impact and the rising influence of crypto ETFs in institutional portfolios.

The Paris-based company has enlisted major Wall Street banks, including Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, and Barclays, to advise on the deal, with a potential listing later this year. The move comes as Ledger increases its presence in the U.S., where capital markets activity and institutional interest in digital asset firms are especially concentrated in New York. @Ledger eyes U.S. IPO at a $4B+ valuation: @FT Hardware #wallet maker #Ledger is preparing for a potential U.S. #IPO , reportedly working with Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, and Barclays on the deal, which could take place as early as this year pic.twitter.com/hjJQcnXxfh — Charged Ventures (@ChargedVentures) January 23, 2026 Wall Street Banks Line Up for Ledger’s IPO Push Ledger’s IPO ambitions reflect a belief that it has reached sufficient scale to withstand public-market scrutiny from Wall Street. In an earlier interview, CEO Pascal Gauthier said the company had grown to a point where a listing was realistic, adding that the U.S. stood out as the natural venue. Roughly 40% of Ledger’s business now comes from North America, a figure that has shaped both its listing strategy and operational expansion in New York. Source: Coherent Market Insights Gauthier has also said the firm is weighing a U.S. IPO alongside a potential private funding round, keeping multiple capital-raising paths open. “Money is in New York today for crypto, it’s nowhere else in the world, certainly not in Europe,” Gauthier told the Financial Times. He reiterated that view in November 2025 when the company first flagged the IPO plans , emphasizing that his increased time in New York was driven by where crypto financing is now concentrated. From Nano Wallets to Triple-Digit Millions in Revenue Founded in 2014 by Éric Larchevêque, Joël Pobeda, and Thomas France, Ledger built its reputation on hardware wallets designed to keep private keys offline. Its early success came from the Ledger Nano series, which gained traction as hacks and exchange failures highlighted the risks of custodial storage. The company has since broadened its product lineup, launching the Ledger Stax, a touchscreen device aimed at long-term holders and institutional users. It has also rolled out an iOS app for enterprise clients and recently completed a major rebranding alongside the release of the Ledger Nano Gen5. Ledger said its revenues reached triple-digit millions in 2025, marking its strongest performance to date, with further growth expected this year. Over the past decade, the firm estimates it has sold more than seven million devices globally and now safeguards around 20% of global crypto assets, including over $100 billion worth of bitcoin. Potential Ledger IPO closing market cap? – raised $3m in 2019, $380m in 2021, $109m at $1.4b in Mar 2023 – seeking $4b valuation in IPO (~3x valuation from last raise) currently the liquidity for this market on @Polymarket is limited, though interesting to see how high it goes… https://t.co/Pmv5JIR4XA pic.twitter.com/k5G6UGHf9E — cs_defier (@cs_defier) January 23, 2026 The company was last valued at $1.5 billion in 2023 after raising a $108 million extension to its Series C round, bringing total funding in that round close to $500 million. While Ledger has since said its valuation has increased, it has not disclosed an updated figure ahead of the reported IPO preparations. Fees, Data Exposure, and the Self-Custody Debate As Ledger expands beyond pure hardware, it has reframed its devices as “Ledger signers,” positioning them as tools for securing digital assets and online identities in an AI-driven environment. That shift has not been without controversy, particularly around new monetization features. Last October, Ledger revealed that its Multisig app would charge a flat $10 fee per transaction, excluding token transfers, which would instead incur a 0.05% variable fee. @Ledger ’s new Multisig app sparked backlash for adding a $10 flat fee per transaction and a 0.05% token transfer fee, on top of gas costs. #Ledger #Crypto https://t.co/b72bb5ZwXw — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 26, 2025 The charges are applied on top of standard blockchain gas fees, prompting backlash from users who argue that self-custody should not come with recurring platform costs. Security concerns have also resurfaced following a recent data exposure incident involving a third-party provider. On January 5, 2026, blockchain researcher ZachXBT said personal information of Ledger customers was accessed in a hack on Global-e, a payment processor used by the company. While no funds were compromised, researchers warned that the exposure heightens the risk of phishing and social engineering attacks.

The update reinforces Strategy’s position as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin globally, continuing its multi-year accumulation strategy that has become central to its balance sheet approach. Total Bitcoin Holdings Reach 712,647 BTC Following the latest acquisition, Strategy reported that it now holds a total of 712,647 BTC as of Jan. 25. The company said its aggregate Bitcoin purchases total roughly $54.19 billion, with an average acquisition price of $76,037 per bitcoin. The figures highlight the scale of Strategy’s long-term bet on Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, accumulated across multiple market cycles. Strategy’s growing holdings show its belief that Bitcoin represents a superior store of value over time, particularly amid concerns around currency debasement and global macro uncertainty. Purchases Funded Through Share Sales Under ATM Program Strategy disclosed that the recent Bitcoin purchases were funded through proceeds generated from the sale of shares under its at-the-market offering program. During the Jan. 20–25 period, the company sold approximately 1.57 million shares of its Class A common stock, generating net proceeds of about $257 million. Strategy also issued roughly 70,201 shares of its variable rate preferred stock, raising an additional $7 million. In total, the company generated about $264 million in net proceeds, which were then deployed toward Bitcoin accumulation. The disclosure also shows that Strategy retains significant remaining capacity for future issuances, including billions of dollars available across multiple stock and preferred equity programs. Corporate Bitcoin Accumulation Continues Into 2026 Strategy’s continued purchases come as institutional adoption of Bitcoin remains a major theme entering 2026, with more companies exploring crypto as a long-term balance sheet asset. The firm has consistently framed Bitcoin as a scarce, inflation-resistant reserve that can outperform cash and traditional holdings over extended time horizons. While the strategy remains controversial due to Bitcoin’s volatility, Strategy has maintained its commitment to accumulation even during periods of market weakness. With over 712,000 BTC now on its balance sheet, Strategy’s exposure to Bitcoin price movements is unmatched among public companies, making it a key bellwether for corporate crypto adoption. As the company continues leveraging equity issuance to fund purchases, investors will closely watch how its aggressive treasury strategy evolves alongside broader market conditions in 2026.

I think that’s a good thing; the two systems can coexist peacefully. BTC's deflationary nature makes it unsuitable as a global currency but ideal for long-term wealth preservation and institutional adoption. I'm upgrading to a Strong Buy rating on BTC due to its asymmetric upside potential, with a valuation model targeting $162,500–$275,000 and up to $1,000,000 per coin in a bullish scenario. Key risks include failure to achieve reserve asset status, persistent volatility, and ongoing high correlation with equities. With the World Economic Forum having just taken place in Davos, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has been discussed between central bankers, institutional investors, and the like. In one interview , the CEO of Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ) was very confrontational towards members of the TradFi (Traditional Finance) sector, mentioning that “banks are lending customers’ deposits without their permission.” In a different part of that same interview, the same Brian Armstrong called out a French Central Banker on a mistake relative to Bitcoin. The Banker incorrectly assumed that Bitcoins can be controlled by any participant in its network and brought that as an example of why independent central banking cannot be substituted. As an observer of the Crypto world, I am surprised by such conversations. I think they reveal how exponents from both “sides”—TradFi and DeFi (Decentralized Finance)—do not fully grasp the other side’s arguments and functioning. Today, I want to spend a few words to clarify what, in my view, is the role of Bitcoin in TradFi and why the two sides do not need to be at odds with each other, but rather realise they will need to coexist. Why Bitcoin is not an alternative to the global banking system How Banking Works (Project Instill) Anyone who has ever taken an Economics 101 course will be familiar with how banking works. In a nutshell, clients’ deposits are lent out at an interest rate to borrowers. The borrowing is done to a higher degree than the amounts available in deposits in the bank, meaning banks lend out more than they hold in deposits. This is the reason why fractional reserves exist in most legislation (with the notable exception of the US, where there has been no legally mandated minimum reserve ratio since 2020). I am surprised how sometimes this very basic function of our economy is brought up as an example of quasi-conspiracy. Yet, this is literally one of the core functions of our economic system. Businesses and governments effectively function because they can access financing to invest and hire. What is Bitcoin’s role in all this? None, in my opinion A banking system based on Bitcoin would not work. Because Bitcoin’s supply is limited to 21 million, banks holding Bitcoin could not lend out more than what they have available. Bitcoin, as a decentralized, algorithm-based form of money, could not be multiplied. It is deflationary in nature. Bitcoin, in this regard, was never conceived as an alternative to banking. Rather, it was conceived as a decentralized system of payment and then matured as an alternative reserve. This is a concept I discussed in my previous work on Bitcoin, bringing on-chain data that shows how Bitcoin behaves more like a reserve asset than a currency, with a somewhat limited number of transactions and mostly “holders.” The role of a global reserve asset Imagine a world where your everyday currency buys you twice the amount of goods than what it bought five years earlier. Would you spend it to buy, for example, a car that depreciates the moment you step out of the car dealer? What about spending it to buy groceries? If you had the reasonable expectation that everything you purchased were to become cheaper in the future, it would be logical to delay most of your purchases (in other words, save as much as possible). What I am describing with this example is the reason why deflation is worse than inflation. China is currently struggling with deflation . Not as a result of the yuan getting stronger, but due to an overcapacity of production that cannot be fully absorbed by internal demand and exports. In simple words, goods get cheaper over time. The results are that more than 25% of the listed Chinese companies reported a loss in the first half of 2025, and youth unemployment is stubbornly stuck above 15% . And this is official data, which is famously unreliable . In academic terms, the chart below showcases the effect of deflation on an economy. When people and businesses spend less (AD shifts left from AD₁ to AD₂), prices drop (from P₁ to P₂), and output falls below full employment (to Y₁). Over time, lower wages and costs shift SRAS (Short-Run Aggregate Supply) right, causing even lower prices (to P₃), while output slowly returns toward the unchanged full-employment level (Y-FE). The Curious Economist Back to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a deflationary currency in nature. With a limited cap, it would be a horrible choice as a global currency. It would cause chronic, undefeatable deflation of the world's economy. A global reserve asset serves another purpose. Like gold, which has been on the run lately, it serves as a reliable, neutral store of value and hedge for nations' central banks in an uncertain world. Central banks hold it for safety, liquidity in extreme scenarios, and long-term wealth preservation. Due to the deflationary nature of Bitcoin, I see it as a potential (with emphasis on potential) global reserve asset, rather than a global currency used for commercial transactions. Conclusion: My Bitcoin price target and why I remain bullish I covered Bitcoin extensively on Seeking Alpha, with 10 articles on BTC-USD and more on the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) as well as other Bitcoin ETFs. As I usually do at the end of most of my Bitcoin-related pieces, I will summarize my thoughts on why I am bullish. However, I invite readers to consult my previous work if they have any specific questions or thoughts on my investment thesis (which I cannot cover in detail every time). I am happy to address them in the comments, too. Bitcoin has all the technical characteristics it needs to succeed as a global reserve asset: durability, divisibility, fungibility, portability, verifiability, and, most importantly in my view, scarcity. In an ever-polarized world, I think there is enough room for more than one major global reserve asset (gold). My belief is compounded by the fact that gold is an element that can be found on Earth at 4 parts per billion, and it is therefore subject to technological disruption. New mining techniques or asteroid mining could theoretically render it obsolete. While today these technologies seem far away, humanity tends to evolve exponentially . I think that increasing institutionalization of Bitcoin, especially by the current US admin, has rendered Bitcoin easily available for most, making its adoption at this point in time purely a matter of strategic choice, beyond any technical hurdles. In the above context, I keep seeing Bitcoin as an asymmetric bet on it maturing as a global reserve asset. Should that happen, my valuation model (summarized in the table below) sees Bitcoin worth between $162,500 and $275,000 per coin, with an upside of up to $1,000,000 per coin in a bullish case. BTC Valuation Model (Author's Work) With Bitcoin trading at ~$88,000 per coin at the time of writing, I'm upgrading to a Strong Buy rating on the asymmetric nature of the investment. Concrete risks exist, which I will cover next. Risks The main risk in investing in Bitcoin today is that it may never mature as a global reserve asset. Just because Bitcoin has all the technical characteristics needed to become one, it doesn’t mean it will actually be adopted by institutions to such an extent. With gold rallying in the current geopolitical context, Bitcoin is still stuck at the level of late 2024. Measured in gold , Bitcoin is actually in a bear market, and its price is below 2021 lows. In other terms, it is clear to me that Bitcoin is not yet being adopted as a global asset. In this sense, any investment in BTC remains a high-risk bet. My own bear case sees Bitcoin remaining “an online casino,” with value only extracted from its volatility by active traders. If that’s the future of Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency will never mature to the size of a global reserve asset and may forever trade at levels around its current price. Other risks include high volatility and the fact that Bitcoin continues to be highly correlated with equities.

The market is in a neutral-to-cautious state. Downside risk remains present on the charts, but structural support zones and improving network usage keep the medium-term outlook open for a potential recovery once selling pressure exhausts. Ethereum Price Analysis: The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, ETH has been rejected lower from the recent consolidation below the declining 100-day moving average, with the 200-day moving average still positioned higher and confirming a medium-term downtrend. The price is trading around the $2,900 region after another decisive rejection from the $3,400–$3,500 supply band, leaving the $2,600–$2,700 zone as the first major demand zone. A sustained loss of the $2,700 area would increase the risk of a deeper move toward the $2,200 support area. The daily RSI has pulled back from neutral levels and is drifting toward oversold territory, signalling that momentum is bearish but also that the market is approaching a zone where downside extension may begin to slow if fresh sellers do not appear. ETH/USDT 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart shows ETH breaking below the rising trendline that had connected higher lows since the November bottom, effectively breaking the symmetrical triangle structure. The asset is now consolidating just under the former $3,000 support band, which has turned into short-term resistance. Repeated failures to reclaim this area would keep intraday pressure skewed toward the $2,800 level and, if weakness persists, down toward the major $2,500-$2,600 demand zone. The 4-hour RSI has already printed oversold readings and is attempting to stabilize, suggesting that while intraday momentum is negative, the market may transition into a choppy consolidation phase rather than an immediate impulsive leg lower if the current short-term support zone holds. On-Chain Analysis Looking at on-chain activity, Ethereum’s total transaction count and its 30-day EMA have been trending higher from the depressed levels seen in early 2025, even as the price has recently corrected from all-time highs back toward $2,900. This combination of declining price and rising transactional activity often reflects a shift from speculative excess toward more organic network usage, as weaker hands reduce exposure while a base of active users remains engaged. If the current upturn in transaction counts persists or accelerates while price consolidates above the main demand zones, it would signal that fundamental network demand is absorbing supply. This is historically a constructive backdrop for a medium-term recovery. Failure of activity to hold these gains, by contrast, would argue for viewing the recent bounce as primarily technical rather than fundamentally supported.

It finally happened. After years of trailing behind, Nvidia now spends more money than any other company at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). Jensen Huang, the guy running Nvidia, said it himself on a podcast this month. He told Morris Chang, the founder of TSMC, decades ago that this day would come. Now he’s saying, “Morris will be happy to know Nvidia is TSMC’s largest customer now.” Back when that conversation happened, no one expected this. Apple had been king of the chip world for a long time. They relied on TSMC to make chips for iPhones and Macs. Those A-series and M-series processors were what kept Apple in front. But now things have changed, and Nvidia is the one piling up the orders. Nvidia’s spending now beats Apple’s by billions Ben Bajarin, who analyzes tech at Creative Strategies, said Nvidia is set to bring in $33 billion in revenue for TSMC this year. That’s about 22% of the foundry’s total. Apple, on the other hand, is expected to bring in just $27 billion, or around 18%. “The scale of this drastically changed,” Ben said. “A couple years ago, you could just see how much more capacity Nvidia was demanding from TSMC.” TSMC doesn’t rank its 522 customers in public, but it did admit back in March that one customer brought in 22% of its revenue and the second biggest brought in 12%. That was the first big hint that Nvidia had taken the lead. This shift didn’t come out of nowhere. Since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in 2022, demand for AI chips exploded. Nvidia’s chips are now used in tons of data centers. The company is behind most of the AI accelerators out there, and that demand pushed TSMC’s high-performance computing sales up to 55% of revenue in the last quarter. In 2022, that number was 40%. Nvidia’s chips cost more and demand more Part of why Nvidia now dominates is that its chips are huge and complicated to make. Compared to what Apple makes, Nvidia’s hardware takes more time, more effort, and more money. That alone boosts how much TSMC earns from them. In February, Nvidia is expected to report $213 billion in sales for fiscal 2026, which ends this month. That’s a 66% increase. Meanwhile, Apple’s sales for fiscal 2025, which ended in September, only grew by 6.4%. Apple’s still pushing though. They’re reporting earnings this Thursday and expecting 12% revenue growth. Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan raised his price target on Apple to $315, saying the stock could still rise 27%. He pointed to stronger iPhone 17 demand and lower expenses. Apple stock is up 11% over the past year, but still behind the S&P 500, which gained 13.4% in that time. Samik said memory prices have been hurting Apple’s profit margins, but he expects that pressure to ease. He also said the company’s Services revenue could rise 7%, even though that’s less than the 14% Apple aimed for. Still, he thinks they’ve got other ways to grow. TSMC is still the most dominant foundry out there. They work with almost everyone; AMD, Intel, Broadcom, Qualcomm, and more. Research group TrendForce said TSMC owns 70% of the global chip manufacturing market. Intel, trying to play catch-up, wants to make advanced chips in the U.S. But they still don’t have a lead customer. Their stock dropped 13% on Thursday after giving weak production forecasts.

It’s Gen Z, aka Zoomers. Unlike Millennials or Gen X, who prefer long-form videos, Gen Z influencers promote crypto through short-form content or live streams. They mix crypto with their version of internet culture, like brainrot slang, memes, and AI slop. A new kind of crypto influence Zoomers have a different kind of crypto influence. They’re a special breed. First, Gen Z isn’t foreign to social media and the internet. They were born between 1997 and 2012 and grew up with the rise of Web2 and now Web3. Moreover, they have experienced two recessions: the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 recession. These economic events made Gen Z fearless. They don’t mind investing in risky assets like meme coins or NFTs. According to a YouGov report , 48% of Generation Z use crypto exchanges, compared with 36% of Millennials. The new generation of investors isn’t that keen on traditional investing. Around 26% of Gen Z invest in stocks compared with 40% of Millennials. Being part of crypto and DeFi is the norm among Zoomers. Most of them had heard of Bitcoin from a young age. Who are “crypto influencers” in the Gen Z era? In the Gen Z era, crypto influencers do not label themselves as professional traders or analysts. They are content creators first. The persona, the vibes, and the delivery method are important. The type of content, whether it’s news or educational, comes next. The new generation of crypto influencers simplifies complex ideas. They react to trends, entertain, and build community engagement around Web3 topics. The influence of Zoomers is rooted in storytelling and social credibility. It’s not just market expertise. Gen Z crypto content is mainly found on TikTok. Short-form videos that provide information in digestible chunks are the preferred way Zoomers learn about crypto. Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts are among other popular apps for short clips. Popular platforms among Gen Z users. According to stats from The 2025 Sprout Social Index , some of the most popular platforms among Gen Z users are: Instagram: 89% YouTube: 84% TikTok: 82% TikTok leads Gen Z daily engagement. Over 83% of Zoomers logged into the app at least once a day in 2025. For chatting and voice calls, Zoomers favor Discord. Many crypto influencers run dedicated servers for their communities. They host audio channels, share insights, analysis, memes, and other alerts in real time. Discord continues to attract Gen Z males. Over 40 million U.S. users engage with the platform each week. X has limited traction among Gen Z. Only 22% used it regularly in 2025. Telegram use among Gen Z rose by 21% due to privacy and censorship issues. Why Gen Z listens to them Gen Z tends to distrust mainstream media and the old school approach to finance. Such media channels are often seen as outdated. Instead, they turn to peer-like, digitally native creators for crypto information. About 37% of Gen Z investors in the U.S. and 38% in the U.K. take financial advice from social media influencers. In addition, Zoomers prefer crypto information that is visual and informal. TikTok and YouTube Shorts crypto influencers create short, engaging videos. They simplify complex topics through relatable, story-like explanations. Gen Z influencers are seen as more genuine and reliable than celebrities or institutions. They use familiar language and share personal stories. They ignore official qualifications. How crypto influencers actually shape markets Gen Z crypto influencers do not focus on market timing. They are more about compressing attention into short time windows. Short form creators can take a vague theme like “this coin is trending,” or “this chart is breaking out,” and turn it into a shareable story that spreads faster than long form research. Young crypto influencers can popularize memecoins and make them accessible. But they also amplify hype and misinformation. This is because their content is optimized for engagement. Memecoins are basically attention products. They don’t need a complex utility case to travel. They need a narrative hook and social proof. Influencer-led attention can quickly inflate and deflate valuations. The fast rise and fall of the Hawk Tuah Girl memecoin is a good example. Influencer content acts like a sentiment shock. A bullish clip sparks FOMO buying. A skeptical reaction triggers doubt, or a “warning” video accelerates exits. It’s a reflexivity loop of content, attention, price, and more content. Moreover, Gen Z platforms don’t just broadcast. They recruit people. Comments like “I’m in,” “dev doxxed,” “listing soon” turn into evidence. TikTok duets or stitches create debates. And reposts and reaction threads simulate consensus. Young influencers don’t directly impact crypto markets, but they grab and control attention. Case patterns A meme coin cycle is a case pattern that keeps repeating. It starts with a meme, a character, or a joke. Explainer content frames it as “the next trend.” It’s an easy story, with a low learning curve. The cycle moves to the virality phase next. Comments, TikTok stitches, and reposts are social proof, creating a sense of consensus around a meme coin. The market starts moving next. A relatively small wave of buys can spike the price of a meme coin with thin liquidity. Then the second wave of buyers arrive because the price spiked. Finally, the distribution phase follows. Early meme coin entrants exit into late FOMO, then regret posts flood social media. Another repetitive case is the airdrop cycle. The cycle begins with “How to qualify?” Twitter threads and short videos spread fast, explaining tasks, points, and referrals. People chase activities like swapping and daily check-ins, which are often framed as “free money.” The expectation of receiving a token gets priced. Pre-market IOUs launch, narrative bidding starts, and rumor cycles begin. At last, the airdrop happens and leads to immediate volatility. As a result, social media content swings to asking whether it was worth it, with regret over farming. Crypto education or crypto entertainment? Gen Z crypto content sits on a spectrum. Some creators teach, others perform, and many do both in the same clip. This creates an education issue and a market integrity issue because social platforms will amplify misinformation and speculation. Young investors use social media to learn about investing and crypto. Some creators genuinely educate. They play a positive role in investor education. Others simplify a topic to the point of distortion. Their content may include false claims, lack proper disclosures, and have conflicts of interest. Moreover, short-form content favors clear answers, not nuance. It’s optimized for retention and virality. It tends to favor confident predictions. Simple buy/sell narratives are better than discussions of tradeoffs. And price movement is often treated as proof. Education explains how something works, like gas fees , liquidity, tokenomics, etc. Speculative education uses explanation as a funnel into a trade. It’s often mixed with urgency and social proof. Complex crypto content with a confident narrative can be risky. It can make new investors overconfident. They may overestimate what they understand, or underestimate drawdowns and liquidity risks. They could also mistake virality for validity. In crypto, volatility is the baseline. When prices swing fast, confident content can prompt impulsive entries. Social proof can accelerate FOMO, and post-pump narratives can trap late buyers. Distinguishing between crypto education and crypto entertainment is a critical skill. Regulatory and platform attention Regulators view crypto influencers as a fundamental part of modern investing. They are no longer just a minor issue. If an influencer promotes crypto on social media, they must clearly and prominently disclose risks. Regulators now act together globally, giving official warnings and taking enforcement actions. Enforcement through social media platforms is complex. This is because influencers or fraudsters can reappear through new or backup accounts. The crypto market is maturing, and regulators are no longer coming for creators. They are trying to reduce consumer harm and standardize disclosure. How this changes the crypto information stack Crypto’s information stack has changed from pull-based reading to push-based feeds. Instead of relying on blogs, forums, and long threads, people watch short clips. The old information stack starts with the user. They search for a topic, follow specific accounts, or read long posts. The learning pace is slow, and narrative formation takes more time. The new information stack starts with an algorithm. The user gets shown what performs, not what is most accurate. The content format is often viral clips, meme explainers, and stitched reactions. The learning pace is fast, and the narrative cycle compresses from days or weeks to hours. The media structure affects market structure. That change in the crypto information stack doesn’t mean influencers control markets. It simply means the path from narrative to retail behavior is shorter. Crypto info stack: old vs. new. What comes next Crypto creators are moving from solo accounts toward managed, monetized media businesses. A hybrid of influencer and journalist creators will be more common. But with more pressure for transparency and disclosures. The goal post will move from who can go viral once to who can be trusted repeatedly. Influence is the new volatility layer Crypto markets react not just to data, but to narratives. Those narratives can become self reinforcing when attention and price feed each other. There’s a strong correlation between social media sentiment and crypto volatility. And Gen Z crypto influencers are big drivers of social media sentiment. This doesn’t mean they control crypto markets. But in thin markets, attention is a volatility amplifier. Understanding Gen Z crypto influencers is part of understanding crypto itself.",Cryptocurrency Guides|Instagram|TikTok|YouTube,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|AIRDROP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-26 13:19:25

This substantial transaction, confirmed on March 21, 2025, arrives during a period of significant maturation for cryptocurrency markets. Consequently, the purchase provides a powerful signal about long-term asset valuation. Moreover, it reflects a broader trend of sophisticated capital allocation toward decentralized networks. Analyzing Strategy’s Major Bitcoin Purchase Strategy’s latest acquisition represents a clear continuation of its publicly stated digital asset strategy. The firm paid an average price of roughly $88,677 per Bitcoin for this 2,932 BTC tranche. This transaction follows a series of similar accumulations by the firm over the past two years. Therefore, it demonstrates a methodical, dollar-cost averaging approach favored by long-term institutional holders. The purchase immediately increases Strategy’s total Bitcoin treasury holdings, which are believed to exceed 15,000 BTC. For context, this positions the firm among the top corporate and institutional holders of the cryptocurrency globally. Market analysts quickly noted the timing of the purchase. It occurred within a specific price range that many consider a key accumulation zone for large investors. Furthermore, on-chain data reveals the Bitcoin was transferred to a known cold storage custody solution. This action highlights the paramount importance of security for institutional players. The transaction was settled on the Bitcoin blockchain, providing transparent and immutable proof of the transfer for all network participants. The Institutional Bitcoin Investment Landscape The landscape for institutional Bitcoin investment has evolved dramatically since 2020. Initially, corporate treasury purchases by firms like MicroStrategy paved the way. Now, a diverse array of asset managers, hedge funds, and private equity firms actively allocate capital. Strategy’s move fits squarely within this established yet expanding framework. Several key drivers explain this sustained institutional interest. Inflation Hedge: Many institutions view Bitcoin as a digital store of value, akin to digital gold, particularly in macroeconomic environments with expansive monetary policy. Portfolio Diversification: Bitcoin’s historically low correlation with traditional asset classes like stocks and bonds makes it an attractive diversifier. Network Adoption: Growing adoption of the Bitcoin network for payments and as a settlement layer increases its fundamental utility. Regulatory Clarity: Enhanced regulatory frameworks in major jurisdictions like the U.S. and EU have reduced uncertainty for institutional entrants. Comparative data illustrates this trend’s scale. The table below shows notable institutional Bitcoin purchases from 2023 to early 2025. Entity Approx. BTC Purchased Approx. Value (USD) Timeframe MicroStrategy ~25,000 ~$1.5B 2023-2024 Strategy (This Purchase) 2,932 $260M March 2025 Several ETF Providers (Aggregate) ~150,000+ ~$10B+ Since ETF Launch Expert Analysis on Treasury Strategy Financial experts point to the strategic nature of such allocations. “Institutions like Strategy are not day-trading,” notes Dr. Anya Sharma, a professor of Digital Asset Economics at the Global Finance Institute. “Their purchases are calculated treasury management decisions. They analyze long-term macroeconomic trends, network security metrics like hash rate, and adoption curves. The decision to allocate hundreds of millions is backed by deep due diligence, often spanning months.” This perspective is supported by public filings and statements from Strategy’s leadership, which consistently emphasize a multi-year holding horizon. The impact of such a purchase extends beyond Strategy’s balance sheet. Firstly, it reduces the available liquid supply of Bitcoin on exchanges, a metric watched closely by analysts. Secondly, it provides a vote of confidence that can influence market sentiment among other institutional investors. Finally, it contributes to the network’s security by incentivizing miners through transaction fees, albeit indirectly. This creates a reinforcing cycle of investment and network strength. Market Impact and Future Implications Immediate market reaction to the news was measured, with Bitcoin’s price showing stability. This response suggests the market efficiently absorbs large, transparent OTC (Over-the-Counter) purchases. However, the long-term implications are more profound. Strategy’s continued accumulation signals to the market that sophisticated investors see enduring value at current price levels. It also validates the operational maturity of custody, execution, and accounting services that now support institutional-scale crypto investing. Looking forward, analysts anticipate several potential outcomes. Other private investment firms may follow suit, accelerating the institutional adoption wave. Furthermore, public companies might feel increased competitive pressure to consider Bitcoin for their own treasury reserves. Regulatory bodies will likely scrutinize these holdings, potentially leading to more standardized accounting treatment. The evolution of Bitcoin as a collateral asset in decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional lending could also accelerate, backed by these substantial institutional balances. Conclusion Strategy’s $260 million Bitcoin purchase of 2,932 BTC is a significant event in the ongoing institutionalization of cryptocurrency markets. It demonstrates a mature, strategic approach to digital asset allocation by a major investment firm. This transaction reinforces Bitcoin’s role as a legitimate treasury asset and provides tangible evidence of sustained institutional confidence. As the ecosystem develops, such methodical, large-scale investments will continue to shape market structure, liquidity, and the broader narrative around Bitcoin’s financial utility. FAQs Q1: How much Bitcoin did Strategy purchase, and at what price? Strategy purchased 2,932 Bitcoin for approximately $260 million, resulting in an average price of roughly $88,677 per BTC. Q2: Why do institutions like Strategy invest in Bitcoin? Institutions typically cite reasons including portfolio diversification, hedging against inflation, and gaining exposure to the growth of the Bitcoin network as a new technological asset class, based on their long-term investment theses. Q3: Where do institutions store such large amounts of Bitcoin? Institutions almost exclusively use regulated, institutional-grade custody solutions that employ deep cold storage, multi-signature technology, and robust insurance policies to secure their assets. Q4: Does a purchase like this immediately affect Bitcoin’s market price? Large purchases are often executed via OTC desks to minimize market impact. While they signal confidence, the immediate price effect is usually muted, with the larger impact being a reduction in readily available supply on exchanges. Q5: What is the significance of this purchase for the average cryptocurrency investor? It serves as a data point indicating that sophisticated, deep-pocketed investors are committing capital for the long term, which can validate the asset’s staying power and influence overall market structure and maturity.

According to the community’s statement on X released Monday, one of the two proposals it voted for reached the validator voting threshold to be integrated into XRPL. One amendment it had backed earlier on was rejected after a flaw surfaced, and another amendment on token escrow is under review pending more testing. XRPL Commons Voting Update On Friday January 23rd, we completed our regular amendment voting session. Amendment votes: 🔷XLS-80 (Permissioned Domains): Voted YES following successful Devnet testing 🔷XLS-81 (Permissioned DEXes): Voted YES following successful Devnet testing… — XRPL Commons (@xrpl_commons) January 26, 2026 XRPL Commons participates in the validator-driven process that determines which changes advance toward activation. Amendments require sustained support from a supermajority of validators before they go live on the ledger. XRP validators greenlight credential-based network zones 88% of validators have voted in favor of the XLS-80 proposal, also known as Permissioned Domains, after successful Devnet testing. The group said the change is tracking an estimated activation date of February 4, 2026, at 09:57:51 UTC. The proposal introduces restricted environments within the XRP Ledger that limit the participation of accounts holding approved credentials. The framework would not expose sensitive personal records, as only proof that a credential is valid is recorded on-chain, while any personal details remain off the ledger. Permissioned Domains are gated zones that institutions can use, provided they verify counterparties before transacting. This is different from the fully open access model that blockchain systems used before, including XRPL. XRPL Commons also voted in favor of the XLS-81 “Permissioned DEX” amendment, which was proposed during the launch of software version v2.5.0 last year. According to the XRP amendment voting page, XLS-81 has not yet been enabled but is still in the voting phase. The amendment requires 27 out of 34 validator votes to meet its threshold. At the time of reporting, consensus stood at 55.88%, with only 19 validators in favour. The proposal expands the XRP Ledger’s built-in exchange by allowing trading inside controlled settings. Participants must hold approved credentials before placing or filling orders, including financial firms operating under identity and reporting rules. Permissioned DEX instances have “allow-lists” that determine who can access a given trading venue. Orders placed in these settings are kept separate from the main open order books. One type limits activity strictly to traders within a specific domain. At the same time, another structure lets traders interact with both the restricted pool and the public exchange, giving priority to the controlled venue. The framework is meant to work alongside XRP Ledger compliance mechanisms, such as authorized trustlines, asset freezing, and clawback functions, to enable regulated on-chain trading. However, the Commons switched its vote on XLS-56 (Batch Transactions) from yes to no after the discovery of a software issue during review. According to the group, the bug could validate inner transactions in a batch that seemed properly signed when they were not. Commons recommended that developers make fixes before its support on the ledger could resume. XRPL token escrow upgrade awaits further testing The XLS-85 amendment that extends escrow features to issued tokens in other chains saw no change in position. XRPL Commons said more testing is scheduled ahead of the next voting session. Per the proposal’s semantics, the ledger could hold IOUs and Multi-Purpose Tokens in escrow. It could also impact coin releases by conditions such as time, specific events, or programmable rules. Token issuers would be barred from placing their own assets into escrow, and any assets under escrow could not be clawed back during the lock period. Transfer fees for certain tokens would be calculated when the escrow is created. The amendment was also introduced with software version v2.5.0 and would require 80% validator backing to activate. Still, it does not provide direct cross-chain escrow functionality as that limitation is outside its current scope. Beyond amendment decisions, XRPL Commons said fee-based reserve remains at 1 XRP, while the owner reserve is capped at 0.1 XRP. All other open amendments had already been voted on in prior sessions, and no new proposals were added to the agenda this round. The next amendment voting session is scheduled for February 6, when validators will revisit pending proposals and review test results. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The bank’s latest research indicates that coordinated action by global authorities has become increasingly probable, marking a significant shift in foreign exchange market dynamics. This development follows months of sustained yen weakness against the US dollar, creating challenging conditions for Japan’s export-driven economy and raising concerns about broader financial stability. Understanding the USD/JPY Intervention Landscape Currency intervention represents a deliberate action by a nation’s monetary authorities to influence the exchange rate of their currency. For Japan, the Ministry of Finance typically authorizes such actions, with the Bank of Japan executing the trades. Historically, Japan has intervened to sell yen when the currency becomes too strong, harming exports. However, the current situation presents the opposite challenge. The yen has weakened substantially against the dollar, raising import costs and inflation pressures. Bank of America’s analysis highlights several critical factors increasing intervention likelihood. First, the interest rate differential between the US and Japan remains wide. The Federal Reserve maintains a restrictive policy stance while the Bank of Japan only recently ended negative rates. Second, Japan’s current account surplus has narrowed. Third, speculative positioning in futures markets shows extreme yen short positions. These conditions create what analysts term “asymmetric intervention risk.” The Mechanics of Modern Currency Intervention Modern currency intervention differs significantly from past approaches. Today, authorities often coordinate actions with other central banks to maximize impact. The Bank of International Settlements frequently facilitates these coordinated efforts. Effective intervention requires surprise, scale, and follow-through. Markets now watch for several signals including unusual option flows, official verbal warnings, and direct inquiries to banks about currency positions. Recent history provides important context. Japan last intervened to support the yen in 2022, spending approximately $60 billion. That action provided only temporary relief. The current environment presents greater challenges with stronger global dollar demand. Analysts note that successful intervention now requires either changing market fundamentals or coordinating with other nations facing similar currency pressures. Global Economic Pressures and Spillover Effects The USD/JPY situation reflects broader global economic tensions. Many emerging market currencies face similar pressures against the dollar. A sustained strong dollar creates debt servicing challenges for nations with dollar-denominated obligations. It also contributes to imported inflation worldwide. These interconnected risks make the yen’s stability particularly important for Asian financial markets. Bank of America’s report identifies specific spillover channels. First, competitive devaluation concerns could prompt other nations to intervene. Second, yen volatility affects carry trade dynamics significantly. Third, Japanese investors might accelerate overseas investment shifts if currency hedging costs remain elevated. The table below summarizes key pressure points: Pressure Point Current Status Intervention Threshold USD/JPY Exchange Rate Above 150 Sustained moves above 155 Import Price Inflation 8.5% year-over-year Sustained above 10% Real Effective Exchange Rate 30-year lows Further 5% depreciation Market participants monitor several additional indicators. These include: Options market skew: Measures market fear of sharp moves Swap line utilization: Indicates dollar funding stress Reserve management changes: Signals policy shifts Verbal intervention frequency: Warns of potential action Central Bank Coordination and Policy Dilemmas Effective intervention increasingly requires international coordination. The Bank of America analysis suggests several potential coordination partners. South Korea faces similar won weakness against the dollar. European Central Bank officials have expressed concern about euro volatility. Even the US Treasury might support action if dollar strength threatens global financial stability. However, coordination presents significant challenges. First, different nations have varying economic priorities. Second, legal frameworks differ across jurisdictions. Third, the effectiveness of coordinated action depends on market psychology and follow-up measures. Historical analysis shows that coordinated interventions during the 1985 Plaza Accord and 2000 euro support operation achieved mixed results. Japanese authorities face particular policy dilemmas. Intervention to support the yen contradicts the Bank of Japan’s gradual monetary normalization. It also risks drawing political criticism if perceived as ineffective. Furthermore, intervention consumes foreign exchange reserves that might be needed during genuine crises. These considerations make intervention a last-resort tool rather than a routine policy instrument. Expert Perspectives on Intervention Timing Financial market experts emphasize several timing considerations. First, intervention during periods of low liquidity maximizes impact. Second, action following extreme market moves gains credibility. Third, coordination with other policy announcements enhances effectiveness. Most analysts agree that authorities prefer to use verbal intervention first, progressing to actual intervention only if markets ignore warnings. The current environment presents unusual challenges. Global dollar strength reflects both US economic outperformance and safe-haven demand. These fundamental factors limit intervention effectiveness. Consequently, many experts believe any intervention would require substantial scale and international support to succeed. Market participants increasingly price in this reality, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of yen weakness. Market Implications and Risk Management Strategies The rising intervention risk necessitates careful market positioning. Currency traders face several challenges. First, intervention timing remains unpredictable. Second, market impact varies based on execution method. Third, follow-up actions determine whether effects persist. Prudent risk management requires considering multiple scenarios. Bank of America recommends several approaches for market participants. These include reducing concentrated directional bets, increasing option protection, and monitoring official communication channels closely. The bank’s research suggests that while intervention might cause short-term volatility, fundamental factors ultimately determine medium-term trends. This creates complex trading dynamics requiring sophisticated risk frameworks. Longer-term implications extend beyond currency markets. Persistent yen weakness affects Japanese corporate earnings, Asian trade patterns, and global inflation dynamics. It also influences capital flows as Japanese investors seek higher yields abroad. These interconnected effects underscore why USD/JPY movements attract such intense scrutiny from policymakers and market participants worldwide. Conclusion Bank of America’s warning about rising USD/JPY intervention risks highlights significant tensions in global currency markets. The analysis underscores how fundamental economic divergences, policy dilemmas, and market dynamics combine to create challenging conditions. While intervention might provide temporary relief, sustainable currency stability requires addressing underlying economic imbalances. Market participants must navigate this complex environment with careful attention to both technical indicators and fundamental developments. The USD/JPY pair will likely remain a focal point for global financial stability concerns throughout 2025. FAQs Q1: What triggers currency intervention by Japanese authorities? Japanese authorities typically consider intervention when excessive currency volatility threatens economic stability, import prices surge uncontrollably, or market movements become disorderly and speculative rather than fundamentals-driven. Q2: How does coordinated intervention differ from unilateral action? Coordinated intervention involves multiple central banks acting simultaneously to amplify market impact, share intervention costs, and demonstrate stronger political commitment compared to unilateral action by a single nation. Q3: What makes USD/JPY intervention particularly challenging currently? The wide US-Japan interest rate differential, strong global dollar demand, and Japan’s narrowing current account surplus create fundamental pressures that intervention alone cannot easily reverse without complementary policy changes. Q4: How do markets typically react to currency intervention? Markets usually experience immediate volatility and position unwinding, but sustained effects depend on intervention scale, surprise element, follow-up actions, and whether economic fundamentals support the desired exchange rate direction. Q5: What indicators signal rising intervention probability? Key signals include intensified verbal warnings from officials, unusual options market activity, direct inquiries to banks about currency positions, and preparatory discussions between finance ministries of potential partner nations.

In his framing, sustained congestion on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) could push fees higher via the protocol’s load-scaling mechanics, potentially destroying on the order of one billion XRP annually. XRPL Load Factor Could Turn Fees Into A Major XRP Burn In a thread titled “The ‘Supply Meltdown’ Simulation,” Vincent Van Code claimed “everyone is calculating the XRP burn wrong,” starting with the premise that the commonly cited base fee of 0.00001 XRP only reflects a quiet network. “But what happens if the world actually starts using the XRPL at its 3,400 TPS limit?” he wrote, positioning load-driven fee escalation as the pivotal variable rather than raw throughput alone. Van Code’s simulation walks through multiple fee regimes at the same headline activity rate, emphasizing that burn changes dramatically when the ledger is full and the “Load Factor” increases fees to deter spam. “As the ledger fills up, the Load Factor kicks in to stop spam,” he wrote. “Fees don’t just stay low; they scale exponentially.” Related Reading: XRP To $11, And Then $70: The Next Impulse Wave To Watch Out For He anchored the thread with four scenarios and daily burn estimates, starting with what he called a “standard day” of 1.2 million transactions and roughly 450 XRP burned per day. From there, he modeled “global adoption” at the stated 3,400 TPS ceiling, translating to about 293 million transactions per day at base fee and an estimated 2,937 XRP burned daily. The more aggressive claims come when he holds transaction volume constant at that 293 million-per-day level but lifts the effective fee via congestion. In his “congestion hike” case, he assumes the load-scaled fee rises to 0.001 XRP, implying about 293,760 XRP burned per day. In a “full gridlock” case at 0.01 XRP per transaction, he estimates 2,937,600 XRP burned daily. Related Reading: XRP Price Recovery Is Possible If It Reclaims This Ichimoku Base The thesis leans on a structural feature of XRPL fees: they are not paid out to validators or any sponsoring entity, but removed from circulation. Van Code underscored that distinction directly. “The fees aren’t paid to miners. They aren’t paid to Ripple. They are destroyed forever.” The “Supply Meltdown” Simulation 🌋 Headline: Everyone is calculating the $XRP burn wrong. 🧵 The “base fee” (0.00001 XRP) only exists when the network is quiet.

Additionally, some key indicators suggest the downturn could deepen in the short term. Finding a New Bottom Just hours ago, Pi Network’s PI tumbled to $0.17, which is the lowest level recorded since the token began trading in February last year. Its market capitalization fell under $1.5 billion, making it the 75th-largest cryptocurrency. PI Price, Source: CoinGecko The latest move to the south could be partially driven by the broader market’s bearish environment, where Bitcoin (BTC) slipped below $88,000, and Ethereum (ETH) briefly plunged to $2,780. Some important factors hint that PI’s price has yet to chart fresh lows. Data shows that almost 150 million coins are expected to be unlocked in the next 30 days, a development that could increase selling pressure, as it will give investors the opportunity to offload assets they have been waiting for a long time. The average token unlocks are just south of 5 million, which is far more aggressive than those in the previous weeks and months. The record day will be February 7, when approximately 6.1 million tokens will be freed up. Huge Adoption on the Way? While PI’s price performance over the past several months indeed seems depressing, some X users remain optimistic about the project. Kosasi Nakomoto recently noted that the asset’s “earn while you wait” model looks “childish” to many crypto natives, but predicted that in a couple of years, most people in emerging markets will probably have a Pi wallet. Meanwhile, PI’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests that the worst might be over and could be time for a short-term rebound. The metric ranges from 0 to 100 and shows whether the asset is overbought or oversold. Ratios below 30 indicate the valuation has slipped too much in a short period and might be due for a rally, while anything above 70 is considered bearish territory. Recently, the RSI fell below 30 and has since increased to 38.

In 2029, Ethereum is anticipated to trade between $12,779 and $16,191 with an average expected price of $13,163. In 2032, ETH could trade between $42,467 and $49,675 with an average price of $43,622 The Ethereum network, launched in 2015, is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and dApps using blockchain technology, eliminating the need for intermediaries and thereby enhancing security. The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and smart contracts have attracted investors’ recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps traders trade Ethereum more easily. So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is ETH likely to go up? What will ETH be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the details by exploring Ethereum’s price predictions from 2026 through 2032. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Symbol ETH Current price $2,889 Market cap $348.79B Trading volume (24-hour) $32.04B Circulating supply 120.7M All-time high $4,891 on Nov 16, 2021 All-time low $0.4209 on Oct 22, 2015 24-hour high $2,940.40 24-hour low $2,785.90 ETH price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 4.29% (Medium) 50-day SMA $ 3,073.09 200-day SMA $ 3,500.07 Sentiment Bearish Fear and Greed Index 20 (Extreme Fear) Green days 15/30 (50%) Ethereum (ETH) price analysis ETH is trading below key short-term moving averages, with sellers defending the $3,000 zone Momentum indicators show weakening upside and growing bearish pressure Price is testing nearby support and could extend lower if buyers fail to step in Ethereum price analysis 1-day chart: Ethereum holds $2,800 support as price rebounds toward $2,900 resistance Ethereum’s 1D chart shows a sharp selloff earlier in the month, followed by a rebound attempt. Price printed a wide range with a low near $2,809 and a high around $2,931, closing near $2,896, suggesting buyers defended the $2,800 zone. The trend remains fragile because the recent structure still shows lower highs from the $3,300–$3,400 area. ETHUSD chart by TradingView A sustained hold above $2,900 could open a push toward $3,000 and $3,120, while rejection there keeps downside risk to $2,850 then $2,800. Watch for higher lows and stronger volume to confirm reversal momentum. If $2,800 breaks, next support sits near $2,700–$2,750 next week. ETH price analysis on the 4-hour chart: Ethereum slides toward $2,900 as bears defend key resistance Ethereum’s 4-hour chart shows a sharp selloff from the $3,300–$3,350 area into the $2,950 zone, followed by choppy consolidation that failed to reclaim $3,000. Bears then pushed price down toward the $2,800 region, where buyers stepped in and sparked a rebound back near $2,900. Momentum remains fragile, with lower highs suggesting sellers still control rallies. ETHUSD chart by TradingView Key support sits around $2,800–$2,820, then $2,750. Resistance is stacked at $2,920, $2,960, and $3,000. Watch volume and candle closes; a sustained hold above $2,920 would hint at short-term reversal, while rejection risks retesting $2,800. Above $3,000, bulls could target $3,120 again quickly in force. ETH technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 3,054.56 SELL SMA 5 2,983.89 SELL SMA 10 3,048.53 SELL SMA 21 3,116.84 SELL SMA 50 3,073.09 SELL SMA 100 3,253.21 SELL SMA 200 3,500.07 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 3,134.28 SELL EMA 5 3,143.49 SELL EMA 10 3,116.14 SELL EMA 21 3,075.29 SELL EMA 50 3,129.61 SELL EMA 100 3,302.89 SELL EMA 200 3,349.99 SELL What to expect from the ETH price analysis next? Ethereum is hovering near the $2,900 zone after rebounding from the $2,800 area, signaling tentative stabilization but not a confirmed trend shift. Buyers must defend $2,820–$2,800 to prevent another breakdown, while a push above $2,960 and especially $3,000 would improve short-term bullish odds. Until that happens, rallies may face selling pressure. Momentum remains mixed, reflecting uncertainty after the sharp drop from $3,300. If volume expands on upside moves, ETH could retest $3,100–$3,200. Failure to hold current levels would reopen downside risk toward $2,750. Overall, expect choppy price action with volatility as traders watch whether support hardens or another leg lower develops. Why is Ethereum down today? Ethereum is down today mainly due to technical breakdown and profit-taking after a recent failed rebound, as seen on the 4-hour and daily charts which show price pulling back from key resistance near $3,000–$3,050. Sellers stepped in once rallies stalled, leading to short-term liquidation and downward pressure. Momentum indicators on lower timeframes also cooled, signaling weakening buyer conviction. Broader crypto market softness and risk-off sentiment, especially if Bitcoin is declining or consolidating, have further weighed on ETH. With overhead supply still heavy and volume modest, the result is a technical selloff and cautious positioning by traders today. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum blockchain is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. However, the opinions expressed are not investment advice; traders should consider researching before investing. What is a realistic price for Ethereum in 2026? The realistic price for Ethereum in 2026 is expected to be around $11,092 at its maximum. What will 1 Ethereum be worth in 2030? One Ethereum is expected to be worth a maximum of $21,961 in 2030. How high can ETH realistically go? Ethereum’s price potential depends on multiple factors, including market trends, institutional adoption, network upgrades, and macroeconomic conditions. Realistically, ETH could reach $5,000 to $7,000 in the next bullish cycle if demand increases and Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions and scalability improvements boost adoption. If institutional interest strengthens, ETH may push past $10,000 over the long term, especially if Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform. However, volatility remains a key risk, with price corrections likely along the way. Regulatory clarity and Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) efficiency could also positively influence its long-term valuation. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2028, with a potential high of $11,092 Will ETH reach $25,000? Based on price predictions, Ethereum is unlikely to surpass the $25,000 level by 2031. By 2031, the ETH’s potential high is expected to be $27,899. This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, so long-term projections should be cautiously approached. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, the Ethereum platform will likely reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $49,675 in 2032. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $49,675 mark by 2032, so holding it for a longer period can be beneficial.

ETH’s price could go as high as $7,675.91, with an average forecast price of $6,544.88. Ethereum ETH price prediction 2028 Ethereum’s 2028 forecast of $9,275–$11,092, averaging $9,603.17, is fueled by massive Layer-2 adoption, institutional-scale DeFi growth, and mainstream integration of blockchain in finance and governance. By then, ETH’s deflationary supply dynamics and global acceptance as a settlement layer could drive demand sharply higher, supporting optimistic long-term price appreciation. Ethereum price prediction 2029 In 2029, the price of one Ethereum is expected to be at least $12.779. The average price of ETH in 2029 is expected to be $13,163 with a potential high of $16,191. By this stage, global adoption in finance, enterprise solutions, and tokenized assets is expected to be widespread. Combined with advanced scaling solutions and deflationary supply mechanics, ETH demand is expected to surge, supporting higher valuations. Ethereum ETH price prediction 2030 It is expected that the price of Ethereum will be at least $19,029 in 2030. The average trading value of Ethereum in USD is $19,687, but the price can go as high as $21,961. However, this is supported by its position as a global financial and digital infrastructure backbone. By then, tokenization of real-world assets, enterprise adoption, and government-level blockchain use are expected to accelerate. Ethereum price prediction 2031 By 2031, Ethereum’s forecast minimum price could rise to $27,899, while the expected average trading price is projected at $28,883. A potential high of $32,829 showcases Ethereum’s increasing appeal to investors. Ethereum price prediction 2032 According to the forecast and technical analysis, the price of Ethereum should be at least $42,467 in 2032. The average price of ETH is $43,622- but it can go as high as $49,675. This is underpinned by its full integration into global finance, enterprise infrastructure, and digital identity systems. With widespread tokenization, institutional dominance, and deflationary tokenomics, ETH is positioned as a core digital asset, driving sustained demand, long-term scarcity, and strong upward momentum in valuation.

Between November 1 and December 3, 2025, Ethereum retraced from a strong start near $3,590 (around November 3) to a trough near $ 2,745- $ 2,770 by November 21 — a downward swing reflecting broad market weakness. In late November, ETH rebounded. By November 26-27, it climbed back into the $3,015–$ 3,030 range before easing again in early December, signaling consolidation around $2,950–$3,050 as of December 3. On December 3, 2025, ETH traded between $2,995 and $3,050 before gradually climbing throughout the month, with prices mostly oscillating between $2,900 and $3,100 as the market stabilized and bulls defended key levels. By December 31, 2025, ETH was near $2,970–$3,024, and on January 1–2, 2026, the price held above $3,000, showing a modest year-end rebound as markets opened 2026 on a balanced note.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-26 13:35:00

The Rich Dad Poor Dad author says he continues buying Bitcoin and Ethereum regardless of volatility, arguing that price matters less than the direction of the global financial system. In a recent post , Kiyosaki pointed to two forces shaping his strategy: the rising US national debt, now above $38.4 trillion, and the steady erosion of the dollar’s purchasing power. From his perspective, daily price movements are a distraction. As debt expands and deficits deepen, scarce assets gain relevance. As he put it bluntly, he does not worry about market fluctuations because “the national debt keeps going up and the purchasing power of the US dollar keeps going down.” Q: Do I care when the price of gold silver or Bitcoin go up or down? A: No. I do not care. Q: Why Not? A: Because I know the national debt of the US keeps going up and the purchasing power of the US dollar keeps going down. Q: Why worry about the price of gold, silver,… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) January 23, 2026 That logic explains why Kiyosaki groups Bitcoin with gold and silver, often referring to BTC as “digital gold.” While he has long favored physical metals, he now sees Bitcoin and Ethereum as modern extensions of the same hedge against monetary dilution. His long-term outlook remains bold, with Bitcoin potentially reaching $1 million over the coming years or decade. Institutional Credibility Weakens as Investors Seek Bitcoin Hedges Kiyosaki’s stance reflects deep skepticism toward traditional financial authorities. He has repeatedly criticized institutions such as the Federal Reserve and the US Treasury, arguing that policy decisions have fueled debt growth rather than long-term stability. This view aligns with a broader investor shift. As inflation pressures, rising interest costs, and geopolitical uncertainty persist, capital has increasingly moved toward assets outside the traditional financial system. Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins, with more than 19.98 million already in circulation, continues to attract investors who see scarcity as protection rather than speculation. Bitcoin Price Prediction: $87K Base Forms as Trendlines Hint at a Springboard Move While the long-term narrative remains intact, Bitcoin’s short-term chart sits at a critical junction. After pulling back from the $95,500–$96,000 zone, BTC is consolidating between $86,000 and $88,000, an area where multiple technical levels converge. On the 4-hour chart, price is pressing against the lower boundary of a descending wedge while still respecting a rising long-term support line that has guided the broader uptrend since late 2025. Recent candles near $86,100 show long lower wicks, suggesting dip-buying rather than forced liquidation. BTC/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum remains soft, with RSI hovering near 39–40, but it has begun to turn higher. A sustained hold above $88,000 would open a path toward $90,700 and $93,300, with a potential retest of $95,500. A break below $86,000 would delay that recovery and expose $84,300, without undermining the broader structure. Taken together, Kiyosaki’s long-term conviction and Bitcoin’s developing technical base suggest the market is pausing, not peaking. For investors focused beyond short-term noise, this consolidation may be the kind of quiet reset that precedes the next expansion phase. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the BTC ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin.

Cipher Mining projects ~$870 million in annual revenue and 76% blended EBITDA margins, with $8.5 billion in contracted HPC revenue over the contract years. At ~7.9x forward sales and 10.2x EV/EBITDA forward, based on projected sales and earnings, Cipher Mining trades at a discount to data center peers despite potential for a higher growth rate. Execution risk centers on timely site energization; delays beyond August/September 2026 could trigger sharp sell-offs. Cipher Mining ( CIFR ) has been one of the Bitcoin miners executing well these past years. I've been long CIFR for the past few years. My past coverage of the company reflects this stance, which all carried Buy ratings. In between the coverages, there have been good runs and sometimes retracements. In my last coverage, I highlighted the point that Cipher Mining’s rerating story isn't over yet . CIFR is up a lot from 2024 but currently off 2025 highs. In this piece, I'd look at what lies ahead for 2026 as a Bitcoin miner and an HPC/AI play and also touch on the HPC deals secured last year and the implication of those deals into the present thesis. Cipher Mining - From Pipeline to Paychecks in 2026 Cipher Mining is one of the HPC/AI plays expecting an operational inflection point in 2026. The market at the moment has remained muted since the HPC/AI hype late last year for the miners that secured deals. ​They all rerated in Q4 but have now since mostly retraced those gains. CIFR itself surged to a 52-week high of ~$25 on the news of the $3 billion 10-year Fluidstack lease deal last September, then followed by the $5.5 billion AWS deal, before retracing following the issuance of senior secured notes totaling $1.73 billion in mid-November. I'd like to say that the market seems exhausted in assigning a premium to miners turned HPC plays based on just announced deals, pipeline capacity, and projected cash flow discounted into today's share price. I highlighted these in an article published here on Seeking Alpha last Friday covering Hut 8 Corp. ( HUT ), another miner turned HPC play. While each of these miners has secured what looks like similar multi-billion HPC deals, nuances in the deals themselves, as well as each miner's equity composition (of which I'm currently weighing their specific exposure to Bitcoin volatility through their balance sheets) and projected net operating income [NOI] for the duration of the deal are the specific metrics I'm looking at as I analyze these companies. ​In my latest HUT article , I downgraded HUT from a Buy to a Hold, despite HUT having seen similar capacity development and deals win as the rest of the HPC pivot companies. The main reason was the longer-dated timeline for their River Bend site energization compared to peers, which was compounded by the company's exposure to Bitcoin as it holds over 13,000 BTC on the balance sheet. These present a double headwind for the company, making 2026 a potentially muted year for HUT. ​In contrast, as I analyze Cipher Mining going into 2026, I'd be maintaining a Buy for CIFR for the singular reason that the checks for the HPC lease from AWS are projected to hit the books from August this year, and 168 MW Fluidstack hosting capacity at Barber Lake expects to commence rent in September. Impressive top line numbers making the headline are a first place to watch for the next catalysts. ​I’ve talked about the sentiment of the current market, which has apparently moved beyond maintaining momentum based on just pipeline capacity or capacity under exclusivity. Those were last year's catalysts. 2026 is the execution year, when HPC pivots show actual top-line impact on financials. To project what's coming for Cipher, I'd make some assumptions. Take the Cipher's base mining revenue to be ~$55 million per quarter (I derived that using the average revenue of three quarters already reported in FY25); annualized, this gives a steady mining run rate of ~$220 million. I'm quite positive the company can now produce that amount of quarterly revenue from mining as a steady run rate until the next halving, with current hashrate at 23.5 EH/s and mining efficiency looking good at 16.8 J/Th. Now layer in the HPC contracts. Cipher has roughly $8.5 billion of contracted revenue from the AWS and Fluidstack deals. If this revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over a 13-year weighted contract life, it implies ~$650 million in annual HPC revenue (calculated as $8.5 billion for the combined deal divided by 13 years). And would put total sales from both mining and HPC to about $870 million. Note that my estimate is still a conservative one as I use a straight-line assumption for the modeling. Cipher's adjusted EBITDA margin improved greatly in 2025. It was just around 12% in Q1 2025 on $49 million revenue and $6.1 million adjusted earnings, but jumped to ~60% in Q3 on a $72.0 million revenue and ~$41 million adjusted EBITDA in Q3. I believe higher adjusted EBITDA is sustainable because it was driven by the upgrade of the mining fleets from older Bitmain T21s to S21 XP Antminers . Economies of scale are likely to stay intact in the meantime, with factors like network difficulty and Bitcoin price not moving too much. For the purpose of my modeling for projected earnings, I'd, however, factor in volatility and go with a conservative ~50% adjusted EBITDA for the mining operations moving forward, which I believe the company can sustain considering the improved 16.8 J/Th average efficiency the S21 XP Antminers have brought to the mining fleet. Valuation is bound to shift from Cipher's current life as a Bitcoin miner when the HPC checks hit in H2. In the deals, management is guiding for an 80–85% NOI margin, which I believe is very well within range, as the AWS deal is a triple N, meaning the clients take care of the biggest three costs (power, cooling, and facility costs). For this modeling, I'll be treating NOI margin as EBITDA margin, which is safe enough considering low overhead and other operational levers in the HPC lease deal which, when accounted for, won't skew our EBITDA from NOI estimate materially. Segment Annual Revenue Projection ~ Adj. EBITDA Margin Annual EBITDA Contribution Bitcoin Mining $220 Million 50.0% (Conservative floor and sustainable with current mining economics) $110.0 Million HPC/AI Hosting $650 Million 85.0% (Guided NOI margin) $552.5 Million Total Pro Forma $870 Million 76.1% (Blended) $662.5 Million At a $6.94 billion market cap at present and $870M projected 2027 sales, CIFR trades at ~7.9x sales, meaning at current market cap, CIFR is trading around 7.9x projected sales. A ~7.9x forward sales multiple for a company with 75%+ blended EBITDA margins and contracted revenue from AWS and Google can be considered modest. Traditional data center providers like Equinix ( EQIX ) and Digital Realty Trust ( DLR ) typically trade in the low mid teens to sales, but they have much slower growth rates as they are well-established firms beyond the rapid growth phase. The case for CIFR is that it is combining high-margin HPC revenue with optionality in Bitcoin upside and potential for rapid growth, which are visible through the pipeline capacity and the AWS and Fluidstack deals themselves, which have clauses that allow expansion down the line. Using the current $6.78 billion EV and our blended EBITDA projection of $662.5 million from both segments, it implies an EV/EBITDA [fwd] of 10.2x (gotten from EV divided by projected EBITDA), and the valuation gets even more attractive. At 10.2x 2027 EBITDA, CIFR is being priced as if the HPC deals are still high-risk speculations. The market is ignoring the fact that the AWS and Fluidstack contracts are legally binding and the sites are already in build-out; the market is underpricing the near certainty of the coming cash flows. As the HPC revenues start to come in, if CIFR catches up to the Sales multiple of data center provider peers (moving from 8x to 10–12x), that would imply a ~25% upside for the rerating from current stock price. If CIFR catches up to the EBITDA multiple (moving from 10.2x to 20–30x), the stock would more than double. Risks The risk I worry about most at this stage is construction and energization slippage risk. As I have noted with Hut 8 and why I downgraded to a Hold because of longer-dated energization timelines, while peers are already locked in for HPC revenue just months away. The market punishes longer-dated timelines. Any hint that the August 2026 for AWS site launch and October for Fluidstack site launch is sliding into 2027 might trigger a sharp CIFR sell-off. Takeaway The market moved with momentum on the AWS deal news in November and is now underappreciating it in January. The gap between current prices around $17 and the top last November around $25 is the execution premium that will likely return as we get closer to that first lease payment in 2H this year. We can do as much rough math as we want, but unless the HPC lease payments don’t start hitting the top line in September/October, CIFR will likely trade as a momentum stock in the latter part of this year, to be driven by the headline top-line numbers from the HPC deals.",CIFR,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2026-01-26 13:45:50

When a market moves that much money that fast, the best edge you can give yourself isn’t speed, it’s a testing routine you can trust. That’s where a test-first Expert Advisor (EA) approach shines in 2026: backtest with real constraints, demo trade to validate execution, then scale up in calm, measured steps. A good example is TIOmarkets, which offers MetaTrader 5 (MT5) with built-in tools like strategy backtesting and support for creating trading bots, which can make it easier to test an EA inside the same platform you’ll use to place trades. If you’re exploring tools in that category, a practical starting point is getting familiar with what forex EA software looks like in the real world, including how it runs on platforms like MetaTrader. The foundation here comes from how regulators define retail forex protections and disclosures, plus current research on how to spot overfitting before it costs you real money. Backtest Like the Rules Still Apply A backtest feels persuasive when the curve looks clean, but a scalable backtest feels persuasive for a different reason: it respects the same guardrails you’ll face in a live US account. In retail forex, the most important guardrail is margin, because margin determines how much room your EA has to be “wrong” before the broker has to act. US retail forex margin is a rule. Under 17 CFR § 5.9, FCMs and RFEDs must collect a minimum security deposit for each retail forex transaction, and the registered futures association cannot set it lower than 2% of notional value for major currency pairs and 5% for all other currency pairs. The same section makes the consequence plain: if the customer’s security deposits aren’t sufficient, the firm must collect additional security deposits or liquidate positions. So if your backtest assumes infinite breathing room, it’s not really testing the strategy that will be traded live. Treat margin realism as a feature: you’re building a strategy that can survive contact with the actual rulebook, not just the historical chart. Now add the market’s current texture. The BIS notes that in 2022, FX trading shifted further away from multilateral platforms toward bilateral methods where trade information remains private, implying transparency may have decreased further. That doesn’t mean retail traders can’t execute well, but it does mean you should give your EA a backtest environment that includes imperfect fills and variable transaction costs, instead of assuming every order gets the midpoint. When your backtest matches margin mechanics and more realistic execution, your demo results tend to look less surprising, which is exactly what you want before you scale. If It’s Too Smooth, It’s Probably Optimized Once your backtest obeys real-world constraints, the next job is making sure it isn’t “trained” to the past in a way that won’t repeat. Overfitting is especially tempting with EAs because it’s so easy to run thousands of parameter combinations until something looks great, even if that greatness is mostly luck. A useful anchor here is academic work that treats overfitting as a real, testable risk rather than a vague worry. In a June 30, 2024 paper, “An Empirical Framework for Detecting Overfitting in Trading Strategies,” the authors propose a unified methodology that integrates cross-validation, stress testing, statistical testing, sensitivity analysis, and bootstrapping to detect parameter overfitting. That line-up matters because it’s not asking you to “believe” your EA; it’s asking you to challenge it from multiple angles until the strategy earns your confidence. Here’s a ladder you can apply: Cross-validate your backtest by splitting history into multiple time windows and requiring decent performance across them, not just in the best segment. Stress test assumptions that change when markets get jumpy, because the BIS links higher FX turnover with a higher-volatility environment in early 2022. Run sensitivity analysis and bootstrapping so small parameter tweaks don’t collapse results, and so performance isn’t hanging on one fragile configuration. The mindset shift is subtle but powerful: you’re no longer hunting for the “best” backtest, you’re looking for the most stable behavior. That’s a positive change because stability is what makes scaling feel like a decision you’re making, not a gamble you’re taking. Robustness is easier to maintain when your EA is simple enough that you can explain why it should work. That’s not about being anti-technology; it’s about being able to notice when the strategy’s edge disappears, and noticing early is a skill you can build. Demo Proof, Real Disclosures, Steady Increases After backtesting and robustness, scaling becomes much easier to frame as a process: validate behavior in demo, start small in live, then expand exposure when the strategy keeps meeting your rules. What makes this especially workable in the US is that regulators require certain disclosures that can help you evaluate counterparties and compare claims to documented facts. The CFTC’s retail forex final-rule fact sheet states that RFEDs and FCMs must disclose the number of non-discretionary retail forex accounts they maintain and the percentage of those accounts that were profitable for each of the four most recent quarters. That disclosure doesn’t tell you whether your specific EA will work, but it does nudge the entire ecosystem toward measurable truth, which supports the “receipts” idea behind test-first scaling. Broker resilience matters too, especially when your EA is capable of frequent trading. NFA Financial Requirements Section 11 states each Forex Dealer Member must maintain Adjusted Net Capital at or above the greatest of several amounts, including $20,000,000, and it adds a formula that includes 5% of certain customer liabilities exceeding $10,000,000. That capital framework isn’t something you plug into your EA, but it belongs in your due diligence because scaling is also about choosing stable plumbing, not just clever logic. It also helps to understand why regulators stay alert. The CFTC reported record monetary relief of over $17.1 billion for fiscal year 2024, including $2.6 billion in civil monetary penalties and $14.5 billion in disgorgement and restitution. The system is actively pushing toward accountability, which pairs nicely with your own approach of verifying performance before you commit more capital. When you put it all together, “demo then scale” becomes more than a slogan. It becomes a way to keep your confidence tethered to evidence: backtest realism, robustness checks, demo execution, and regulated disclosures that keep you grounded. Scale Isn’t Speed. It’s Repeatability. A test-first EA playbook for 2026 works because it treats scalable trading as a sequence: backtests that respect margin and liquidation mechanics, robustness checks that reduce overfitting risk, and a demo-to-live ramp backed by transparent disclosures. The BIS reminds us the FX market can be both massive and complex in how trading is executed, which is exactly why steady, evidence-led scaling is such a practical advantage. If you’re going to scale an EA, the goal isn’t to feel certain every day. It’s to build a process that stays clear-headed when conditions change.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2026-01-26 13:53:16

This strategic move represents a significant evolution in cryptocurrency investment products, introducing income generation strategies to the digital asset space for the first time at this scale. The filing follows the tremendous success of the firm’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), which accumulated billions in assets within months of its January 2024 launch. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Strategy Expands with Income Focus According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock submitted an S-1 registration statement for the Bitcoin Premium Income ETF. The proposed fund will employ a covered call strategy on Bitcoin holdings. This approach involves purchasing Bitcoin while simultaneously selling call options against those holdings. Consequently, the strategy generates premium income from option sales. The fund will register as a spot product under U.S. securities law, mirroring the structure of existing spot Bitcoin ETFs. Covered call strategies represent a well-established approach in traditional equity markets. However, their application to Bitcoin marks a notable innovation. The strategy typically provides two potential benefits for investors. First, it generates regular income through option premiums. Second, it offers some downside protection during market declines. Nevertheless, the strategy may limit upside participation during strong Bitcoin rallies. BlackRock previously registered an entity for this ETF in Delaware last September. The firm has not yet disclosed the ticker symbol or management fees. Industry analysts anticipate competitive fee structures similar to the firm’s existing IBIT product, which charges 0.25% annually. The filing demonstrates BlackRock’s continued commitment to cryptocurrency investment products despite regulatory uncertainties. Understanding Covered Call Strategies in Cryptocurrency Markets The covered call strategy represents a sophisticated financial engineering approach. Essentially, investors hold an underlying asset while selling call options against that position. Each call option gives the buyer the right to purchase the asset at a predetermined price within a specific timeframe. The option seller collects a premium for taking this obligation. In traditional markets, covered calls serve multiple purposes for different investor types: Income Generation: Option premiums provide regular cash flow Risk Management: Premiums offer partial downside protection Enhanced Returns: Strategy can outperform in sideways markets Volatility Capture: Benefits from time decay of options Bitcoin’s unique characteristics present both opportunities and challenges for covered call strategies. The cryptocurrency exhibits higher volatility than traditional assets, potentially generating larger option premiums. However, this same volatility increases assignment risk and requires sophisticated risk management protocols. Additionally, Bitcoin’s 24/7 trading schedule necessitates continuous monitoring unlike traditional markets. Expert Analysis: Market Implications and Regulatory Context Financial analysts view BlackRock’s filing as a significant development for several reasons. First, it represents product innovation beyond simple spot exposure. Second, it addresses investor demand for income-generating cryptocurrency products. Third, it demonstrates institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s market infrastructure maturity. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart commented, “This filing represents the natural evolution of cryptocurrency ETF products. Initially, investors sought simple exposure. Now, they demand sophisticated strategies. BlackRock’s move likely signals similar products from other asset managers.” The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency ETFs has evolved significantly since 2024. The SEC approved multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs following years of rejection. These products have attracted substantial institutional and retail investment. However, regulatory scrutiny remains intense, particularly regarding market manipulation concerns and custody arrangements. BlackRock’s filing occurs within this complex regulatory environment. The firm maintains extensive experience navigating SEC requirements, having launched hundreds of ETFs previously. Their established relationship with regulators may facilitate smoother approval processes compared to newer market entrants. Comparative Analysis: Income vs. Spot Bitcoin ETFs The proposed Bitcoin Premium Income ETF differs fundamentally from existing spot Bitcoin ETFs. Understanding these differences helps investors make informed decisions about product suitability for their portfolios. Feature Spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) Bitcoin Premium Income ETF Primary Objective Direct Bitcoin price exposure Income generation with Bitcoin exposure Strategy Hold Bitcoin directly Covered calls on Bitcoin holdings Return Profile Matches Bitcoin price movements Moderated returns with income component Risk Level High volatility exposure Moderate with income cushion Investor Profile Growth-focused, risk-tolerant Income-seeking, moderate risk tolerance This product differentiation addresses varying investor needs within cryptocurrency markets. Income-focused investors, particularly those nearing retirement, may prefer the premium income ETF’s regular distributions. Growth-oriented investors might favor direct spot exposure despite higher volatility. Financial advisors now have more tools for constructing diversified cryptocurrency allocations. Market Impact and Future Developments BlackRock’s filing signals several potential market developments. First, it may accelerate institutional adoption of Bitcoin investment strategies. Second, it could inspire similar products from competitors like Fidelity and Vanguard. Third, it might pave the way for more complex cryptocurrency derivatives products. The cryptocurrency options market has grown substantially since 2023. Daily trading volumes regularly exceed $1 billion across major exchanges. This liquidity enables efficient implementation of covered call strategies at scale. However, regulatory oversight of cryptocurrency derivatives remains fragmented across jurisdictions. Industry observers note potential challenges for the proposed ETF. Bitcoin’s volatility requires careful option strike price selection. Additionally, tax treatment of option premiums in cryptocurrency remains complex. The fund’s prospectus will need to address these considerations thoroughly for investor protection. Market timing also presents interesting considerations. Bitcoin has experienced significant price appreciation since spot ETF approvals. Some analysts question whether current market conditions favor income strategies over growth approaches. However, BlackRock’s long-term perspective suggests confidence in Bitcoin’s enduring market presence regardless of short-term price movements. Conclusion BlackRock’s Bitcoin Premium Income ETF filing represents a sophisticated evolution in cryptocurrency investment products. The covered call strategy introduces income generation to digital asset markets at institutional scale. This development addresses growing investor demand for diversified Bitcoin exposure beyond simple price appreciation. The filing demonstrates continued institutional confidence in cryptocurrency market infrastructure despite regulatory uncertainties. As the SEC reviews this application, market participants await further details about fees, ticker symbols, and implementation specifics. Ultimately, this Bitcoin ETF innovation expands accessible strategies for both retail and institutional investors seeking cryptocurrency exposure. FAQs Q1: What is a covered call strategy in simple terms? A covered call strategy involves owning an asset while selling someone else the right to buy that asset at a specific price. The seller collects a fee (premium) for this agreement, which generates income but may require selling the asset if its price rises significantly. Q2: How does this Bitcoin ETF differ from BlackRock’s existing IBIT product? The new Bitcoin Premium Income ETF focuses on generating regular income through options trading, while IBIT provides direct exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without income generation. The income ETF may have more moderate returns during strong Bitcoin rallies. Q3: When might the SEC approve this Bitcoin ETF? The SEC typically takes several months to review ETF applications. Given BlackRock’s established regulatory relationships and the precedent of approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, analysts suggest potential approval within 3-6 months, though timelines remain uncertain. Q4: What are the main risks of this Bitcoin income strategy? Primary risks include limited upside participation during Bitcoin price surges, Bitcoin’s inherent volatility affecting option pricing, regulatory changes impacting cryptocurrency derivatives, and potential tax complexities regarding option premium income. Q5: Who is the target investor for this Bitcoin income ETF? The fund targets income-seeking investors comfortable with moderate cryptocurrency risk, including retirees seeking portfolio diversification, institutional investors adding alternative income streams, and financial advisors constructing balanced cryptocurrency allocations for clients.

The awards include Best Exchange for Futures Trading 2025 by crypto.ru, Best Emerging Exchange 2025 by FinanceFeeds, Breakthrough Platform of the Year at Cripto Latin Fest, and Best Growing Exchange by Cexfinder. Together, these recognitions come from Europe, Latin America, and global crypto media, showing feedback from both professional trading communities and industry observers. Bitunix Expands Futures Trading Capabilities in 2025 Throughout 2025, Bitunix has continued to focus on building a futures trading environment that supports active and professional traders. The platform introduced improvements to chart trading tools, order execution systems, and risk management features. Most notable was the launch of Coin-M perpetual futures through 2025, allowing traders to use the underlying asset for margin and settlement instead of USDT. This follows the launch of USDT-M futures in early 2024 and additional product releases that expanded Bitunix’s derivatives offering throughout 2025. Bitunix’s futures trading capabilities played a key role in the exchange’s 2025 industry recognition. According to the team, features such as perpetual contracts, expanding leverage of up to 200x on selected pairs, flexible margin modes, hedge mode, and advanced-candlestick charting with the possibility of opening up to 16 windows at once helped strengthen trading performance and execution quality, contributing to the platform’s growing adoption by active traders. “Our focus has been on improving trading performance, security, and transparency while building tools that support real trading needs,” said Steven Gu, Chief Strategy Officer at Bitunix. “The recognition we received this year reflects the work of our teams and the feedback from the trading community.” Bitunix Strengthens Regional Presence Across CIS and LATAM Bitunix’s recognition in the CIS by crypto.ru as the Best Futures Trading Platform and Breakthrough Platform of the Year at Cripto Latin Fest reflects the exchange’s focus on building strong regional connections alongside its global expansion strategy. During the year, the Bitunix team participated in more than 10 major international industry events, including Web3 Amsterdam, Paris Blockchain Week, Token2049 Dubai and Singapore, Wealth Expo Argentina, Cripto Latin Fest, and LABITCONF, allowing the company to connect with regional communities and support its international expansion efforts. By participating in industry events, working with local partners, and engaging directly with regional trading communities, Bitunix increased brand visibility and user adoption in these markets, which, according to the team, contributed to its industry recognition and awards in both regions. Furthermore, the exchange has also confirmed its participation in Blockchain Forum 2026 in Moscow, continuing its involvement in regional crypto industry events. Security and Transparency Initiatives Rolled Out in 2025 The team also cited security and transparency initiatives as contributing factors to Bitunix’s industry recognition. By strengthening its infrastructure through partnerships with Fireblocks and Elliptic, completing independent security audits with Hacken, Certified, and Salus, and introducing Proof of Reserves to allow users to verify asset backing, the platform improved trust and operational reliability. In addition, the launch of the Bitunix Care Fund, a 30 million USDC protection reserve designed to support users in case of unexpected technical or system incidents, further demonstrated the exchange’s commitment to user protection. This factor contributed to its positive market perception and award recognition. Trading Volume Growth Reflects Platform Adoption According to the latest CoinGlass Annual Report , Bitunix ranked 7th worldwide in trading volume in 2025, reflecting the platform’s growing adoption among traders and contributing to its industry recognition. The exchange also rose in position on some of the most reputable ranking platforms in the crypto industry, such as CoinMarketCap and Coingecko, reflecting its growing influence in both futures and spot markets throughout 2025.

The company’s strategic purchase of 40,302 ETH represents one of the most significant single-week institutional accumulations in recent cryptocurrency history, bringing Bitmain’s total Ethereum holdings to an unprecedented 4,243,338 ETH. This development, confirmed on March 15, 2025, from Bitmain’s Hong Kong headquarters, provides crucial insights into evolving institutional strategies within the rapidly maturing digital asset ecosystem. Bitmain’s Ethereum Purchase: Analyzing the $110 Million Strategic Move Bitmain’s recent transaction represents more than a simple asset acquisition. The company executed this purchase through multiple exchanges and over-the-counter desks to minimize market impact. Consequently, the accumulation occurred gradually across five business days. Market analysts immediately noted the timing coincided with a minor ETH price correction, suggesting sophisticated entry strategy. Furthermore, this purchase increases Bitmain’s Ethereum portfolio by approximately 1% in a single week. The transaction’s scale immediately drew attention from institutional investors worldwide. For context, $110 million exceeds the market capitalization of numerous publicly traded companies. Additionally, this purchase represents nearly 0.03% of Ethereum’s total circulating supply. Bitmain’s accumulation strategy demonstrates calculated precision rather than speculative impulse. The company’s treasury management team reportedly planned this acquisition for several months, waiting for optimal market conditions. Institutional Cryptocurrency Investment Trends in 2025 Bitmain’s move reflects broader institutional trends reshaping cryptocurrency markets. Traditional financial institutions increasingly allocate portions of their treasury reserves to digital assets. Simultaneously, corporate balance sheets now commonly feature Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings. This institutional adoption creates new market dynamics fundamentally different from previous retail-driven cycles. The table below illustrates recent comparable institutional Ethereum acquisitions: Institution Date ETH Purchased Approximate Value Bitmain Technologies March 2025 40,302 ETH $110 million MicroStrategy February 2025 15,000 ETH $41 million Tesla Treasury January 2025 8,500 ETH $23 million Square Financial December 2024 6,000 ETH $16 million Several key factors drive this institutional accumulation trend. First, Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake consensus significantly reduced environmental concerns. Second, regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions provides greater confidence for corporate treasuries. Third, Ethereum’s robust developer ecosystem continues expanding real-world utility. Finally, institutional custody solutions now offer enterprise-grade security previously unavailable. Expert Analysis: Decoding Bitmain’s Treasury Strategy Financial analysts specializing in cryptocurrency treasury management identify multiple strategic considerations behind Bitmain’s move. The company traditionally focused on Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturing and mining operations. However, its expanding Ethereum position signals strategic diversification beyond core business lines. This diversification potentially hedges against Bitcoin-specific market volatility. Bitmain’s existing Ethereum holdings of 4.24 million ETH represent one of the largest corporate positions globally. To illustrate, this holding exceeds the Ethereum treasuries of many blockchain foundations. The company’s average acquisition cost remains undisclosed but analysts estimate significant unrealized gains. Bitmain’s treasury strategy appears focused on long-term value preservation rather than short-term trading profits. The purchase timing suggests confidence in Ethereum’s upcoming network upgrades. Specifically, the forthcoming “Electra” hard fork promises enhanced scalability and reduced transaction costs. Additionally, Ethereum’s staking yield currently exceeds traditional fixed-income returns. Therefore, Bitmain potentially views Ethereum as both growth asset and yield-generating treasury instrument. Market Impact and Ethereum Price Dynamics Bitmain’s announcement immediately influenced Ethereum market dynamics. The news broke during Asian trading hours, triggering a 3.2% price increase within ninety minutes. Moreover, trading volume spiked 40% above thirty-day averages. Market makers adjusted order books anticipating follow-on institutional interest. Derivatives markets showed increased call option activity at higher strike prices. The purchase’s market impact extends beyond immediate price action. First, it reduces available ETH supply on exchanges, increasing scarcity. Second, it signals sophisticated investor confidence to retail participants. Third, it may encourage similar accumulations by competing mining firms. Finally, it provides validation for Ethereum’s fundamental value proposition. Historical analysis reveals similar large purchases preceded sustained bullish periods. For example, MicroStrategy’s initial Bitcoin acquisitions in 2020 preceded institutional adoption waves. Similarly, Bitmain’s accumulation could signal upcoming institutional Ethereum adoption acceleration. Market structure analysis suggests reduced selling pressure from such long-term holders. Bitmain’s Evolving Business Model and Blockchain Integration Bitmain’s Ethereum accumulation aligns with broader business diversification. The company recently announced Ethereum mining software optimizations. Additionally, Bitmain expanded its staking infrastructure services. This vertical integration creates synergistic value across business segments. The company’s mining operations generate fiat revenue convertible to digital assets. Bitmain’s technological expertise provides unique advantages in cryptocurrency accumulation. The company develops proprietary trading algorithms minimizing market impact. Furthermore, Bitmain maintains direct exchange relationships securing favorable execution terms. These operational efficiencies create acquisition advantages unavailable to traditional institutions. The company’s Hong Kong headquarters provides strategic regulatory positioning. Hong Kong’s progressive cryptocurrency regulations facilitate institutional-scale transactions. Meanwhile, Bitmain’s manufacturing operations span multiple jurisdictions with favorable energy costs. This global footprint enables sophisticated treasury management across regulatory environments. Regulatory Considerations and Compliance Framework Bitmain’s substantial Ethereum holdings operate within evolving regulatory frameworks. The company maintains rigorous compliance protocols exceeding jurisdictional requirements. All acquisitions undergo anti-money laundering verification. Additionally, transaction reporting follows both Hong Kong and international standards. Institutional cryptocurrency holdings face increasing regulatory scrutiny globally. The Financial Action Task Force recently updated travel rule requirements. Meanwhile, accounting standards continue evolving for digital asset valuation. Bitmain’s transparent disclosure sets positive industry precedent. The company reportedly engages regulators proactively regarding treasury management practices. Several key compliance considerations shape institutional cryptocurrency strategies: Custody Solutions: Enterprise-grade custody with insurance coverage Accounting Standards: Proper classification as intangible assets Tax Implications: Clear documentation for capital gains calculations Disclosure Requirements: Transparent reporting to stakeholders Security Protocols: Multi-signature wallets and geographic distribution Bitmain’s approach addresses each consideration comprehensively. The company utilizes multiple custody providers minimizing counterparty risk. Additionally, external auditors verify holdings quarterly. This rigorous framework enables scale impossible for less sophisticated investors. Conclusion Bitmain’s $110 million Ethereum purchase represents a watershed moment for institutional cryptocurrency adoption. The strategic accumulation demonstrates sophisticated treasury management extending beyond speculative positioning. Furthermore, it validates Ethereum’s fundamental value proposition for corporate balance sheets. This transaction signals accelerating institutional confidence in blockchain infrastructure assets. Bitmain’s expanding Ethereum holdings reflect broader trends reshaping global finance. The company’s transparent disclosure provides valuable insights for market participants. Ultimately, such institutional movements increasingly determine cryptocurrency market structure and valuation paradigms. FAQs Q1: How does Bitmain’s Ethereum purchase affect ordinary investors? Bitmain’s accumulation signals institutional confidence potentially stabilizing prices long-term. However, large purchases temporarily reduce exchange liquidity. Retail investors should consider dollar-cost averaging rather than timing markets. Q2: What percentage of Ethereum’s supply does Bitmain now control? Bitmain’s 4.24 million ETH represents approximately 0.35% of Ethereum’s circulating supply. While significant, this percentage doesn’t constitute controlling interest or network influence. Q3: Does Bitmain stake its Ethereum holdings? While unconfirmed, analysts believe Bitmain stakes portions of its holdings. Enterprise staking solutions now offer secure yield generation. Staking would align with Bitmain’s infrastructure business model. Q4: How do Bitmain’s Ethereum holdings compare to its Bitcoin reserves? Bitmain remains predominantly Bitcoin-focused but increasingly diversifies. The company’s Bitcoin holdings likely exceed Ethereum values. However, exact Bitcoin treasury figures remain undisclosed. Q5: Could Bitmain’s purchase trigger regulatory concerns about market manipulation? Properly disclosed institutional accumulation differs from manipulative trading. Bitmain spread purchases across multiple days minimizing price impact. Regulatory frameworks increasingly distinguish between strategic accumulation and manipulation.

Many analysts have noted that GHOST could be the best crypto to buy now, as capital has started to rotate from $PENGUIN into $GHOST. This shift highlights renewed interest in privacy-focused infrastructure on Solana. GHOST has been live for several months, during which the Solana-based privacy project has continued to build and expand its ecosystem. GhostWareOS offers multiple forms of utility, all centered on delivering practical privacy tools rather than single-purpose features. These utilities are designed to address transparency limitations that currently exist on the Solana blockchain. Earlier this year the $GHOST token saw its market capitalization fall to around $2 million, reflecting broader market weakness and reduced speculative interest. In recent days, however, GHOST has rallied by more than 300%, with its market cap now sitting at approximately $7 million. Several new features are expected to be rolled out by the GhostWareOS team in the near term, adding further functionality to the protocol. GHOST Price Chart: 300% Surge Before getting into some of the utility driving the long-term value of GHOST, it is worth taking a look at some technical analysis. At first glance, the chart would bring confidence to anyone who picked up the dip on $GHOST earlier in January 2026. Price action has clearly shifted from a prolonged consolidation phase into a sharp upside breakout. From a technical perspective, GHOST has reclaimed its short and mid-term moving averages, with price holding firmly above them during the recent push higher. Momentum indicators such as RSI and short-term moving averages have expanded into bullish territory without immediately showing signs of exhaustion. This suggests strength behind the move rather than a brief relief rally. Looking at key levels, the $8 million market cap zone is shaping up as an important area of potential support following the recent breakout. Holding this level could provide a base for further upside, with a sustained move above it opening a clearer path toward a test of the $10 million threshold. Prior consolidation areas below may now act as secondary support on any pullbacks. It is also notable that GHOST continues to trade well below its all-time high market capitalization of roughly $27 million. This gap has given many dip buyers confidence that there is still meaningful upside potential if momentum continues and interest remains strong. Importantly, this move may not be purely technical, as several recent announcements from the GhostWareOS team have also contributed to renewed interest. GHOST price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Could GHOST Dominate the 2026 Privacy Narrative? A couple of announcements from the team, combined with on-chain analysis from third parties, appear to be the primary drivers of the GHOST rally. Together, these factors have shifted sentiment back toward privacy-focused infrastructure on Solana. This has helped GHOST re-enter broader market discussions around the 2026 privacy narrative. When GHOST’s price moved below the $4 million market cap range, some traders exited their positions. With small-cap tokens, a single large red candle is often interpreted as a sign that a team may disengage or slow development. Recent announcements, however, show that this has not been the case with GhostWareOS. The team confirmed via its official X account that following the successful launch of GhostPay, work is now underway on GhostSwap. GhostSwap is designed to introduce private, unlinkable swaps, addressing a key transparency gap in on-chain trading. This matters because it expands GhostWareOS beyond payments into core DeFi infrastructure. On-chain data shared by Lookonchain on X highlighted that a Nietzschean Penguin ($PENGUIN) whale rotated out of their position and moved over $4.5k into GHOST. That wallet is now holding approximately 1 million GHOST tokens. This has drawn attention from smaller traders monitoring whale behavior, especially given that $PENGUIN has been one of the hottest memecoins so far in 2026. The GhostSwap announcement, combined with visible whale rotation from $PENGUIN, has generated significant interest in GHOST. Some traders are now speculating that profits from leading Solana memes could continue flowing into the GhostWareOS ecosystem. Lookonchain found that a $PENGUIN whale had rotated profits into GHOST. Source: X Final Thoughts on the Best Crypto to Buy Now Privacy was a major narrative in 2025, with XMR and ZEC experiencing sharp price rallies. Interest now appears to be returning to privacy on the Solana network, where the GhostWareOS team has aligned GHOST with this theme through ongoing releases such as GhostPay and GhostSwap. In addition, rotation from $PENGUIN traders has strengthened GHOST’s case as a potential best crypto to buy now. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

57479641,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=902629,1769436239,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57479641.jpeg,Security alert raised as Chrome security support ends for old iPhones and Macs,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/apple-iphone-mac-users-drop-chrome/,"Apple and Google have both issued warnings to millions of iPhone and Mac users, saying they could be exposed to security risks for using the Chrome web browser. The alerts center on operating system compatibility and recently discovered vulnerabilities that affected Apple’s software ecosystem. According to Apple, users of older Mac computers, iPhones, and iPads, and those running outdated operating systems, are at risk of being hacked. The warnings follow weeks of security advisories and software update notices on Apple’s hardware lineup and Google’s Chrome browser support policies. Both companies are urging users to update their devices to the latest software to avoid exposure to cyberattacks, including sophisticated spyware. Browser warnings and the end of Chrome support for old iOS devices Apple has been messaging iOS users about browser privacy and security, telling them that Safari is a safer option than Google Chrome on their devices. In a user-facing privacy message, Apple stated, “Unlike Chrome, Safari truly helps protect your privacy.” At the same time, Google has confirmed that millions of Mac users will soon stop receiving updates to its native browser. The change applies to devices running macOS 12 (Monterey). Google announced that Chrome 150 will be the final version compatible with that operating system, since Apple had already stopped supporting Monterey in mid-2024. “Chrome 150 is the last version of Chrome that will support macOS 12 (Monterey). Chrome 151 (tentatively scheduled for release on July 28, 2026) is the first version of Chrome that requires macOS 13 Ventura or later. You’ll need to ensure your device is running macOS 13 or later to continue receiving future Chrome releases,” the smartphone operating system developer said. Those who cannot upgrade their Mac to macOS Ventura or newer will be left on an unsupported browser version. “Older versions of Chrome will continue to work, but there will be no further updates released for users on this operating system,” the company continued, also adding that only those who upgrade to newer macOS versions will “continue to receive the latest security updates and Chrome features.” Security researchers warn that running an unpatched browser significantly raises an internet user’s exposure to hackers. Web browsers are targets for attackers because they process untrusted content from the Internet daily. Almost two weeks ago, Google had to rush out updates after a vulnerability was disclosed that could expose applications to attack. Soon after, on January 13, Google Chrome’s Srinivas Sista issued a notice revealing that 10 new vulnerabilities had been identified. “The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 144 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac, and Linux,” Sista said. However, the statement also noted that the update would “roll out over the coming days/weeks.” Apple devices hit by WebKit flaws Apple has also been working to address security weaknesses in its own software. Over recent weeks, the company sent alerts about a flaw that could impact half of all iPhone users if their devices are not updated . Apple disclosed two vulnerabilities in WebKit, the browser engine that powers Safari and all browsers on iOS. The iPhone manufacturer found flaws in several malicious websites that, when visited, could trick devices into executing harmful code without the user realizing. Once compromised, attackers could take control of the device, steal login credentials, or access financial information. The vulnerabilities were discovered and reported by Apple Security Engineering and Architecture and Google’s Threat Analysis Group. Apple credited Google’s team with identifying CVE-2025-43529. Third-party browsers such as Chrome, Edge, and Firefox on Apple mobile devices were also affected at the engine level. Apple released patches for the vulnerability on several versions, including iOS 26.2 and iPadOS 26.2 for newer iPhones and iPads, iOS 18.7.3 and iPadOS 18.7.3 for slightly older supported models. On the Mac side, fixes were included in macOS Tahoe 26.2; on Apple TV, in tvOS 26.2; on Apple Watch, in watchOS 26.2; and on the Vision Pro headset, in visionOS 26.2. Don’t just read crypto news.

Pundit Says Prepare Now,https://timestabloid.com/the-trump-xrp-playbook-has-officially-begun-pundit-says-prepare-now/,"Financial markets have entered another period where political messaging drives price action faster than fundamentals can react. Sudden volatility has returned across risk assets, and cryptocurrencies have once again found themselves reacting to geopolitical headlines rather than internal catalysts. For seasoned market participants, this environment feels familiar and often signals the start of a broader macro-driven adjustment phase. That backdrop shaped recent commentary from Levi Rietveld, who shared a video on X addressing the abrupt downturn across the crypto market. His remarks followed a sharp move lower in Bitcoin and XRP, prompting renewed discussion about how U.S. trade policy rhetoric continues to influence digital asset prices. The Trump XRP Playbook Has Officially Begun! (Please Prepare Now) pic.twitter.com/IoYSlj9yfz — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) January 25, 2026 Geopolitical Pressure Triggers Market Sell-Off Rietveld attributed the sudden correction to renewed tariff-related tensions involving U.S. President Donald Trump and Canada. He explained that fresh tariff threats, combined with warnings over Canada’s trade relations with China, reignited geopolitical uncertainty. “Bitcoin just fell below 88,000, and XRP also saw a very sharp correction,” Rietveld said, describing the move as rapid and aggressive. He emphasized that the size and speed of the red candles pointed to institutional selling rather than retail-driven panic. According to his analysis, large market participants reduced exposure as geopolitical risk escalated. XRP Follows Bitcoin’s Lead As Bitcoin moved lower, XRP quickly reflected the shift in sentiment. Rietveld noted that XRP traded down to around $1.85 during the sell-off, reinforcing its sensitivity to macro-driven moves. “Bitcoin leads the market, and we’re seeing this impact on XRP as well,” he said, highlighting the dominant role Bitcoin continues to play in broader crypto price discovery. This correlation aligns with historical behavior, where Bitcoin absorbs initial shocks before altcoins follow through with amplified volatility. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The “Trump Playbook” in Motion Rietveld framed the episode as part of a recurring political and market cycle. “The political theater is starting to come into effect much like it has many times previously,” he explained. He described a pattern in which tariff threats raise tensions, trigger market pullbacks, and eventually push all sides toward negotiation. He added, “This is essentially what happens every single time,” suggesting that markets often overreact during the uncertainty phase before stabilizing once diplomatic engagement begins. What Investors Are Watching Next Despite the short-term pressure, XRP’s broader fundamentals remain intact. The asset now operates in a cleaner regulatory environment following the resolution of Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. However, macro events continue to exert outsized influence during periods of heightened geopolitical risk. Rietveld’s commentary does not frame the move as structural damage but as part of a familiar macro-driven sequence. As geopolitical signals evolve, traders continue to watch for signs of de-escalation, which historically mark the transition from volatility to recovery.

This initiative, launched globally in February 2025, directly targets both spot and derivatives traders, offering them a lucrative opportunity to engage with specific trading pairs. Consequently, this event highlights the ongoing trend of DEX platforms using incentivized programs to drive user adoption and liquidity. DEX Aster Trading Competition Details and Structure The Aster exchange has meticulously structured two distinct contests. Firstly, the CMC20/USDT spot trading competition commenced recently and will conclude at 2:00 p.m. UTC on February 25, 2025. This event boasts a generous $50,000 reward pool, distributed entirely in the platform’s native ASTER tokens. Importantly, rewards are not based solely on profit and loss. Instead, the distribution mechanism cleverly considers two key metrics: the total trading fees generated by participants and the duration they hold their positions. This structure encourages sustained engagement rather than purely speculative, short-term trading. Secondly, the platform is concurrently running a RIVER/USDT perpetual futures trading competition. This contest features a $25,000 prize pool and has an earlier deadline, ending at 12:00 p.m. UTC on February 1, 2025. To qualify, participants must meet a minimum trading volume threshold. Rewards are then tiered according to the holding duration of perpetual futures contracts, promoting a more strategic approach to derivatives trading. These competitions represent a calculated effort by Aster to deepen liquidity for these specific asset pairs while rewarding its most active community members. The Strategic Context of Decentralized Exchange Incentives Incentivized trading competitions are not a novel concept in cryptocurrency. However, they have become a cornerstone strategy for decentralized exchanges, especially those operating on automated market maker (AMM) models. Unlike centralized exchanges (CEXs) that can rely on order book depth, DEXs like Aster fundamentally depend on liquidity provided by users. Therefore, events with substantial prize pools serve a dual purpose: they attract new users and motivate existing liquidity providers to increase their stakes. For instance, similar programs have historically led to measurable spikes in total value locked (TVL) and daily trading volume on competing platforms. Furthermore, the choice of trading pairs is highly strategic. The CMC20 token, likely an index or basket asset, and RIVER, potentially a newer or niche asset, indicate Aster’s intent to boost visibility and trading activity for specific projects within its ecosystem. By allocating rewards in ASTER tokens, the exchange also strategically increases the utility and circulation of its native governance and fee token, potentially enhancing its value accrual mechanisms. This aligns with broader DeFi trends where tokenomics and community incentives are deeply intertwined. Expert Analysis on Market Impact and Participant Strategy Industry analysts often view such competitions as effective short-term catalysts. “Well-structured trading contests can significantly compress the user acquisition timeline for a DEX,” notes a report from a leading blockchain analytics firm. “They create a focused surge of activity that, if sustained, can lead to improved market depth and tighter spreads.” For participants, the key is understanding the specific reward mechanics. The emphasis on fee generation and holding time, rather than just PnL, discourages reckless trading. Successful participants will likely employ strategies that balance frequent, fee-generating trades with disciplined position management to maximize their score across both metrics. From a regulatory and risk perspective, Aster and participants must navigate these events carefully. The competitions inherently encourage increased trading activity, which carries standard market risks. Participants should conduct their own research (DYOR) on the involved tokens and fully understand the mechanics of perpetual futures contracts, which can involve leverage and funding rates. The exchange, for its part, must ensure transparent, real-time leaderboards and a flawless smart contract execution for reward distribution to maintain trust within its community. Conclusion The DEX Aster trading competition, with its combined $75,000 prize pool, represents a targeted and substantial investment in community growth and liquidity mining. By segmenting the event into spot and futures categories, Aster effectively engages different trader profiles within the DeFi space. Ultimately, the success of this initiative will be measured by sustained engagement metrics beyond the competition period, including TVL retention and organic trading volume growth. For the decentralized finance sector in 2025, such incentivized programs continue to be a vital tool for platforms competing in an increasingly crowded marketplace. FAQs Q1: What are the key dates for the Aster DEX trading competitions? The CMC20/USDT spot trading competition ends at 2:00 p.m. UTC on February 25, 2025. The RIVER/USDT perpetual futures competition concludes earlier, at 12:00 p.m. UTC on February 1, 2025. Q2: How are the rewards distributed in the CMC20 competition? Rewards from the $50,000 pool are distributed in ASTER tokens based on a combination of the total trading fees a participant generates and their cumulative holding time for the CMC20 token during the event. Q3: What is required to enter the RIVER perpetual futures competition? Participants must meet a minimum trading volume requirement in the RIVER/USDT perpetual futures market. Rewards from the $25,000 pool are then tiered based on the duration positions are held. Q4: Why do decentralized exchanges like Aster host trading competitions? DEXs host these events primarily to incentivize liquidity provision, increase trading volume for specific assets, attract new users, and enhance the utility of their native governance tokens like ASTER. Q5: What should a trader consider before joining such a competition? Traders should understand the specific reward mechanics, assess the risks of the involved tokens (CMC20, RIVER, USDT) and derivatives products, and ensure they are comfortable with the trading strategies required to optimize for fee generation and holding time.

In 2028, XLM will range between $0.675033 and $0.801602, with an average price of $0.738317. The token could reach as high as $1.65 in 2032. Stellar (XLM) is a decentralized cryptocurrency and payment protocol launched in July 2014 by Jed McCaleb and Joyce Kim. Developed by the non-profit Stellar Development Foundation, it aims to facilitate fast, low-cost cross-border transactions. Stellar operates on its blockchain, using the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) to validate transactions, which enhances security and efficiency. One of Stellar’s key features is its ability to enable currency exchange between different fiat and digital assets. The network charges a minimal transaction fee of 0.00001 XLM, making it an attractive option for users seeking affordable transaction solutions for real world assets with low transaction costs. Stellar is particularly focused on financial inclusion, targeting unbanked populations in developing regions by providing access to essential financial services without traditional banking systems and as an alternative to traditional money. XLM, the native cryptocurrency of the Stellar network, is used for transaction fees and as a bridge currency in cross-asset transactions. Initially, there were 100 billion XLM, but in 2019, the Stellar Development Foundation burned approximately half of the total supply to enhance its value and utility. Today, around 30.6 billion XLM are in circulation, with the network gaining traction for its real-world applications in remittances and asset transfers due to its ongoing project developments. Is XLM a good investment? Will it go up? Is Stellar Lumens a buy or sell? Where will it be in 5 years? We answer these questions and more in our Stellar Price Prediction.

Concurrently, the cryptocurrency gained 2.48 percent in value during the day. Technical indicators give bearish signals, but the price charts continue to give a bullish verdict for the day. Further upside might be observed soon, as the buyers continue to advance. Is Stellar a good investment? Stellar (XLM) has potential as a long-term investment due to its focus on facilitating fast, low-cost international payments and its growing utility. While past performance shows significant volatility, XLM has outperformed many top cryptocurrencies. With the upcoming launch of smart contracts via Soroban, Stellar’s utility is set to expand massively in 2026. However, the coin’s price is closely tied to its adoption, and competition from other cryptocurrencies poses risks. Ultimately, Stellar’s viability as an investment depends on your risk tolerance and belief in its future growth potential, so your own research or professional advice is suggested. Why is XLM up? Stellar Lumens (XLM) has struggled to gain traction due to its high circulating supply, which limits price growth potential. Additionally, its price movements often lag behind the broader cryptocurrency market, and ongoing operational sales by the Stellar Development Foundation contribute to downward pressure; however, the token’s price has increased today. Will XLM reach $1? Predictions for Stellar Lumens (XLM) suggest it is likely to reach $1 in the near future. Most forecasts estimate prices between $0.885981 and $1.01 by 2029, indicating significant gains for the coin, making it a good option to buy Stellar tokens. Will XLM reach $3? XLM is not expected to reach $3 by 2032. During this time, it is expected to achieve a maximum price of $1.65, which is less than $3 but still makes it a good decision to buy XLM coins; however, this is not investment advice. Will XLM reach $10? Current predictions suggest that Stellar Lumens (XLM) is unlikely to reach $10 in the near future. Most forecasts estimate its price will remain below $3 through 2032, with some projections suggesting a maximum of around $4.05. How much will stellar lumens be worth in 2030? Stellar (XLM) is expected to trade anywhere from $1.10 to $1.22 in 2030. How safe is XLM? Stellar (XLM) is a relatively safe cryptocurrency with a strong foundation, regular protocol updates, and partnerships with major entities. However, the crypto market is unpredictable, and potential investors should be cautious due to possible regulation changes. Does Stellar Lumens have a future? Stellar Lumens (XLM) shows potential for a positive long-term future due to its innovative blockchain technology and strategic partnerships, particularly in cross-border payments.

XLM historical price sentiment XLM price history Stellar (XLM) was launched in April 2015, starting with a price of approximately $0.00279. The cryptocurrency experienced a challenging year, closing at around $0.00175, marking it as one of its worst years. In 2016, XLM’s price further declined to an average of $0.00200, with a maximum price of $0.00338. The following year, 2017, was a turning point, as Stellar surged significantly, reaching an average price of $0.0335 and peaking at $0.3904, as per historical data of financial markets. The bullish momentum continued into 2018, where XLM hit its all-time high of $0.9381 in January. However, the price fell sharply throughout the year, closing at approximately $0.1103. In the subsequent years, XLM’s price fluctuated, with notable lows in 2019 around $0.0450 and a recovery in 2021, where it reached $0.7930. In July 2023, Stellar’s price jumped to $0.159, reflecting its volatility and potential for growth in the cryptocurrency market. In March 2024, Stellar flashed at $0.14 once again before a correction. In November the same year, it jumped high to $0.515 in a positive trend, but closed the year near the $0.31 level. Stellar’s peak price in January 2025 was $0.48, but it decreased to $0.29 in February. In July, Stellar turned bullish and broke above numerous resistance levels, reaching $0.521. In August 2025, XLM was trending near $0.440, and in September, it saw a lower high of $0.415, and in late October, it came down to $0.298. At the end of December 2025, XLM was trending near $0.214 with low bullish signals. XLM kickstarted 2026 with strong bullish support, jumping to $0.252 in a few days; however, its price has retreated to $0.210 as current sentiment is mostly bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XLM|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-26 14:18:57

Following the retrace, several crypto assets are back in undervalued territory. Fresh data suggest that Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) are among the altcoins that are more undervalued than Bitcoin. XRP Ahead of Bitcoin on Value Opportunity According to the latest findings by Santiment, a coin’s 30-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) can help gauge risk when opening or adding to a position. Lower readings indicate reduced risk. Hence, a negative 30-day MVRV means average traders are currently down money, which creates an opportunity to enter while profits remain below the typical “zero-sum game” level. Santiment added that the more negative the percentage, the safer it is to buy. The lower a coin’s 30-day MVRV is, the less risk there is in opening or adding on to your position. A coin having a negative percentage means average traders you’re competing with are down money, and there is an opportunity to enter while profits are below the normal… pic.twitter.com/YH8y4IzkWc — Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 26, 2026 On the other hand, a positive 30-day MVRV means that average traders are up money, which increases the risk of entering while profits are above normal levels, with higher positive values described as more dangerous. In the latest data shared, Santiment listed XRP at -5.7%, which classified it as undervalued and more undervalued than Bitcoin, which was shown at -3.7% and labeled mildly undervalued. Besides, several top altcoins were also flagged as undervalued in Santiment’s 30-day MVRV snapshot. For instance, Chainlink (LINK) posted the most negative reading at -9.5%, followed by Cardano (ADA) at -7.9% and Ethereum (ETH) at -7.6%. Reaccumulation Phase XRP sank nearly 4% over the past seven days after falling below $2. It briefly retested the $1.81 level before a modest rebound to $1.89 on Monday. Despite the short-term market weakness, certain market watchers say that the bigger picture remains intact. Crypto analyst ChartNerd, for one, pointed to a longer-term technical setup for XRP. They noted that after an explosive breakout in December 2024, the crypto asset has spent the past year retesting its prior seven-year resistance trendline. The analyst described the move as a prolonged “reaccumulation” phase and said a similar formation unfolded in 2017 before XRP saw major upside. ChartNerd added that if the retest holds, it would support a continuation of the trend.

The deal comes with a $1.3 billion loan and $277 million in federal support. It’s a major bet from Donald Trump’s administration, which is pushing hard to kick China out of the rare earth supply game and bring that control back home. Commerce will get 16.1 million shares of common stock and 17.6 million warrants, based on a new filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Depending on whether those warrants are exercised, the U.S. government’s stake in the company could land between 8% and 16%. Traders didn’t wait. The stock jumped more than 20% premarket as soon as the announcement hit. On top of the public funds, USA Rare Earth also pulled in $1.5 billion from private investors. Trump funds Round Top and magnet factory in supply chain push The new capital will support USA Rare Earth’s plans to build a magnet plant in Stillwater, Oklahoma, and develop a rare earth mine in Texas known as Round Top. Both projects are considered key to breaking dependence on Chinese supply lines . The Trump administration has been lining up big checks to make it happen. “USA Rare Earth’s heavy critical minerals project is essential to restoring U.S. critical mineral independence,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a statement. “This investment ensures our supply chains are resilient and no longer reliant on foreign nations.” This isn’t the first time Trump’s team has used equity to get leverage. Last year, the government struck a deal with MP Materials , which included a price floor, equity stake, and offtake agreement. The feds also grabbed pieces of Lithium Americas and Trilogy Metals. Every move has the same goal: stop the U.S. from having to rely on China’s grip on minerals needed for things like semiconductors, EVs, defense tech, and robotics. U.S. eyes Greenland rare earths as China’s control faces pushback China still controls most of the rare earth supply chain, and that power showed up last year when Beijing tried to block exports during trade fights with Trump. But Trump isn’t just targeting China’s mainland holdings. His administration is now circling Greenland, home to the world’s eighth-largest rare earth reserves at 1.5 million metric tons, based on 2024 numbers from the U.S. Geological Survey. Beijing, through Shenghe Resources, is also invested in Greenland’s Kvanefjeld mining project, which holds the third-largest known rare earth deposit on land. China’s partner in that project is Australia’s Energy Transition Minerals. That project, though, hit a wall after Greenland banned uranium mining in 2021. It’s now stuck in court battles. Ryan Castilloux, who runs the research firm Adamas Intelligence, said that locking in U.S. priority over Greenland’s supply would “ensure that a Chinese partner or somebody else doesn’t come back to the table to develop those resources.” Trump said at Davos that his plan for Greenland isn’t even about mining. “I want Greenland for security. I don’t want it for anything else,” he told reporters just before meeting with the NATO Secretary General. “We have so much rare earth, we don’t know what to do with it. We don’t need it for anything else.” Castilloux added that the U.S. supply pipeline is now “full” after the administration made big steps in the past year to get a domestic rare earth network up and running.

One project now entering that conversation is Husky Inu AI , a low-cap meme ecosystem that is drawing attention for its early traction, live products, and positioning alongside established narratives. To understand why Husky Inu AI is being mentioned in this context, traders are looking back at how momentum formed during the rise of $PENGUIN. Why traders keep referencing $PENGUIN Nietzschean $PENGUIN is a meme coin that surprised traders with the speed of its breakout . In less than seven days, it moved from a low-visibility launch to a high-traffic asset, quickly landing on trader watchlists. During its first week, $PENGUIN climbed into the nine-figure market cap range , with daily trading volume reaching the tens of millions of dollars alongside a rapid spike in social activity across X, Telegram, and crypto media. For traders, the key takeaway was how fast liquidity arrived . That rapid transition from obscurity to visibility is why $PENGUIN is now used as a reference point when evaluating new meme coins showing early momentum. Husky Inu AI (the best friend of Shiba Inu) Husky Inu AI is positioning itself as the best friend of Shiba Inu by doing what most meme coins don’t: shipping real products and building a usable ecosystem. Live products already built Husky Inu AI already operates multiple live platforms, setting it apart from typical early-stage meme projects. • SwapCrypto.com – A non custodial exchange built by the Husky Inu team, allowing users to swap assets without giving up custody. • CryptoNews.ai – An AI powered crypto news platform delivering real time updates, market narratives, and trend analysis. • HinuBucks.com – A rewards and task based system designed to incentivize holders and strengthen community engagement. • CryptoGPT – An AI driven tool focused on market price prediction and deep technical analysis. A demo is live at AskCryptoGPT.com , with the full version planned for release in the coming weeks. Husky Inu AI price prediction For Husky Inu AI, price prediction is often framed by looking at how similar meme ecosystems have evolved. Shiba Inu itself was widely labeled the “Dogecoin killer” after starting as a Dogecoin-inspired project and gaining massive traction once Dogecoin went viral. During its breakout phase, SHIB went on to capture roughly 20% of Dogecoin’s market capitalization , delivering explosive growth in a very short period of time. Husky Inu AI is aiming to follow a comparable path as a companion narrative to Shiba Inu. Based on Shiba Inu’s current market cap, scenario-based models suggest that capturing even a small percentage of SHIB’s valuation could place Husky Inu AI in a significantly higher market cap range than where it stands today. At the time of writing, Husky Inu AI is still valued at roughly $920,000 , placing it firmly in the early-stage category. Compared to the scenario ranges outlined above, this highlights the scale of the gap between the project’s current valuation and the broader targets traders are watching. Why pick Husky Inu AI Most people in crypto remember watching Dogecoin turn from a meme into a multi billion dollar phenomenon. Many also remember seeing Shiba Inu, widely called the Dogecoin killer, explode after going viral and thinking one thing too late. Husky Inu AI exists for that exact moment. It is built for those who recognize patterns early, before narratives dominate timelines and before exchange listings shift valuations. This is not about chasing hype. It is about positioning ahead of it. What makes Husky Inu AI stand out is the combination of meme appeal, live products, and an expanding ecosystem already in motion. While many projects promise delivery later, Husky Inu AI is already building, already shipping, and already forming its community. For those who remember missing Dogecoin or Shiba Inu in their early stages, Husky Inu AI represents a rare opportunity to engage with a project while it is still small, still developing, and still largely undiscovered.

This finding, published in London in early 2025, highlights a growing rift between traditional finance and the emerging crypto sector. The data signals a potential crisis for consumer access and poses serious questions about the United Kingdom’s position as a global fintech hub. UK Banks Crypto Transfer Data Reveals Systemic Friction The UK Crypto-Business Council (UKCBC) conducted the definitive survey. Researchers gathered data from the ten largest centralized exchanges operating within the United Kingdom. Consequently, they discovered that eight out of these ten platforms reported a noticeable increase in payment issues over the past year. Moreover, not a single exchange reported any decrease in these banking obstacles. The council’s methodology involved analyzing thousands of customer service tickets and transaction logs. This approach provided a clear, evidence-based picture of the current financial landscape. Banking restrictions typically manifest in two primary ways. First, payments are sometimes blocked entirely before they reach the exchange. Second, transfers face significant delays, often lasting several business days. These actions create substantial friction for users trying to deposit funds. For instance, a user attempting to buy Bitcoin during a market dip might find their funds held until the opportunity passes. The report specifically implicates major high-street banks, though it avoids naming individual institutions to maintain a focus on systemic issues. The Regulatory Landscape and Compliance Pretext Banks frequently cite regulatory compliance and anti-fraud measures as justification for their restrictive actions. The UK’s financial regulations, including stringent Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) rules, provide a framework for this caution. However, the UKCBC report argues that banks are applying these rules inconsistently. The council asserts that institutions are using compliance as a pretext to stifle competition. This practice effectively excludes a legitimate sector from essential banking services. The industry itself has made considerable efforts to combat fraud. Exchanges now implement advanced verification systems that often exceed standard banking protocols. Many platforms use real-time transaction monitoring and blockchain analytics software. The following table contrasts typical bank and crypto exchange compliance approaches: Compliance Area Traditional Bank Approach Modern Crypto Exchange Approach Identity Verification Document checks, credit history Biometric scans, liveness detection, document + selfie verification Transaction Monitoring Pattern-based alerts, manual review Blockchain analytics, smart contract screening, automated risk scoring Source of Funds Salary slips, bank statements Cryptographic proof, on-chain history analysis, fiat gateway data This disparity suggests that risk perception, rather than actual risk, may be driving bank policy. The regulatory environment remains a complex patchwork. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) oversees crypto asset activities, but its guidelines leave room for interpretation. Consequently, banks often adopt the most restrictive interpretation to avoid potential penalties. Expert Analysis on Market Impact and Consumer Choice Financial technology analysts view this trend with deep concern. They note that blocking payments undermines consumer sovereignty and financial innovation. When banks control payment rails, they effectively act as gatekeepers for the entire economy. This power can inadvertently suppress new technologies and business models. The 40% blockage rate represents more than an inconvenience; it signifies a structural barrier to market entry. The impact extends beyond individual users. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operating in the crypto space face operational paralysis. They struggle to pay suppliers, manage payroll, and handle basic corporate treasury functions. This environment pushes business activity to jurisdictions with clearer regulatory frameworks. Nations like Switzerland, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates are actively crafting crypto-friendly policies. They aim to attract the talent and investment currently facing hurdles in the UK. Economic historians draw parallels with early internet commerce. Initially, many banks hesitated to process payments for online retailers due to perceived fraud risks. However, dedicated payment processors eventually emerged to fill the gap. A similar evolution may occur in crypto payments. Specialized electronic money institutions (EMIs) and payment service providers (PSPs) are already gaining market share. They offer dedicated fiat-to-crypto gateways with higher success rates than traditional banks. Potential Solutions and Industry Responses The UKCBC report does not merely identify problems; it also proposes concrete solutions. The council advocates for a formal dialogue between banks, regulators, and crypto businesses. A shared understanding of risk and compliance standards could reduce friction significantly. Furthermore, the industry supports the development of clearer regulatory guidelines. Specific rules for bank-crypto relationships would eliminate the current ambiguity. Several technical solutions are also gaining traction: Dedicated Banking Channels: Some exchanges now partner with specific banks to create white-listed payment corridors. Open Banking APIs: Using secure application programming interfaces to initiate payments directly, reducing intermediary friction. Stablecoin On-Ramps: Users purchase regulated stablecoins with faster payment systems, then transfer them to exchanges. Direct Debit Mandates: Recurring, pre-approved transfers that undergo one-time enhanced due diligence. Consumer advocacy groups emphasize the importance of transparency. Banks should provide clear, specific reasons for blocking a transaction. They should also offer a straightforward appeals process. Currently, users often receive generic messages citing “security policies” or “terms of service.” This lack of clarity fuels frustration and distrust. Regulatory technology (RegTech) startups are developing tools to bridge this communication gap. Their platforms can translate complex compliance rules into actionable insights for both banks and customers. Conclusion The report detailing how UK banks block or delay 40% of crypto exchange transfers serves as a critical wake-up call. It underscores a tangible conflict between innovative financial technology and entrenched banking practices. The situation affects everyday investors, businesses, and the UK’s competitive standing. Moving forward, collaborative effort between regulators, banks, and the crypto industry is essential. Constructive dialogue can build a framework that manages risk without stifling innovation. The resolution of this UK banks crypto transfer issue will significantly influence the future of finance in the digital age. FAQs Q1: Which UK banks are blocking crypto transfers? The UKCBC report did not name specific banks to focus on the systemic issue. However, customer reports frequently mention major high-street banks and building societies. The problem appears widespread rather than limited to one or two institutions. Q2: Is it illegal for banks to block these payments? No, it is not illegal. Banks operate under their own terms of service and risk management frameworks. They have the legal right to refuse service to any customer or transaction they deem high-risk, provided they do not discriminate unlawfully. Q3: What can I do if my bank blocks a transfer to a crypto exchange? First, contact your bank’s customer service for a specific reason. You can also try using a different payment method, such as a debit card or a specialized payment provider. Some users switch to banks or digital challenger banks known for being more crypto-friendly. Q4: How does this affect the price of cryptocurrencies in the UK? Restricted access can create localized supply constraints, potentially causing prices on UK exchanges to deviate slightly from global averages. More significantly, it reduces market participation and liquidity, which can increase volatility for UK-based traders. Q5: Are there any regulations being proposed to fix this? As of early 2025, no specific legislation addresses this banking friction directly. However, broader discussions about the UK’s crypto asset regulatory regime are ongoing. Industry bodies like the UKCBC are lobbying for clear guidelines that would standardize how banks interact with regulated crypto firms.

The session is now firmly set for 3:30 p.m. UTC on January 29, 2025, providing a clear path forward after speculation of a lengthier delay. This development marks a crucial step toward establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets in the United States. US Senate Crypto Bill Advances with New January Timeline The Committee’s decision to proceed with the January 29 markup represents a significant acceleration in the legislative process. Consequently, this action directly counters earlier reports from financial news outlets, including Bloomberg, which suggested a potential postponement until late February or even March. Moreover, the rescheduling signals a renewed commitment from lawmakers to address the complex regulatory challenges posed by cryptocurrency markets. The CLARITY Act, formally known as the Crypto-Asset Regulatory Framework and Investor Transparency Act, aims to create a cohesive national strategy. This strategy will delineate regulatory responsibilities between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The Legislative Journey of the CLARITY Act Understanding the current markup requires context on the bill’s evolution. Initially introduced in the previous congressional session, the CLARITY Act emerged from bipartisan discussions seeking to resolve jurisdictional ambiguities. For years, the digital asset industry has operated under a patchwork of state regulations and conflicting federal guidance. This environment has created uncertainty for businesses and investors alike. The bill’s sponsors have consistently argued that clear rules are essential for consumer protection, market integrity, and maintaining U.S. competitiveness. The upcoming markup session will involve committee members debating, amending, and ultimately voting on the bill’s text before it can advance to the full Senate floor. Analyzing the Impact of Digital Asset Regulation The implications of this legislative effort extend far beyond Capitol Hill. A successful markup and subsequent passage of the CLARITY Act would establish the first major federal regulatory framework specifically designed for cryptocurrencies and related technologies. Firstly, it would provide legal certainty for crypto exchanges, custodians, and token issuers. Secondly, it would create standardized rules for investor disclosures and anti-fraud measures. Industry analysts closely monitor several key provisions expected within the bill: Regulatory Classification: Defining which digital assets constitute securities versus commodities. Exchange Registration: Establishing mandatory registration pathways for trading platforms. Stablecoin Oversight: Creating federal standards for payment stablecoin issuers. Consumer Protections: Mandating robust custody and disclosure requirements. Furthermore, the global regulatory landscape influences this domestic push. Other major economies, including the European Union with its MiCA framework and the United Kingdom with its phased approach, have moved forward with their own regimes. Therefore, U.S. lawmakers face pressure to act to prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure American leadership in financial technology. Expert Perspectives on the Markup’s Significance Financial policy experts emphasize the procedural importance of the January 29 date. “A committee markup is where the substantive legislative work happens,” explains Dr. Elena Torres, a senior fellow at the Center for Financial Markets. “It’s the stage where theoretical policy meets practical amendment. The rescheduling from a potential spring date to late January indicates the committee leadership has secured enough consensus to proceed with detailed negotiations.” Legal scholars also note the bill’s attempt to reconcile differing philosophical approaches to regulation. Some advocate for principles-based frameworks, while others insist on detailed, prescriptive rules. The final language emerging from the markup will reveal which perspective holds greater sway. Market Reaction and Industry Preparedness Anticipation for regulatory clarity has been a dominant theme in crypto markets for several quarters. Institutional investors, in particular, have cited regulatory uncertainty as a primary barrier to larger-scale adoption and capital allocation. The announcement of a firm markup date provides a tangible timeline for market participants. Consequently, trade associations and legal teams are preparing detailed commentary and proposed amendments for committee staff. The table below outlines the potential immediate and long-term effects of the bill’s progression: Stakeholder Group Short-Term Impact (Pre-Markup) Long-Term Impact (If Passed) Crypto Exchanges Increased compliance preparation and lobbying efforts. Clear operational guidelines, potential for national licensing. Traditional Finance Assessment of market entry strategies under new rules. Easier pathways to offer crypto-related products and custody. Investors Market volatility around news events. Enhanced disclosure and legal recourse, potentially boosting confidence. Blockchain Developers Scrutiny of token distribution models. Legal clarity for utility tokens and decentralized network launches. Simultaneously, state regulators are watching the process closely. A strong federal framework could preempt a variety of state-level laws, creating a more uniform national market. However, it is unlikely to eliminate all state authority, particularly regarding money transmission and consumer protection laws. Conclusion The rescheduling of the US Senate crypto bill markup to January 29, 2025, is a definitive event for the digital asset ecosystem. It moves the CLARITY Act from theoretical discussion to actionable legislation. This process will shape the regulatory environment for years to come, influencing innovation, investment, and consumer safety. The outcome of the Senate Banking Committee’s work will provide critical signals about the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States. All market participants should monitor the developments from this key markup session closely, as its results will form the foundation of America’s approach to the digital financial future. FAQs Q1: What is the CLARITY Act? The CLARITY Act is a proposed U.S. Senate bill designed to create a comprehensive federal regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and digital assets. It aims to clarify the roles of the SEC and CFTC and establish rules for market participants. Q2: What is a “markup” session in Congress? A markup is a meeting by a congressional committee or subcommittee where members debate, amend, and rewrite proposed legislation. It is a critical step where the actual text of a bill is finalized before a committee vote to send it to the full chamber. Q3: Why was the Senate crypto bill markup rescheduled? The Senate Banking Committee rescheduled the markup to January 29 to advance the legislative process more quickly. This followed earlier reports of a potential delay, suggesting committee leaders believe they have sufficient consensus to proceed. Q4: What happens after the January 29 markup? If the committee approves the bill during the markup, it will be reported to the full U.S. Senate for consideration. It would then need to pass the Senate, be reconciled with any similar House bill, and be signed by the President to become law. Q5: How does this affect current cryptocurrency regulations? The markup itself does not immediately change any regulations. However, if the CLARITY Act eventually becomes law, it would supersede much of the current guidance-based approach with formal statutes, creating a clearer and more stable regulatory environment.

This weather event demonstrates the growing vulnerability of cryptocurrency infrastructure to extreme climate conditions, particularly for energy-intensive proof-of-work networks like Bitcoin. Bitcoin Hashrate Decline: Immediate Network Impact The Bitcoin network experienced a measurable hashrate reduction of approximately 15-25% during the peak of the winter storm, according to blockchain analytics firms. This decline directly correlates with mining operations in affected states voluntarily curtailing their electricity usage. Consequently, the network witnessed longer average block generation times, temporarily slowing transaction processing. Mining companies in Texas, Wyoming, and Pennsylvania reported the most significant operational reductions. These states collectively represent nearly 40% of the United States’ Bitcoin mining capacity. The hashrate decline represents one of the most substantial weather-related impacts on the Bitcoin network since China’s mining ban in 2021. Winter Storm Disrupts Power Grid Stability The severe winter storm created unprecedented strain on regional power grids across multiple states. Grid operators issued emergency alerts, requesting voluntary and mandatory load reductions to prevent widespread blackouts. Bitcoin mining facilities, as large, flexible energy consumers, became primary targets for these reduction requests. Many operations participate in demand response programs. These programs compensate miners for reducing consumption during grid stress. The table below illustrates the relationship between weather severity and mining response: Region Temperature Drop Estimated Mining Load Reduction Primary Grid Concern Texas (ERCOT) 25°F below average 30-40% Natural gas supply freeze Midwest (MISO) 20°F below average 20-30% Coal plant outages Northeast (PJM) 18°F below average 15-25% Transmission line icing This grid-first response highlights the evolving relationship between cryptocurrency mining and traditional energy infrastructure. Mining operations increasingly function as grid stabilizers during extreme events. Expert Analysis: Mining’s Role in Grid Resilience Energy analysts note that Bitcoin mining’s interruptible load provides unique value to grid operators. Dr. Sarah Chen, an energy economist at Stanford University, explains the dynamic. “Bitcoin mining facilities can power down within minutes, unlike industrial factories or hospitals,” Chen states. “This flexibility makes them ideal participants in demand response markets, especially during winter peaks when heating demand soars.” However, the sudden hashrate reduction reveals network concentration risks. The United States now hosts approximately 38% of global Bitcoin mining. Regional weather events can therefore create noticeable global network effects. This concentration contrasts with the decentralized ideal of cryptocurrency networks. Historical Context of Weather Impact on Cryptocurrency Mining Weather disruptions to cryptocurrency mining are not unprecedented, but their scale and frequency are increasing. In 2021, Texas summer heat waves prompted similar mining curtailments. In 2023, hydropower-dependent mining in Sichuan, China, faced reductions during drought conditions. The 2025 winter storm event, however, represents the most severe cold-weather impact on U.S. mining to date. The event underscores several critical trends: Geographic Concentration: Mining has consolidated in regions with cheap energy, often making it vulnerable to local climate patterns. Energy Interdependence: Mining profitability remains tightly coupled with energy availability and pricing volatility. Network Security: Temporary hashrate drops, while recoverable, briefly reduce the computational security of the Bitcoin network against potential 51% attacks. Network difficulty adjustments will eventually compensate for the hashrate decline. The Bitcoin protocol automatically recalibrates mining difficulty every 2,016 blocks, or approximately every two weeks. This adjustment ensures block times return to the target 10-minute average, regardless of total network hashrate. Economic and Market Implications The hashrate decline coincided with noticeable effects on mining economics and broader cryptocurrency markets. Mining profitability metrics, measured by hash price, showed temporary improvement for remaining online miners. These miners received a larger share of block rewards due to reduced competition. However, offline miners faced revenue losses and potential operational challenges, including: Fixed cost burdens without corresponding revenue Restart logistics and potential hardware issues from rapid shutdowns Contractual penalties or lost incentives from power agreements Bitcoin’s price showed minimal direct reaction to the hashrate news, suggesting mature market understanding of temporary network perturbations. Analysts emphasize that short-term hashrate volatility rarely affects long-term price trends. The network has historically demonstrated remarkable resilience to much larger disruptions. The Future of Climate-Resilient Mining Infrastructure Industry leaders are already discussing adaptations to mitigate future weather risks. Proposed solutions include greater geographic diversification of mining operations, investment in on-site backup power generation, and deployment of more energy-efficient mining hardware. Some companies are exploring “stranded” energy sources, like flare gas or remote hydropower, that are less integrated with main grids. These sources might offer greater insulation from widespread weather disruptions. The winter storm of 2025 will likely accelerate these trends, pushing the industry toward more resilient and sustainable operational models. Conclusion The severe U.S. winter storm of January 2025 provided a stark demonstration of cryptocurrency infrastructure’s vulnerability to extreme weather. The resulting Bitcoin hashrate decline highlighted the complex interdependence between mining operations, energy grids, and climate patterns. While the network’s difficulty adjustment mechanism ensures long-term stability, the event underscores the need for greater operational resilience. As Bitcoin mining continues to mature as an industry, its ability to navigate climate-related challenges will remain crucial for network security and reliability. The 2025 winter storm serves as both a stress test and a catalyst for innovation in cryptocurrency infrastructure design. FAQs Q1: What is Bitcoin hashrate and why does it matter? A1: Bitcoin hashrate measures the total computational power securing the Bitcoin network. A higher hashrate indicates greater network security against attacks. The temporary decline during the storm slightly reduced this security margin until the network adjusted. Q2: How long does it take for Bitcoin’s difficulty to adjust after a hashrate drop? A2: The Bitcoin network automatically adjusts mining difficulty every 2,016 blocks, which typically takes about two weeks. This adjustment brings block production back to the target rate of one block every ten minutes, regardless of the current hashrate. Q3: Did the winter storm affect Bitcoin transaction times or fees? A3: Yes, temporarily. Longer block times initially slowed transaction confirmations. However, the mempool (waiting area for unconfirmed transactions) did not become severely congested, and fee spikes were moderate compared to previous network stress events. Q4: Are Bitcoin miners required to reduce power usage during grid emergencies? A4: Participation varies. Many large miners voluntarily enroll in demand response programs that compensate them for reducing load. In some extreme cases, grid operators can mandate reductions to prevent blackouts, affecting all large energy consumers, including miners. Q5: Could this happen to other cryptocurrencies? A5: Proof-of-work cryptocurrencies with concentrated mining in affected regions could experience similar impacts. Proof-of-stake networks, which validate transactions through token ownership rather than computational work, are not affected by hashrate fluctuations and consume far less energy.

The Kobeissi Letter said about $60 million in leveraged long positions were liquidated in roughly 30 minutes as prices broke under the $88,000 level. Macro headlines also weighed on sentiment. The Kobeissi Letter linked the selloff to rising expectations of a U.S. government shutdown and fresh trade threats from President Donald Trump. Trump said he could impose a 100% tariff on Canadian imports tied to Canada’s trade approach with China, escalating tensions with Ottawa as markets looked ahead to the next U.S. trading session. Bitcoin Bear Flag Forms After Sharp Pullback Bitcoin traded near $88,000 on Jan. 25 as a TradingView daily chart shared by X user CryptoGerla flagged a potential bear flag structure forming after the latest decline.

This pivotal development, named the VanEck Avalanche ETF (VAVX), represents a significant step toward bridging the gap between innovative blockchain networks and mainstream, regulated investment vehicles. Consequently, the financial community is closely analyzing its structure and potential implications. Decoding the VanEck Avalanche ETP Launch VanEck, a established name in asset management, formally introduced the VanEck Avalanche ETF (VAVX). Importantly, the firm clarified a crucial technical detail. Despite the “ETF” nomenclature, this product is not a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)-approved exchange-traded fund. Instead, it operates as a trust product. This structural distinction is common for single-asset crypto products awaiting full ETF approval. The trust will hold AVAX tokens directly, providing investors with a regulated avenue for exposure. The announcement immediately sparked discussion across financial and crypto sectors. Analysts recognize this launch as part of a broader trend of institutional adoption. Furthermore, it follows VanEck’s existing suite of digital asset funds, including products for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The firm’s decision to select Avalanche highlights the network’s growing prominence. Avalanche is renowned for its high throughput and sub-second transaction finality. The Structural Nuances of Crypto ETPs Understanding the product type is essential for investor clarity. An Exchange Traded Product (ETP) serves as an umbrella term. It encompasses various securities that trade on exchanges, like stocks. Within this category, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) represent a specific, SEC-regulated subtype that typically holds a basket of assets. Currently, the U.S. SEC has approved spot Bitcoin ETFs but has not yet approved spot ETFs for other cryptocurrencies, including AVAX. Therefore, VanEck’s VAVX utilizes a trust structure. This model involves the issuer creating a publicly traded trust that acquires and holds the underlying asset. Investors then buy shares representing a fractional interest in that trust. The table below outlines key differences: Feature VanEck Avalanche Trust (VAVX) Hypothetical SEC-Approved AVAX ETF Regulatory Status Operates under trust regulations Would require explicit SEC approval under Investment Company Act Structure Grantor trust holding AVAX Registered investment company Primary Market Creation Issuance/redemption of shares for cash or AVAX Typically involves authorized participants exchanging baskets of securities Current Availability Available now Not yet available in the U.S. This structure provides several immediate benefits: Regulated Access: It offers a familiar, brokerage-account-friendly way to gain exposure. Custodial Security: Assets are held by a regulated custodian, mitigating self-custody risks. Tax Documentation: Investors receive standardized tax forms, simplifying reporting. Expert Analysis on Market Impact Financial analysts view this launch as a validation signal for the Avalanche ecosystem. “The introduction of a physically-backed AVAX product by a firm of VanEck’s caliber is a substantial endorsement,” noted a report from Bloomberg Intelligence. It signals to institutional allocators that the asset is maturing within the framework of traditional finance. Moreover, it provides a potential liquidity conduit, as the trust’s shares can be created and redeemed based on demand. The timing is also significant. It arrives as regulatory frameworks for digital assets continue to evolve. The product does not circumvent regulation but operates within existing structures for commodity-based trusts. This approach demonstrates a pragmatic path forward for asset managers seeking to offer crypto exposure while navigating the current U.S. regulatory landscape. Avalanche Network: The Underlying Technology To fully appreciate this milestone, one must understand the Avalanche protocol. Launched in 2020 by Ava Labs, Avalanche is a layer-1 blockchain platform designed for high scalability and customizability. Its consensus mechanism, a directed acyclic graph (DAG)-optimized protocol, enables it to process thousands of transactions per second with rapid finality. The network comprises three built-in blockchains: Exchange Chain (X-Chain): Creates and trades AVAX and other digital assets. Contract Chain (C-Chain): Hosts smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Platform Chain (P-Chain): Coordinates validators and enables the creation of subnets. This architecture has attracted a diverse ecosystem. It includes decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces, and enterprise blockchain initiatives. For instance, major financial institutions have explored asset tokenization on its subnet infrastructure. The VanEck ETP directly ties the performance of this ecosystem to a tradable security. The Broader Context of Institutional Crypto Adoption The launch of VAVX is not an isolated event. It represents a clear step in the sequential institutionalization of cryptocurrency markets. The journey began with Bitcoin futures, progressed to Bitcoin and Ethereum trusts, and saw a watershed moment with spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in January 2024. Now, attention is expanding to alternative crypto assets, often called “altcoins.” Asset managers are strategically building product suites to capture demand across the digital asset spectrum. VanEck’s move can be seen as a first-mover advantage for AVAX in the U.S. regulated product space. Other asset managers will likely monitor its reception and trading volume closely. Success could encourage similar products for other layer-1 tokens, gradually building a more comprehensive menu of institutional-grade crypto investment tools. Potential Implications for Investors and the Ecosystem For traditional investors, the primary implication is accessibility. They can now gain exposure to AVAX’s price movements without managing private keys or using crypto-native exchanges. This convenience factor cannot be overstated for financial advisors and larger institutions with strict compliance requirements. For the Avalanche ecosystem, the launch brings heightened visibility and a new class of potential stakeholders. Increased demand for the ETP shares requires the trust to acquire more underlying AVAX, which could positively influence market dynamics. However, analysts caution that the product’s success depends on factors like trading liquidity, management fees, and ongoing regulatory developments. Conclusion The launch of the VanEck Avalanche ETP marks a groundbreaking milestone in the convergence of decentralized blockchain networks and traditional finance. By offering the first U.S. regulated product for AVAX exposure, VanEck has provided a critical bridge for institutional capital. While structured as a trust rather than an SEC-approved ETF, the VAVX product fulfills a clear market need for secure, familiar access. This development underscores the ongoing maturation of the crypto asset class and highlights Avalanche’s specific technological value proposition. As the regulatory environment continues to clarify, such products will likely play an integral role in shaping the future of digital asset investment. FAQs Q1: What is the VanEck Avalanche ETP? A1: The VanEck Avalanche ETP (ticker: VAVX) is a publicly traded investment product that holds Avalanche (AVAX) tokens. It allows investors to gain exposure to AVAX’s price through a traditional brokerage account without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Q2: Is the VanEck Avalanche product an ETF? A2: Despite its marketing name (VanEck Avalanche ETF), it is not an SEC-approved exchange-traded fund. It is structured as a grantor trust, which is a common type of exchange-traded product (ETP) for single-asset crypto holdings under current U.S. regulations. Q3: How does this product benefit investors? A3: It provides a regulated, custodial solution for AVAX exposure. Benefits include ease of access within existing investment accounts, professional custody of assets, and simplified tax reporting compared to direct crypto ownership. Q4: How does this affect the Avalanche network? A4: It brings increased institutional visibility and potential demand for AVAX. The trust must purchase and hold AVAX to back its shares, which could impact market liquidity. It also validates Avalanche’s standing as a significant layer-1 blockchain. Q5: Can this product convert into a spot ETF later? A5: Potentially, yes. If the SEC approves a spot AVAX ETF in the future, VanEck could seek to convert this trust into that more efficient structure. However, such a conversion is not guaranteed and depends on future regulatory approvals. Q6: What are the risks of investing in this ETP? A6: Risks include the volatility of the underlying AVAX asset, potential tracking error between the share price and AVAX value, regulatory changes affecting crypto trusts, and the specific custody and operational risks associated with the product structure.

Many analysts have noted that GHOST could be the best crypto to buy now, as capital has started to rotate from $PENGUIN into $GHOST. This shift highlights renewed interest in privacy-focused infrastructure on Solana. GHOST has been live for several months, during which the Solana-based privacy project has continued to build and expand its ecosystem. GhostWareOS offers multiple forms of utility, all centered on delivering practical privacy tools rather than single-purpose features. These utilities are designed to address transparency limitations that currently exist on the Solana blockchain. Earlier this year the $GHOST token saw its market capitalization fall to around $2 million, reflecting broader market weakness and reduced speculative interest. In recent days, however, GHOST has rallied by more than 300%, with its market cap now sitting at approximately $7 million. Several new features are expected to be rolled out by the GhostWareOS team in the near term, adding further functionality to the protocol. GHOST Price Chart: 300% Surge Before getting into some of the utility driving the long-term value of GHOST, it is worth taking a look at some technical analysis. At first glance, the chart would bring confidence to anyone who picked up the dip on $GHOST earlier in January 2026. Price action has clearly shifted from a prolonged consolidation phase into a sharp upside breakout. From a technical perspective, GHOST has reclaimed its short and mid-term moving averages, with price holding firmly above them during the recent push higher. Momentum indicators such as RSI and short-term moving averages have expanded into bullish territory without immediately showing signs of exhaustion. This suggests strength behind the move rather than a brief relief rally. Looking at key levels, the $8 million market cap zone is shaping up as an important area of potential support following the recent breakout. Holding this level could provide a base for further upside, with a sustained move above it opening a clearer path toward a test of the $10 million threshold. Prior consolidation areas below may now act as secondary support on any pullbacks. It is also notable that GHOST continues to trade well below its all-time high market capitalization of roughly $27 million. This gap has given many dip buyers confidence that there is still meaningful upside potential if momentum continues and interest remains strong. Importantly, this move may not be purely technical, as several recent announcements from the GhostWareOS team have also contributed to renewed interest. Final Thoughts on the Best Crypto to Buy Now Privacy was a major narrative in 2025, with XMR and ZEC experiencing sharp price rallies. Interest now appears to be returning to privacy on the Solana network, where the GhostWareOS team has aligned GHOST with this theme through ongoing releases such as GhostPay and GhostSwap. In addition, rotation from $PENGUIN traders has strengthened GHOST’s case as a potential best crypto to buy now. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

Despite the all-time highs, the token came with warnings of significant insider holdings. RIVER is one of the recent new runners, rising to an all-time high of $87.73. The token broke out in the past few weeks, showing an unusual risk appetite for a relatively new asset. RIVER has entered a period of rapid token unlocks and may also face selling pressure in the coming weeks. RIVER remains volatile, later falling below $80, reversing the trend just hours after climbing to its record. The rapid expansion and volatility led to more interest in the project and its potential risks. The token was launched toward the end of 2025 by River, Inc., a new DeFi protocol with a native stablecoin. Until the recent rally, River was a relatively small protocol with $161M in liquidity . As Cryptopolitan reported , River attracted $8M in funding from TRON DAO. River’s native stablecoin, SatUSD, had a supply of around $158M with multi-chain presence. RIVER flagged for significant insider holdings RIVER is a multi-chain token with representation on BNB Chain , Ethereum, and Base. All chain holdings have a different composition, based on Bubblemaps data. On Base, over 88% of the supply is not distributed and is held on a single address. On Ethereum and BNB Chain, RIVER is held in connected wallet clusters, suggesting potential insider accumulation. RIVER pumped due to a relatively small outstanding supply of 19.6M tokens, with a total supply of $100M. The token’s trading is highly concentrated on Bitget, where market makers can boost liquidity and encourage more active trading. Additionally, RIVER had a derivative market on Binance, where the price liquidated short positions close to $90. Recently, open interest on RIVER reached a peak above $214M, signaling increased interest in speculative bets. More than 64% of all positions were short, leading to the rapid short squeeze in the past days. However, most of the available positions were closed or liquidated, leading to a price slide. Traders fear RIVER crash RIVER is setting expectations of crashing to near-zero, similar to other newly launched tokens. On BNB Chain, the top holder carries over 69.3% of the supply, based on decentralized on-chain data . The token has been mentioned by top influencers, including Arthur Hayes , but it is still considered at risk for insider selling. The token is represented on decentralized markets, including PancakeSwap and Uniswap. The asset is also extremely volatile, as only one liquidity provider ensures over 59% of the liquidity in the PancakeSwap pair. The top two whale traders have already extracted close to $2M from the decentralized market, selling into strength while RIVER rallied. The presence of whales and influential traders is opening RIVER to even greater risks. The token has been around for a few months, accumulating over 25K reported holders. However, some of the smaller wallets may be connected to a smaller number of real holders. RIVER continues to be promoted as potentially breaking out above $90 or even to $100, but analysts remain skeptical, especially under the worsening crypto market sentiment.

The company said the site refresh reflects its long-term strategy around using Ethereum and its layer-2 networks to bring traditionally illiquid assets on-chain in a regulated format. ETHZilla centers tokenization strategy on Ethereum layer-2 infrastructure In the same thread, ETHZilla described itself as an institutional platform focused on securitizing assets on Ethereum layer-2 networks and enabling real-world asset trading through a partnership with Liquidity.io. The company said Ethereum’s programmable settlement layer allows assets to be issued, governed, and traded with greater transparency, while layer-2 networks support scalable issuance and compliance without relying on off-chain systems. ETHZilla outlined several asset categories planned for Ethereum-based tokenization, including industrial equipment such as aerospace and aircraft engines, private credit products tied to auto loans and manufactured home loans, and commercial and multifamily real estate. According to the posts, these assets are structured around predictable cash flows and are supported by AI-assisted underwriting and diversified exposure models designed for on-chain settlement. Looking ahead, ETHZilla said its first tokenized asset listing is expected in the first quarter of 2026. The company added that its Ethereum-centric infrastructure includes SEC-registered trading systems, qualified custody and institutional settlement, Ethereum layer-2 issuance and compliance rails, and a partnership with a FINRA-licensed broker-dealer. ETHZilla said this setup allows governance and regulatory controls to operate directly alongside Ethereum-based tokenization, rather than outside it. Ethereum chart shows repeated breakout failures as analyst flags potential upside move Meanwhile, Ethereum traded near the high $2,700s on Jan. 25 after failing twice to break above a rising resistance line, according to a TradingView chart shared by X user Eco Nomad. The daily ETH USDT chart shows price rejecting near the same upper trendline on two separate attempts, labeled as the first and second failed breakouts, before rolling back lower. Ethereum Failed Breakouts and Support Test. Source: TradingView Eco Nomad on X After the second rejection, Ethereum slid sharply and moved below its short term moving averages, including the 13 day and 50 day exponential averages, while also losing the horizontal level near $3,070. Price then dropped toward the $2,800 area, where a longer term ascending support line from late 2025 comes into focus. Despite the pullback, Eco Nomad said he expects a strong upside move starting next week. The analyst pointed to momentum conditions rather than price structure alone. On the lower panel, the stochastic RSI sits deep in oversold territory after a steep reset, a setup that previously preceded sharp rebounds earlier in the cycle. The broader chart structure shows Ethereum trading inside a rising long term channel, with price still holding above the lower boundary despite recent weakness. As a result, the setup frames the latest decline as a retracement within a larger uptrend rather than a confirmed trend reversal, while attention shifts to whether momentum can turn higher from current levels.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|TRADING|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-26 15:44:44
57481737,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=265424,1769442311,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Kraken DeFi Earn Shatters Barriers with 8% APY Launch Across US, Europe, and Canada",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/kraken-defi-earn-launch-us-europe-canada/,"BitcoinWorld Kraken DeFi Earn Shatters Barriers with 8% APY Launch Across US, Europe, and Canada San Francisco, March 2025 – Kraken, one of the world’s longest-operating cryptocurrency exchanges, has fundamentally transformed access to decentralized finance with its groundbreaking DeFi Earn product launch across three major markets. This strategic expansion into the United States, European Economic Area, and Canada represents a pivotal moment for mainstream DeFi adoption, offering centralized exchange users unprecedented access to decentralized yields through a familiar interface. The platform’s announcement of up to 8% annual percentage yield immediately captured industry attention, signaling a significant evolution in how traditional crypto investors interact with decentralized protocols. Kraken DeFi Earn Product Architecture and Mechanics Kraken’s DeFi Earn functions as a sophisticated bridge between centralized exchange convenience and decentralized finance protocols. The product automatically allocates user deposits to vetted DeFi platforms, eliminating the technical barriers that typically prevent mainstream adoption. Unlike traditional centralized savings products, DeFi Earn directly connects users with decentralized lending markets, liquidity pools, and staking protocols. This architecture maintains the security and transparency of decentralized systems while providing the user experience expectations of established exchanges. The product’s yield generation mechanism operates through several verified DeFi strategies. These include automated liquidity provision to decentralized exchanges, collateralized lending through established protocols, and participation in proof-of-stake networks. Kraken’s risk management team continuously monitors protocol security and market conditions. They implement dynamic allocation strategies to optimize returns while managing exposure to smart contract risks and market volatility. Technical Infrastructure and Security Framework Kraken employs a multi-layered security approach for DeFi Earn, combining institutional-grade custody with decentralized protocol interactions. The platform utilizes secure multi-party computation (MPC) for private key management and maintains insurance coverage for custodial assets. All integrated DeFi protocols undergo rigorous security audits by third-party firms like CertiK and Trail of Bits. The company maintains transparent communication about underlying protocols, providing users with detailed information about where their assets generate yield. Comparative Analysis with Existing Yield Products The cryptocurrency yield landscape features three primary categories: centralized exchange products, decentralized protocols, and traditional financial instruments. Kraken’s DeFi Earn occupies a unique hybrid position, combining elements from each category while addressing their respective limitations. Product Type Average APY Range Key Advantages Primary Risks Traditional Savings 0.5%-2% FDIC/NCUA insurance, regulatory clarity Inflation erosion, low returns Centralized Crypto Earn 3%-6% User-friendly interface, instant withdrawals Counterparty risk, opaque operations Direct DeFi Protocols 5%-15% Transparent operations, non-custodial Technical complexity, smart contract risk Kraken DeFi Earn 4%-8% Balanced risk/return, regulatory compliance Protocol selection risk, liquidity constraints This comparative positioning demonstrates Kraken’s strategic approach to capturing market demand for yield products that balance accessibility with decentralized principles. The 8% maximum APY specifically targets the premium segment of yield-seeking investors while maintaining risk parameters acceptable for regulated markets. Regulatory Landscape and Market Expansion Strategy Kraken’s simultaneous launch across three jurisdictions reflects sophisticated regulatory navigation. Each region presents distinct compliance requirements that the product architecture carefully addresses. In the United States, DeFi Earn operates within existing money transmitter licenses and state-by-state regulatory frameworks. The European Economic Area launch leverages MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation transitional provisions, while Canada’s implementation follows CSA (Canadian Securities Administrators) guidance on crypto asset trading. The company’s phased rollout strategy prioritizes markets with established regulatory clarity. This approach minimizes compliance risks while maximizing addressable market size. Industry analysts note that Kraken’s regulatory-first expansion contrasts with earlier DeFi projects that prioritized technological innovation over compliance. This strategic difference likely explains the product’s availability in jurisdictions that have restricted competing offerings. Liquidity Management and Withdrawal Mechanisms Kraken explicitly addresses withdrawal processing in its product documentation. While most withdrawals process immediately, the company acknowledges potential delays during periods of low liquidity in underlying DeFi protocols. This transparency represents a significant departure from traditional centralized products that guarantee instant withdrawals regardless of market conditions. The distinction highlights the fundamental architectural difference between purely centralized systems and hybrid DeFi integrations. The platform implements several liquidity management strategies to minimize withdrawal delays: Protocol diversification across multiple lending markets and liquidity pools Dynamic allocation algorithms that prioritize liquid positions Reserve pools maintained for immediate withdrawal needs Real-time monitoring of protocol liquidity conditions Industry Impact and Competitive Response Kraken’s DeFi Earn launch immediately influenced competitive dynamics within the cryptocurrency exchange sector. Major competitors including Coinbase, Binance, and Crypto.com now face pressure to enhance their own yield product offerings. Industry observers anticipate several potential responses: First, competing exchanges may accelerate their own DeFi integration roadmaps. Second, specialized DeFi platforms might develop simplified interfaces targeting retail users directly. Third, traditional financial institutions could accelerate their exploration of blockchain-based yield products. This competitive pressure benefits consumers through improved product offerings and potentially higher yields across the sector. The launch also impacts decentralized protocol ecosystems. Established DeFi platforms like Aave, Compound, and Uniswap may experience increased capital inflows as Kraken allocates user deposits. However, this centralized distribution channel creates new dependencies that could influence protocol governance and development priorities. Some decentralized purists express concern about centralization pressures, while pragmatists welcome the mainstream capital and legitimacy. Historical Context and Market Evolution Kraken’s DeFi Earn represents the latest evolution in cryptocurrency yield generation, building upon several previous market phases. The initial era (2017-2019) featured basic exchange staking with limited yield options. The DeFi summer of 2020 introduced permissionless yield farming but required significant technical expertise. The centralized finance yield period (2021-2023) offered simplified products but faced regulatory challenges and transparency issues. Current market conditions favor hybrid approaches that balance accessibility with decentralization principles. Several factors drive this trend: Regulatory maturation providing clearer compliance pathways Institutional demand for crypto-native yield opportunities Technological standardization improving interoperability Market education increasing consumer sophistication Kraken’s product timing aligns perfectly with these converging trends, positioning the exchange to capture significant market share during the next growth phase. Risk Assessment and Consumer Protection Measures DeFi Earn incorporates multiple risk mitigation layers while maintaining transparent communication about remaining exposures. The product clearly distinguishes between custodial risks (minimized through institutional security practices) and protocol risks (inherent to DeFi participation). This distinction represents crucial consumer education, helping users understand the fundamental differences between centralized and decentralized finance models. Key risk factors include: Smart contract vulnerabilities in integrated DeFi protocols Liquidity constraints during market stress events Regulatory changes affecting product availability Market volatility impacting collateral values Protocol governance decisions altering yield mechanisms Kraken addresses these risks through continuous security monitoring, protocol diversification, and clear risk disclosure. The company’s established reputation and regulatory compliance history provide additional consumer confidence compared to newer market entrants. Conclusion Kraken’s DeFi Earn product launch fundamentally advances decentralized finance accessibility for mainstream cryptocurrency investors. The strategic expansion across the United States, European Economic Area, and Canada demonstrates sophisticated regulatory navigation while addressing substantial market demand for yield generation. The hybrid architecture successfully bridges centralized exchange convenience with decentralized protocol transparency, offering up to 8% APY through carefully vetted DeFi strategies. As the cryptocurrency industry continues maturing, products like DeFi Earn will likely play crucial roles in transitioning users from purely centralized platforms to hybrid models that preserve decentralization benefits while improving accessibility. Kraken’s established market position and compliance focus position this DeFi Earn product for significant adoption across its three launch markets. FAQs Q1: How does Kraken DeFi Earn differ from traditional savings accounts? Kraken DeFi Earn generates yield through decentralized finance protocols rather than traditional banking systems, offering potentially higher returns but with different risk profiles including smart contract vulnerabilities and market volatility. Q2: What cryptocurrencies can users deposit into DeFi Earn?

The latest purchase pushes Strategy’s total Bitcoin reserves to 712,647 BTC as of Jan. 25, 2026, according to the post. The company’s cumulative investment now stands at $54.19 billion, with an average purchase price of $76,037 per BTC. Strategy Extends Its Long-Term Accumulation Playbook The latest buy continues a pattern of steady, high-conviction accumulation that has defined Strategy’s identity for years. Even as Bitcoin trades below recent record highs and volatility continues to shake broader risk markets, Saylor and his team have maintained their view that BTC offers unmatched long-duration strength compared to traditional asset classes. The firm typically finances its acquisitions through a blend of equity issuance, debt offerings, and cash flow from operations. This multi-channel funding model has allowed it to scale its BTC position aggressively while maintaining its long-term thesis that digital scarcity will outperform legacy stores of value over time. Market Context: A Corporate Arms Race for BTC Bitcoin’s trading range in early 2026 has been defined by choppy sentiment and macro crosswinds. This has seen the price of the largest crypto by market cap plunge over 5% in the past week. Yet Strategy’s actions suggest it sees this environment as fertile ground rather than a warning sign. Saylor has repeatedly positioned Bitcoin as the “apex monetary asset,” a narrative that continues to resonate among institutions seeking alternatives to inflation-sensitive fiat assets. The latest accumulation also comes as crypto-treasury strategies gain traction globally. Japanese Bitcoin treasury firm Metaplanet, for instance, recently raised its revenue forecasts for 2025 and 2026 even as it prepares to post a deep 2025 loss tied to a nearly $700 million Bitcoin write-down. The company says its growing Bitcoin income business more than offsets the short-term accounting hit. A High-Conviction Bet in a Volatile Cycle Strategy’s average cost basis of $66,037 remains comfortably below current market prices, giving the company a sizable unrealized gain even as Bitcoin consolidates. But the firm is equally aware that such a large position exposes it to amplified swings in a highly reflexive market. Despite this, Saylor has shown no indication of slowing down, frequently characterizing each market dip as an opportunity to strengthen the firm’s digital treasury. According to the company’s website , Strategy has purchased Bitcoin for 6-consecutive weeks now. The largest purchase during this period was made last week, when the firm acquired 22,305 BTC for approximately $2.125 billion.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-26 15:49:29

Historically, Bitcoin World Disrupt events have attracted approximately 10,000 participants annually, with founder and investor categories comprising roughly 40% of total attendance. The +1 pass initiative specifically targets networking expansion, recognizing that collaborative attendance often leads to more valuable conference experiences. Industry analysts note that technology events offering companion discounts typically see 25% higher satisfaction ratings in post-event surveys. Ticket Type Standard Price Early Bird Price Savings General Admission $1,895 $1,215 $680 +1 Companion Pass $1,215 $607.50 $607.50 Total for Two $3,110 $1,822.50 $1,287.50 Strategic Value of Technology Conference Attendance Professional development through conference participation demonstrates measurable returns for technology professionals. Industry research conducted by the Event Marketing Institute indicates that 85% of executives believe in-person events provide critical relationship-building opportunities that digital platforms cannot replicate. Furthermore, a 2024 study published in the Journal of Business Networking found that conference attendees typically establish three to five valuable professional connections that yield tangible business outcomes within twelve months. Bitcoin World Disrupt distinguishes itself through curated programming that emphasizes quality interactions over quantity. The conference structure intentionally limits parallel sessions to reduce decision fatigue while maximizing relevant content exposure. This approach contrasts with larger technology gatherings where attendees often report feeling overwhelmed by too many simultaneous options. Conference organizers have specifically designed the 2026 event to address common pain points identified in post-event surveys from previous years. Historical Impact and Speaker Legacy Analysis Previous Bitcoin World Disrupt events have established significant industry influence through their speaker selection and programming. The 2024 conference featured notable presentations from technology leaders including Matt Mullenweg of Automattic, whose discussion about decentralized publishing platforms generated substantial media coverage. Analysis of speaker impact metrics from the past three Disrupt events reveals consistent patterns of topic adoption within the technology sector following conference presentations. Speaker diversity represents another strength of the Disrupt conference series. Historical data shows balanced representation across technology sectors, with particular emphasis on emerging fields. The 2022 event included Serena Williams discussing venture capital investment strategies, while the 2023 conference featured transportation technology leaders from Waymo and Rivian. This multidisciplinary approach creates unique cross-pollination opportunities that single-industry events cannot replicate. Networking Architecture and Connection Opportunities Conference organizers have implemented sophisticated networking systems designed to facilitate meaningful connections. The curated matchmaking algorithm analyzes attendee profiles to suggest relevant introductions based on professional interests, investment theses, and complementary expertise. This system differs significantly from traditional conference networking, which often relies on random encounters or crowded social events. Data from previous Disrupt conferences indicates that 72% of attendees reported establishing at least one valuable business relationship through these curated introductions. Specialized programming tracks further enhance networking effectiveness. The conference offers dedicated sessions for specific professional roles, including: Founder-focused workshops addressing startup scaling challenges Investor roundtables featuring portfolio strategy discussions Operator deep-dives on technology implementation Executive leadership sessions covering organizational management This targeted approach ensures that networking occurs within relevant professional contexts, increasing the likelihood of productive collaborations. Industry research supports this methodology, showing that context-specific networking yields 40% higher follow-through rates than general social mixing. Startup Ecosystem Integration and Exhibition Strategy The Startup Battlefield 200 competition represents a cornerstone of the Disrupt conference experience, providing emerging companies with unprecedented visibility. Historical data reveals compelling outcomes for participating startups: approximately 30% secure funding within six months of presentation, while 45% report significant partnership opportunities arising from conference connections. The selection process for Battlefield participants involves rigorous evaluation by industry experts, ensuring that exhibiting companies represent genuine innovation rather than incremental improvements. Exhibition space allocation follows strategic principles designed to maximize attendee-startup interactions. Rather than traditional trade show layouts, the Disrupt exhibition area organizes startups by technology vertical and development stage. This clustering enables efficient exploration for investors and partners seeking specific types of opportunities. Conference analytics from previous years indicate that this organized approach increases startup-visitor interactions by approximately 60% compared to randomized layouts. Technology Sector Representation and Trend Analysis Bitcoin World Disrupt 2026 will feature substantial representation across key technology sectors, reflecting current industry investment patterns.

The 2024 event demonstrated increased emphasis on generative AI applications, while the 2023 conference highlighted Web3 infrastructure development. These programming shifts consistently align with venture capital investment data published quarterly by industry research firms, confirming the conference’s relevance to current market dynamics. Registration Timeline and Decision Considerations The five-day registration window requires careful consideration from potential attendees. Conference registration data analysis reveals distinct patterns in decision-making timelines: approximately 70% of early bird registrations typically occur within the final 72 hours of availability. This clustering suggests that many professionals delay registration decisions until deadline proximity creates necessary urgency. However, with over half of the discounted +1 passes already claimed, this pattern may differ for the 2026 event. Financial planning represents another crucial consideration. Many technology companies allocate conference budgets annually, with approval processes requiring several weeks for completion. Professionals considering Bitcoin World Disrupt 2026 attendance should immediately initiate internal budget discussions to avoid missing the January 30 deadline. Historical registration patterns indicate that last-minute registrations face approximately 15% higher cancellation rates due to budget or scheduling conflicts that emerge after hasty decisions. Conclusion Bitcoin World Disrupt 2026 presents a time-sensitive opportunity for technology professionals seeking premier networking and educational experiences. The rapidly diminishing availability of 50% off +1 passes, combined with the January 30 deadline, creates immediate decision pressure for potential attendees. Conference registration represents a strategic investment in professional development, with historical data demonstrating substantial returns through connections, insights, and opportunities. The curated nature of Bitcoin World Disrupt distinguishes it from larger technology gatherings, offering focused programming designed for maximum relevance to hands-on technology professionals. As the registration window narrows, careful consideration of both financial and professional development factors will determine optimal attendance decisions. FAQs Q1: What exactly does the 50% off +1 pass include? The +1 pass provides full conference access for a companion at half the early bird price. This includes admission to all sessions, exhibitions, and networking events, representing identical benefits to a standard attendee pass. Q2: How does Bitcoin World Disrupt differ from other technology conferences? Bitcoin World Disrupt emphasizes curated experiences over sheer volume, with intentional programming designed to maximize relevant connections. The conference limits parallel sessions to reduce decision fatigue and employs matchmaking algorithms to facilitate meaningful networking. Q3: What happens if I register after the first 500 passes are claimed? Registration remains available at standard early bird pricing, but the 50% discount on +1 passes disappears once the initial 500 are claimed. Regular ticket prices apply after January 30 regardless of how many +1 passes have been distributed. Q4: Are there specialized passes for different professional roles? Yes, Bitcoin World Disrupt offers Founder Passes and Investor Passes with tailored programming. These specialized passes provide role-specific content, networking opportunities, and resources designed to address unique professional needs. Q5: What is the cancellation policy for Bitcoin World Disrupt 2026 tickets? Cancellation policies typically allow refunds until specific deadlines, often 30-60 days before the event. However, early bird tickets may have different terms, so registrants should review current policy details before completing their purchase.

A newly released attestation report shows XAU₮ surpassed $4 billion in market value as the flight to hard assets strengthened amid geopolitical fragmentation, monetary uncertainty, and record-breaking bullion prices. The past year marked a turning point for on-chain commodities. The total market capitalization of gold-backed stablecoins expanded from roughly $1.3 billion to over $4 billion in 2025, driven by soaring demand for real-world asset (RWA) exposure that can be traded instantly on public blockchains. The surge coincided with spot gold breaking above $5,000 per ounce. Gold price (Source: CoinCodex) Within that boom, Tether Gold maintained a dominant share, commanding around 60% of all gold-backed tokens in circulation. The latest attestation from TG Commodities, S.A. de C.V.—a regulated stablecoin issuer and Digital Asset Service Provider under El Salvador’s Digital Asset Issuance Law—detailed the scale of the token’s growth. Record Reserves and 1:1 Physical Backing As of Dec, 31, 2025, TG Commodities confirmed the following key metrics: Total Physical Gold Reserves: 520,089.350 fine troy ounces Total XAU₮ Tokens in Circulation: 520,089.300 XAU₮ Backing Ratio: 1:1 with physical gold Total Market Value: US$2.246 billion Tokens Sold: 409,217.64 XAU₮ Tokens Available for Sale: 110,871.66 XAU₮ The physical gold reserves are fully vaulted in Switzerland and adhere to London Good Delivery standards mandated by the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), ensuring that each token corresponds to institutional-grade bullion. Tether Joins the Ranks of Major Sovereign Gold Holders According to data cited from the IMF and a late-2025 Jefferies analysis, Tether’s aggregate gold exposure now places it among the top 30 gold holders in the world, surpassing national reserves held by Greece, Qatar, and Australia. In the final quarter of 2025 alone, Tether Gold Investments, including Tether International Limited and TG Commodities Limited—added approximately 27 metric tons of gold, outpacing the purchases of most individual central banks during the same period. That pace reflects a growing trend of private entities stepping into roles historically dominated by sovereign monetary authorities. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said that Tether Gold is now operating at a scale that places its investment fund alongside sovereign gold holders, and that carries real responsibility. “XAU₮ exists to remove ambiguity at a time when confidence in monetary systems is weakening. Every token represents physically held, vaulted gold that can be verified on-chain, and the market’s growth shows that investors increasingly expect tokenized assets to meet the same standards as national and institutional reserves.”",News|Reports,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|USDT|XAUT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-26 15:54:43

Discovered in early 2025, this massive data breach notably includes sensitive information for 420,000 accounts from the global cryptocurrency exchange Binance, raising urgent questions about data security practices and user vulnerability. Anatomy of the Massive Data Breach Cybersecurity researcher Jeremiah Fowler first identified the exposed database, according to reports from the Helsinki Times. The repository was publicly accessible on the internet without any form of password protection or encryption. Consequently, anyone with an internet connection could potentially view and download the vast trove of personal data. The owner of this database remains unidentified, adding a layer of mystery and concern to the incident. This situation highlights a critical failure in basic data security protocols. The scale of this login credentials leak is immense. The database contained information from some of the world’s most popular online services. Specifically, the exposed data included credentials linked to 48 million Gmail accounts, 17 million Facebook accounts, 6.5 million Instagram profiles, four million Yahoo accounts, and 3.4 million Netflix subscriptions. The inclusion of Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, introduces significant financial security risks for affected users. Implications for Cryptocurrency and Financial Security The exposure of 420,000 Binance account credentials represents a particularly severe facet of this data breach. Cryptocurrency exchanges are high-value targets for cybercriminals due to the direct financial assets they hold. Unlike social media accounts, a compromised exchange account can lead to immediate and irreversible theft of digital assets. This incident underscores the persistent security challenges within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, even for its most established players. Historically, the crypto industry has faced numerous security incidents. For instance, the 2014 Mt. Gox hack resulted in the loss of 850,000 bitcoins. Similarly, the 2022 Ronin Network breach saw over $600 million in crypto assets stolen. While this current leak involves credentials rather than a direct platform hack, it creates a direct pathway for such thefts if users employ the same passwords across multiple sites. Therefore, the real-world impact hinges on user security habits. Expert Analysis on Credential Stuffing Attacks Cybersecurity experts consistently warn about the dangers of credential reuse. “A leak of this magnitude is a bonanza for credential stuffing attacks,” explains a veteran information security analyst. In these attacks, automated bots test username and password combinations from one breach across thousands of other websites. If a user employed the same password for their Netflix account and their Binance account, attackers could gain unauthorized access to both. The chain reaction from a single leaked password can be catastrophic for an individual’s digital life. Broader Cybersecurity Context and Trends This event is not an isolated one. It fits into a troubling pattern of large-scale data exposures. For example, the 2021 Facebook data leak impacted 533 million users. Similarly, the 2023 Twitter data breach exposed 200 million email addresses. These incidents often stem from misconfigured databases, inadequate access controls, or insecure application programming interfaces (APIs). The 2025 leak’s root cause—an unsecured, publicly accessible database—is a depressingly common and preventable error. The regulatory landscape is evolving in response. Legislation like the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California’s Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) mandate strict rules for data handling and breach notification. Companies failing to protect user data face severe financial penalties. This legal framework aims to incentivize better security practices, though enforcement remains a global challenge. Immediate Steps for User Protection If you suspect your data was part of this or any breach, immediate action is crucial. Follow these steps to secure your accounts: Change Your Passwords Immediately: Start with your most critical accounts—email, financial services, and cryptocurrency exchanges. Use a unique, complex password for every single account. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): This adds a critical second layer of security. Use an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator or Authy) instead of SMS-based 2FA where possible, as SIM-swapping attacks can bypass SMS codes. Use a Password Manager: These tools generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts, eliminating the need to remember them or reuse them. Monitor Your Accounts: Regularly check your financial and crypto exchange statements for any unauthorized transactions. Consider using credit monitoring services. Verify Breach Exposure: Use reputable services like ‘Have I Been Pwned’ to check if your email address appears in known data breaches. The Role of Companies in Data Stewardship This incident places a spotlight on corporate responsibility. Companies collecting user data have a fundamental duty to protect it with robust security measures. Basic steps include encrypting databases at rest and in transit, implementing strict access controls, and conducting regular security audits. Furthermore, transparent communication with users during a crisis is non-negotiable. Users deserve timely, clear information about what data was exposed and what the company is doing to remediate the situation. The identity of the database owner in this case remains unknown. This ambiguity complicates the response and remediation efforts. It raises questions about whether this was a centralized aggregation of data from previous, smaller breaches or a new, previously unknown compromise. The cybersecurity community continues to investigate the source and scope of the exposure. Conclusion The leak of 149 million login credentials, including those for 420,000 Binance accounts, serves as a stark reminder of the fragile state of digital security in 2025. This massive data breach underscores the catastrophic consequences of simple security failures and the critical importance of individual cyber hygiene. While companies must be held accountable for safeguarding data, users must proactively defend themselves by adopting unique passwords and multi-factor authentication. Ultimately, collective vigilance is our best defense in an increasingly interconnected and vulnerable digital landscape. FAQs Q1: What should I do if I think my Binance account was part of this data breach? A1: Immediately log into your Binance account and change your password to a new, strong, and unique one. Then, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) using an authenticator app. Finally, review your account activity and API keys for any suspicious actions. Q2: How can a leaked password from Netflix or Facebook lead to my crypto being stolen? A2: Through a technique called “credential stuffing.” Attackers use automated software to try the leaked username and password combinations on hundreds of other websites, including cryptocurrency exchanges. If you reused the same password, they can gain access. Q3: What does “publicly accessible database without password protection” mean? A3: It means the digital storage server holding all this user data was connected to the open internet. Furthermore, it had no login gate or encryption barrier. Anyone who knew the server’s address or found it through a scan could access, view, and download all the information inside. Q4: Why is the owner of the leaked database unknown? A4: Cybersecurity researchers often find exposed data through scans of internet-connected systems. Determining the legal owner requires forensic investigation of server metadata, registration records, and the data’s origin, which can be intentionally obscured or difficult to trace. Q5: Are password managers safe to use, and do they help in this situation? A5: Reputable password managers are highly secure and are one of the best defenses against breaches. They store your passwords in an encrypted vault and generate strong, unique passwords for every site. This means a breach of one site’s password does not compromise your other accounts.

According to the document, the asset manager filed for an S-1 on January 23, 2026. The filing marks a step toward launching the Bitcoin-focused income ETF under the iShares platform. According to Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, the strategy is to “track performance of the price of bitcoin while providing premium income through an actively managed strategy of writing (selling) call options primarily on IBIT shares and, from time to time, on ETP Indices.” BlackRock just dropped the official S-1 for it's upcoming iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF.. no fee or ticker yet.

Both BlackRock’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have generated over $260 million in combined annual revenue within two years. Bitcoin Premium Income ETF to offer yields of 8-12% annually The new fund is built for investors who want income, not just exposure to Bitcoin’s price. While IBIT tracks the spot price of Bitcoin, the Premium Income ETF adds an options overlay to extract extra income. According to the filing, the trust will invest mainly in Bitcoin, IBIT shares, and cash reserves. It will also generate yield through call option writing on IBIT or index-tracking spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products. The proposed fund would use a covered call strategy on the Bitcoin holdings. Here, the investor would buy the Bitcoins while selling the call options on the purchased Bitcoins. The covered call strategy would sell the out-of-the-money options on the Bitcoins to earn premiums, which would be 8-12% annually, like other equity opportunities. The fund will register as a spot product under US securities law. The strategy offers two potential benefits for investors: it generates regular income from option premiums and provides downside protection during market declines. However, the strategy may limit upside participation during strong Bitcoin rallies. As reported by Cryptopolitan, BlackRock previously registered an entity for this ETF in Delaware last September. The firm has not yet disclosed the ticker symbol or management fees. According to industry analysts, competitive fee structures are likely to mirror the firm’s existing IBIT product, which charges 0.25% annually. BlackRock IBIT leads in daily outflows Last week, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds saw $1.32 billion in outflows. Wednesday’s $708.7 million marked the sixth-largest single-day exodus since launch. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust led daily outflows, with $22.35 million. However, IBIT remains the dominant product, holding $69.84 billion in assets and nearly 4% of the Bitcoin supply represented in ETFs. Fidelity’s FBTC followed with $9.76 million in outflows, while Grayscale’s GBTC reported flat daily flows but remains deeply negative overall, with $25.58 billion in cumulative net outflows. Other issuers, including Bitwise, Ark, 21Shares, VanEck, Invesco, Valkyrie, Franklin, and WisdomTree, recorded largely unchanged flows, suggesting a pause rather than broad panic selling. Bitcoin price lost nearly 3% over the weekend, and although it attempted a bounce on Monday, gaining 1.3%, it still trades below the $90k threshold. BTC is holding last week’s local lows, beneath the moving average grid, and opening a direct path to test the lower boundary of the two-month consolidation range between $85,000 and $82,000. According to LMAX strategist, crypto markets “bore the brunt of deteriorating global risk sentiment” as “unpredictability of the US administration, renewed fears of an unwind in the yen carry trade, and broader implications for global growth drove defensive positioning”. Technical analysis shows that in the medium term, Bitcoin continues to target last year’s April lows around $74,000, or as low as $68,000 on the weekly chart, where the 200-week exponential moving average currently runs. The kingcoin has seen a 0.5% decline over the last 24 hours, trading at $ 88,171. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

This crypto is none other than Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently available in presale for a mere $0.04 in Phase 7. The presale has already raised over $19.97 million from 18,880+ investors. Analysts predict that MUTM will top Dogecoin’s 2021 millionaire-making potential with ease, citing its utility focus. Dogecoin Makes Technical Recovery in the Short Term Dogecoin is currently displaying positive short-term technical movement as the coin has been able to break away from the $0.115 mark and has surpassed its local trendline as well. The coin is displaying consolidation-type movement as an overall trend, based on wider market sentiment. While a recovery could follow, Dogecoin is unlikely to repeat its 2021 success owing to its large market cap. Investors looking for the next crypto to explode are turning attention to Mutuum Finance at $0.04. MUTM Demand and Investor Confidence Mutuum Finance is gaining remarkable momentum with its ongoing presale, which is witnessing substantial early-stage interest and generating substantial value for its first backers. Starting with a $0.01 entry price, Mutuum Finance’s token, MUTM, has seen a four-fold rise to $0.04 with its seventh phase. Its listing price on exchanges is expected to be $0.06. This shows that there is substantial and immediate gain to be reaped with this token. In fact, with a $5,000 investment, there is expected to be a $1,250 gain with Phase 8. This is because in Phase 8, there is expected to be a price rise to $0.045. By the time of launch, this $5,000 will have become $7,500. This potential is already generating substantial community momentum with 18,880 community members contributing to a fundraising effort that is nearing $19.98 million. This is a strong indication of the overall market’s trust and confidence in Mutuum’s vision and solidifies its position as a top new crypto. In order to build a deep liquidity foundation for this purpose, Mutuum Finance offers a strategic incentive system to all its ecosystem players. It rewards its liquidity providers with extra benefits in addition to the base interest they earn. For example, if a user invests $5,000 in USDC in a Peer-to-Contract pool with a 7% APY interest rate, they could also get an extra 5% as an incentive. This will take the overall interest to around 12%. Borrowers also get rewarded with extra benefits in the form of rebates. For example, if a user borrows $6,000 with a 9% interest rate in a Peer-to-Contract pool, they could get an extra 3% in MUTM token form as a rebate. This will take their overall interest down to 6%. This will encourage more users to take part in this ecosystem by offering them efficient benefits in the form of rewards from 10% of the overall MUTM token supply. Risk Protocols and Live Testing In addition, security and stability are also integrated into Mutuum Finance through a smart system of dynamic risk management, in which Loan-To-Value ratios and liquidation levels are intelligently managed according to asset price volatility. For well-established assets such as ETH and USDT, LTV levels go as high as 75%, and liquidation occurs at 80%. A holder, for example, would thus be able to leverage $8,000 in ETH and borrow up to $6,000 in stablecoins without selling his/her holdings. Before the official debut on the mainnet network, the project will be launching a fully featured Version 1 on the Sepolia testnet. During this public test phase, the project will allow the public to interact directly with the core features of the project by depositing funds into liquidity pools managing mtTokens as well as debt positions, while also allowing them to observe the liquidation process in a risk-free environment. Thus, the project will be offering not only security but also early access to the market while positioning MUTM as a well-thought-out project with great investment potential. Dogecoin’s run in 2021 created multiple millionaires. However, its lack of utility saw these gains go away as quickly as they were made. Mutuum Finance presents a utility-backed case that stands out from what Dogecoin offered.

57482037,658999,1769443221,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57482037.jpeg,Bitcoin Bulls Eye Dollar Weakness As Yen Intervention Rumors Build,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bulls-dollar-weakness-yen-intervention/,"Bitcoin traders are once again anchoring to FX, after intervention rumors around USD/JPY revived a familiar tug-of-war: short-term shock risk from a strengthening yen versus the longer-horizon bid that typically follows a softer dollar and easier global liquidity. The spark over the weekend was a viral X thread (2.9 million views) from Bull Theory (@BullTheoryio), which framed reported “rate checks” by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as a prelude to coordinated action. “The New York Fed has already done rate checks, which is the exact step taken before real currency intervention,” the account wrote. “That means the US is preparing to sell dollars and buy yen. This is rare. And historically, when this happens, global markets surge.” Bitcoin In The Crosshairs Bull Theory pointed to the macro backdrop in Japan , years of yen weakness, Japanese bond yields at multi-decade highs, and a still-hawkish Bank of Japan, as the pressure cooker forcing officials toward more aggressive signaling. In the thread’s telling, the key variable is coordination: Japan acting alone “does not work,” while joint US-Japan action “does,” citing 1998 and the Plaza Accord era as historical reference points. A Bloomberg report cited by the account described the yen’s sharp jump on speculation that Japanese authorities could be preparing intervention to arrest the currency’s slide, after traders reported the New York Fed had conducted rate checks with major banks. The story said the yen rallied as much as roughly 1.6% to around 155.90 per dollar, marking its strongest level since December in that session. THE FED IS PREPARING TO SELL U.S. DOLLARS AND BUY JAPANESE YEN FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS CENTURY. The New York Fed has already done rate checks, which is the exact step taken before real currency intervention. That means the U.S. is preparing to sell dollars and buy yen. This… pic.twitter.com/7xFReOFoDo — Bull Theory (@BullTheoryio) January 25, 2026 The fight in the replies was less about whether markets moved and more about what a “rate check” actually signals. Daniel Kostecki (@Dan_Kostecki) dismissed the viral framing outright, arguing the mechanism is often misread. “The Japanese asked the NY Fed to act as their agent in the American market,” Kostecki wrote. “NY Fed employees then started calling banks in New York to perform the ‘rate check’—strictly at the Japanese’s request. If officials from Tokyo had called New York banks, traders might have ignored it as a ‘local Japanese problem.’ But when the Fed calls, banks treat it as a signal that a joint intervention (USA + Japan) might be coming.” That distinction matters for crypto because the thread’s “bull case” leans heavily on the idea that selling dollars to buy yen mechanically weakens the dollar and expands liquidity , conditions many macro-focused crypto traders associate with risk-asset upside. Ted (@TedPillows) echoed the liquidity-first interpretation while flagging the path dependency. “The Fed is preparing for a possible yen intervention,” he wrote, before laying out the causal chain: dollars sold, yen bought, dollar weaker, liquidity higher, risk assets helped, then warning that “a strengthening yen could first cause a similar crash like in August 2024.” After that, he added, markets could stabilize and rally. Michael A. Gayed (@leadlagreport), Portfolio Manager of The Free Markets ETF, offered a different rationale for why Washington would care, suggesting the Fed is acting to prevent a scenario where Japan would need to sell US Treasuries to raise dollars to intervene—“It’s not that Japan will panic. It’s the Fed that will panic,” he wrote. Bull Theory’s most concrete crypto claim was that the setup contains both a near-term trap and a medium-term tailwind. The account argued there are “hundreds of billions of dollars tied into the yen carry trade ,” meaning abrupt yen strength can force deleveraging in the very assets, stocks and crypto, funded with cheap yen borrowing. As an example, the account pointed to August 2024, claiming a small BoJ rate hike pushed the yen higher and “Bitcoin crashed from $64K to $49K in six days,” with crypto losing “$600B in value.” Bull Theory framed that episode as the template for the “catch” in 2026: yen strength can be toxic in the first act, even if sustained dollar weakness ultimately improves the liquidity backdrop for Bitcoin. LondonCryptoClub (@LDNCryptoClub) leaned into that lagged-liquidity framing, arguing that a weaker dollar tends to filter into risk assets with a delay, while also introducing an additional US liquidity variable. “Continued and accelerated breakdown of the dollar will be good for Bitcoin and broad risk over the next few months,” the account wrote, adding that the dollar “tends to act with a 3 months lag” outside of “knee jerk reactions.” It also warned that a potential US government shutdown and subsequent Treasury General Account rebuild could offset some of the positive liquidity impulse.

XRP now sits at the intersection of these forces, with retail traders chasing short-term gains while institutions increasingly explore its potential for high-volume cross-border liquidity . Understanding which side drives sustainable value has become crucial for investors entering 2026. X Finance Bull recently highlighted remarks from Dilip Rao , former Global Head of Infrastructure Innovation at Ripple, made during a 2025 panel at the Global Islamic Economy Summit. Rao emphasized that XRP is not designed primarily for retail speculation but as a bridging mechanism for sophisticated institutions. “A lot of it, as you say, is very shallow trading by individuals, and that is not the use case that we are pursuing,” Rao explained. He added that retail activity generates “a lot of noise” that distracts from XRP’s role in solving quadrillion-dollar liquidity problems. Dilip Rao, former Ripple infrastructure head, said it clearly $XRP isn't for retail trading. It's a bridging mechanism for institutions and wholesale finance. Retail noise is a distraction. XRP is solving quadrillion-dollar problems. Accumulate $XRP while you still can. pic.twitter.com/XCVb8X9866 — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) January 25, 2026 XRP’s Role as an Institutional Bridging Asset Rao described XRP as a financial instrument built for high-volume, wholesale finance rather than casual trading. He stated, “What we are pursuing is the use of XRP as a financial asset by sophisticated institutions as a bridging mechanism.” This framing underscores Ripple’s strategy to align XRP with the operational needs of banks, remittance networks, and corporate treasury functions, enabling real-time, low-cost cross-border settlements. Recent quarters have reflected this institutional focus, with the majority of XRP sales directed toward large-scale buyers rather than retail traders. This strategic allocation allows XRP to support massive liquidity flows efficiently, positioning the network to serve global markets with trillions in annual cross-border transactions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Retail Noise vs. Institutional Adoption While retail speculation drives short-term volatility, Rao emphasized that it does not define XRP’s ultimate trajectory. He explained that as XRP transitions toward institutional use, the market will experience a turning point marked by adoption in wholesale finance . This shift prioritizes structural utility over momentary hype, giving XRP a foundation for sustainable long-term growth. Strategic Implications for Investors X Finance Bull interprets Rao’s comments as a clear message for market participants: accumulating XRP now provides an opportunity to participate before broader institutional adoption peaks. Unlike assets fueled primarily by retail activity, XRP’s value lies in its ability to address systemic liquidity needs and integrate into large-scale financial infrastructure. In essence, XRP is evolving from a retail-traded token into a purpose-built financial tool. Investors who recognize this transition can position themselves strategically, aligning with a market that increasingly values utility, scale, and institutional trust over short-term speculation.

57482255,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=265441,1769443812,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Nvidia’s Strategic $2B Investment Empowers CoreWeave to Expand AI Compute Capacity by 5 Gigawatts,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/nvidia-coreweave-ai-compute-investment/,"BitcoinWorld Nvidia’s Strategic $2B Investment Empowers CoreWeave to Expand AI Compute Capacity by 5 Gigawatts In a landmark move that underscores the intensifying race for artificial intelligence infrastructure, Nvidia Corporation announced a substantial $2 billion investment in CoreWeave on Monday, October 13, 2025. This strategic capital infusion aims to accelerate CoreWeave’s ambitious plan to add more than 5 gigawatts of AI computing capacity by 2030, directly addressing the explosive global demand for computational resources. The investment represents a significant vote of confidence in CoreWeave’s business model despite recent scrutiny over its substantial debt obligations, which totaled $18.81 billion as of September 2025 according to PitchBook data. Nvidia’s Deepening Partnership with CoreWeave Nvidia, already an existing investor in CoreWeave, purchased Class A shares at $87.20 per share as part of this latest financial commitment. Consequently, this transaction strengthens the symbiotic relationship between the chipmaking giant and the specialized cloud provider. The collaboration extends beyond mere financial support, encompassing joint development of “AI factories”—advanced data centers specifically optimized for artificial intelligence workloads. These facilities will leverage Nvidia’s complete technology stack, including the forthcoming Rubin chip architecture designed to succeed the current Blackwell platform. Furthermore, CoreWeave will integrate multiple Nvidia product lines across its platform. The integration includes Bluefield storage systems and Vera, Nvidia’s new CPU line. This comprehensive technological alignment ensures CoreWeave’s infrastructure remains at the cutting edge of AI computation. The partnership also involves Nvidia assisting CoreWeave with critical infrastructure development, including land acquisition and power procurement for new data center locations. The Financial Context and Market Response CoreWeave reported $1.36 billion in revenue for the third quarter of 2025, demonstrating substantial growth since its transition from cryptocurrency mining to AI-focused data center services. The company’s shares surged more than 15% following the investment announcement, reflecting market optimism about Nvidia’s endorsement. However, analysts continue to monitor CoreWeave’s debt-heavy strategy, which involves using its GPU inventory as collateral for financing expansion. CEO Michael Intrator has consistently defended this approach, citing the “violent change in supply and demand” within the AI industry that necessitates unconventional financing methods. CoreWeave’s Aggressive Expansion Strategy Since its initial public offering in March 2024, CoreWeave has pursued an aggressive growth strategy through both organic expansion and strategic acquisitions. The company successfully transitioned from cryptocurrency mining operations to become a premier provider of GPU-accelerated cloud services for AI training and inference. This pivot positioned CoreWeave to capitalize on the generative AI revolution that began gaining momentum in late 2022. CoreWeave’s acquisition spree has significantly enhanced its technology portfolio: Weights & Biases (March 2025): An AI developer platform for experiment tracking and model management OpenPipe (April 2025): A reinforcement learning startup specializing in efficient model training Marimo (October 2025 agreement): An open-source alternative to Jupyter notebooks Monolith (October 2025 agreement): Another AI technology company expanding CoreWeave’s capabilities The company has also expanded its cloud partnership with OpenAI and counts several hyperscalers as customers, including Meta and Microsoft. This diverse client base demonstrates CoreWeave’s growing importance in the AI infrastructure ecosystem. The AI Infrastructure Arms Race The Nvidia-CoreWeave partnership occurs against the backdrop of an intensifying global competition for AI computational resources. Industry analysts estimate that global demand for AI compute will increase tenfold between 2023 and 2030, creating unprecedented pressure on infrastructure providers. Nvidia’s investment represents one of dozens the company has made over the past year to fuel continued development in the AI sector, where it maintains dominant market position in AI accelerator chips. This investment also addresses concerns about “circular deals” in the AI industry, where companies invest in each other to create artificial demand. Michael Intrator has addressed these concerns directly, stating that companies must “work together” to solve the fundamental supply-demand imbalance. The 5-gigawatt expansion target represents enough computational power to support training of increasingly large and complex AI models that require thousands of GPUs operating simultaneously for months. Technical Integration and Future Roadmap The partnership includes technical collaboration beyond simple product integration. Nvidia and CoreWeave plan to incorporate CoreWeave’s AI software and architecture within Nvidia’s reference architecture for sale to cloud businesses and enterprises. This collaboration creates a vertically integrated solution that could potentially become an industry standard for AI infrastructure deployment. The timeline for the 5-gigawatt expansion extends through 2030, with incremental capacity additions planned each year. This gradual approach allows for technological evolution as Nvidia introduces new architectures like Rubin, while managing the substantial capital requirements of data center construction. Each gigawatt of AI computing capacity represents approximately $5-7 billion in infrastructure investment when accounting for buildings, power systems, cooling, and networking equipment. Industry Implications and Competitive Landscape Nvidia’s deepening relationship with CoreWeave has significant implications for the broader cloud computing and AI infrastructure markets. Traditional hyperscalers like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure now face increased competition from specialized providers like CoreWeave that focus exclusively on AI workloads. The investment also strengthens Nvidia’s position against emerging competitors in the AI chip market, including AMD, Intel, and various startups developing alternative AI accelerators. The table below illustrates key metrics comparing CoreWeave’s position before and after the Nvidia investment: Metric Pre-Investment (Q3 2025) Post-Investment Target AI Compute Capacity Approximately 1.2 GW 6.2+ GW by 2030 Debt Obligations $18.81 billion Expected to increase with expansion Quarterly Revenue $1.36 billion Projected significant growth Share Price Pre-announcement levels 15%+ increase post-announcement Conclusion Nvidia’s $2 billion investment in CoreWeave represents a strategic alignment between the dominant AI chipmaker and a rapidly growing infrastructure specialist. This partnership accelerates the expansion of AI compute capacity by 5 gigawatts, addressing critical infrastructure needs for the next generation of artificial intelligence development. While CoreWeave’s debt-heavy financing model continues to draw scrutiny, Nvidia’s substantial investment provides validation of its approach to meeting explosive AI demand. The collaboration on “AI factories” and technology integration positions both companies to capitalize on the ongoing AI revolution, potentially reshaping the competitive landscape for cloud infrastructure and computational resources through the remainder of the decade.

By 2029, AAVE could reach a maximum price of $477.67. In 2032, AAVE will range between $658.59 to $776.19. Aave is a decentralized lending protocol on the Ethereum blockchain . It is known for its innovative financial solutions, such as flash loans, which allow users to borrow instantly without collateral, and dynamic interest rates that adapt to market conditions. Participants in the Aave ecosystem can deposit their digital crypto assets back into liquidity pools to earn interest payments or obtain loans by borrowing funds without providing collateral. Aave’s governance and fee distribution are significantly driven by its native token, AAVE, enhancing its utility and value within the platform. Having touched its ATH at $666.86 in May 2021, how much will AAVE be worth in 2026? Is AAVE worth holding? Let’s get into the Aave technical analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Aave Ticker AAVE Current price $152.37 Market cap $2.315B Trading volume (24-h) $399.47M Circulating supply 15.18M AAVE All-time high $666.86 on May 19, 2021 All-time low $26.02 on Nov 5, 2020 24-hour low $145.76 24-hour high $154.24 Aave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 5.23% (High) 50-day SMA $169.24 14-Day RSI 37.12 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 20 (Extreme Fear) Green days 12/30 (40%) 200-Day SMA $235.64 Aave 1-day price analysis Key takeaways : AAVE is rebounding short-term, but the daily trend is still bearish. $155–158 is the key resistance zone; rejection there keeps downside risk active. Only a reclaim of $164 on the daily would signal a real trend shift. Aave 1-day price chart On the 1-day chart for January 26, AAVE closed around $152.7 after a +3.2% session, bouncing modestly from the recent $147–148 local low. Despite this green close, the price remains firmly below the 20-day SMA near $164 and well under the upper Bollinger Band around $181, confirming that the broader daily trend is still bearish. From the recent swing high near $178, AAVE has already corrected roughly 14–15%, and this rebound has not yet reclaimed any key moving averages. AAVEUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView Momentum indicators continue to reflect weakness rather than reversal. The daily MACD is deeply negative, with widening separation between the signal and MACD lines, suggesting downside momentum has slowed but not flipped. The RSI sits near 41, recovering slightly but still below the neutral 50 level, which historically signals rallies are corrective unless buyers regain control above mid-range. The $155–158 zone now acts as first resistance; failure to reclaim it keeps risk skewed toward another retest of $147. A daily close back above $164 would be the first meaningful signal that downside pressure is easing. Aave 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour timeframe, AAVE shows a clearer relief structure after the sharp sell-off toward $146, rebounding nearly 5% into the $152–153 area. The price is attempting to stabilize near the Alligator’s lips and teeth, but remains below the jaw around $155, meaning the short-term trend has not fully turned bullish yet. This rebound looks more like a technical reaction than a confirmed trend reversal. AAVEUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The 4-hour MACD has just crossed back toward the zero line, with the histogram turning positive, signaling that short-term bullish momentum is building. However, CMF remains negative, indicating that capital inflows are still weak and that buying pressure lacks conviction. As long as AAVE holds above $148, sideways consolidation or a push toward $155–158 is possible, but rejection there would likely resume the broader downtrend. A clean 4-hour close above $155 would be needed to shift short-term structure decisively upward. Aave technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $161.36 SELL SMA 5 $157.22 SELL SMA 10 $159.13 SELL SMA 21 $167.29 SELL SMA 50 $169.24 SELL SMA 100 $186.17 SELL SMA 200 $235.64 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $165.48 SELL EMA 5 $165.54 SELL EMA 10 $163.57 SELL EMA 21 $164.60 SELL EMA 50 $176.08 SELL EMA 100 $198.02 SELL EMA 200 $219.44 SELL AAVE price analysis conclusion Daily structure dominates and remains bearish, while the 4-hour chart suggests only a corrective bounce. Upside attempts toward $155–$158 are likely to face resistance unless volume and momentum expand meaningfully. Loss of $147 would reopen downside risk toward the low $140s. Is AAVE a good investment? Aave provides the essential infrastructure for lending and borrowing within DeFi, expanding beyond traditional applications into gaming, NFTs, and dApps. AAVE token plays a vital role in powering the platform, making it a strong choice for investors due to its proven market success and continuous development. Where to buy AAVE?

That’s not some rounded-up estimate. It’s the real number, built from 14 separate funding rounds, tracked by Dealroom. In 2020 and 2021, Nvidia didn’t invest in a single European tech company. One deal showed up in 2022, five in 2023, and seven in 2024. But in 2025, the pace exploded. Out of 86 global startup investments, nearly a fifth were in Europe. The whole thing wasn’t random. Nvidia, along with its venture arm NVentures, zeroed in on European companies across AI, data centers, quantum, semiconductors, automation, fintech, and biotech. They didn’t just dip a toe. They went all in. Nvidia pumped money into AI labs, cloud startups, and quantum projects The biggest deal of the year was with Mistral , a French AI firm building models to go head-to-head with OpenAI and Google. Nvidia invested in two rounds for the startup, first in 2024 and then in September 2025, joining a €1.7 billion Series C that valued Mistral at €11.7 billion or about $13.6 billion. UK-based Nscale came next. The company builds AI cloud infrastructure and data centers. Jensen Huang announced in September that Nvidia was committing £500 million. Two funding rounds followed ($1.1 billion in September and $433 million in October) with Nvidia in both. Quantinuum, a quantum computing startup, landed a $600 million round in September. The deal gave it a $10 billion valuation, and the cash will help it launch its next-gen system called Helios. Then there’s Black Forest Labs, a German company building visual AI models. Nvidia joined a16z , General Catalyst, and Salesforce Ventures in a $300 million December raise that gave the company a $3.25 billion valuation. Lovable, which makes “vibe coding” software, raised $330 million in December with help from Nvidia, Alphabet’s venture unit, and Menlo Ventures. The company was valued at $6.6 billion. More startups across biotech, automation, and fintech got Nvidia’s money too German startup N8n, which automates business workflows, closed a $180 million Series C in October at a $2.5 billion valuation. Nvidia joined Accel, Meritech, and Redpoint on that one. UK-based CuspAI builds an AI platform to help find new materials. It raised $100 million in September with Nvidia as one of the investors. In December, NVentures took part in PolyAI’s $86 million Series D. The British company makes voice assistants for call centers and customer service. NVentures also joined its $50 million Series C in May 2024. Charm Therapeutics, a biotech firm working out of the UK, pulled in $80 million in September. Nvidia had already invested $20 million back in 2023 and came back for more. France’s Scintil Photonics secured €50 million in September. The company designs photonic integrated circuits to help with data flow inside AI data centers . The round also featured Bosch Ventures, Bpifrance, and Innovacom. Another UK startup, PhysicsX, raised $20 million in November. Nvidia joined the deal and also grabbed rights to invest $80 million more in the next round. The company is working on tools that help engineers simulate physics when designing physical systems. Nvidia also made undisclosed investments in Cassava Technologies and Revolut. Cassava, based in the UK but focused on internet and data center infrastructure in Africa, got funding in October. Revolut , the UK-based fintech giant, confirmed in November that Nvidia bought shares at a $75 billion valuation. Meanwhile, investors were piling into European equities like crazy. BlackRock’s Ursula Marchioni said European-focused exchange-traded funds pulled in $92 billion in 2025. That’s almost as much as they took in from 2014 to 2024 combined. She called it a “decade in a year.” Marchioni said the flood was driven by the urge to stay exposed to AI but still diversify away from the U.S. She said, “We’ve seen last year the great repatriation trade… there is this desire to diversify and remain exposed to the AI trade and to the US, but with some form of protection.” Government spending is rising across Europe, especially from Germany, and analysts from Bloomberg Intelligence say Stoxx 600 profits might climb 10% this year, after flatlining in 2025. European stocks have also been ripping. In dollar terms, they’re up 37% since last January, which is double what the S&P 500 delivered. It’s not just tech. Banks, miners, and defense stocks have all jumped too. Valuations are still cheaper than in the U.S., with a 30% discount on the Stoxx 600 compared to U.S. equities.

Others set them in motion. This one falls into the latter category, spotlighting the patterns that quietly repeat before the market notices, and momentum explodes. From community-driven networks to privacy-focused chains and next-gen infrastructure builders, the coins shaping this cycle are already in plain sight: Cardano, Solana, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash, Chainlink, Sui, Monero, World Liberty Financial, Polkadot, and APEMARS. Each represents a unique philosophy, yet together they define the emerging crypto landscape. In the middle of this mix of top 10 coins is APEMARS. Not as a replacement for established chains, but as a cultural layer forming around them. Built with a sharp focus on community mechanics and long-term incentives, APEMARS is designed to thrive alongside major crypto movements rather than compete directly with them. That difference matters as the next phase unfolds. APEMARS – Top Coin Presale Hits Momentum Engine APEMARS Stage 5, officially titled VOID VIBES, is now live, and the pace is unmistakable. Over $108k has already been raised, with 543 holders securing positions and more than 4.9 billion tokens sold. Stage 5 priced tokens at 0.00003629, while the confirmed listing price stands at 0.0055, translating into projected returns exceeding 15,055 percent from Stage 5. With only one day left before the next stage begins, the countdown is real. What fuels urgency is structure. If this stage sells out before the timer expires, the system auto-advances. No extensions. No mercy. This is where top 10 coins narratives are born, especially when Ethereum price volatility pushes attention toward presales with controlled supply mechanics. As one of the best altcoins to invest during this phase, APEMARS sits firmly in the top crypto conversation while still offering a low-entry window that disappears fast. Beyond timing, utilities drive conviction. APEMARS token burns are not symbolic. According to the whitepaper, burns are tied directly to ecosystem activity, shrinking circulating supply as engagement rises. This creates compounding pressure that benefits early participants. Alongside this, the referral rewards system transforms community growth into a measurable advantage, incentivizing holders to actively expand the network. That combination positions APEMARS as a big crypto contender with real mechanics behind the momentum. Quiet Accumulation Produces Loud Results Presale phases allow accumulation without public attention or emotional interference. In this investment scenario, committing $2,500 during Stage 5 positions the investor for an estimated $376,375 at listing under the 15,055% ROI model. The advantage lies in operating while the market is silent. How to Buy APEMARS Start by connecting a supported wallet directly on the APEMARS platform. Once connected, select your preferred cryptocurrency for purchase. Enter the amount you wish to invest, review the allocation, and proceed. If you have a referral or bonus code, apply it before confirming. After purchase, your tokens will appear instantly in your dashboard, reflecting your position in the current stage. Cardano – Research Driven Scalability Cardano continues to evolve through methodical development and peer-reviewed research. Its layered architecture enables upgrades without disrupting the network, appealing to institutions and developers alike. As reported by the best crypto to buy now , this steady approach positions Cardano as a long-term infrastructure play rather than a speculative swing. While price action may feel restrained at times, Cardano’s focus on governance and sustainability keeps it relevant. In volatile cycles, projects with clear academic foundations often regain attention when speculation cools. Solana – High-Speed Ecosystem Growth Solana remains synonymous with speed and throughput. Its ability to process thousands of transactions per second has attracted builders across DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. Despite past network challenges, improvements continue to strengthen reliability. Solana’s ecosystem thrives on activity. When user demand accelerates, networks built for scale tend to benefit disproportionately, keeping Solana firmly in the conversation. Stellar – Global Payment Rails Stellar’s strength lies in cross-border payments and real-world financial integration. By focusing on low-cost transfers and partnerships with financial institutions, Stellar targets utility rather than hype. As global payment narratives expand, Stellar’s role as a bridge between traditional finance and blockchain keeps it strategically positioned for steady relevance. Bitcoin Cash – Peer-to-Peer Payment Utility Bitcoin Cash was created to prioritize everyday usability, offering faster confirmations and lower transaction fees than traditional Bitcoin transfers. Its design supports frequent, small-value payments, making it suitable for merchants and users seeking practical digital cash solutions. While market attention often shifts between narratives, Bitcoin Cash continues to focus on transactional efficiency. During periods when usability regains importance, its payment-first philosophy allows it to re-enter discussions as a functional alternative within the broader crypto economy. Chainlink – Decentralized Data Connectivity Chainlink plays a critical role behind the scenes by providing secure and reliable data feeds to smart contracts. Its decentralized oracle network enables blockchains to interact with real-world information, powering everything from DeFi protocols to insurance platforms. As decentralized applications grow more complex, dependable data becomes essential. Chainlink’s widespread integration across ecosystems reinforces its importance as infrastructure rather than speculation, positioning it as a foundational layer supporting blockchain innovation. Sui – Next-Generation Layer-One Design Sui introduces a modern approach to blockchain scalability through its object-centric data model. This structure allows transactions to process in parallel, reducing congestion and improving overall network efficiency. Developers benefit from greater flexibility when building applications that require speed and responsiveness. With growing interest in user-friendly blockchain experiences, Sui’s emphasis on performance and simplicity makes it appealing to both builders and end users. Its architecture reflects a forward-looking vision tailored to evolving demand. Monero – Privacy-Focused Digital Currency Monero is widely recognized for its commitment to privacy and anonymity. By default, transactions are confidential, obscuring sender, receiver, and amount details. This makes Monero a preferred option for users who prioritize financial privacy in an increasingly transparent digital environment. Its consistent focus on privacy has allowed Monero to maintain a loyal community. As discussions around data protection and personal sovereignty intensify, privacy-centric networks like Monero continue to hold strategic relevance. World Liberty Financial – Structured DeFi Framework World Liberty Financial aims to merge decentralized finance with structured financial models. Its vision centers on providing accessible tools while maintaining clarity and compliance, appealing to users seeking balance between innovation and reliability. As decentralized systems mature, projects attempting to align financial structure with blockchain efficiency attract attention. World Liberty Financial represents this emerging category, offering a framework designed for sustainable participation. Polkadot – Interoperable Blockchain Ecosystem Polkadot addresses one of blockchain’s biggest challenges: fragmentation. Through its parachain system, multiple blockchains can operate independently while sharing security and interoperability. This design encourages collaboration rather than competition across networks. By enabling seamless communication between chains, Polkadot supports diverse use cases under one umbrella. Its interoperability focus positions it as a long-term solution for an increasingly interconnected blockchain landscape. Final Words On Top 10 Coins: Where Conviction Meets Timing This list of top 10 coins reflects diversity in strategy and vision. From established networks like Cardano and Polkadot to utility-focused chains like Chainlink and Stellar, each serves a distinct role. Yet among them, APEMARS stands apart through timing, structure, and incentive design. As Ethereum price narratives shape broader sentiment, early-stage opportunities with defined mechanics gain appeal. APEMARS emerges as the most compelling presale option this year, combining urgency with substance.

The top 10 coins are defined by relevance, utility, and timing. They combine active development, strong communities, and narratives that align with current market conditions rather than short-term speculation alone. How does Ethereum price affect market sentiment? Ethereum price movements often influence overall confidence, guiding capital flow toward alternative projects when volatility increases, especially those offering differentiated value or early-stage access. Why consider presales among established projects? Presales offer asymmetric exposure. While established coins provide stability, early-stage entries can deliver higher growth potential when supported by clear mechanics and active communities. Are utility-driven tokens more sustainable? Tokens with real utility tend to maintain relevance longer. Features like supply control and incentive systems help align long-term participation with network growth. Summary This article explored the top 10 coins shaping the current cycle, including Cardano, Solana, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash, Chainlink, Sui, Monero, World Liberty Financial, Polkadot, and APEMARS. Each represents a unique approach to blockchain adoption. As discussions around Ethereum price continue, attention shifts toward projects balancing innovation and opportunity. Together, these coins illustrate how infrastructure, privacy, interoperability, and community-driven models coexist within today’s evolving crypto landscape.",Press Release,EN,0,0,BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-26 16:15:00

The World Liberty Financial-issued stablecoin reached a market capitalization of nearly $4.9 billion, overtaking PayPal’s PYUSD at roughly $3.75 billion. Trading activity reflected the shift. USD1 logged more than $2.2 billion in 24-hour volume, far above PYUSD's $134 million, signaling deeper on-chain usage and exchange engagement. Market Rankings Highlight a Changing Stablecoin Order The move pushed USD1 into the top tier of crypto assets, ranking near the mid-20s among the largest digital currencies by market value. PYUSD slipped several positions lower despite its backing from a global fintech brand. Holder data underscored the divergence. USD1 reported nearly 583,000 holders compared with about 101,000 for PYUSD. Circulating supply figures showed full issuance for both tokens, which placed market cap differences squarely on adoption rather than token mechanics. Eric Trump Confirms the Milestone Eric Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and co-founder of World Liberty Financial, confirmed that USD1 surpassed PYUSD in market capitalization. He described the move as a major milestone for the project and framed USD1 as an emerging digital dollar platform. His comments drew attention to the growing influence of politically linked crypto ventures within a sector long dominated by fintech and exchange-issued stablecoins. Lending Integration Fuels USD1 Demand World Liberty Financial expanded USD1’s utility by pushing the token into crypto lending markets. The firm launched World Liberty Markets, an onchain borrowing and lending platform built around USD1 and the WLFI governance token. Users can post collateral such as Ether, tokenized Bitcoin, and major stablecoins like USDC and USDT. The platform supports both lending and borrowing within a single marketplace, increasing transactional demand for USD1. Company executives said they plan to add more collateral types over time, including tokenized real-world assets. They also confirmed discussions with exchanges, prediction markets, and real estate platforms. These steps place USD1 at the center of onchain credit flows rather than limiting it to payments alone. Regulatory Shifts Reshape Stablecoin Incentives Regulatory developments also played a role in USD1’s rise. Changes linked to the GENIUS Act reshaped how stablecoin issuers and exchanges structure incentives. While issuers face limits on direct interest payments, exchanges have expanded reward programs tied to trading and usage. Binance initiatives, including booster-style programs, supported USD1 liquidity and visibility across global markets. The regulatory environment encouraged exchange-based adoption while favoring stablecoins that integrate easily into trading, lending, and treasury workflows. That structure helped USD1 scale faster than fintech-issued alternatives focused primarily on payments. Banking Ambitions Add a New Dimension World Liberty Financial recently applied for a U.S. national trust bank charter through its subsidiary, World Liberty Trust Company. The firm aims to issue and custody USD1 under a regulated banking framework designed specifically for stablecoin operations. Executives said the structure would support zero-fee conversion to U.S. dollars at launch and broaden USD1’s role in cross-border payments and treasury management. Industry leaders took note. BitGo CEO Mike Belshe said his firm supported USD1’s growth past $3.3 billion and plans to continue as a strategic partner as the trust bank effort moves forward. Stablecoin Competition Enters a New Stage Historical data shows no prior case of a family-linked stablecoin surpassing a major fintech-backed digital dollar in market size. USD1’s rise now raises broader questions about how politics, regulation, and onchain finance intersect. As USD1 expands across lending, exchanges, and regulated banking ambitions, the stablecoin market appears to be entering a new competitive phase.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|PYUSD|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-26 16:18:03

The Financial Services Agency (FSA) aims to amend existing law so that Bitcoin, Ethereum and similar assets qualify as eligible assets for ETFs under Japan’s investment regulations, rather than being limited by the current framework. This change would let major institutions and investment firms launch regulated crypto ETF products that retail and institutional investors can buy on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Key financial players such as SBI Holdings and Nomura Holdings have already begun preparing products ahead of the expected approval. The FSA’s plan stems from broader regulatory modernization. Japan has been restructuring its crypto rules for several years, moving oversight from the Payment Services Act to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA). This transition will bring digital asset investment products closer to traditional securities, with clearer obligations for disclosures, custody and investor protections. Regulatory Shift and Market Impact Allowing spot crypto ETFs would align Japan with global markets where similar products already exist, including the United States and Canada. Japan’s timeline is slower by design, reflecting a cautious approach that emphasizes investor safety and market stability. Alongside ETF approval, Japan is considering broader fiscal changes. Reports indicate moves toward a flat 20% tax rate on crypto profits — down from a top rate of 55% — to harmonize digital assets with equities and encourage investment. This tax reform could coincide with ETF availability, making crypto exposure more efficient for investors. Japan also has one of the world’s largest active crypto investor bases, with more than 13 million accounts nationwide. That growing participation has pressured regulators to modernize laws and protect residents from fraud while supporting innovation. Historical Context and Future Outlook Japan was among the first major economies to regulate cryptocurrencies, starting in 2017 when Bitcoin was legally recognized as a form of payment. Since then, the FSA has built a comprehensive regime covering exchanges, custody, and compliance, often tightening rules after fraud and exchange collapses. Spot crypto ETFs would represent the next phase of this evolution, bringing digital assets into mainstream financial products. Investors could gain regulated exposure without directly holding crypto wallets, and ETFs could attract capital from both domestic and international sources once listed. Japan’s move reflects a global trend toward regulated crypto investment products, balancing accessibility, oversight, and market growth.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-26 16:24:09

The blockchain pioneer recently said he’s changed his mind about how users should interact with and check blockchain networks. Buterin caused a stir in 2017 when he referred to the notion of individuals verifying blockchain data on their own as a “weird mountain man fantasy.” He now claims that viewpoint was incorrect. His latest remarks on X demonstrate that he has been persuaded to change direction by both new technologies and lessons learned over the years. The 2017 debate over blockchain design The change brings up a long-standing debate over the proper operation of blockchains. That year, Buterin and blockchain theory researcher Ian Grigg engaged in a public argument. According to Grigg, blockchains should simply record transaction times. He reasoned that the real state of affairs, such as how much money people have or what smart contracts are doing, could be recreated on separate machines and subsequently discarded. Buterin strongly opposed that idea . He said it would force people to constantly replay every transaction that ever happened just to know what’s current, or they would have to rely on outside services to tell them what’s going on. Buterin advocated for Ethereum’s approach instead. Snapshots of the network’s state get attached to each block. With something called Merkle proofs and assuming most miners or validators are honest, users could check specific information without depending on a middleman. The problem with making everyone verify everything themselves, Buterin argued back then, was that regular computers couldn’t handle it. The only way to make it work would be to severely limit how much the network could do. New cryptography changes the equation So what changed? The answer is zk-SNARKs, a type of advanced math that lets someone prove they did a bunch of calculations correctly without having to show their work or make others redo everything. After years of having to choose between poor solutions, Buterin characterizes zk-SNARKs as discovering an inexpensive, universal solution. Thanks to this technique, Ethereum can now provide full verification security without making it excessively costly or challenging for average users. He says this breakthrough means Ethereum can rethink compromises it once had no choice but to accept. That’s particularly true when it comes to scaling up, staying decentralized, and allowing peopl e to ve rify things themselves. Buterin also admit s hi s earlier thinking depended too much on perfect conditions. In the real world, networks fail. In addition to slowing down connections and shutting down services, middlemen may be forced to prohibit specific apps or users due to external pressure from society or governments. When those issues arise, relying on other parties or requiring developers to intervene becomes a vulnerability. That realization supports his renewed interest in what he calls the “mountain man’s cabin” idea. It’s a backup plan that lets people work directly with the blockchain when everything else falls apart. zk-SNARKs are now a major focus of Ethereum’s development plans, particularly through zero-knowledge rollups. By processing thousands of transactions off the main chain and giving Ethereum a single cryptographic proof, these second-layer networks significantly reduce expenses. These methods are already being used in projects like zkSync , StarkNet, and Scroll . Regarding proof size, transparency, and processing costs, each person adopts a different strategy. Around mid-2025, community members suggested that keeping personal information off-chain and using cryptographic proofs might help Ethereum meet European data protection requirements. Zk-SNARKs came up as a way for validators to confirm data is correct without actually seeing it. This would reduce what needs to be stored on-chain. Technically speaking, Buterin has realized that some outdated design decisions currently impede Ethereum’s zero-knowledge objectives. After the modular exponentiation precompile, which he had included himself, proved to be a significant barrier to producing zk proofs, he proposed eliminating it in late 2025.

In an update published on January 26, BitMine said it now holds 4,243,338 ether, giving the company control of roughly 3.52% of Ethereum’s total circulating supply. BitMine provided its latest holdings update for January 26th, 2026: $12.8 billion in total crypto + ""moonshots"": – 4,243,338 ETH at $2,839 ( @coinbase ) – 193 Bitcoin (BTC) – $200 mllion stake in Beast Industries @MrBeast – $19 million stake in Eightco Holdings (NASDAQ: $ORBS )… — Bitmine (NYSE-BMNR) $ETH (@BitMNR) January 26, 2026 At the time of disclosure, the position was valued at roughly $12 billion, making BitMine the largest Ethereum treasury in the world and the second-largest crypto treasury overall, behind Strategy Inc., formerly Strategy, which holds more than 700,000 bitcoin. BitMine Accelerates ETH Accumulation as Prices Slide The disclosure shows how quickly BitMine’s balance sheet has expanded over the past six months. Weekly purchase data shared by the company indicates steady accumulation since late October, 2025, with particularly large buying activity in December. In the week ending January 26 alone, BitMine added just over 40,000 ETH, following purchases of more than 35,000 ETH the prior week and several six-figure ETH buys in December. Last week the company bought the dip, purchasing $110M worth of Ethereum . BitMine @BitMNR now controls 3.48% of Ethereum’s total supply after adding $110M in $ETH during the dip, moving closer to its “Alchemy of 5%” goal. #Ethereum #BitMine https://t.co/W74cW2b8XH — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 21, 2026 The pace of accumulation has continued even as ether prices softened, with ETH down double digits over the past month amid broader market volatility. Ethereum is currently trading at $2,940.44, showing a 2.0% increase over the past hour, which suggests short-term buying pressure returning to the market. Source: Cryptonews On a 24-hour basis, ETH is up a modest 0.4%, indicating relatively stable price action despite broader market fluctuations. However, over the past seven days, Ethereum has declined by 8.4%, reaching as low as $2,787. Source: Bitmine BitMine’s total crypto, cash, and equity holdings now stand at $12.8 billion, according to the company. In addition to its Ethereum position, the firm holds 193 bitcoin, $682 million in cash, a $200 million stake in Beast Industries, and a smaller equity position in Eightco Holdings. BitMine’s Ethereum Bet Moves Closer to the 5% Mark The company trades on the NYSE American under the ticker BMNR and was last priced around $28.50, down modestly on the day and slightly lower over the past week. The Ethereum accumulation is central to BitMine’s stated long-term strategy, as it has publicly set a goal of acquiring 5% of Ethereum’s total supply, a target it refers to as the “alchemy of 5%.” Based on current supply estimates, reaching that level would require roughly 6 million ETH. At current market prices, closing that gap would require several billion dollars in additional capital. BitMine Expands Ethereum Staking as Holdings Grow Beyond holding ether on its balance sheet, BitMine is also expanding its staking operations. As of January 25, the company had staked 2,009,267 ETH, worth about $5.7 billion, representing nearly half of its total holdings. Source: Bitmine Using the composite Ethereum staking rate of roughly 2.81%, BitMine estimates that a fully deployed staking strategy could generate about $374 million in annual fees, or more than $1 million per day. For now, the company relies on external staking providers, but it plans to launch its infrastructure , known as the Made in America Validator Network, or MAVAN, in early 2026. BitMine @BitMNR plans an early-2026 launch of its MAVAN validator network, aiming to turn a $12B Ether treasury into staking yield at scale. #BitMine #Staking https://t.co/YOlkeNouQu — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 30, 2025 Chairman Tom Lee has framed the Ethereum strategy as a long-term bet on institutional adoption of blockchain technology. Speaking after last week’s World Economic Forum meeting in Davos , Lee said discussions among policymakers and business leaders increasingly point to the convergence of traditional finance, crypto, and artificial intelligence. He pointed to Ethereum’s role in tokenization and financial infrastructure projects as evidence that Wall Street is already building on the network.

The same chart shows Bitcoin trading near $89,200 at the latest reading, after a pullback from late 2025 highs. Realized loss spike signals stress, and it can reshape the next move The CryptoQuant NRPL series shows a deep red bar near the far right edge, marking a sharp jump in coins sold at a loss. In past cycles, similar loss spikes tended to appear when leveraged traders and short term holders exited at once, while longer term holders waited for clearer direction. Bitcoin: Net Realized Profit and Loss (NRPL). Source: CryptoQuant A prior episode with comparable capitulation came when Bitcoin traded around $28,000 after a long correction. That pattern matters because heavy realized losses often clear out weak positions, which can reduce near term selling pressure if the rush to exit fades. Still, a loss spike does not guarantee an immediate bottom. If realized losses stay elevated for several sessions, Bitcoin can keep probing lower as sellers test demand. However, if the indicator cools quickly and price holds above recent support zones, the setup often shifts toward a stabilization phase, with sharp rebounds possible as forced selling eases. Bitcoin CME gaps point to nearby upside targets Meanwhile, Bitcoin now shows two open CME futures gaps above spot price, according to a TradingView chart shared by analyst Ted Pillows. The first gap sits near $89,350, while the second clusters around $93,000, levels that formed during recent downside volatility on the CME Bitcoin futures market. BTC1! 45 CME. Source: Ted Pillows on X CME gaps matter because Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange stop trading over the weekend, while spot markets keep moving. When price reopens on Monday, those gaps often act like magnets as liquidity returns. Since October 2025, every visible Bitcoin CME gap has filled within about two weeks, creating a consistent short term tendency rather than a one off event. If that pattern holds, price action may gravitate first toward the $89,350 zone, which also aligns with a nearby consolidation area on the intraday chart. A clean move through that level would leave the $93,000 gap as the next upside reference, especially if selling pressure continues to ease after the recent realized loss spike. Still, timing matters. Gap fills do not require a straight line move. Bitcoin can chop, retest lower support, and still close the gaps later in the window. For now, the presence of two unfilled CME gaps above price shifts short term focus upward, even as broader trend confirmation depends on how BTC behaves around the high $80,000s.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-26 16:39:26

The coordinated campaign represents growing tension between tech workers and federal immigration enforcement. Tech Workers Mobilize Against ICE Operations Workers from Google, Meta, OpenAI, Amazon, and Salesforce signed an open letter through IceOut.Tech. They specifically urge chief executives to contact the White House. The letter demands an immediate withdrawal of federal agents from multiple cities. Organizers cite escalating violence and military-style tactics as primary concerns. Furthermore, the campaign gained momentum after two recent incidents. ICE agents shot and killed U.S. citizen Renee Good three weeks ago. Border Patrol agents then killed 37-year-old Alex Pretti last weekend. Pretti worked as an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital. Many signatories chose anonymity due to fear of workplace retribution. Historical Context of Tech Industry Pressure The letter references a previous successful intervention. Tech leaders collectively called the White House in October when Trump threatened National Guard deployment to San Francisco. That pressure reportedly made Trump back down. Workers now argue similar collective action could halt current operations. Minneapolis as Federal Operation Focal Point Minneapolis has become the center of large-scale immigration enforcement. Federal operations there employ intense tactics that many describe as military occupation. Regular confrontations occur between agents and community protesters. Law enforcement frequently uses crowd control measures. Documented Crowd Control Tactics in Minneapolis Tactic Reported Usage Pepper Spray Widespread deployment Tear Gas Multiple incidents documented Rubber Bullets Used against protesters Sound Cannons Deployed in residential areas Community members report indiscriminate use of these measures. The operations have created widespread fear among immigrant populations. Local organizations document numerous constitutional concerns. Legal challenges against these tactics are currently pending in federal court. Tech Industry Leaders Break Silence Several prominent figures have already spoken against federal actions. LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman criticized ICE operations as “terrible for the people.” Khosla Ventures founder Vinod Khosla described current enforcement as “macho ICE vigilantes running amuck.” Google DeepMind’s chief scientist Jeff Dean called for universal condemnation. He urged “every person regardless of political affiliation” to denounce violence escalation. OpenAI’s head of global business James Dyett highlighted industry hypocrisy on social media. He noted more outrage over wealth taxes than masked agents terrorizing communities. Signal President Meredith Whittaker issued particularly strong criticism. She stated masked agents are “executing people in the streets” while leaders lie to cover for them. Whittaker challenged industry colleagues to demonstrate courage matching their stated values. Notable Industry Silence Despite these voices, most powerful tech executives remain quiet. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai, and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg all attended Trump’s inauguration. Their companies or they personally donated to inauguration funds. None have publicly addressed escalating ICE raids. OpenAI president Greg Brockman and his wife Anna are prominent Trump-associated donors. They have refrained from commenting on current operations. Elon Musk has actively supported ICE operations, calling protesters “pure evil.” This aligns with his established anti-immigration views. Substantial Financial Contracts at Stake The letter makes concrete financial demands beyond political statements. Workers urge CEOs to cancel all company contracts with ICE. This represents potentially massive financial consequences for several firms. Palantir holds a $30 million contract to build “ImmigrationOS,” an AI surveillance platform Clearview AI provides facial recognition technology to ICE Amazon Web Services supplies cloud infrastructure to Homeland Security Microsoft and Oracle also provide cloud services and IT support These contracts represent significant revenue streams. Cancellation would involve substantial financial penalties. The demand tests corporate commitment to ethical principles versus profitability. Political Dynamics and Industry Influence The campaign reveals complex relationships between tech leaders and political power. Many executives have cultivated relationships with the Trump administration. They seek regulatory favors and policy advantages. Speaking against ICE operations risks damaging these carefully built connections. However, worker pressure creates internal tension. Tech companies pride themselves on progressive values and employee empowerment. Ignoring substantial employee concerns could damage recruitment and retention. The industry already faces scrutiny over ethical AI development and privacy practices. Historical Precedents for Worker Activism This campaign follows previous tech worker movements. Employees successfully pressured Google to abandon Project Maven in 2018. Workers also organized against military contracts at Microsoft and Amazon. The current ICE protest represents the most politically charged campaign yet. Labor experts note changing dynamics in tech workplaces. Younger employees increasingly demand ethical alignment from employers. They leverage collective action despite lacking traditional union structures. This movement tests whether worker pressure can influence federal policy. Legal and Constitutional Implications Federal operations in Minneapolis raise significant legal questions. Constitutional scholars debate the appropriate use of force in immigration enforcement. The deployment of Border Patrol agents in interior cities represents unusual jurisdictional overlap. Legal challenges focus on several key areas: Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches First Amendment rights of protesters Jurisdictional boundaries between agencies Appropriate use of military-style equipment domestically Federal courts will likely address these questions in coming months. The outcomes could reshape immigration enforcement nationwide. Community Impact and Response Minneapolis residents describe living under constant fear. Community organizations report decreased attendance at public services. Many immigrants avoid hospitals, schools, and grocery stores. This creates public health and social service challenges. Local businesses report significant economic impact. Customers avoid commercial areas where operations occur. Property values in affected neighborhoods show noticeable decline. Community leaders call for immediate de-escalation to restore normal life. Conclusion The tech worker campaign against ICE operations represents a pivotal moment for industry activism. Over 450 employees risk their positions to demand corporate accountability. Their call highlights tension between profitable government contracts and ethical principles. The killing of Alex Pretti has become a rallying point for broader concerns about federal enforcement tactics. Industry leaders now face difficult decisions. They must balance political relationships, financial interests, and employee demands. The outcome will influence tech’s role in political discourse for years. Furthermore, it may determine whether worker collectives can effect policy change in the technology sector. FAQs Q1: What specific incident triggered the tech worker campaign?

Recent on-chain data suggests investor behavior is shifting toward accumulation rather than distribution. At the same time, network activity points to renewed engagement across the ecosystem. Together, these signals support bullish sentiment even as consolidation persists. Exchange Reserve Decline Signals Accumulation Trend On-chain data from CryptoQuant shows that Shiba Inu exchange reserves declined over the past 24 hours, reinforcing signs of accumulation. According to the platform, 29,169,846 SHIB exited centralized exchanges during the period. Exchange-held reserves fell from 82,066,732,850,077 SHIB on January 25 to 82,066,703,680,231 SHIB at press time. CryptoQuant’s trending metrics further confirmed the movement, reporting a 0.09% drop in exchange reserves over 24 hours. The data also showed that reserves remained in a broader seven-day downtrend. The declining reserves are a sign that holders move tokens off exchanges to reduce exposure to short-term selling. Flow data added more context to the trend. Total exchange outflows reached 256 billion SHIB, while inflows stood at 183.5 billion SHIB. The imbalance indicated that withdrawals significantly exceeded deposits. Such behavior typically reflects a preference for self-custody rather than active trading. As a result, immediate sell-side pressure often weakens under these conditions. Network Activity Shows Rising User Engagement Beyond exchange flows, Shiba Inu also recorded improvements in core network metrics. CryptoQuant data showed active addresses increased by 0.83% to 195. Active receiving addresses also rose by 1% to 131, signaling broader participation. Transaction activity supported this trend. Total transaction count climbed to 5,863, aligning with the increase in active addresses. Health often links rising transactions to renewed user interest and ecosystem usage. These metrics may not trigger immediate price movement. However, sustained growth in participation often lays the groundwork for future shifts. When broader crypto market conditions stabilize, such engagement could amplify price reactions. According to on-chain analysts, reclaiming key moving averages remains critical for any breakout attempt. Still, the current data suggests Shiba Inu’s ecosystem shows resilience during consolidation. The combination of declining exchange reserves and improving network activity continues to support a constructive outlook for the meme coin in the near term.

The Nasdaq-listed company’s disclosure provides unprecedented transparency into institutional crypto asset management, particularly regarding its Solana holdings. This SOL staking revenue report arrives during a pivotal moment for blockchain adoption by traditional corporations, offering valuable insights into sustainable crypto investment approaches. Sharps Technology SOL Staking Strategy Analysis Sharps Technology maintains a substantial position in the cryptocurrency market through its strategic SOL holdings. According to their recently published SOL staking revenue report, the company currently holds approximately 2 million SOL tokens. These digital assets represent a market value of around $250 million at current prices. The majority of this substantial portfolio remains actively staked through carefully selected validator partners. The company’s approach demonstrates several key characteristics of institutional crypto investment: Strategic Allocation: The SOL position represents a calculated percentage of Sharps Technology’s overall treasury management strategy Validator Partnership Model: Rather than operating its own validators, the company collaborates with established network participants Revenue Optimization: The staking strategy prioritizes consistent returns while maintaining network security participation Risk Management: The approach balances yield generation with liquidity considerations and market exposure This corporate staking model differs significantly from individual investor approaches. Consequently, Sharps Technology achieves different operational efficiencies and faces unique regulatory considerations. The company’s public reporting on these activities establishes new precedents for transparency in corporate cryptocurrency management. Corporate Cryptocurrency Adoption Trends The Sharps Technology SOL staking revenue report emerges within a broader context of increasing institutional blockchain engagement. Over the past three years, publicly traded companies have gradually increased their cryptocurrency allocations. However, comprehensive reporting on staking activities remains relatively uncommon. This disclosure therefore provides valuable benchmarking data for other corporations considering similar strategies. Several factors have contributed to growing corporate interest in proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies like Solana: Corporate Crypto Adoption Drivers Driver Description Impact on Strategy Yield Generation Staking provides revenue streams beyond price appreciation Creates ongoing return on digital asset holdings Regulatory Clarity Improved guidelines for corporate crypto accounting Enables proper financial reporting and compliance Network Participation Staking supports blockchain security and operations Aligns corporate holdings with network health Portfolio Diversification Crypto offers low correlation with traditional assets Reduces overall portfolio volatility through diversification Sharps Technology now ranks as the fifth-largest publicly traded company holding SOL strategically. This positioning reflects both the scale of their investment and their commitment to transparent reporting. Other corporations with significant crypto holdings typically include technology firms, financial institutions, and forward-thinking traditional businesses. The growing list demonstrates increasing mainstream acceptance of blockchain assets as legitimate treasury components. Institutional Staking Yield Mechanics The reported 7% average annual staking yield requires examination within proper context. According to blockchain analytics firms, Solana network staking yields have fluctuated between 5% and 8% annually over the past two years. These variations depend on multiple factors including total network stake, validator performance, and protocol adjustments. Sharps Technology’s reported yield falls within the expected range for institutional-scale staking operations. Several technical elements influence institutional staking returns: Validator Selection: Institutional investors typically choose multiple validators to distribute risk and optimize performance Fee Structures: Validator commission rates directly impact net returns to delegators Uptime Requirements: Consistent validator performance ensures maximum reward accumulation Compounding Strategies: Automated reward reinvestment can significantly enhance long-term returns The company’s report specifically notes that the 7% figure excludes fees. This clarification indicates that gross yields before validator commissions might approach 8-9% annually. Such transparency helps other institutions benchmark their own potential returns more accurately. Furthermore, it establishes realistic expectations for corporate treasury managers evaluating similar strategies. Solana Network Impact and Considerations Large-scale institutional staking activities like Sharps Technology’s program significantly impact the Solana ecosystem. When corporations stake substantial token quantities, they contribute to network security and decentralization. However, they also introduce new dynamics regarding token distribution and governance influence. The blockchain community generally views institutional participation as positive for long-term network stability and legitimacy. Several network effects result from corporate staking activities: Security Enhancement: Increased total stake makes network attacks more expensive and difficult Validator Economics: Institutional delegations can support professional validator operations Market Liquidity: Staked tokens become temporarily illiquid, potentially reducing selling pressure Governance Participation: Staked tokens typically carry voting rights in network decisions The Solana Foundation has actively encouraged institutional participation through educational initiatives and technical support. Their efforts appear successful given the growing number of corporate participants. Network developers continue optimizing staking mechanics to accommodate large-scale operations while maintaining decentralization principles. This balanced approach seeks to welcome institutional capital without compromising core blockchain values. Regulatory and Reporting Implications Sharps Technology’s detailed SOL staking revenue report reflects evolving regulatory expectations for corporate cryptocurrency holdings. Accounting standards have gradually developed to address the unique characteristics of staked digital assets. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued updated guidance in 2023 regarding cryptocurrency accounting and disclosure requirements. Key reporting considerations for corporate staking activities include: Revenue Recognition: Staking rewards must be properly recorded as income when earned Asset Classification: Staked tokens require appropriate balance sheet categorization Risk Disclosure: Companies must explain cryptocurrency-related risks to investors Tax Implications: Staking rewards create taxable events requiring proper documentation The increasing clarity around these requirements enables more corporations to participate in staking activities confidently. Standardized reporting frameworks help investors compare performance across different companies and strategies. As more firms follow Sharps Technology’s transparency example, industry best practices will continue evolving toward greater consistency and comprehensiveness. Future Outlook for Corporate Crypto Strategies The successful implementation and reporting of Sharps Technology’s SOL staking program suggests growing maturity in institutional cryptocurrency management. Other corporations will likely examine this model when developing their own digital asset strategies. The 7% yield benchmark provides a realistic target for treasury managers evaluating potential returns against traditional fixed-income alternatives. Several trends will likely shape future corporate crypto adoption: Diversification Beyond Bitcoin: More institutions will explore proof-of-stake networks like Solana Sophisticated Yield Strategies: Corporations will develop more advanced staking and DeFi participation methods Enhanced Reporting Standards: Industry groups may establish formal guidelines for crypto revenue disclosure Regulatory Evolution: Continued clarification will reduce compliance uncertainty for participating firms The blockchain industry generally welcomes corporate participation as validation of underlying technology and economic models. However, community members also emphasize the importance of maintaining network decentralization despite institutional involvement. This balance requires careful protocol design and ongoing community governance participation from all stakeholder groups. Conclusion The Sharps Technology SOL staking revenue report represents a significant milestone in corporate cryptocurrency adoption. Their disclosure of a 7% average annual yield on $250 million in staked SOL provides valuable benchmarking data for other institutions. This SOL staking revenue report demonstrates that sophisticated treasury management can successfully incorporate blockchain assets while generating meaningful returns. As regulatory frameworks mature and reporting standards develop, more corporations will likely follow similar paths. The transparency exhibited by Sharps Technology establishes important precedents for institutional crypto participation that balances financial objectives with network support responsibilities. FAQs Q1: What is SOL staking and how does it generate revenue? SOL staking involves locking Solana tokens to support network security and operations. Validators process transactions and maintain the blockchain, earning rewards distributed to themselves and their delegators. This process creates revenue streams for token holders who participate in staking. Q2: How does Sharps Technology’s 7% staking yield compare to individual investor returns? Individual investors typically achieve similar yields, though institutional operations may achieve slight advantages through validator negotiation and operational efficiencies. The 7% figure falls within the normal range for Solana staking, which has varied between 5-8% annually in recent years. Q3: What risks do corporations face when staking cryptocurrency? Corporate staking involves several risks including validator underperformance, network slashing penalties, cryptocurrency price volatility, regulatory changes, and technological risks. Companies typically implement risk management strategies including validator diversification and insurance considerations. Q4: Why would a publicly traded company invest in cryptocurrency? Public companies may allocate to cryptocurrency for portfolio diversification, yield generation, technological exposure, inflation hedging, or strategic positioning in emerging sectors. These investments typically represent small percentages of overall treasury assets. Q5: How does corporate staking affect the Solana network? Corporate staking generally strengthens network security by increasing total stake, though extremely large allocations could potentially impact decentralization. Most networks welcome institutional participation as validation of their economic models and technology.

Analysts Weigh In,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-ada-reach-1-again-analysts-weigh-in/,"Cardano (ADA) has previously been among the most popular altcoins in the previous growth crypto cycle. Much of the early positioning by many investors yielded good returns in ADA as it rose into the highest market capitalization category. The question however remains whether ADA can find the same momentum and reclaim $1 in the following cycle. Analysts who go through long-term price structures say that it is all a matter of market behavior, an amount of liquidity, and rivalry with new assets lapsing through discovery stages. Cardano (ADA) Cardano is near $0.36 with a market cap of thirteen billion dollars. It possesses a profound liquidity base and extensive distribution of holders. ADA has also withstood many cycles in the market which is also indicative of durability. The issue with this is that big caps are more likely to be affected by slower movements after the initial asymmetry has been avoided. When new inflows are weakened or changed to smaller assets with high elasticity, this problem will get more serious. There is no optimism in the price models 2026 and 2027. According to the analysts, ADA will require heavy capital inflows to revert to one dollar. In the absence of a significant catalyst, the consensus models indicate that a recovery to $0.50-$0.60 range will be only a small advance and not a breakout. The expectation reset is indicative of a larger shift in which investors are abandoning assets requiring the billions of liquidity to ascend. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new cheap crypto which is a developing lending protocol that will enable users to borrow on collateral and enables lenders to use idle assets to earn yield. The project has affirmed an independent security work by Halborn Security and has a 90/100 token scan score on CertiK. The MUTM presale started in Q1 2025 starting to sell at $0.01 and is currently in Phase 7 with the token valued at $0.04. The protocol has already raised the $19.9M mark and has over 18,800 holders. The structure has a proposed price launch of $0.06 and gradual growth from stage to stage, instead of abrupt re-pricing. ADA Limitations and MUTM Positioning The key weakness of Cardano is size. ADA must have large inflows in order to provide any meaningful returns with a market cap of thirteen billion dollars. This is what makes analysts forecast less percentage changes in ADA in the year 2026 and 2027. ADA has now grown to be a mature asset in a mature segment. It has the ability to appreciate but no longer is in the early asymmetry region. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in the reverse position. It is still low priced. Its mechanics are based on the fundamentals of token value related to use in collateralized borrowing, mtToken yield and a revenue model which repays purchased tokens to participants. This is the reason why analysts are confident that Mutuum Finance can increase its percentage growth when liquidity takes shape. An example of the difference is a scenario of $700 allocation. ADA to $0.6 is a small improvement in two years under a recovery case. Based on the model of Mutuum Finance, analysts anticipate a repricing of about $0.20-$0.30 in 2026 in case V1 usage, growth of borrowing volume, mainnet following and revenue distribution behave as anticipated. It is this difference that causes some investors to think that MUTM is in the previous stages of ADA. V1 Takeoff and Phase Development On its official X account, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) announced that its V1 protocol will start to test on Sepolia in Q1 2026. V1 comprises a collateral rule, liquidation systems and debt accounting, which takes the project out of concept and into activation. This switch is important since when behavior changes towards participation rather than observation, liquidity will support the price discovery. The sell phase 7 of the presale has been selling at a faster rate than any previous stage. Whale allocations have also been witnessed in the past several weeks and the 24-hour leaderboard rewards the top contributor with $500 in MUTM. The ability to make payments via using a card has made onboarding easier. The comparison of ADA and MUTM 2026 is not nostalgic. It shows expectations of the returns, lifecycle positioning. ADA is at the late compounding stage with decelerating upside. Mutuum Finance is at the initial stage of building with observable catalysts. To investors considering the best crypto projects to invest in on the next cycle, such structural details are more significant than narrative.

57482949,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=902747,1769446806,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57482949.jpeg,Google settles $68 million claim for illegally recording users,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/google-settle-voice-assistant-recorded-users/,"Google has agreed to pay $68 million to end a lawsuit that accused the tech giant of using its voice assistant to secretly record smartphone users without their permission. The settlement was submitted to a federal court in San Jose, California late Friday night. Judge Beth Labson Freeman must still give her approval before the deal becomes final. People who filed the lawsuit said Google broke the law by recording and sharing their private conversations. According to the complaint, this happened when Google Assistant was turned on by mistake. The company then used these recordings to show users specific ads, the lawsuit claimed. Google Assistant works like Apple’s Siri. It’s supposed to start listening only when someone says special phrases like “Hey Google” or “Okay Google.” But users complained they got ads after the assistant mistakenly heard something else as these trigger words. The lawsuit called these errors “false accepts.” Google has denied doing anything wrong Court documents show the company decided to settle to avoid the risks and costs that come with a long legal fight. The Mountain View, California company did not respond to requests for comment on Monday. The settlement will cover anyone who owned Google devices or experienced these false activations going back to May 18, 2016. The lawyers representing the smartphone users plan to ask for up to one-third of the total settlement amount, which comes to roughly $22.7 million in legal fees. This case mirrors a similar situation with Apple reported by Cryptopolitan previously. In December 2024, Apple reached a $95 million settlement over nearly the same problem with Siri. That deal got final approval in September 2025, and payments started going out in January 2026. Apple users can receive up to $20 for each device they own, with a cap of $100 if they have five devices. Google’s record-breaking privacy settlements in 2025 The Google voice assistant settlement is just one of several major privacy cases the company has dealt with recently. In October 2025, Google signed what might be its biggest settlement ever with Texas. The state received $1.375 billion after accusing Google of illegally tracking where users went, watching what they did in private browsing mode, and collecting biometric information, including voice recordings and face scans. Two months earlier, in September 2025, a jury in California ordered Google to pay $425.7 million. That case involved almost 100 million users who said Google kept collecting their information through other apps even after they turned off a setting called “Web & App Activity.” Google also settled with state attorneys general across the country over its Play Store. That $700 million deal covered complaints about unfair business practices. Money from that settlement started reaching consumers in December 2025. The agreement involved officials from 53 states and territories. In August 2025, Google and YouTube paid $30 million to settle claims they gathered personal information from children without asking parents first. Another settlement from September 2025 dealt with Google’s advertising system called Real-Time Bidding. While no cash amount was set, experts said the privacy changes Google agreed to make could be worth anywhere from $1.4 billion to $21.6 billion. These settlements show how tech companies face growing pressure over how they handle user information. Privacy advocates have long raised concerns about smart assistants and whether they listen more than they should. The settlements with both Google and Apple suggest these worries may have been justified in some cases.

57482929,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=265450,1769446812,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,SEC CFTC Crypto Event Postponement Sparks Regulatory Harmony Debate for 2025,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-cftc-crypto-event-postponed-january-2025/,"BitcoinWorld SEC CFTC Crypto Event Postponement Sparks Regulatory Harmony Debate for 2025 WASHINGTON, D.C., January 2025 – The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have unexpectedly postponed their highly anticipated joint cryptocurrency event, rescheduling the crucial regulatory discussion for January 29, 2025. This two-day delay of the “SEC-CFTC Harmonization: U.S. Financial Leadership in the Age of Crypto” forum immediately sparked industry-wide analysis about the challenges of coordinating America’s fragmented digital asset oversight framework. Market observers now scrutinize whether this postponement signals logistical issues or reflects deeper complexities in aligning two powerful regulatory bodies with historically different approaches to cryptocurrency classification and enforcement. SEC CFTC Crypto Event Details and Rescheduling Implications The postponed SEC CFTC crypto event maintains its original structure despite the date change. Furthermore, the forum will now occur from 7:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. UTC on January 29 at CFTC headquarters. Additionally, the event will feature SEC Chairman Paul S. Atkins and CFTC Chairman Michael Selig as primary speakers. The agencies confirmed the rescheduling through simultaneous press releases that emphasized their continued commitment to collaborative cryptocurrency regulation. Industry analysts immediately noted that such joint appearances remain relatively rare, making this event particularly significant for understanding future regulatory directions. Regulatory experts point to several potential reasons for the postponement. First, scheduling conflicts between two major agency heads could necessitate adjustments. Second, last-minute substantive additions to the discussion agenda might require more preparation time. Third, external factors like recent market developments or legislative updates could prompt content revisions. The cryptocurrency community generally views the delay as minor but watches closely for any substantive changes to the announced program. Historical Context of SEC and CFTC Cryptocurrency Regulation The relationship between SEC and CFTC regarding digital assets has evolved significantly since Bitcoin’s emergence. Initially, both agencies largely observed the cryptocurrency space without clear jurisdictional claims. However, the 2017 cryptocurrency boom forced regulatory clarification. The SEC typically asserts authority over cryptocurrencies classified as securities under the Howey Test. Conversely, the CFTC claims jurisdiction over cryptocurrencies deemed commodities, particularly in derivatives markets. This jurisdictional divide has created regulatory gaps and uncertainties that market participants must navigate carefully. Several landmark moments highlight this regulatory tension. In 2018, former CFTC Chairman Christopher Giancarlo and former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton issued a rare joint statement emphasizing cooperation. Subsequently, the 2020 Telegram settlement demonstrated SEC’s enforcement approach to token offerings. Meanwhile, CFTC pursued numerous cases against unregistered crypto derivatives platforms. The 2022 Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act attempted legislative clarity but stalled in Congress. Consequently, this 2025 joint event represents the latest effort to demonstrate inter-agency coordination. Key SEC and CFTC Cryptocurrency Jurisdictional Approaches Agency Primary Jurisdiction Key Legal Framework Notable Enforcement Actions SEC Securities tokens Howey Test, Securities Act of 1933 Telegram (2020), Ripple (ongoing), Coinbase (2023) CFTC Commodity tokens, derivatives Commodity Exchange Act BitMEX (2021), Ooki DAO (2022), Binance (2023) Expert Analysis: Why Harmonization Matters for Crypto Markets Financial regulation specialists emphasize the critical importance of SEC-CFTC harmonization for several reasons. First, clear regulatory boundaries reduce compliance costs for cryptocurrency businesses. Second, consistent enforcement prevents regulatory arbitrage where companies seek the most favorable jurisdiction. Third, harmonized approaches strengthen U.S. leadership in global digital asset standards. Former SEC senior advisor Jennifer Schulp notes, “When two major regulators speak with one voice on cryptocurrency, market participants gain crucial predictability.” This predictability ultimately benefits investors through reduced systemic risk and improved market integrity. The postponement itself offers insights into regulatory coordination challenges. Government agencies operate with complex internal processes that can delay public events. Additionally, substantive policy discussions between agencies often require multiple clearance layers. The two-day shift suggests relatively minor coordination issues rather than fundamental disagreements. However, cryptocurrency markets remain sensitive to any regulatory uncertainty, as demonstrated by immediate social media speculation following the postponement announcement. Global Implications of U.S. Crypto Regulatory Coordination International observers closely monitor SEC-CFTC harmonization efforts because U.S. regulatory approaches significantly influence global standards. The European Union implemented its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework in 2024, creating comprehensive cryptocurrency regulations. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom established its Financial Conduct Authority as primary crypto regulator. Asian jurisdictions like Singapore and Japan developed distinct regulatory models. Consequently, coordinated U.S. regulatory messaging carries substantial weight in international policy discussions about digital asset oversight. Several key areas require SEC-CFTC alignment for effective global leadership: Token Classification Standards: Consistent frameworks for distinguishing securities from commodities Exchange Regulation: Harmonized requirements for trading platforms handling multiple token types Stablecoin Oversight: Coordinated approach to dollar-pegged digital assets DeFi Governance: Shared principles for decentralized finance protocols Cross-Border Enforcement: Unified strategies for international regulatory cooperation Recent international developments increase pressure for U.S. regulatory clarity. The Financial Stability Board and International Organization of Securities Commissions both published global cryptocurrency standards in 2023. Furthermore, the G20 endorsed roadmap for crypto asset regulation during India’s presidency. Therefore, this postponed SEC-CFTC event takes on additional significance as a demonstration of U.S. capacity to implement coherent digital asset policies matching its financial influence. Technical and Logistical Aspects of the Rescheduled Event The practical details of the postponed event reveal careful planning for maximum accessibility and impact. The SEC confirmed the event will stream live on its official website alongside CFTC channels. Additionally, major financial news networks will likely carry the discussion. The one-hour format suggests focused presentations followed by moderated discussion rather than lengthy speeches. This efficient structure aims to deliver substantive content while respecting participants’ time constraints. The evening UTC timing accommodates both U.S. and international audiences, reflecting global interest in U.S. cryptocurrency regulation. Physical attendance at CFTC headquarters will remain limited to credentialed participants due to security and space considerations. However, the digital streaming approach ensures broad public access. Regulatory experts anticipate the discussion will cover several pressing topics based on recent agency priorities. These likely include exchange-traded product approvals, stablecoin legislation progress, enforcement coordination mechanisms, and responses to emerging technologies like zero-knowledge proofs and layer-2 solutions. The postponement may allow inclusion of more current market data and recent regulatory developments. Market Impact and Industry Response to Postponement Cryptocurrency markets showed minimal immediate reaction to the event postponement, suggesting mature understanding of regulatory processes. Major digital asset prices remained stable following the announcement. However, regulatory analysts detected increased options trading volume for dates following the rescheduled event. This activity indicates sophisticated market participants positioning for potential regulatory announcements. Industry associations like the Blockchain Association and Coin Center issued statements welcoming continued regulatory dialogue while emphasizing the need for clear guidelines. Several factors explain the muted market response. First, two-day postponements of regulatory events occur regularly across financial sectors. Second, the agencies maintained the event’s substantive focus rather than canceling it entirely. Third, cryptocurrency markets increasingly focus on macroeconomic factors like interest rates and inflation. Nevertheless, regulatory developments remain crucial for long-term industry growth. The postponed event’s content will likely influence investment decisions and business strategies throughout 2025. Conclusion The SEC CFTC crypto event postponement to January 29, 2025, represents a minor scheduling adjustment with significant symbolic importance for digital asset regulation. This joint forum highlights ongoing efforts to harmonize U.S. cryptocurrency oversight between two major regulatory agencies with complementary jurisdictions. Furthermore, the event demonstrates America’s commitment to maintaining financial leadership through coordinated regulatory approaches. Market participants should monitor the rescheduled discussion for insights into future enforcement priorities, legislative support areas, and international cooperation strategies. Ultimately, successful SEC-CFTC harmonization could establish clearer guidelines that benefit investors, innovators, and the broader financial system while positioning the United States as a global standard-setter in cryptocurrency regulation. FAQs Q1: Why did the SEC and CFTC postpone their joint cryptocurrency event? The agencies provided no specific reason for the two-day postponement from January 27 to January 29, 2025. Such adjustments commonly result from scheduling conflicts, agenda modifications, or logistical considerations when coordinating between two major regulatory bodies. Q2: What is the significance of SEC-CFTC harmonization for cryptocurrency regulation? Harmonization creates consistent regulatory approaches between agencies overseeing different aspects of digital assets. This reduces compliance confusion, prevents regulatory arbitrage, and strengthens U.S. leadership in global cryptocurrency standards development. Q3: How can the public access the postponed SEC CFTC crypto event? The event will stream live on the SEC website and CFTC channels from 7:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. UTC on January 29, 2025. Physical attendance at CFTC headquarters requires prior credentials, but digital access ensures broad public availability. Q4: What topics will likely dominate the SEC-CFTC cryptocurrency discussion? Based on recent agency priorities, expected topics include token classification frameworks, exchange regulation coordination, stablecoin oversight approaches, enforcement cooperation mechanisms, and responses to emerging blockchain technologies. Q5: How does this postponed event affect current cryptocurrency market regulation? The postponement itself has minimal immediate regulatory impact. However, the event’s content could signal future enforcement priorities and policy directions that might influence market participants’ compliance strategies and investment decisions throughout 2025.

Rather than chasing short-term hype, many participants are now prioritizing platforms that demonstrate clear utility, transparent economics, and consistent user engagement. Projects offering open token structures, verifiable reward systems, and dependable infrastructure are becoming more prominent within the best crypto presale category. While names such as ZKP, LivLive, PepeNode, and Blazpay are frequently mentioned, the larger trend points toward careful analysis of fundamentals and community strength before committing capital. By focusing on these elements, investors can better identify presales with meaningful potential. Below are several projects that reflect how these trends are shaping the best crypto presale market in 2026. 1. Zero Knowledge Proof: Building Privacy-First Infrastructure Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) has quickly become one of the most discussed crypto initiatives in early 2026. Unlike many projects that begin with fundraising, ZKP committed over $100 million of internal capital to build its network before opening any public presale. Its core technology addresses a major issue in modern computing by enabling data verification without exposing sensitive information, an increasingly vital feature as data breaches become more costly. A major attraction for users is Proof Pods, simple plug-and-play devices that allow participants to earn daily rewards through verifiable computing. Presale interest continues to accelerate as Zero Knowledge Proof operates in Stage 1 of its daily auction model, releasing exactly 200 million tokens every 24 hours. This phase concludes on January 24, 2026, after which the daily issuance decreases to 190 million tokens, increasing participation costs over time. Users can purchase Proof Pods for a one-time fee of $249, connecting directly to the network and earning rewards based on actual computing contribution. The combination of declining supply and rising demand positions ZKP as the best crypto presale for investors focused on long-term value creation. Analysts remain optimistic about ZKP’s deflationary “Supply Black Hole” mechanism, where increased network activity leads to token burning or locking. This structure introduces scarcity and strong upside potential. With Stage 1 nearing its end, opportunities to secure early exposure to this project are rapidly diminishing. 2. LivLive: Rewarding Real-Life Activity With Tokens LivLive’s $LIVE token operates as an ERC-20 asset on Ethereum and emphasizes participation rather than passive holding. Approximately 65% of the total supply is distributed to the community through presales, rewards, mining, and quest-based systems, promoting broad ownership instead of concentration. The platform converts real-world actions such as walking, exploring locations, completing AR challenges, leaving reviews, and engaging with physical spaces into $LIVE tokens and experience points. This approach encourages active involvement rather than waiting for speculative price movement. The LivLive wearable device is built with validated hardware, offering accurate health tracking, a battery life of 8 to 10 days, and comfort suitable for daily wear. Additional features like GPS and workout tracking are currently under development, expanding the app’s functionality. This model supports fairness and ongoing demand, placing LivLive firmly within the best crypto presale conversation. 3. PepeNode: Interactive Mining Through Gamification PepeNode also earns a place among the best crypto presales of 2026 by combining meme culture with a virtual mining framework. Users can purchase Miner Nodes, upgrade digital facilities, and earn rewards through a simulated mining process. The system avoids physical hardware requirements and focuses on engagement through gameplay mechanics. While PepeNode introduces variety and entertainment, its utility remains largely contained within its own ecosystem. Rewards are generated through participation in the platform rather than broader real-world applications. Even so, its structured design and interactive approach make it a recognizable entry among current presales without relying on unrealistic promises. 4. Blazpay: Streamlining DeFi With Artificial Intelligence Blazpay centers on AI-powered decentralized finance tools, offering services related to payments, automated trading, and cross-chain liquidity. The platform aims to simplify complex DeFi processes by focusing on infrastructure efficiency rather than behavioral reward systems. Although Blazpay delivers technical value and supports advanced financial interactions, its incentives are tied mainly to platform usage instead of everyday activities. Compared to projects like LivLive, which directly reward real-world behavior, Blazpay offers a different engagement model. Even so, its emphasis on combining AI with DeFi functionality gives it a clear role among structured, utility-focused projects, securing its place within the best crypto presale category. Why ZKP Leads the Best Crypto Presale Market in 2026 Overall, LivLive, PepeNode, and Blazpay demonstrate the wide range of approaches within today’s crypto presales, from activity-based rewards and gamified systems to AI-driven financial tools. Each project presents a defined use case and organized structure, making them notable contenders in the best crypto presale space. Among them, Zero Knowledge Proof clearly stands apart due to its prebuilt infrastructure, Proof Pod-based computing rewards, and deflationary token mechanics designed for long-term value. With Stage 1 of its presale nearing completion, ZKP offers a rare mix of technological utility, transparency, and scarcity, making it a leading example of what the best crypto presale looks like in early 2026.

XRP, in particular, operates on a consensus-based ledger with a unique deflationary model, yet many market participants underestimate the true magnitude of its supply reduction. A deeper look at network mechanics reveals that as adoption scales, XRP’s burn could far exceed conventional projections. Vincent Van Code recently highlighted this issue on X, presenting a “Supply Meltdown” simulation that examines XRP burn under varying levels of network usage. Collaborating with AI tools, he modeled scenarios ranging from routine transaction volume to extreme global adoption at the XRPL’s maximum capacity of 3,400 transactions per second (TPS). According to Van Code, most observers calculate XRP burn using the current low-fee, low-activity environment, overlooking how the ledger dynamically scales fees as demand increases. The ""Supply Meltdown"" Simulation Headline: Everyone is calculating the $XRP burn wrong. The ""base fee"" (0.00001 XRP) only exists when the network is quiet. But what happens if the world actually starts using the XRPL at its 3,400 TPS limit? The Congestion Math: As the… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) January 24, 2026 How XRPL Fees Respond to Network Congestion XRP’s base fee currently sits at 0.00001 XRP per transaction during periods of low congestion. Van Code notes that this metric fails to capture real-world dynamics. The XRPL uses a Load Factor to prevent spam, which increases fees exponentially as the ledger fills. In effect, higher transaction volume drives higher burns, amplifying XRP’s deflationary impact. The simulation illustrates the contrast. On a standard day with 1.2 million transactions, the burn amounts to roughly 450 XRP . At near-global adoption levels—293 million transactions daily at base fee—the burn jumps to nearly 3,000 XRP. When congestion scales fees to 0.001 XRP, daily destruction exceeds 290,000 XRP. At extreme gridlock, with fees reaching 0.01 XRP, the simulation shows over 2.9 million XRP burned per day. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Deflationary Mechanics and Market Implications Unlike Proof-of-Work tokens, XRP fees do not reward validators or Ripple; they are permanently removed from circulation. Van Code emphasized that under maximum usage, the network could destroy up to one billion XRP annually, creating a self-reinforcing deflationary cycle tied directly to utility. This structural scarcity could profoundly impact long-term value if adoption accelerates. Utility as the Ultimate Value Driver Van Code’s analysis underscores a broader principle: XRP’s value derives from real-world use rather than speculative trading. As more institutions and individuals transact on the XRPL, each interaction reduces circulating supply, aligning utility with scarcity. Investors and ecosystem participants can view this dynamic as a structural advantage, reinforcing the network’s long-term potential while minimizing reliance on retail-driven hype. By modeling fee behavior under maximum throughput, Vincent Van Code demonstrates that XRP’s deflationary potential is far greater than commonly perceived. The simulation highlights how widespread adoption could transform the ledger into a powerful engine for both liquidity and scarcity, reshaping market narratives around one of crypto’s most structurally unique assets.

The split matters because it shows where investors are seeking protection during the current bout of uncertainty and why BTC is trading more like a risk asset than a hedge as confidence in fiat currencies wavers. Weak Dollar, Risk-Off Mood Keeps Pressure on BTC Market observers note that the dollar’s recent decline has not propelled Bitcoin higher. Instead, capital has flowed decisively into traditional safe havens. In a January 26 analysis, CryptoQuant contributor GugaOnChain argued that dollar weakness only supports Bitcoin in specific cases, such as high inflation or easy liquidity. However, investors tend to favor assets with long-established roles as stores of value when fear and capital preservation drive currency moves. This perspective may help explain the present split. The dollar’s softness appears linked to rumors of yen intervention and broader geopolitical stress, including renewed U.S. tariff threats against Europe. “If the devaluation stems from a crisis of confidence and extreme risk aversion – as now, with the dollar weakening on rumors of yen intervention – cryptos tend to fall alongside stocks,” the analyst wrote. In this environment, investors are looking for proven stores of value. “People are not chasing returns; they are protecting purchasing power because confidence elsewhere is dying fast,” posted market observer Daniel Tschinkel. He added that physical gold is trading at high premiums in parts of Asia, indicating strong real demand beyond paper markets. Gold and Silver Attract Flows as Bitcoin Lags The scale of the move into precious metals is extraordinary. As of this writing, gold’s market cap had reached a record $35 trillion, and silver’s had hit $6 trillion, according to data from The Kobeissi Letter. This increase has coincided with notable capital rotation away from crypto assets. On-chain analytics firm Lookonchain noted that an unnamed investor, who lost $18.8 million on Ethereum (ETH) in two weeks, has since spent over $36 million since December 13 to buy a gold-backed token and is now sitting on an unrealized profit of more than $2 million. The performance gap is also stark. A comparison posted on X by analyst Ash Crypto shows that a $100,000 investment one year ago would now be worth $180,000 in gold and $342,000 in silver, but only $85,900 in BTC. Additionally, trader Ted Pillows pointed out that the number one cryptocurrency is down 56% against gold since December 2024, with the monthly relative strength index for the pair at its lowest level ever. All said, the current landscape suggests that until the macroeconomic fear driving investors into physical metals subsides, Bitcoin’s established narrative as a digital safe haven faces a serious test. As GugaOnChain stated, “For BTC to thrive, the weakness of the American currency must come from risk appetite, not from fear.” The post Here’s Why Gold Is Beating Bitcoin in a Weak-Dollar Market appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto News|Top News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Gold,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2026-01-26 17:05:35

Our Pi network price prediction anticipates the Pi price to reach a maximum level of $0.3444 by 2026. In 2032, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $3.19. Pi Network is a social crypto and developer ecosystem focused on mass accessibility and real-world use, founded by Stanford PhDs Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan. As 2026 begins, Pi has transitioned from a long-running experiment into a live Layer-1 blockchain with open transfers, exchange liquidity, and a growing app ecosystem. In the past year 2025, Pi hit an all-time high near $2.98 after Open Mainnet launched, then fell to a low around $0.1585 in October as large token unlocks increased supply, leaving the price in the low-$0.20 range. Despite the volatility, 2025 marked major progress: Open Mainnet went live, exchange listings expanded, Pi Network Ventures launched a $100 million ecosystem fund, AI-powered KYC scaled up, and developer activity grew through hackathons, Testnet DEX and AMM tools, Map of Pi 2.0, and broader merchant adoption, signaling a shift from speculation toward real usage. In this Pi Network price prediction, we discuss these developments with major technical levels and the model of exponential supply of Pi that is in decline to determine whether 2026–2032 favors a sustained recovery or further downside.

The bearish momentum is still dominant, and no reversal signals have been confirmed yet. Pi is holding short-term support near $0.176 and $0.178, while $0.20 has turned into key resistance. As of January 26, 2026, Pi Network has continued to trade under pressure, with Price action remaining poor below the $0.20 psychological level. Pi trading near $0.1740, posting a daily decline of over 2.5%.The movement occurred after a long-term rejection in the area of about $0.18 and $0.19, which was earlier short-term support. The inability to regain such a range enabled sellers to expand their influence, keeping the prices tight around the daily lows. Trade is cautious, with traders waiting for further evidence of a trend change. Pi Network 1-day price chart analysis On the daily timeframe, Pi opened in the range of $0.1733, peaked at a high of about $0.1757, fell to a low of about $0.1714, and closed in the area of $0.1740.The structure shows sustained low highs and lower lows, which confirms a bearish trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has declined to 21.78, which is in oversold territory. The level indicates that there is intense selling pressure as opposed to accumulation. MACD is also deeply negative, with the MACD line at -0.0087, the MACD signal line at -0.0061, and the MACD histogram at -0.0026. These show that bearish momentum has not been reversed. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView Immediate support is forming near $0.176 and $0.178. A failure to hold this range could expose the price to further downside. On the upside, resistance remains stacked near $0.185, with stronger selling pressure expected around the $0.20 level. Pi/USD 4-Hour Price Analysis On the 4-hour chart, Pi is still under pressure, having not regained the $0.18 level. Pi is trading at around $0.1725. The price action indicates a continuous pattern of decreasing highs after the steep decline that was experienced at the beginning of the year, around January 19, when Pi broke out of the $0.20 support zone. The chart shows a strong bearish impulse candle that pushed the price lower, followed by a period of sideways consolidation. Although brief recovery attempts appeared near the $0.17 region, they lacked volume and failed to develop into a sustained rebound. This shows sellers remain in control despite reduced downside momentum. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView The Relative Strength Index of the 4-hour time period is at 29.40, which is still in the oversold region. The RSI had tried to stabilize above the 30 level, but below its moving average, showing that the buying pressure is still weak. In this RSI structure, sellers were exhausted, but there was no confirmed trend reversal. The MACD remains negative, with the MACD line at -0.0035, the signal line at -0.0031, and the histogram still below zero. Although the histogram has begun to flatten, indicating slowing downside momentum, there is no bullish crossover in place yet. This keeps the short-term outlook tilted to the downside. Support is located near $0.170 and $0.172, which have acted as a short-term base following the recent sell-off. A breakdown below this level could expose Pi to further losses toward the $0.165 region. On the upside, resistance remains strong at $0.178, followed by supply near $0.185, where previous selling pressure intensified. Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.1977 SELL SMA 5 $0.1995 SELL SMA 10 $0.2018 SELL SMA 21 $0.2058 SELL SMA 50 $0.2097 SELL SMA 100 $0.2196 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.2062 SELL EMA 5 $0.2075 SELL EMA 10 $0.2077 SELL EMA 21 $0.2083 SELL EMA 50 $0.2160 SELL EMA 100 $0.2449 SELL What to expect from the Pi price analysis next? Pi is likely to remain under pressure as long as the price stays below the $0.18 resistance zone, with sellers still controlling momentum. If support near $0.17 fails to hold, the next move could extend toward $0.165, while any recovery would require a strong breakout above $0.185 to signal trend stabilization.. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. Why is PI’s price down today? PI is down today because it hit a fresh low near $0.17, keeping the chart bearish while traders price in extra supply from roughly 150M PI unlocking over the next 30 days. The drop also came during a broader risk-off crypto move, which tends to hit weaker altcoins like PI harder. Will Pi Price Reach $5? At the current pace of development and given its total PI supply circulating supply of over 8 billion PI, Pi Network’s value is unlikely to reach $5 in the near term. Multiple technical quantitative indicators and fundamental factors, such as delayed mainnet launch and maximum supply constraints, suggest that Pi’s price may fluctuate within lower ranges before any major uptrend. A $5 target would require sustained adoption, significant on-chain activity, and strong market demand that is not yet present. Will Pi Reach $10? Reaching $10 would represent a massive increase in Pi’s market cap, something that is not expected soon under current crypto market conditions. Analysts suggest that even optimistic forecasts place this milestone more than a decade away, if at all. Investors should treat such projections as speculative investment advice and conduct their own research before making investment decisions, as Pi remains a high-risk asset with uncertain long-term value.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment PI Network Price History: CoinmarketCap Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi showed a sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72. At the start of July 2025, Pi Network faced high volatility as massive token unlocks triggered strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458–$0.50 range. On July 19, 2025, PIUSDT declined slightly to $0.4412, reflecting short-term bearish pressure. On July 26, 2025, PIUSDT continued to hover under pressure around $0.4409, staying within a tight trading range as momentum remained subdued. for August 2, 2025. Pi traded at $0.3496, still under pressure and at its all-time low. On August 6, 2025, Pi Network traded at around $0.3410, showing moderate consolidation with weak momentum and limited price movement. On August 9th, Pi/USDT went up from its early August low of $0.3766 and traded around $0.4103. August 17th, 2025, the Pi Network (PI) traded at $0.387 , showing slight movement between support at $0.383 and resistance at $0.390 . On August 21, Pi Network (PI) traded near $0.366, showing a modest 1.39% gain as buyers attempted a short-term recovery. On September 2, 2025, Pi network traded around $0.34, just above its past month’s August all-time low of $0.3304. On September 22, 2025, Pi crashed to a new all-time low (ATL) of $0.2234, marking a –92% drop from its February ATH and reflecting heavy sell-side pressure from token unlocks and weak demand. Pi rebounded slightly, to trade between $0.25 and $0.28 through late September, though resistance at $0.30 continued to hold firmly. At the start of October 2025, Pi trades at $0.2718, but is still struggling under bearish sentiment as buyers attempt to defend support above $0.26 while momentum indicators suggest only a weak recovery. On October 11, 2025, Pi Network hit a new all-time low of $0.1585, reflecting the peak of a prolonged market crash and severe selling pressure. On October 15, 2025, Pi Network (PI) stabilized slightly, trading around $0.1884, as short-term buyers stepped in following the sharp October 11 crash. On October 28, 2025, PI attempted a short rebound toward $0.238, but failed to hold gains, slipping back below the 20-day moving average. As of the start of November 2025, Pi Network traded at approximately $0.247, still below key resistance at $0.26, as traders remain cautious ahead of the upcoming 120 million token unlock expected in November. As of November 15, Pi network traded at $0.223. This rise for 1 day was driven by technical breakout signals, whale accumulation, and ongoing ecosystem updates. As of November 30, 2025, Pi Network traded around $0.243, consolidating above the $0.24 support zone while still below the $0.26 resistance heading into month-end. As of December 1, 2025, Pi Network had dropped to about $0.226, as sellers reacted to December’s 190M PI token unlock overhang and a broader risk-off mood in the crypto market. As of December 16, 2025, Pi Network traded around $0.196, having broken below the psychological $0.20 support as ongoing token unlocks, legal uncertainty, and sustained bearish technical momentum kept strong downside pressure on the price. As of late December 2025, Pi Network traded in the low-$0.20 range around $0.205, moving sideways as selling pressure eased, but trading volume stayed light, and buyers remained cautious after the mid-month dip below $0.20. At the start of 2026, Pi continued to hover near the $0.20–$0.21 zone, showing early stabilization above the key $0.20 level, with the market still weighing ongoing supply unlocks against slower demand growth. On January 15, 2026, Pi traded around $0.205 and closed near $0.2046 after slipping from the $0.21 area, showing a controlled pullback with buyers still defending the low-$0.20 zone.",Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|TRADING|ZRX|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-26 17:05:40

SBI Global Asset Management CEO Asakura Tomoya has publicly criticized Japan’s reported 2028 timeline for approving spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), labeling the planned schedule as dangerously “too late.” This urgent critique, delivered via social media platform X, responds directly to a Nikkei Shimbun report outlining the Financial Services Agency’s (FSA) expected regulatory pathway. Asakura argues that this cautious approach threatens to leave Japan lagging behind major economic rivals, including the United States and China, in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. The CEO’s forceful comments underscore a growing tension between traditional regulatory prudence and the breakneck speed of fintech innovation. Japan Crypto ETF Ambitions Face Critical Scrutiny The core of the controversy centers on a specific financial product: the spot cryptocurrency ETF. Unlike futures-based ETFs, which track derivative contracts, a spot ETF holds the actual underlying digital asset, such as Bitcoin. This structure provides direct exposure for investors without the complexities of managing private keys or using cryptocurrency exchanges. The Nikkei Shimbun report, which triggered Asakura’s response, indicated that Japan’s FSA is methodically working toward a framework that would permit trading of these instruments by 2028. Furthermore, the report suggested accompanying tax reforms aimed at clarifying the treatment of crypto assets. However, for industry leaders like Asakura, this four-year horizon represents a critical failure to match global momentum. Consequently, market observers note a significant gap emerging between Japan’s regulatory planning and real-world developments elsewhere. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024, leading to an influx of billions in institutional capital. Similarly, other Asian financial hubs, including Hong Kong, have launched their own spot crypto ETFs. This global context forms the backbone of Asakura’s argument. He contends that Japan’s proposed timeline is not merely slow but strategically misaligned, potentially ceding financial innovation leadership and associated economic benefits to competitors. The delay could impact capital flows, talent retention, and Japan’s position as a forward-looking financial center. Global Regulatory Race and Competitive Pressures The push for cryptocurrency ETFs represents more than a niche financial product launch; it symbolizes a broader shift in institutional acceptance. When a major regulator like the U.S. SEC approves such products, it signals a level of maturity and oversight that attracts conservative capital. Japan, with its historically robust and conservative financial regulatory framework, has often moved deliberately. The FSA’s approach to crypto has evolved from initial warnings to a licensed exchange system following the infamous Mt. Gox hack. This history informs its current cautious stance, prioritizing investor protection and systemic stability above first-mover advantage. Nevertheless, the competitive landscape is shifting rapidly. The following table illustrates the divergent regulatory postures among key economies regarding spot crypto ETFs as of early 2025: Country/Region Regulatory Status (Spot Crypto ETF) Key Approval Date/ Timeline Notable Details United States Approved January 2024 Multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs launched, managing tens of billions in assets. Hong Kong Approved April 2024 Offers spot ETFs for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Canada Approved Early 2021 Among the first global jurisdictions to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF. Australia Approved 2024 Several spot Bitcoin ETFs listed on ASX. Japan Under Review / Proposed Reported Target: 2028 Awaiting FSA framework and parallel tax reforms. European Union Varied by Member State Ongoing Governed by MiCA regulations; some UCITS-like products exist. As this comparison shows, Japan’s projected timeline places it years behind other developed markets. Asakura’s warning specifically highlights the risk from China, where, despite a ban on cryptocurrency trading, the state is aggressively advancing its central bank digital currency (CBDC) and blockchain infrastructure. This suggests competition is not limited to Western markets but is intensely regional. Expert Analysis on Market Impact and Investor Sentiment Financial analysts monitoring the Asia-Pacific region point to several immediate consequences of a delayed approval. Firstly, domestic capital seeking regulated crypto exposure may flow to overseas markets or products, resulting in a loss of taxable revenue and trading activity for Japanese exchanges. Secondly, Japanese financial institutions like SBI, which have invested heavily in blockchain ventures and digital asset exchanges, face a competitive disadvantage. They cannot offer locally regulated products that their global peers already provide. Thirdly, the delay affects retail and institutional investor sentiment, potentially framing Japan’s market as less innovative. Moreover, the proposed tax reforms are a critical piece of the puzzle. Japan’s current tax code treats cryptocurrency as “miscellaneous income,” subject to progressive rates up to 55% on profits. This has been a significant deterrent for professional traders and investors. The promised reform, tied to the 2028 ETF timeline, aims to create a more favorable environment. However, experts argue that decoupling tax reform from ETF approval could accelerate progress. Implementing clearer, lower tax rates sooner could stimulate the domestic market independently, building a stronger foundation for when ETFs eventually launch. The Path Forward for Japanese Cryptocurrency Adoption Asakura’s public critique is not an isolated voice but reflects a growing chorus within Japan’s financial technology sector. The call is for regulatory agility—a principle where frameworks can adapt swiftly to technological change without compromising core safeguards. Proponents suggest a phased or pilot approach for spot crypto ETFs, similar to regulatory sandboxes used for other fintech innovations. This would allow the FSA to monitor risks in a controlled environment while enabling market participants to gain experience. Key arguments for accelerating the timeline include: Institutional Demand: Japanese pension funds, insurers, and asset managers are increasingly seeking diversified digital asset exposure through regulated channels. Technological Leadership: Japan boasts strong blockchain developer communities and fintech companies; delayed regulation stifles their growth and export potential. Consumer Protection Paradox: By not offering regulated domestic products, authorities may inadvertently push investors toward riskier, unregulated offshore platforms. Economic Revitalization: A dynamic digital asset sector could attract foreign investment and talent, supporting broader economic goals. The FSA now faces a complex balancing act. It must weigh Asakura’s urgent warning against its mandate to ensure market stability and protect investors. The agency’s next moves will be closely scrutinized by global investors and policymakers alike. Will it hold firm to a meticulous, multi-year plan, or will competitive pressures catalyze a more accelerated review process? The decision will significantly shape Japan’s financial landscape for the next decade. Conclusion The debate over Japan’s crypto ETF timeline, forcefully highlighted by SBI CEO Asakura Tomoya, transcends a simple regulatory schedule. It strikes at the heart of how a major economy navigates the disruptive force of digital assets. While the Financial Services Agency’s deliberate approach is rooted in a commendable history of investor protection, the global market is moving at an unprecedented pace. The reported 2028 target for spot cryptocurrency ETF approval risks cementing Japan as a follower rather than a leader in the next era of finance. As Asakura contends, the cost of being “too late” may not just be measured in delayed product launches but in diminished influence, capital flight, and a missed opportunity to shape the future of digital finance. The coming months will reveal whether this urgent warning prompts a strategic recalibration. FAQs Q1: What is a spot cryptocurrency ETF? A spot cryptocurrency ETF is a regulated investment fund traded on traditional stock exchanges. It directly holds the underlying digital asset, like Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure without personally buying, storing, or securing the crypto themselves. Q2: Why does the SBI CEO think Japan’s 2028 timeline is too slow? Asakura argues that by 2028, Japan will be years behind other major financial markets like the U.S., Canada, and Hong Kong, which have already approved such products. This delay could cause Japan to lose competitive advantage, investment, and influence in the growing digital asset economy. Q3: What is the role of Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) in this process? The FSA is Japan’s primary financial regulatory body. It is responsible for developing the rules, oversight framework, and investor protections necessary to approve new financial products like spot crypto ETFs, ensuring market stability and integrity. Q4: How do Japan’s current cryptocurrency tax rules affect this issue? Japan taxes cryptocurrency profits as “miscellaneous income” at rates up to 55%. This high tax burden is seen as a barrier to adoption. The proposed reforms, tied to the ETF timeline, aim to create a more favorable tax regime to encourage regulated market participation. Q5: What are the potential risks of accelerating the approval of crypto ETFs? Risks include potential market volatility, inadequate investor education, insufficient custody safeguards for the underlying assets, and the possibility of exacerbating financial systemic risk if the products are not properly structured and regulated from the outset.

The ETF will stake a portion of its AVAX holdings, distributing rewards to holders after deducting fees. VanEck claims its Avalanche ETF is the first and currently the only US-listed ETP focused on providing investors with exposure to Avalanche’s native token’s price returns and potential staking rewards. Kyle DaCruz, Director, Digital Assets Product with VanEck, stated , “We’re excited to launch VAVX to provide investors with a transparent, exchange-traded vehicle to access a network that we believe will drive the next phase of institutional blockchain adoption.” Avalanche ETF spurs AVAX market optimism The proposal outlined that the Avalanche ETF will have a 0.30% management fee despite general market volatility. According to the SEC report, the staking provider will routinely credit staking incentives after subtracting any relevant compensation, such as the custodian staking facilitation fee. Additionally, VanEck is waiving all sponsor fees for VAVX through the fund’s first $500 million in assets or until 2/28/26. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, Coinbase Crypto Services will take 4% from staking rewards under the terms of the “staking provider consideration” agreement. Currently, there is no custodian staking facilitation cost. The SEC report revealed that Benqi Finance (sAVAX), Hypha (STAVAX), and Yield Yak (yyAVAX) will provide a liquid staking solution that allows holders of AVAX to deposit them with their smart contract. The VanEck proposal also highlighted that the goal of the investment is to track the performance of AVAX’s price and the benefits of staking some of the trust’s AVAX holdings. The report mentioned that the Avalanche ETF will track the price of AVAX using the MarketVector Avalanche Benchmark Rate price index. The optimism surrounding VanEck’s Avalanche ETF launch remains a key driver of prices. AVAX is now testing a pivotal support zone near $12, following a steady decline from the mid-$13s. Price is no longer accelerating lower, but it is also failing to attract sustained demand, a behavior that often appears when a market is hovering above support without conviction. According to analysts, Avalanche is trading at a structural fork, with price pinned between a base that must hold and resistance that must break. As long as AVAX continues to defend the $11–$12 region and manages to reclaim the $14.80 band, structure begins to recover, and the target towards $18–$20 comes back into view. A failure to hold this base, however, exposes a much thinner zone beneath, where price could drift towards the $9–$10 region. This remains a level-driven market, and direction will be decided by how the price behaves at these boundaries rather than by expectation in the middle. Meanwhile, the coin is trading at $11.7 Avalanche blockchain sees broad adoption The Avalanche market is experiencing a resurgence of enthusiasm following a rise in on-chain activity. Last week, active addresses rose by 1,733% from 30K to over 600K. Grayscale also observed that Avalanche’s C‑Chain gained momentum in late 2025, averaging 2.5 million on‑chain transactions over seven days. Avalanche C-Chain transactions. Source: Grayscale At the same time, Avalanche’s blockchain technology is gaining traction across various sectors. In the gaming industry, popular games like Off the Grid and MapleStory are now operating on Avalanche’s Layer 1 blockchains. In the asset management industry, companies like KKR and SkyBridge Capital have started the process of tokenizing their funds through Avalanche’s platform. The public sector is also adopting Avalanche’s strength, with $240 billion of property records in New Jersey being tokenized. Additionally, the California Department of Motor Vehicles is using Avalanche to tokenize car titles.

The Ifo Institute in Munich said Monday its business climate reading stayed at 87.6 points this month, unchanged from December and below what economists had predicted. Around 9,000 companies answer the monthly survey. Analysts polled by The Wall Street Journal had expected the number to climb to 88.0. “The German economy is starting the new year with little momentum,” Clemens Fuest, who leads the Ifo Institute, said in a statement. The flat reading comes as IG Metall, Germany’s most powerful autoworker union, said it would increase pressure on companies like Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz if they keep pushing cost cuts and moving work to other countries. The union is getting ready for wage talks in the metal and electrical engineering sector later this year, with tough negotiations expected around autumn. Nadine Boguslawski, the head treasurer at IG Metall who sits on the boards of Mercedes and major parts maker Robert Bosch, spoke Monday at the union’s yearly press meeting. “We are prepared to take a stand against corporate strategies that prioritize profits and then resort to circumventing collective agreements and relocating abroad,” she said. “The driving force behind the economic upturn in 2026 will be employees and their incomes.” The union and carmakers will face off as the industry deals with tougher competition in China and from Chinese companies, the effects of American tariffs , and slower-than-hoped demand for electric cars. Worker representatives hold unusual power at big German companies. They get half the seats on supervisory boards, which lets them shape and even stop major company plans. Germany’s car industry had a rough year marked by warnings about lower profits and restructuring plans. Manufacturers pulled back on electric vehicle programs because fewer people bought them than expected. Companies have announced job cuts that will eliminate close to 100,000 positions by 2030, with Bosch cutting the most. Some cost-cutting shows results Some recent cost-cutting has shown results. Volkswagen said last week it had better-than-expected cash flow from its car business in 2025. Most of that came from putting off investments. Parts supplier ZF Friedrichshafen also reported stronger cash flow after customers canceled several electric car projects. While companies resize their plans, competition from Chinese carmakers like BYD keeps growing both in China, the world’s largest car market, and through cars shipped into Europe. German car production has been stuck at the same level for three straight years, staying well under where it was before the crisis. Production in 2025 was about 11% lower than in 2019. IG Metall says any government help for the industry should benefit workers in Germany. Union chair Christiane Benner said she wants “a clear commitment against relocations, site closures and layoffs — immediately,” according to a statement from the union. The business climate reading stayed flat even though the government rolled out stimulus programs. Confidence had picked up at the start of last year after German officials promised up to around one trillion dollars in spending for the country’s roads, bridges, and military. But that confidence stopped growing after summer when higher American tariffs began affecting businesses, and worries increased about how fast the stimulus money would actually reach companies. “The unchanged Ifo index reflects the uncertainty that has hit the German economy again on the back of geopolitical tensions and tariff threats,” Carsten Brzeski at ING said. Confidence likely took another hit in January after President Trump threatened to put extra tariffs on several European nations, including Germany, because they would not agree to a deal for the United States to “acquire” Greenland. Brzeski said people should not read too much into the Ifo number. It is not clear if most companies answered the survey before or after President Trump backed away from the additional tariff threats. The index showed the assessment of how things are right now went up slightly, while expectations for the future dropped a bit. By sector, the business climate got much better in manufacturing but got worse in services. Sentiment also went up in trade and construction, the Ifo Institute said. Signs of economic recovery emerge Information released earlier this month showed the German economy returned to growth last year for the first time since 2022, with output helped by more investment in the final three months of the year. Investor confidence jumped in January to its highest point since July 2021, based on the ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment, while purchasing managers’ indexes also improved. Factory data also points to a solid comeback in the industrial sector, which should get stronger as stimulus money starts flowing through the economy more quickly this year, Brzeski added. But Germany should not become too comfortable. The country needs major reforms to make sure growth bounces back and stays strong. “It is up to German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and his government to implement these reforms this year and turn a long-awaited rebound into a sustainable recovery,” Brzeski said.

This prediction, made in early 2025, hinges on the silent integration of blockchain infrastructure into the fabric of everyday digital interactions, from payments to identity verification. Consequently, the debate may soon shift from *if* people will use crypto to *how* they will interact with its invisible architecture. Decoding Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s Crypto Adoption Thesis Brian Armstrong’s commentary extends beyond corporate optimism. It reflects a broader industry thesis about technological absorption. Historically, transformative technologies often fade into the background. For instance, most internet users today do not consciously think about TCP/IP protocols when sending an email. Similarly, Armstrong suggests blockchain and cryptocurrency protocols will become the unseen plumbing for digital value transfer. This transition from a visible, often volatile asset class to an embedded utility is central to his argument. Therefore, critics focusing on price speculation may miss the underlying shift toward utility-based adoption. The Historical Precedent of Invisible Technology Experts frequently draw parallels to other technological revolutions. “We don’t say we’re ‘using HTTP’ when we browse the web,” noted Dr. Aisha Chen, a fintech historian at Stanford University, in a 2024 paper. “The end-user experience abstracts away the complexity.” Blockchain development is increasingly following this path. Major projects focus on improving scalability and user experience (UX) to the point where the blockchain itself becomes incidental to the service provided. For example, a user paying for a coffee with a digital wallet may not know or care if the settlement layer is a blockchain or a traditional ledger, provided it is fast, cheap, and secure. The Driving Forces Behind Invisible Crypto Integration Several concurrent developments make Armstrong’s prediction plausible. First, regulatory clarity in major economies like the EU, with its MiCA framework, and evolving U.S. guidelines are creating safer environments for builders. Second, technological advancements in layer-2 scaling solutions and zero-knowledge proofs are drastically reducing transaction costs and times, enabling micro-transactions. Third, institutional adoption for settlement and asset tokenization is building the backbone for consumer-facing applications. Regulatory Frameworks: Clear rules reduce risk for developers integrating crypto features into mainstream apps. Scalability Solutions: Networks now handle thousands of transactions per second at minimal cost. User Experience (UX) Focus: Wallet and key management are becoming seamless, often handled in the background. Institutional Backbone: Major financial entities are building infrastructure that consumers will eventually touch indirectly. Moreover, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) could act as a bridge. They may familiarize the public with digital bearer assets on blockchain rails, smoothing the path for broader crypto acceptance. From Criticism to Unconscious Use: A Psychological Shift The most intriguing part of Armstrong’s statement addresses the critic’s journey. Current criticism often centers on volatility, complexity, energy use, or illicit activity. However, as the technology matures, these pain points are actively being solved. Proof-of-Stake networks have addressed many environmental concerns. Simplified custody solutions reduce complexity. Furthermore, when the technology is embedded, the user’s motive changes. One does not use a ride-sharing app to “use the internet”; one uses it to get a car. Similarly, future users might use an app for its utility, with crypto as the enabling, hidden layer. Evolution of Crypto Criticisms vs. Industry Responses (2020-2025) Primary Criticism (2020-2022) Industry Response & Trend (2023-2025) Result for End-User High Energy Consumption (PoW) Widespread shift to Proof-of-Stake (e.g., Ethereum Merge) Environmental impact reduced by ~99.9%; less salient for critics. Poor Scalability & High Fees ProLiferation of Layer-2 rollups & alternative L1s Fast, sub-cent transactions possible; enables daily micro-use. Complex User Experience Seedless wallets, social recovery, embedded wallets in apps Interaction feels like traditional web2 login/payment. Use for Illicit Activity Enhanced, compliant on-chain analytics and regulatory tech Perceived legitimacy increases for mainstream products. The Role of Major Corporations and Infrastructure Large technology and financial companies are pivotal in this immersion strategy. When a social media platform integrates digital tipping via blockchain, or a game uses NFTs for in-game items, users engage with crypto concepts without needing technical knowledge. Payment giants are experimenting with blockchain settlement. This corporate adoption builds the infrastructure that makes Armstrong’s “daily use” scenario operational. It moves cryptocurrency from something you *hold* to something that *powers* services you already use. Potential Impacts on Finance, Identity, and Digital Ownership The long-term impact of widespread, invisible crypto use is profound. In finance, it could enable truly global, instant, and programmable money. For identity, it might give users control over verifiable credentials, logging into services without passwords. Digital ownership of assets—from concert tickets to software licenses—could become portable and interoperable across platforms. These changes, however, will happen incrementally. The first wave for many may be loyalty points tokenized on a blockchain or a verified credential for a professional license. Subsequently, these isolated use cases will coalesce into a new digital experience layer. Conclusion Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s prediction that critics will one day use cryptocurrency daily underscores a strategic vision for the technology’s evolution. The focus is shifting from speculative trading to seamless, utility-driven integration. As scalability, regulation, and user experience improve, blockchain’s most significant achievement may be its own disappearance from the user’s conscious thought. Ultimately, the measure of crypto’s success may not be its price, but its imperceptible and reliable presence in the background of our digital lives, fulfilling Brian Armstrong’s forecast of inevitable, unconscious adoption. FAQs Q1: What did Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong actually say about crypto critics? Brian Armstrong predicted that even the most ardent critics of cryptocurrency will eventually use it on a daily basis. He added that due to the nature of the evolving technology, they might not even realize they are interacting with blockchain-based systems. Q2: How could someone use crypto without knowing it? This could happen through embedded financial technology. For example, using a mobile app for cross-border payments, verifying a digital driver’s license, or owning a tokenized in-game item might all be powered by blockchain infrastructure that is completely abstracted away from the user interface. Q3: What technologies are making “invisible” crypto use possible? Key technologies include layer-2 scaling solutions (like rollups) for speed and low cost, improved wallet security and recovery, zero-knowledge proofs for privacy, and robust application programming interfaces (APIs) that let developers easily add crypto features to existing apps. Q4: Isn’t crypto mainly for investment and speculation? While speculation has dominated public perception, the underlying blockchain technology has always been designed for peer-to-peer transactions and trustless agreements. The industry is now building tangible utility in supply chain, digital identity, and automated finance (DeFi), moving beyond pure speculation. Q5: What are the biggest hurdles to this vision of daily, invisible adoption? The main hurdles remain regulatory uncertainty in key markets, the need for even greater scalability for global adoption, and overcoming the remaining UX complexities related to private key management. However, progress in each area is accelerating rapidly.

The report suggests this regulatory move could unlock a long-anticipated surge in asset tokenization across traditional financial institutions. This assessment arrives at a critical juncture, as blockchain infrastructure reaches new levels of maturity and the market clamors for definitive rules. The CLARITY Act: A Potential Inflection Point for Tokenization Jefferies’ recent research note, cited by financial news outlets including CoinDesk, places significant weight on the legislative proposal formally known as the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act. The bank’s analysts argue that the act’s primary function—to establish a federal regulatory framework for payment stablecoins—serves as a foundational step for broader digital asset adoption. Consequently, this regulatory scaffolding could accelerate institutional confidence in tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs). Tokenization, the process of converting rights to an asset into a digital token on a blockchain, promises profound efficiency gains. These gains include near-instant settlement, enhanced liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets, and automated compliance through smart contracts. However, widespread adoption has historically faced a significant barrier: regulatory uncertainty. The CLARITY Act directly addresses a core component of this ecosystem, potentially clearing a major path forward. Building Blocks: Mature Infrastructure Meets Regulatory Momentum The Jefferies report does not view the CLARITY Act in isolation. Instead, it contextualizes the legislation within a broader technological and regulatory trajectory that has been building for years. The analysis highlights two concurrent developments creating a fertile ground for change. First, blockchain infrastructure has demonstrably matured. Enterprise-grade platforms now offer the security, scalability, and interoperability required by large financial institutions. Second, global regulatory bodies are progressively moving from a stance of observation to one of active framework development. This dual progress lays essential groundwork for the tokenization trend Jefferies anticipates. Expert Analysis on Market Structure Definition The Jefferies analysis emphasizes a crucial nuance. While the CLARITY Act focuses on stablecoins, its passage could spur faster action on a more comprehensive U.S. crypto market structure bill. A precise legal definition for digital asset securities, commodities, and payment instruments remains the holy grail for institutional deployment. Clear rules would allow banks, asset managers, and insurers to allocate capital and develop products with defined compliance parameters. Financial technology experts often cite the need for this clarity. They argue that without it, institutions operate in a gray area, limiting innovation to pilot programs and proofs-of-concept. The table below contrasts the current state with the potential post-CLARITY Act environment: Aspect Current Environment Potential Post-CLARITY Environment Stablecoin Issuance Fragmented state-level rules, federal uncertainty Federal chartering options, clear reserve & redemption standards Institutional On-Ramps Complex, bespoke compliance for each bank Standardized custody and transaction rules for regulated entities Tokenization Pilots Limited to private networks, small scale Potential for interoperable public/private networks, larger scale Assessing the Impact on Financial Ecosystems Jefferies projects that the impact of regulatory clarity would ripple across multiple sectors with tangible effects. The report identifies three primary beneficiary groups should the legislative trend solidify. Traditional Financial Institutions: Major banks and asset managers could aggressively develop tokenized offerings for treasury bonds, private equity funds, and trade finance. This would create new revenue streams and improve operational efficiency. Blockchain-Based Companies: Infrastructure providers,合规 technology firms, and security auditors would see demand surge as institutions seek partners to build compliant systems. The Broader Tokenization Industry: Success in financial markets could spur tokenization in adjacent fields like real estate, carbon credits, and intellectual property, creating a more unified digital asset economy. Despite this optimistic outlook, the report acknowledges legislative uncertainty. The passage of the CLARITY Act, or any major market structure bill, involves a complex political process. However, Jefferies suggests that even the serious debate and progression of such legislation can have a market-positive effect, signaling to institutions that the regulatory endpoint is in sight. Conclusion The analysis from Jefferies positions the U.S. CLARITY Act as more than a stablecoin rulebook. It represents a potential keystone in the arch of modern financial infrastructure. By addressing a fundamental layer of the digital asset stack, the act could catalyze a wave of institutional tokenization that leverages now-mature blockchain technology. While its passage is not guaranteed, the very pursuit of such clarity marks a significant step away from ambiguity and toward a structured future for finance. The coming months will be critical in determining whether this potential turning point for tokenization becomes a reality. FAQs Q1: What is the CLARITY Act? The Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act is a proposed U.S. law aimed at creating a federal regulatory framework for issuers of payment stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value relative to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. Q2: Why does Jefferies link the CLARITY Act to asset tokenization? Jefferies analysts believe that clear regulation for stablecoins, a key tool for settling tokenized asset transactions, would reduce risk and uncertainty for traditional financial institutions, thereby encouraging them to pursue larger-scale tokenization projects. Q3: What is asset tokenization? Asset tokenization is the process of converting the ownership rights of a physical or financial asset (like real estate, bonds, or art) into a digital token on a blockchain. This can make assets more divisible, easier to transfer, and simpler to track. Q4: What are the main hurdles to institutional tokenization today? The primary hurdles include regulatory uncertainty, concerns over compliance and anti-money laundering rules, technological integration challenges with legacy systems, and questions about the legal enforceability of smart contracts. Q5: Has tokenization been successful anywhere yet? Yes, several successful pilots and limited productions exist. For example, central banks are exploring wholesale central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) for settlements, and financial institutions in Europe and Asia have tokenized government bonds and money market funds on regulated platforms.

This counterintuitive dynamic challenges a long-held market axiom and underscores a profound shift in investor psychology, according to a detailed on-chain analysis. Traditionally, cryptocurrency investors have viewed dollar weakness as a direct tailwind for digital assets. However, current conditions reveal a more complex relationship where macroeconomic fear overrides conventional catalysts. Bitcoin Price and the Broken Dollar Correlation The inverse correlation between the US dollar and Bitcoin has formed a cornerstone of crypto market analysis for years. Historically, a falling dollar often signals easier global financial conditions, potentially driving capital toward alternative, non-fiat stores of value. Consequently, analysts frequently cite dollar weakness as a bullish signal for cryptocurrencies. Recent data, however, paints a different picture. The DXY has retreated from recent highs, yet the Bitcoin price continues to trade within a tight, fearful range, lacking upward momentum. This decoupling prompts a critical re-examination of the underlying drivers for crypto asset valuation. GugaOnChain, a noted CryptoQuant contributor and on-chain analyst, provides crucial context for this anomaly. The analyst’s research, reported by CryptoPotato, indicates that a weaker dollar alone is an insufficient catalyst. Instead, it must coincide with specific macroeconomic conditions to fuel a sustainable Bitcoin rally. These conditions primarily include persistent high inflation and abundant systemic liquidity. In such an environment, investors actively seek inflation hedges outside the traditional financial system. Currently, neither condition is fully met, leaving the typical transmission mechanism between dollar value and crypto prices effectively broken. Macroeconomic Fear Drives a Flight to Safety The dominant theme in 2025’s first quarter is a potent risk-off sentiment sweeping across global financial markets. Several factors contribute to this climate of caution. Geopolitical tensions continue to simmer, central banks maintain a restrictive stance compared to the zero-rate era, and concerns about economic growth linger. In this environment, fear governs asset allocation decisions. Investors demonstrate a clear preference for capital preservation over aggressive growth speculation. This psychology directly impacts the Bitcoin price, as the asset’s perceived volatility conflicts with the desire for stability. When fear dominates, capital flows toward assets with centuries of established trust. Gold, the quintessential safe haven, has notably outperformed Bitcoin during recent periods of dollar weakness. This trend highlights a critical distinction in investor perception. Despite being labeled “digital gold” by proponents, Bitcoin has not yet universally achieved that status during systemic stress. The analyst emphasizes that during crises of confidence and extreme risk aversion—scenarios that can also weaken the dollar—cryptocurrencies often decline in tandem with risk assets like stocks. This correlation with equities, rather than decoupling as a true safe haven, currently exerts more influence on the Bitcoin price than dollar movements. The Crucial Role of Liquidity and Inflation To understand the missing link, one must analyze the liquidity landscape. The period of rampant quantitative easing (QE) post-2020 created a massive pool of cheap capital that flowed into various risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. That liquidity tide has receded. Current monetary policy, while not uniformly tight globally, lacks the firehose-like abundance of previous years. Without this excess liquidity sloshing through the system, even a weaker dollar struggles to push significant new capital into the crypto ecosystem. The mechanism is clogged. Similarly, the inflation narrative has evolved. While inflation remains above central bank targets in many economies, the peak fear of hyperinflation or a complete loss of fiat credibility has subsided. This moderation reduces the urgent, panic-driven demand for alternative stores of value. The table below contrasts the historical catalyst environment with current conditions: Macro Factor Historical Rally Catalyst (e.g., 2020-2021) Current Market State (Early 2025) US Dollar Trend Falling Falling Systemic Liquidity Abundant (QE) Restricted / Normalized Inflation Psychology Rising Fear / “Fiat Debasement” Managed Fear / Contained Overall Market Sentiment Risk-On Risk-Off Primary Beneficiary Bitcoin & Risk Assets Gold & Treasuries This comparative analysis clearly shows why the outcome differs despite a similar dollar trend. The surrounding conditions dictate the market’s reaction. Key takeaways for investors include: Context is paramount: Isolated indicators like the DXY provide limited insight. Sentiment dictates flows: Fear overwhelms theoretical correlations. Liquidity is the lifeblood: Without it, price catalysts remain dormant. On-Chain Data and Investor Behavior Beyond macroeconomic theory, on-chain metrics offer a real-time window into investor behavior that explains the stagnant Bitcoin price. Analysis of exchange flows shows neither significant accumulation nor aggressive distribution, indicating a wait-and-see approach. Furthermore, the velocity of Bitcoin—the rate at which it changes hands—remains low. This suggests that existing holders are not transacting actively, and new speculative capital is not entering the network at a scale needed to drive a rally. The market is in a state of equilibrium, biased slightly toward fear. The behavior of long-term holders (LTHs) versus short-term holders (STHs) is particularly telling. LTHs continue to hold steadfast, showing conviction, but they are not providing buying pressure. STHs, typically the source of volatile trading, are inactive or are selling at minimal profits or losses, reflecting the risk-off environment. This stagnation in network activity underscores that a weaker dollar, without accompanying positive sentiment or a compelling macro narrative, fails to trigger the algorithmic and human trading decisions that propel prices upward. Historical Precedents and Market Maturation This is not the first time Bitcoin’s correlation with the dollar has broken down. Similar periods occurred during the 2018 bear market and phases of the 2022 downturn. Each instance coincided with a contraction in global liquidity and a flight to safety. However, the market structure in 2025 is more mature. The presence of institutional players, regulated ETFs, and more sophisticated derivatives means reactions to macro data are more nuanced and less driven by retail speculation alone. This maturation may lead to more frequent periods of decoupling as Bitcoin finds its own equilibrium based on a broader set of factors, including: Adoption metrics and network utility Regulatory developments Institutional custody flows Global accessibility and legal tender status in select nations Conclusion The analysis reveals a critical lesson for 2025: the Bitcoin price does not move in a vacuum based on a single inverse indicator like the US dollar. Its trajectory is a complex function of liquidity, macroeconomic sentiment, and competing safe-haven assets. The current risk-off climate, characterized by fear and a preference for traditional stores of value like gold, has severed the simple weak-dollar-strong-Bitcoin narrative. For a sustained rally to materialize, the market likely requires a shift back to a risk-on mindset, coupled with renewed liquidity or a sharp resurgence in inflation fears. Until then, dollar weakness alone will remain an insufficient catalyst, highlighting the cryptocurrency market’s ongoing integration into and reaction to broader global financial dynamics. FAQs Q1: Why isn’t Bitcoin rising if the US dollar is getting weaker? A1: A weaker dollar typically helps Bitcoin only when combined with high inflation and abundant market liquidity. Currently, widespread risk-off sentiment and fear are driving investors toward traditional safe havens like gold instead, overriding the dollar’s influence. Q2: What does “risk-off sentiment” mean for cryptocurrency? A2: Risk-off sentiment describes a market environment where investors prioritize safety and capital preservation. They sell volatile assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies and move money into perceived stable assets such as government bonds, gold, and stable currencies, leading to downward pressure on the Bitcoin price. Q3: Has the correlation between Bitcoin and the US dollar changed permanently? A3: Not necessarily. Correlations in financial markets are dynamic. The relationship may reassert itself if macroeconomic conditions shift back to a high-liquidity, risk-on environment. The current decoupling shows Bitcoin’s price drivers are multifaceted and context-dependent. Q4: What macroeconomic conditions would help Bitcoin rise alongside a weaker dollar? A4: Key conditions include aggressive monetary easing (creating new liquidity), a sharp rise in inflation expectations that undermines faith in fiat currency, and a general shift in investor psychology from fear to optimism about economic growth and risk assets. Q5: How does gold’s performance relate to Bitcoin’s current price action? A5: Gold’s outperformance during this period of dollar weakness acts as a clear signal of the market’s risk-off preference. Capital is flowing into the established, centuries-old store of value rather than the newer digital alternative, demonstrating that in times of acute fear, perceived stability trumps technological innovation for many investors.

A new survey of crypto platforms operating in the country found that nearly 40% of all transactions are blocked or delayed by banks. The UK’s banking sector is allegedly “debanking” crypto platforms operating in the jurisdiction. A recent survey by the UK Cryptoasset Business Council (UKCBC) revealed that nearly 40% of all transactions to crypto exchanges are blocked or delayed by banks, causing inconvenience and customer friction. Debanking concerns on crypto platforms in the UK intensify, survey shows The report named “Locked Out: Debanking the UK’s Digital Asset Economy” noted that the “ debanking ” trend is worsening amid the implementation of new restrictions. According to the survey report, the “action by UK banks is incompatible with the City Minister’s recent statement of the UK government’s plans to make the ‘UK at the top of the list for cryptoassets firms looking to grow.'” The UKCBC surveyed ten of the largest crypto exchange platforms in the UK, including Coinbase, Uphold, Kraken, Zumo, Wirex, OKX, Luno, Bitpanda, Xapo Bank, and Gemini. These exchanges offer crypto services to millions of UK citizens and have processed hundreds of billions of pounds in transactions. One crypto exchange said it had experienced a decline in transactions worth £1 billion ($1.2 billion) over the past year due to bank-side rejections of card payments and bank transfers in the UK alone. The survey found that 80% of exchanges reported an increase in customer friction due to blocked, delayed, or limited transfers over the past 12 months. Only two exchanges reported no changes, while one reported an increase. The survey also found that 70% of UK crypto exchanges described the prevailing UK banking environment for crypto enterprises as deteriorating into greater hostility. All exchanges said that banks do not provide clear reasons for blocking transactions or restricting accounts. The report also highlighted that Wise and Revolut , leading international money transfer platforms, have entered the crypto space, yet they also block, delay, and limit transactions to other crypto platforms. The UKCBC reported that the debanking challenge is undermining domestic innovation and driving competition overseas. Countries like the U.S. have initiated processes of streamlining the clarity of crypto assets, a move that is set to merge traditional finance with decentralized assets. UKCBC gives recommendations to solve UK bank-crypto friction The UKCBC gave several recommendations to improve the UK’s financial ecosystem by bridging crypto exchanges with the traditional banking sector. The council recommended that the FCA require banks to establish a risk-based framework that recognizes the diversity of centralized exchanges and encourages close interactions between banks and legislators. The council also urged the FCA and the UK government to encourage banks to move away from treating all retail crypto users as equally “high risk.” The council’s report also recommended that the FCA mandate banks to remove unnecessary frictions for exchanges registered under the FCA and promote anti-competitive practices. The UKCBC also advised the UK government to create a forum for regular engagement among regulators, banks, and crypto exchanges to tackle issues such as fraud and other criminal activities. The news comes after Cryptopolitan reported on January 26 that the UK’s biggest banks will raise profit targets in the near future, after recording strong earnings. The publication noted that rising interest rates and cost-control measures are driving better-than-expected performance. Sources familiar with the matter revealed that NatWest intends to boost its 2027 projection from the current 15% to possibly 17%. The analysts also predicted that Barclays and HSBC could raise their targets by up to 200 basis points after outlining their strategies for the following years. European banking shares have risen dramatically after years of low profitability since the financial crisis. The sector’s valuation has more than doubled since early 2024 and risen 60% in the last year, casting a shadow over U.S. banks.

At the same time, it will expand the list of trading choices offered on Binance Spot by adding six new pairs. Ukrainians Will Feel the Changes Binance conducted another periodic review on its listed spot pairs to check for vital factors, including liquidity and trading volume. Following the analysis, it decided to remove the following ones: BTC/UAH, COMP/BTC, ETC/ETH, MOVE/BNB, PNUT/FDUSD, SHIB/DOGE, TON/BTC, and others. The delisting will take effect on January 27 and will not affect the availability of the tokens on Binance Spot. “Users can still trade the spot trading pair’s base and quote assets on other trading pair(s) that are available on Binance,” the disclosure reads. The amendment is particularly important for Ukrainian clients. The Ukrainian Hryvnia (UAH) is the official currency of the country, and the removal of a direction pair between BTC and the domestic currency can make it harder for locals to move in and out of the cryptocurrency market. As a result, Ukrainians may be forced to first convert their funds into another fiat currency before gaining exposure to the leading digital asset, adding extra friction to the process. Meanwhile, most tokens included in the delisting effort are in the red today (January 26), which is a rather normal reaction when Binance withdraws its support. However, the move south is more likely to have been caused by the broader market decline observed in the past few days. The Listing Announcement Contrary to the aforementioned disclosure, the company also revealed that it will expand the list of choices on Binance Spot and “enhance users’ trading experience” by adding BNB/U, ETH/U, KGST/U, SOL/U, TRX/USD1, and USD1/U. The inclusion is scheduled again for January 27. U refers to United Stables, a stablecoin that saw the light of day towards the end of last year and is pegged to the American dollar. To stimulate users onboarding of the new services, Binance introduced zero maker fees on BNB/U, ETH/U, KGST/U, SOL/U, and USD1/U until further notice. “During the Validity Period, Standard taker fees will apply to regular and VIP 1 users for BNB/U, ETH/U, and SOL/U, and the trading volume of these pairs will count toward regular and VIP 1 users’ VIP tier calculation,” the announcement reads.

The Tokyo-listed firm announced it booked a Bitcoin impairment loss of $720 million (¥104.6 billion) following a BTC price decline. It also reported a $155 million (¥22.6 billion) foreign-exchange translation gain from yen depreciation in other comprehensive income. After netting these effects, Metaplanet said the value of its Bitcoin net assets dropped by about $565 million (¥82 billion) for the period. The company held 35,102 Bitcoin as of Dec. 31, 2025. Metaplanet declined to provide guidance for ordinary income or net income attributable to shareholders, citing Bitcoin price volatility as too unpredictable. Fiscal 2026 Forecast Bets Big On BTC Income Metaplanet projected fiscal 2026 revenue of $110 million (¥16.0 billion), more than double its fiscal 2025 revenue forecast of $61 million (¥8.9 billion). It forecast operating income of $78 million (¥11.4 billion), assuming selling, general, and administrative expenses of about $32 million (¥4.6 billion). The company expects $107 million (¥15.6 billion) of its $110 million revenue forecast to come from Bitcoin Income Generation operations. It said expanded Bitcoin holdings in fiscal 2025 increase available capital and BTC collateral for Bitcoin-related options, supporting premium income through fiscal 2026. Metaplanet converts yen to U.S. dollars for operations and Bitcoin purchases. The firm plans to continue separating Bitcoin price effects from foreign-exchange impacts in its disclosures and describes itself as a ”Bitcoin Treasury company,” publishing daily BTC holdings, unrealized gains/losses, and related metrics on its website. Metaplanet Stock Builds Range With Clear Technical Targets Metaplanet shares are trading within a broad consolidation pattern after a sharp rally triggered by the company's initial Bitcoin purchases. The weekly chart shows price action within a rising channel, with recent candles compressing into a defined accumulation range, signaling cooling momentum rather than a trend reversal, as higher lows hold above channel support. Volume expanded during the initial breakout, then faded during sideways action. Recent volume pickup near range lows suggests renewed buyer interest defending support. The volume profile shows heavy trading interest clustered below current price levels, often acting as a cushion during pullbacks. Technical analysis from X user Enea₿ highlights upside targets at $6.20 (¥900), $13.45 (¥1,954), and $30.50 (¥4,435) over a six-month horizon. These levels align with prior resistance and rising channel extensions but assume Bitcoin recovers toward $115,000 territory, keeping Metaplanet's equity tightly correlated to BTC price action. As long as price holds within the accumulation box and respects rising channel support, the broader structure remains bullish. A sustained breakout above the range would target the lower levels first, while channel support failure would undermine the setup.

While bullish patterns like the cup-and-handle and ascending triangle are shaping up, confirmation is required before any decisive move. Last Defense Zone: $2,274–$2,104 And The Libra Reversal Setup Kamile Uray shared that Ethereum is currently trying to hold above the critical support zone between $2,775 and $2,623. This area has become a key battleground for bulls and bears, with buyers attempting to defend it to prevent further downside. If this support continues to hold, ETH could regain short-term stability and make another attempt to move higher. Related Reading: Ethereum Loses Structure After $3,220 Rejection — Is This Distribution Or Just The First Crack? On the upside, a sustained bounce from this zone could allow Ethereum to revisit the pink box resistance around the $3,445 level. A clean breakout above this resistance would activate bullish structures such as a cup-and-handle or an ascending triangle, signaling growing bullish momentum and opening the path toward the $3,894 level. However, this becomes possible if ETH manages to close above the $3,661 peak, confirming the formation of the first major high. The $3,894 level carries technical significance, as it represents the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement of the most recent downward wave. A decisive close above this level would suggest continuation of the recovery. Failure to hold above it, however, could trigger renewed selling pressure and lead to another corrective move lower. On the downside, if Ethereum loses the $2,623 support, a deeper decline toward the pink box zone between $2,274 and $2,104 would become likely. This area is notable for the potential formation of a bullish Libra pattern. Should reversal confirmation emerge from this zone, ETH could attempt another recovery phase, with the broader objective of retesting its previous highs. Waiting For Confirmation: ETH’s Next Move Depends On Price Action Ethereum is currently following the trajectory outlined by Crypto Candy in a recent update on X. As predicted, the asset dipped into the lower support range between $2,600 and $2,700 and is now attempting to stage a recovery from the zone. Should this upward momentum persist, the immediate objective for bulls is a return to the $3,070 level. Related Reading: Ethereum Poised For $4,000 Breakout? Expert Pinpoints On-Chain Triggers For Potential Rally However, for Ethereum to firmly re-enter bullish territory and shift the broader market structure, it must close decisively above the $3,070 threshold. This level serves as the primary gateway for any sustained recovery beyond the current relief rally. Until that breakout occurs, the prevailing market bias remains firmly bearish, as the failure to reclaim and hold above $3,070 suggests that the path of least resistance is still to the downside, with lower price points remaining the primary expectation for the short term.

XRP has experienced extended periods of consolidation and episodic rallies, making technical analysis an essential tool for traders and investors seeking to anticipate meaningful moves. Recent data suggest the cryptocurrency may be forming a structure that signals a sustained bullish phase. Egrag Crypto recently highlighted a long-term XRP/USD chart on X, identifying what appears to be a triple bottom pattern. According to the analysis, XRP established repeated support near $0.35 in 2022, 2023, and 2024. Each rebound from this floor gradually strengthened the market, culminating in a breakout above the $1.60 resistance level. Egrag Crypto interprets this breakout as a confirmation of bullish momentum, suggesting that XRP could pursue significantly higher price levels. #XRP Patterns Within Pattern: Triple Bottom Pattern pic.twitter.com/A9m4auNMVE — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) January 26, 2026 The Mechanics of a Triple Bottom Pattern A triple bottom forms when an asset tests a support level three times without breaking lower, signaling strong buying interest at a critical price point. Historically, this pattern represents the conclusion of a downtrend and the potential start of an extended upward move. Bulkowski’s chart studies indicate that triple bottoms succeed in roughly 78% of bull market cases, though cryptocurrency volatility introduces additional risk. For XRP, repeated lows illustrate that sellers could not maintain downward pressure, providing a solid foundation for a potential breakout. Measuring the Upside Potential Egrag Crypto employs the “measured move” technique to project potential targets. This method calculates the vertical distance from support to resistance and adds it to the breakout point, creating a roadmap for future price action. Using this framework, the analysis projects XRP could reach as high as $27 , contingent on volume confirmation and sustained market participation. The pattern emphasizes disciplined entry points, highlighting the importance of accumulating positions after the breakout rather than chasing short-term spikes. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Current Market Alignment As of report time, XRP trades around $1.89. Price action indicates that support around $1.88 remains intact, suggesting a transition from consolidation to a potential multi-month bullish phase. While macroeconomic factors and broader crypto market fluctuations may influence momentum, technical evidence underscores a strong probability of continued upward pressure. Implications for Traders and Investors Egrag Crypto’s analysis frames XRP as a high-conviction candidate for accumulation. Traders can monitor support and resistance levels to confirm trend strength, while long-term investors may view the breakout as a structural entry point. If the triple bottom holds and momentum sustains, XRP could validate the projected targets, offering a roadmap for both strategic positioning and tactical trades. By combining historical pattern reliability, breakout confirmation, and volume-based validation, the triple bottom pattern presents a compelling technical case for XRP’s next leg up, potentially propelling the cryptocurrency toward significant gains.

The trial opens in California Superior Court in Los Angeles County, where a 19-year-old California woman known as K.G.M. has brought claims against Meta Platforms, TikTok and YouTube. Court documents show she argues the companies built their platforms with features designed to capture attention, which she says led to addictive use starting when she was young. The woman claims this use contributed to depression and thoughts of suicide. First test of legal claims against platforms According to Matthew Bergman, the lawyer representing K.G.M., this marks the first time these technology companies will have to answer for alleged harms in court. “They will be under a level of scrutiny that does not exist when you testify in front of Congress,” Bergman told Reuters. The case is one of multiple lawsuits expected to reach trial this year involving what lawyers are calling addiction to social media among children. The jury hearing the case will weigh whether the companies acted carelessly in offering products that damaged K.G.M.’s mental wellbeing. Jurors must also consider whether her platform use played a major role in her depression, or whether other factors, such as content created by third parties that she saw on the apps, or circumstances in her offline life, were more significant causes. Clay Calvert, who works as a media lawyer at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank that generally supports business interests, described the proceedings as “really a test case.” He said the trial will reveal how legal theories holding social media platforms responsible for user harm hold up in court. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to appear as a witness. Lawyers for Meta told Reuters before the trial that the company plans to argue its products were not responsible for K.G.M.’s mental health struggles. Snap’s CEO Evan Spiegel had also been expected to testify, as Snap was named in the lawsuit, but the company reached a settlement agreement with K.G.M. on January 20. A Snap representative would not discuss details of the settlement. YouTube plans to tell the court that its platform operates differently from social networks like Instagram and TikTok, and should not be grouped with them, according to a YouTube executive speaking ahead of the trial. TikTok did not provide information about its courtroom strategy. Companies launch public outreach efforts While preparing for trial, these same companies have been working across the country to persuade doubters that their platforms are appropriate for teenagers. They have rolled out tools they describe as giving parents greater oversight of their children’s platform use, and have put millions into promoting these features. Meta has been running workshops for parents focused on teen safety online at high schools throughout the United States since at least 2018. In 2024, the company held one such workshop called Screen Smart in Los Angeles. National PTA President Yvonne Johnson and Meta’s safety chief Antigone Davis participated. National PTA is a nonprofit organization focused on child welfare. TikTok has backed similar events through partnerships with 100 local and regional PTA groups under the name Create with Kindness, according to information on the company’s website. The program offered instruction on TikTok features for parents, including ways to restrict nighttime screen use, based on the program’s curriculum. Google, which owns YouTube, has worked with Girl Scouts in recent years as part of its public messaging about protecting children online. Girls can receive a patch displaying Google’s logo for their uniform after finishing lessons covering topics like creating secure passwords, treating others well online, and understanding digital privacy, per the Girl Scouts website. The companies have also brought on legal teams with experience defending corporations in major cases involving addiction. Meta retained lawyers from Covington & Burling who previously represented McKesson in widespread litigation connected to the opioid crisis, according to publicly available attorney biographies. TikTok’s legal team includes lawyers who represented Activision Blizzard and Microsoft in arguments about video game design and addiction. Julie Scelfo, who started Mothers Against Media Addiction, a group backing smartphone restrictions in schools, said the companies are deploying extensive influence campaigns. “These companies are using every lever of influence that you can imagine,” she said. “It can be very confusing for parents who to trust.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The rally followed confirmation that the U.S. Department of Commerce plans to back the company with a $1.6 billion financing package. During regular trading, USAR climbed as much as 20.6% before easing to gains near 15%, reflecting intense investor focus on domestic critical mineral supply chains. Why the sudden excitement? The scale and structure of the funding provided the answer. Commerce Department Outlines $1.6B Financing Package USA Rare Earth disclosed that the Department of Commerce issued a non-binding Letter of Intent under the CHIPS Act covering $277 million in proposed federal funding and a $1.3 billion senior secured loan. The agreement also involves collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy. Officials framed the plan as a strategic move to close supply gaps across rare earth elements essential for semiconductors, advanced manufacturing, and national defense. The package positions USA Rare Earth as a cornerstone of Washington’s push to localize production from mining through magnet manufacturing. Trump Administration Takes Equity Stake Reports from the Financial Times indicated that the Trump administration plans to acquire a 10% stake in USA Rare Earth as part of the broader financing. The reported purchase price reflected roughly a 30% discount to the prior Friday’s closing price, valuing the company at a fully diluted market capitalization of about $4.03 billion. Source: CNBC Via X Separately, USA Rare Earth announced a $1.5 billion private placement priced at 21.50, also below the previous close. Together, the PIPE transaction and proposed government support would lift total available capital to roughly $3.1 billion. Building a Mine-to-Magnet Platform USA Rare Earth continues to advance its vertically integrated strategy. The company is nearing completion of a magnet manufacturing facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma. In September, it acquired U.K.-based Less Common Metals, a producer that secured a U.S. Defense Department grant to expand samarium metal output. Samarium sits among several restricted rare earths that Beijing limited for export in April. These elements play a critical role in military hardware, including high-temperature components used in fighter jets like the F-35. China Restrictions Add Strategic Urgency Despite diplomatic engagement between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, export limits on medium and heavy rare earths remain in place. Materials such as gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium continue to face tight controls. This backdrop has elevated the strategic value of USA Rare Earth’s Round Top deposit in Texas. The company said it accelerated development plans, with commercial production now targeted for late 2028. Peer Stocks Rally Across the Sector USA Rare Earth’s surge lifted sentiment across the rare earth sector. MP Materials gained about 4%, while NioCorp jumped 11%. Critical Metals, Energy Fuels, and American Resources also posted solid gains. The moves echoed earlier government backing for MP Materials, which included a $400 million investment, long-term purchase commitments, and Pentagon loans to support heavy rare earth separation and magnet production. Financial Outlook and Market Volatility USA Rare Earth expects operating expenses and operating losses between $56 million and $62 million for 2025, with capital expenditures ranging from $37 million to $43 million. The stock’s recent breakout followed a volatile period marked by sharp swings. Over the past month, shares climbed steadily along the right side of a consolidation pattern.

This development marks a pivotal shift in how non-accredited investors can participate in the high-growth, yet traditionally exclusive, private markets of leading crypto enterprises. Republic Europe Kraken Exposure Through an SPV Structure Republic Europe’s offering utilizes a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) , a common legal entity in finance. Consequently, this structure pools capital from multiple investors. The SPV then acquires an interest in Kraken, likely through secondary market shares or other financial instruments. Therefore, investors gain exposure to the value fluctuations of Kraken without holding direct equity. This method effectively bypasses the typical high minimum investments and regulatory barriers associated with private company shares. Historically, investing in late-stage private companies like Kraken remained the domain of venture capital firms and ultra-high-net-worth individuals. Republic Europe, a subsidiary of the U.S.-based Republic platform, is strategically expanding this access. The platform is regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC), providing a regulated framework for European Economic Area investors. Democratizing Access to Crypto Infrastructure The launch responds to a clear market demand. Retail investors increasingly seek exposure to the crypto ecosystem beyond simply holding digital assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. They target the “picks and shovels” companies—the exchanges, custodians, and infrastructure providers that facilitate the broader market. Kraken, founded in 2011, stands as one of the world’s oldest and most reputable crypto exchanges. Its valuation has seen substantial growth through multiple funding rounds, though it remains a privately held company. The Regulatory and Market Context This product arrives amid evolving European cryptocurrency regulations, notably the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. MiCA aims to harmonize rules across the EU, potentially increasing investor confidence. Republic Europe’s regulated status allows it to create compliant products that bridge traditional finance and digital assets. Furthermore, the structure offers a potential liquidity path. If Kraken undertakes an initial public offering (IPO) or direct listing, the SPV’s holdings could convert to publicly traded stock, offering an exit opportunity for investors. The following table contrasts traditional private investment with the new SPV model: Aspect Traditional Private Investment Republic Europe SPV Model Minimum Investment Often €500,000+ Dramatically lower, retail-friendly Investor Accreditation Usually required Not typically required for retail Direct Ownership Holds company shares Indirect exposure via SPV Regulatory Access Complex, limited Streamlined via regulated platform Analyzing the Risks and Considerations for Investors While innovative, this indirect exposure model carries specific risks that investors must understand. Firstly, the investment’s value remains entirely tied to Kraken’s private market valuation . This valuation can be volatile and is less transparent than public stock prices. Secondly, liquidity is constrained. Investors cannot simply sell their SPV interest on a public exchange; they may need to wait for a specific liquidity event orchestrated by Republic Europe or Kraken itself. Additionally, fees associated with the SPV structure will impact net returns. These typically include setup, management, and performance fees. Investors should scrutinize the offering documents for full cost disclosure. Finally, concentration risk is a factor. The investment represents a bet on a single private company’s success, unlike a diversified ETF or fund. Expert Perspectives on the Product’s Impact Financial analysts view this as part of a broader trend of asset democratization. “Products like this blur the lines between public and private markets,” notes a fintech analyst from Bloomberg Intelligence. “They offer retail investors a seat at the table previously reserved for institutions, though with a different risk-return and liquidity profile.” The success of this offering could prompt other platforms to launch similar products for other major crypto unicorns, potentially increasing competition and innovation in retail investment vehicles. Conclusion Republic Europe’s launch of a Special Purpose Vehicle for indirect Kraken exposure represents a strategic evolution in cryptocurrency accessibility. It provides a regulated, structured pathway for European retail investors to gain a stake in a leading crypto exchange’s growth trajectory. However, this novel access requires careful consideration of the inherent illiquidity, fee structures, and single-asset risk. As the digital asset landscape matures, such hybrid financial products will likely play an increasingly important role in connecting traditional finance with the innovative world of cryptocurrency infrastructure. FAQs Q1: What exactly is Republic Europe offering to retail investors? A1: Republic Europe is offering a financial product structured as a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV). This SPV allows investors to pool funds and gain indirect exposure to the valuation changes of the private cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, without directly owning its shares. Q2: How does this differ from buying Kraken stock? A2: Kraken is a privately held company, so its stock is not available on public exchanges. This SPV provides a legal mechanism for indirect investment. Investors own a share of the SPV, which holds an interest in Kraken, rather than owning Kraken equity directly. Q3: What are the main risks of this investment? A3: Key risks include illiquidity (you cannot easily sell your position), dependence on Kraken’s private valuation (which can be volatile and opaque), fees associated with the SPV structure, and concentration risk by investing in a single company. Q4: Is this product available to investors worldwide? A4: The product is offered by Republic Europe, which is regulated by CySEC. It is primarily targeted at retail investors within the European Economic Area (EEA). Availability for investors outside the EEA would depend on local regulations. Q5: Could this model be used for other private companies? A5: Yes, absolutely. The SPV structure is a common tool in finance. If this offering proves successful, it could establish a blueprint for other investment platforms to offer similar indirect exposure to other high-value, late-stage private technology and cryptocurrency companies for retail audiences.

This judicial examination follows the court’s February 2024 decision to maintain existing restrictions, creating a significant policy reversal that legal analysts describe as potentially transformative for Brazil’s October 2025 general elections. The reconsideration signals a dramatic shift in how nations approach digital asset integration within democratic processes, particularly as cryptocurrency adoption accelerates across Brazil’s 214 million citizens. Brazil Supreme Court Reconsiders Cryptocurrency Ban: Legal Context and Timeline The Supreme Court’s review represents a substantial departure from established election finance protocols. Initially, Brazilian election authorities implemented cryptocurrency restrictions to prevent anonymous political donations and ensure transparent campaign financing. However, the growing mainstream acceptance of digital assets has prompted judicial reconsideration. Justice Alexandre de Moraes leads the review panel, which must complete its analysis by March 2025, according to court documents obtained by DL News. This timeline provides seven months for potential regulatory adjustments before October’s national elections. Brazil’s existing electoral framework, governed by Law 9,504/1997 and subsequent amendments, currently prohibits cryptocurrency donations through explicit language restricting “anonymous contributions” and mandating traceable financial transactions. The Superior Electoral Court (TSE) reinforced this position in 2022 through Resolution 23,610, which specifically excluded cryptocurrencies from approved donation methods. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court’s current review examines whether updated technological safeguards could enable compliant cryptocurrency integration. Political Landscape and Cryptocurrency Advocacy Brazil’s political environment has evolved significantly regarding digital asset acceptance. Multiple congressional representatives now advocate for cryptocurrency integration, reflecting changing voter demographics and technological adoption patterns. A 2024 survey by the Brazilian Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Association (ABCB) revealed that 16% of Brazilian adults hold some form of cryptocurrency, with higher percentages among younger voters. This demographic shift has prompted politicians to reconsider campaign finance strategies. Presidential hopeful Renan Santos exemplifies this trend, frequently citing El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele as a model for progressive cryptocurrency policy. During a January 2025 campaign event, Santos declared, “Brazil must embrace financial innovation while maintaining electoral integrity. We can develop secure, transparent systems for cryptocurrency donations that enhance democratic participation.” His platform includes proposals for graduated Bitcoin reserve accumulation, mirroring El Salvador’s national strategy but adapted to Brazil’s larger economy. Comparative International Perspectives Brazil’s regulatory reconsideration occurs within a global context of evolving cryptocurrency election policies. The table below illustrates current international approaches: Country Cryptocurrency Campaign Status Regulatory Framework Implementation Year United States Permitted with disclosure FEC Advisory Opinion 2014 2014 El Salvador Fully integrated Bitcoin Law Article 7 2021 European Union Restricted by member state MiCA Regulation 2024 Brazil (Current) Prohibited TSE Resolution 23,610 2022 Brazil (Proposed) Under review Supreme Court examination 2025 This comparative analysis demonstrates Brazil’s potential to establish a middle-ground approach, balancing innovation with regulatory oversight. Notably, the United States Federal Election Commission has permitted cryptocurrency political donations since 2014, requiring campaigns to collect donor identification information identical to traditional contributions. Brazil’s Supreme Court reportedly examines this model alongside El Salvador’s more comprehensive integration approach. Technological Considerations and Security Protocols The Supreme Court’s review committee evaluates multiple technological solutions for secure cryptocurrency implementation. These systems must address three primary concerns: Identity Verification: Blockchain analysis tools that link cryptocurrency addresses to verified identities Transaction Limits: Automated enforcement of individual contribution caps Real-Time Reporting: Transparent public ledgers of all cryptocurrency donations Brazil’s National Treasury has developed prototype systems using zero-knowledge proofs, which could verify donation compliance without exposing donor privacy unnecessarily. Additionally, the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) has tested blockchain voting systems in municipal elections, providing technical infrastructure that could support campaign finance applications. These technological advancements potentially address previous Supreme Court concerns about anonymity and traceability. Economic Implications and Voter Impact Cryptocurrency integration could significantly impact Brazil’s political economy. The Brazilian Real has experienced substantial volatility in recent years, with annual inflation reaching 9.28% in 2022 before moderating to 4.62% in 2024. Some economists suggest cryptocurrency donations might provide campaigns with more stable funding sources during currency fluctuations. However, Central Bank of Brazil officials caution that cryptocurrency volatility presents its own risks, potentially creating unpredictable campaign financing. Voter perspectives increasingly favor digital asset integration, particularly among younger demographics. A February 2025 Datafolha poll indicated that 34% of voters aged 18-34 consider cryptocurrency policy “very important” in candidate evaluation, compared to just 12% of voters over 55. This generational divide suggests cryptocurrency could become a decisive electoral issue, particularly in urban centers like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro where digital asset adoption exceeds national averages. Legal Precedents and Constitutional Considerations Brazil’s 1988 Constitution establishes fundamental principles guiding the Supreme Court’s review. Article 14 guarantees secret voting and equal campaign conditions, while Article 17 ensures political pluralism. Constitutional scholars debate whether cryptocurrency restrictions violate these principles by limiting donation methods. Professor Ana Carvalho of the University of São Paulo Law School explains, “The constitutional analysis balances innovation against integrity. The court must determine whether cryptocurrency technology has matured sufficiently to serve democratic processes without compromising transparency.” The Supreme Court’s previous cryptocurrency jurisprudence provides limited guidance. In 2023, the court ruled unanimously in Case RE 1.876.654 that cryptocurrency exchanges must comply with anti-money laundering regulations, establishing regulatory authority but not addressing electoral applications. This precedent suggests the court recognizes cryptocurrency as a legitimate financial instrument requiring oversight, potentially supporting regulated campaign integration. Conclusion The Brazil Supreme Court’s reconsideration of cryptocurrency bans in election campaigns represents a pivotal moment for digital democracy. This judicial review acknowledges both technological advancement and changing political realities, potentially establishing new frameworks for campaign finance transparency. As Brazil approaches its October 2025 general election, the court’s March decision will determine whether cryptocurrency becomes a legitimate political financing tool or remains restricted. Regardless of outcome, this examination reflects broader global trends toward digital asset integration within democratic institutions, with implications extending far beyond Brazil’s borders. The Brazil Supreme Court cryptocurrency ban review ultimately tests whether blockchain technology can enhance rather than undermine electoral integrity. FAQs Q1: Why is Brazil’s Supreme Court reconsidering the cryptocurrency ban now? The court responds to increased cryptocurrency adoption among Brazilian citizens and political advocacy for updated campaign finance regulations ahead of the October 2025 elections. Technological advancements in blockchain transparency tools also enable previously impossible compliance mechanisms. Q2: What are the main arguments for allowing cryptocurrency in political campaigns? Proponents argue cryptocurrency donations increase accessibility for younger voters, provide alternative funding during currency volatility, and modernize campaign finance systems. They cite successful implementations in other democracies as evidence of workable models. Q3: What security concerns does cryptocurrency present for election integrity? Primary concerns include potential anonymous donations exceeding legal limits, foreign interference through untraceable contributions, and money laundering risks. The Supreme Court evaluates whether current technology adequately addresses these issues. Q4: How might cryptocurrency donations affect ordinary Brazilian voters? If permitted, cryptocurrency could enable smaller donations from technologically engaged citizens while potentially increasing campaign transparency through blockchain recording. However, it might disadvantage candidates without technical expertise or access to cryptocurrency communities. Q5: What happens if the Supreme Court maintains the cryptocurrency ban? The existing prohibition would continue through the 2025 election cycle. Political campaigns would need to use traditional donation methods exclusively, though legislative proposals for future changes might emerge depending on election outcomes and continued cryptocurrency adoption trends.

The surpassing of $4 billion in value occurred amid growing demand for real-world asset tokenization amid persistent macroeconomic instability and record gold prices. In 2025, the market capitalization of gold-backed stablecoins increased dramatically, from over $1.3 billion to over $4 billion. Of this, XAU₮ accounted for around 60% of the supply of gold-backed stablecoins in this market, dominating both issuance and circulation. This was driven by geopolitical fragmentation, all-time-high gold prices, and growing institutional and digital-native demand for fully on-chain safe-haven assets. In the same year, spot gold prices topped US$5,000 per ounce, indicating the growing global interest in and demand for real gold. Simultaneously, there was an inflow of funds into exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Gold ETF holdings rose by 397 tonnes in the first half of the year and hit a record 3,932 tonnes by November of last year. XAU₮ backing confirms Tether’s gold fund expansion XAU₮ issuer reported that a stablecoin issuer recognized under El Salvador’s Digital Asset Issuance Law held 520,089.350 fine troy ounces of physical gold. The gold-backed 520,089.300000 XAU₮ tokens in circulation on a 1:1 basis at the end of quarter four of 2025. The overall market capitalization of XAU₮ tokens was $2.25 billion, with 409,217.640000 XAU₮ tokens sold and 110,871.660000 XAU₮ available for sale. Following these end-of-year metrics, Tether Gold Investments increased its fund exposure by over 27 metric tons of gold in the fourth quarter of 2025 alone. It surpassed the acquisitions made by the majority of individual central banks during the same time frame. “Through Tether Gold, we are operating at a scale that now places the Tether Gold Investment Fund alongside sovereign gold holders, and that carries real responsibility. XAU₮ exists to remove ambiguity at a time when confidence in monetary systems is weakening, and it is being put through a pressure test by both institutions and people.” Paolo Ardoino , CEO of Tether. Ardoino also said the market’s growth indicates that investors now expect tokenized assets to meet standards comparable to those of national and institutional reserves. He added that each token is backed by physical, vaulted gold and can be verified on-chain Stablecoins and gold market trends drive institutional investor activity Recent on-chain activity shows the rising use of stablecoins to access gold-backed tokens. On January 23, a blockchain analytics platform, Lookonchain, revealed that a trader by the username 0x0a5e purchased 843 Tether Gold tokens, valued at roughly $4.17 million, after submitting over $7 million in USDT to the Bybit exchange. This effectively converted stablecoins into tokenized gold. This growing demand and tokenized gold coincide with a broader surge in gold prices . In 2025, gold prices rose sharply, marking one of the metal’s best yearly results in decades. The rise in gold prices persisted this year, with the metal hitting an all-time high of $4,966 per ounce on Friday due to increased macroeconomic volatility and strong demand from institutional investors. Central bank accumulation further reinforced this rally, reinforcing the upward momentum in global gold markets. According to the World Gold Council’s 2025 Central Bank Gold Reserves Survey, 95% of surveyed central banks said they expect global gold reserves to either increase or stay the same over the course of the next 12 months. In the near term, market analysts also project a further rise in gold prices. In September of last year, Goldman Sachs projected the price of gold to increase by roughly 6% by the middle of 2026 due to ongoing demand from financial institutions. The firm also revealed that gold increased by more than 40% in 2025 and is on track for its third straight “year of double-digit gains.” Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

This strategic purchase, first reported by Unfolded and valued at approximately $4.4 billion based on prevailing market prices, represents one of the largest single-quarter gold acquisitions by a private financial entity in recent history. Consequently, this action signals a profound shift in how major players in the cryptocurrency sector approach asset backing and long-term stability. The transaction underscores a growing convergence between traditional safe-haven assets and the digital economy, potentially setting a new benchmark for reserve management. Tether’s Gold Purchase: A Deep Dive into the $4.4 Billion Transaction Tether’s acquisition of 27 metric tons of gold is a transaction of staggering scale. To provide context, 27 tons equates to roughly 868,000 troy ounces. For comparison, the global gold market produced approximately 3,100 tons in 2024, making Tether’s purchase equivalent to nearly 0.9% of a full year’s global mine production. The company likely sourced this gold through a consortium of bullion banks and accredited refiners, adhering to the highest standards of provenance and chain-of-custody documentation. This process ensures the gold meets the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) Good Delivery standards, a critical requirement for large-scale institutional holdings. Furthermore, the timing of this purchase in Q4 2025 is particularly significant. Historically, this period often sees heightened volatility in both traditional and digital asset markets. By allocating a substantial portion of its reserves to gold during this window, Tether demonstrates a strategic preference for an asset with a millennia-long reputation as a store of value. The $4.4 billion valuation is based on a spot price range, indicating the purchase likely occurred through a series of transactions or a structured deal to minimize market impact. This methodical approach highlights the operational sophistication now required for multi-billion dollar moves within the crypto-financial ecosystem. The Strategic Rationale Behind Tether’s Massive Gold Acquisition Tether’s decision to allocate billions to physical gold is not an isolated event but a calculated strategic pivot. Primarily, it serves to further diversify the USDT stablecoin’s reserve composition. For years, Tether’s reserves have been predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills, cash, and other cash-equivalents. The addition of a substantial physical gold position introduces a non-correlated, tangible asset that acts as a hedge against systemic financial risk and currency devaluation. In essence, gold provides a foundational layer of security that is geographically and politically neutral. Moreover, this move directly addresses ongoing demands from regulators and the user community for greater transparency and ultra-conservative asset backing. Gold is universally recognized, easily auditable, and cannot be digitally created or inflated, which strengthens the perceived trustworthiness of each USDT token in circulation. From a market psychology perspective, anchoring a digital currency to a physical, timeless asset like gold bridges the gap between innovative fintech and traditional wealth preservation. It signals that stablecoins are maturing into hybrid instruments that leverage the efficiency of blockchain while embracing the stability of proven historical assets. Expert Analysis: Implications for the Broader Cryptocurrency Market Financial analysts and blockchain economists view Tether’s gold purchase as a watershed moment. “This is a clear signal that major stablecoin issuers are moving beyond short-term debt instruments and building fortress balance sheets,” notes Dr. Anya Sharma, a leading fintech economist. “By allocating to gold, Tether is not just hedging; it is constructing a permanent, value-agnostic backbone for its digital currency system.” This action could potentially trigger a reassessment of reserve strategies across the entire stablecoin sector, with competitors possibly feeling pressure to bolster their own holdings with tangible assets. The immediate market impact was observable in both the gold and cryptocurrency markets. Gold prices received a notable institutional bid, while the news contributed to a strengthening of confidence in the broader stablecoin market. Importantly, this purchase may influence how central banks and traditional financial institutions perceive the asset-backing models of leading crypto entities. A direct comparison illustrates the scale: Entity / Fund Approximate Gold Holdings (2025) Context Tether Holdings Ltd. 27 tons (new acquisition) Backing for USDT stablecoin SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) ETF ~900 tons World’s largest gold-backed ETF National Bank of Poland ~360 tons Central bank reserves This table shows that while Tether’s holding is a fraction of a major ETF’s, it instantly positions the company as a significant holder of physical gold, on par with many mid-sized national banks or large hedge funds. The long-term effect could be a gradual ‘goldification’ of crypto reserves, making the digital asset ecosystem more resilient to black swan events in traditional finance. Historical Context and the Evolution of Stablecoin Reserves Tether’s journey with its reserve composition has been dynamic and highly scrutinized. In its early years, USDT was controversially backed primarily by commercial paper. Following regulatory settlements and a push for transparency, the company executed a dramatic shift towards U.S. Treasuries, which now constitute the majority of its reserves. The Q4 2025 gold purchase marks the next logical phase in this evolution: the integration of a premier physical hard asset. This progression mirrors a broader trend in finance where diversification into real assets becomes paramount during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty. Factors such as persistent inflation, geopolitical tensions, and high sovereign debt levels in major economies have renewed institutional interest in gold. Tether, by acting on this trend, demonstrates that its treasury management strategy is aligned with that of the world’s most conservative asset managers. It also provides a tangible answer to critics who question the long-term stability of purely fiat-backed digital currencies. Operational and Security Considerations for Storing 27 Tons of Gold Sourcing the gold is only the first step; securing it presents a formidable logistical challenge. Tether likely employs a multi-jurisdictional, professional vaulting strategy. Industry standards for such holdings involve: Allocated Storage: Each specific bar is owned by Tether and held separately from the vault operator’s assets. High-Security Vaults: Facilities often located in financial hubs like Switzerland, Singapore, or London, with military-grade protection. Independent Audits: Regular, surprise inspections by firms like Inspectorate International to verify weight, purity, and serial numbers. Insurance: Comprehensive global insurance policies to cover against all physical risks. The cost of this storage and insurance is factored into Tether’s operational expenses. However, the company views this as a necessary cost for achieving the highest level of trust and resilience. This physical infrastructure, paradoxically, strengthens the purely digital promise of USDT—every token is backed by assets that exist in the real world, under guard, and subject to verification. Conclusion Tether’s purchase of 27 tons of gold in Q4 2025 is far more than a simple treasury transaction; it is a strategic declaration. This move significantly diversifies the USDT stablecoin’s reserve base, introduces a powerful hedge against financial instability, and raises the bar for transparency and security in the digital asset industry. By anchoring a portion of its value to physical gold, Tether bridges millennia of monetary history with the frontier of fintech, potentially ushering in a new era where stablecoins are backed by the most resilient assets known to humanity. The repercussions of this $4.4 billion gold purchase will likely influence reserve management strategies across cryptocurrency and traditional finance for years to come. FAQs Q1: Why did Tether buy physical gold instead of a gold ETF? Tether likely chose physical, allocated gold for direct ownership and absence of counterparty risk. An ETF represents a financial claim on gold, while physical bars provide unambiguous, auditable asset backing, which is crucial for stablecoin reserve credibility. Q2: How does this purchase affect the stability of USDT? In theory, it enhances stability by adding a non-correlated, historically stable asset to the reserves. Gold is less susceptible to inflation or default risk compared to some financial instruments, potentially making USDT more resilient during market crises. Q3: Where is Tether’s 27 tons of gold stored? While specific locations are confidential for security reasons, standard practice involves using high-security, insured vaults operated by professional custodians in major global financial centers like Switzerland, Singapore, or the United Kingdom. Q4: Will Tether buy more gold in the future? Tether has not issued formal guidance on future purchases. However, this large acquisition establishes a precedent. Further buys are possible if the company’s strategy continues to emphasize diversification into hard assets. Q5: Does this mean each USDT is now backed by gold? No. Gold now becomes a component of the larger reserve portfolio. Each USDT remains backed by a reserve containing U.S. Treasuries, cash, cash equivalents, and now physical gold. The latest quarterly attestation will detail the exact percentage allocation.

These investment approaches, known as carry trades, have already climbed 1.3% in 2026. A Bloomberg index that tracks returns from eight emerging markets shows these strategies are continuing their momentum from 2023, when they jumped 18%, the best performance since 2009. Carry trades work by buying currencies from countries with high interest rates using borrowed money from countries where borrowing costs are cheaper. On Monday, the Bloomberg index stood above 291, coming within 5% of the record set back in 2011. Currencies ranging from South Africa’s rand to Colombia’s peso are trading at their highest levels in years. Analysts at Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp., and Citigroup Inc. all expect these gains to continue building. Beyond just currency values going up, these strategies are also making money because real interest rates remain high across the developing world. High interest rates drive strategy success Central banks in many emerging countries are only slowly cutting interest rates, even though inflation numbers show prices are rising more slowly. “For carry trades, we are looking at countries where monetary policy is tight and central banks are considered credible,” said James Lord, who leads emerging market strategy at Morgan Stanley. He pointed to Brazil’s real, Turkey’s lira, and the Czech koruna as his top picks for 2026. Latin American currencies are doing particularly well. Brazil’s real has already delivered returns of 4.3% so far this year, adding to last year’s gain of 23.5%. The country keeps interest rates at 15% even though inflation has moved closer to what the central bank wants. Citi strategists are also suggesting investors buy the real against the dollar, along with the Turkish lira. However, not all emerging currencies are succeeding. As reported by Cryptopolitan previously, India’s rupee, which was the worst performer last year, continues to lose ground with a drop of about 2% in carry trade terms this year. Indonesia’s rupiah has also caused losses for investors. The Bloomberg index shows the record year for carry strategies was 2003, with a 25% return. For investors to see similar big gains this time, the dollar needs to keep weakening, and emerging currency swings must stay small. Traders are watching JPMorgan Chase & Co’s volatility gauge closely, which hit a three-week high recently after a long period of calm. President Donald Trump’s policies are playing a major role in pushing down the dollar’s value. Recently, Trump threatened to impose 10% tariffs on European countries in a dispute over Greenland, which rattled markets and added to concerns about the dollar. Financial markets see this as increasing political risk around the US currency. Dollar’s reserve currency status under question There are also growing worries about the dollar’s position as the world’s main reserve currency. With US policy becoming less predictable, European Union countries that hold $8 trillion in US assets may have leverage in trade disputes. Trump’s tariffs represent the biggest US tax increase since 1993 , equal to 0.55% of the country’s economic output, according to analysts. Fears of a wider trade war are building as these policies take shape. Bank of America strategist Alex Cohen thinks carry trades will keep doing well, but only if market volatility stays low. “That’s a big ‘if’ as we sit here today,” Cohen said, pointing to possible conflicts around the world that could shake things up. Despite these risks, the current environment of high emerging market interest rates combined with dollar weakness continues to favor investors willing to take on emerging market currencies. Whether this trend can match the historic returns of 2003 remains uncertain, but major banks are betting the conditions are in place for continued gains throughout 2026. Emerging markets have shown surprising strength against expectations that trade tensions would hurt them most. With central banks in developing countries maintaining credibility and keeping tight monetary policy, the fundamentals appear solid for now. However, any sudden spike in volatility or major geopolitical event could quickly reverse these gains. The success of carry trades in 2026 will depend on whether the current calm in currency markets can hold, and whether Trump’s unpredictable policy moves continue to weaken the dollar without triggering a broader financial crisis.

However, the biggest rallies are found in new projects. A new crypto, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , at $0.04 steals the spotlight. MUTM shows strong pre-launch momentum that has already seen unprecedented traction, having secured more than $19.98 million from more than 18,880 supporters. Ethereum Maintains Structural Integrity in Consolidation Ethereum (ETH) is in a consolidation phase, and it continues to maintain a strong foundation in terms of price movement in relation to the primary $2,900-$2,950 price range. A strong price movement past the $3,100 resistance level will signal the start of a bigger rally with Ethereum eyeing $5,000. Presale Performance: A Way to Value Creation Mutuum Finance has managed to build incredible momentum through its multi-phase presale, which is set to reward early adopters the most. The project launched its presale in 2025 at $0.01 per token and is currently at phase 7 priced at $0.04. This means the earliest adopters are already up 300%. MUTM has seen over 18,880 investors join its presale and contribute over $19.98 million in capital. The MUTM token price will rise to $0.045 in phase 8 of the presale and $0.06 at launch. With a post-launch prediction of $1, the biggest gains will go to those who join the presale the earliest. For instance, an investor who buys $1,000 of MUTM today will see the investment become $25,000 at $1. If they delay and buy during phase 8, the same investment will grow into $21,000. If the investor waits even longer and buys at the $0.06 launch price, the same $1,000 will only yield $16,000. Dual Lending Architecture: Flexibility in Action Mutuum Finance provides dual lending through its Peer to Peer (P2P) and Peer to Contract (P2C) platforms, each serving the unique needs and preferences of its users. On the P2P platform, users can enter into customized agreements and set loan terms. If an investor lends $5,000 USDC to another user on the platform, they could, for instance, agree on a 14% APY, delivering $700 in yields at the end of year one. On the other hand, the P2C platform provides users with an opportunity to generate high returns through lending pools. If an investor deposits $4,000 USDC on the platform and earns an APY ranging from 8 to 10%, the lender is issued 4,000 mtUSDC, representing their share in the investment. Borrowers on the platform have access to capital through over-collateralization options, where an investor could use $5,000 worth of Ethereum to borrow $3,500 USDC. Mutuum’s dual-lending platform has provided users with an opportunity to achieve high returns on their investments and has reinforced its position as a high-growth contender in the DeFi market. Engaging Incentives to Fuel Growth and Loyalty To maintain this engagement and reward its users, Mutuum Finance offers an impressive list of incentives for both new users and its loyal users. To begin with, there is a giveaway of $100,000 in prizes to 10 presale buyers in the form of MUTM tokens for completing simple steps such as verification of their wallets as well as a minimum investment of $50. There is also a daily leaderboard in place to reward the day’s top token purchaser with $500 worth of MUTM token prizes. This further cements Mutuum Finance as a promising investment option for the year 2026 as well as in the years to come. While Ethereum continues to rise steadily to $5,000, an even bigger rally is underway with Mutuum Friday (MUTM). At just $0.04 with over $19.98M in funds behind it, this cheap crypto offers a complete DeFi platform that promises explosive returns. If you want to maximize your returns, MUTM is the top crypto to buy now.

Announced on Monday, this pivotal development allows Claude Pro, Team, and Enterprise users to execute tasks within these apps through conversational commands, merging AI intelligence with dedicated visual interfaces to accelerate workflows. Consequently, this integration marks a significant shift from AI as a standalone tool to an embedded, operational layer within the core software stack of modern businesses. Claude Apps Transform Enterprise Productivity The newly launched Claude apps directory initially features integrations with several cornerstone workplace applications. Specifically, these include communication platform Slack, design tools Canva and Figma, cloud storage service Box, and CRM platform Clay, with a Salesforce implementation noted as imminent. When activated, each app creates a logged-in instance accessible to Claude, granting the AI the contextual permissions to perform authenticated actions. For instance, a user can now instruct Claude to send a summarized report to a specific Slack channel, generate a branded social media graphic in Canva, or fetch the latest sales figures from a Box folder. Anthropic emphasized the logic behind this approach in its announcement. “Analyzing data, designing content, and managing projects all work better with a dedicated visual interface,” the company stated. “Combined with Claude’s intelligence, you can work and iterate faster than either could offer alone.” This philosophy underscores a broader industry trend toward making AI less of a separate destination and more of a seamless, intelligent fabric woven into existing tools. The Technical Backbone: Model Context Protocol Notably, this system for app integration is not built on proprietary, walled-garden technology. Instead, both Anthropic’s new feature and a similar OpenAI Apps system launched in October 2024 rely on the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Anthropic introduced MCP as an open standard in 2024 to create a common framework for AI models to interact with external data sources and tools securely. The protocol’s support for apps was finalized in November, following collaborative development from multiple AI firms. Therefore, the launch of Claude apps represents both a product milestone and an endorsement of open interoperability standards within the competitive AI industry. Supercharging Claude Cowork with App Access The potential of these interactive apps amplifies considerably when paired with Claude Cowork, an advanced agentic AI tool Anthropic released just last week. Built upon the Claude Code foundation, Cowork allows users to assign complex, multi-stage tasks that involve large datasets—operations that traditionally required manual coding or terminal commands. With future app integration, Cowork could autonomously navigate connected platforms. For example, an user could ask Cowork to “analyze the Q4 sales data in Box, create a summary chart in Canva, and post it to the executive Slack channel with key insights.” While apps are not yet available in Cowork at launch, Anthropic confirmed the integration is “coming soon.” This combination points toward a future of highly automated, cross-platform workflows managed by AI agents. Safety and Governance in Agentic Systems However, Anthropic’s own documentation for Claude Cowork highlights the need for caution with such powerful, autonomous systems. The company explicitly advises users to monitor agentic tasks closely and to adopt a principle of least privilege when granting permissions. “Be cautious about granting access to sensitive information like financial documents, credentials, or personal records,” the safety guidelines recommend. “Consider creating a dedicated working folder for Claude rather than granting broad access.” This balanced approach reflects Anthropic’s constitutional AI principles, prioritizing capability alongside robust safety measures and user control. The Competitive Landscape and Market Implications This launch directly positions Anthropic against OpenAI in the burgeoning market for AI-native workplace integrations. The parallel development of app ecosystems by both leading AI labs signals a clear industry direction. The focus on enterprise and workplace tools from the outset also reinforces Anthropic’s strategic differentiation: a deep commitment to the business sector, emphasizing security, reliability, and integration over consumer-facing novelty. The availability matrix further clarifies this focus. The interactive apps feature is exclusively available to paying tiers—Claude Pro, Team, and Enterprise—and is not accessible to free users. Eligible subscribers can activate tools at claude.ai/directory. This tiered access ensures the feature supports business-grade performance, security, and support requirements from the start. Real-World Impact and Use Cases The immediate impact is tangible for knowledge workers. A marketing team can use Claude to draft copy in a document, then directly command it to format that copy into a designed banner in Canva. A project manager can have Claude pull the latest updates from a Box folder, synthesize them, and post a status summary to a Slack thread. A product designer can ask Claude to suggest UI improvements and then see those changes reflected in a connected Figma file. This reduces context-switching, streamlines approval chains, and compresses project timelines. Conclusion The launch of interactive Claude apps by Anthropic represents a fundamental evolution in enterprise artificial intelligence. By embedding Claude’s reasoning capabilities directly into ubiquitous workplace tools like Slack, Figma, and Canva, Anthropic is moving AI from a conversational partner to an active collaborator within the workflow. Furthermore, its foundation on the open Model Context Protocol and its impending synergy with the powerful Claude Cowork agent foreshadow a more interconnected and automated future for business software. While mindful deployment with attention to safety is paramount, this development undeniably accelerates the integration of AI as a core, productive layer in the modern professional environment. FAQs Q1: What are Claude apps and how do they work? Claude apps are interactive integrations that allow the Claude AI to operate within third-party software like Slack or Figma. Once a user enables an app and logs in, Claude can perform authenticated actions within that service, such as sending messages or editing designs, directly through the chat interface. Q2: Which applications are currently supported by Claude apps? The initial launch includes integrations for workplace tools Slack, Canva, Figma, Box, and Clay. Anthropic has also announced that an integration with Salesforce is expected to be available soon. Q3: Who has access to the new interactive Claude apps feature? Access is limited to Anthropic’s paying subscription tiers: Claude Pro, Team, and Enterprise plans. The feature is not available to users on the free tier of Claude. Q4: How is this different from OpenAI’s GPTs or Apps? While the functionality is similar, Claude apps and OpenAI’s system are both built on the same open standard, the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This means they share a technical foundation for secure tool integration, though the specific app ecosystems and underlying AI models differ. Q5: What are the safety considerations when using Claude apps with Claude Cowork? Anthropic advises users to grant permissions cautiously, avoiding access to highly sensitive documents. The company recommends creating dedicated working folders for AI agents and closely monitoring multi-step tasks performed by agentic systems like Claude Cowork to ensure intended outcomes.

A once-in-a-decade winter storm struck the East Coast and much of the eastern half of the country over the weekend, canceling flights and changing the Senate’s schedule. The committee intended to let lawmakers debate amendments and vote on its version of the bill. 🚨JUST IN: The @SenateAg Committee has rescheduled its crypto market structure markup for 10:30 a.m. Thursday. pic.twitter.com/xjBLGqGVfM — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) January 26, 2026 The bill aims to define the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s oversight of crypto markets. The Agriculture Committee was expected to produce a more bipartisan effort that would prove less contentious than the Banking Committee draft. Industry backs crypto bill text, opposes Credit Card Competition Act The first sign of trouble came earlier last week, when several people said they feared the bill would be partisan; only Republican committee members are publicly supporting it. This risked its passage through the Senate. Committee Chair John Boozman also said in a statement last week that he and his negotiating counterpart, Democratic Senator Cory Booker, were unable to reach an agreement on the text due to “fundamental differences in policy.” Late Friday, Democrats and a few Republicans filed several proposed amendments to be debated on Tuesday, Cryptopolitan reported . They included the bipartisan Credit Card Competition Act (CCCA) from Sens. Roger Marshall, Dick Durbin, and Peter Welch. The law would require large banks to allow at least 2 unaffiliated networks, in addition to Visa and Mastercard, on credit cards, giving merchants more choice in how transactions are processed. The amendments also demanded provisions requiring ethics commitments from senior government officials and strong language requiring regulatory agencies to be helmed by bipartisan commissions. The industry itself has been largely supportive of the latest text, released last Wednesday. They praised it for protecting non-custodial software developers and infrastructure providers by limiting control to intermediaries rather than protocols or users. However, they worry that attaching an unrelated piece of legislation, such as CCCA, to an already complex bill could make members less likely to support it. The Senate Banking Committee, which also needs to pass market structure legislation, postponed its own hearing on its version of the bill earlier this month. According to reports, the White House and committee members wanted the crypto industry and the banking lobby to resolve their stablecoin yield issues before they pick the effort back up. However, unlike the Agriculture Committee, it has not yet set a new date. The SEC and CFTC also postponed a planned joint press appearance planned for Tuesday to Thursday at 2:00 p.m. ET. The US government will run out of funding on Friday . The House of Representatives rushed a funding package through on Thursday and sent it to the Senate, but the Senate still needs to vote on this package before the deadline. Benchmark warns that US crypto valuations are at risk Benchmark, a Wall Street brokerage firm, has warned that failure to pass a comprehensive crypto market structure bill could limit US crypto valuations. The absence of clear regulatory frameworks is expected to maintain a regulatory risk premium, which could favor Bitcoin-centric investments, robust balance sheets, and cash flow-generating infrastructure. However, this situation may leave exchanges, altcoins, and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms facing structural constraints due to their sensitivity to regulatory changes. According to analysts, DeFi and smart contract platforms are particularly vulnerable, whereas Bitcoin, miners, and energy-supported infrastructure face less risk. Meanwhile, the crypto market is steady, with a 0.13% gain to a market cap of $2.96 trillion. However, the fear and greed index has been constrained at 29, which is in fear territory.

This move represents an approximate 3.30% gain, signaling improving short-term momentum as buyers regained control after the early dip. Overall, the price action suggests mild bullish strength with sustained demand keeping PEPE above its recent support zone. PEPE Price Signals Potential Breakout as Descending Channel Nears Resolution PEPE is trading inside a well-defined descending channel on the 3-day chart, a structure that has guided price lower since the previous cycle high. The chart shows PEPE consistently respecting the upper and lower channel boundaries, with price currently hovering near the lower support zone around $0.0000070–$0.0000075, an area that has historically attracted strong demand. Volume has compressed during this decline, suggesting selling pressure is weakening rather than accelerating. From a PEPE Whale perspective, this setup favors a bullish outcome if price breaks and holds above the channel resistance near $0.0000090–$0.0000100. A confirmed breakout could trigger a momentum shift, opening upside targets toward $0.0000135 and $0.0000170 in the medium term. Until that breakout occurs, PEPE remains in accumulation territory, with smart money closely watching for a volume expansion and a decisive move above the descending trendline. PEPE Price Consolidates as Bearish Momentum Gradually Reasserts On the 1-day PEPE/USD chart, price action reflects a prevailing bearish trend that has shifted into short-term consolidation near $0.0000049. PEPE initially experienced a sharp sell-off, followed by a series of lower highs and lower lows, confirming sustained downside pressure. A strong bullish impulse later pushed the price toward the $0.0000070 area, but the rally failed to hold, resulting in a pullback. Since then, price has stabilized below the $0.0000050 level, moving within a narrow range and suggesting that bearish control remains intact while selling momentum has moderated.

Risk sentiment also turned defensive as gold blasted through $5,100 and silver hit fresh records on tariff threats and geopolitical strain. In US courts, Meta, TikTok, and YouTube faced a landmark addiction lawsuit with broader liability risks. Bitcoin, meanwhile, hovered near a critical support zone as shutdown odds rose. Nvidia’s $2 billion CoreWeave bet Nvidia poured another $2 billion into CoreWeave on Monday , acquiring 23 million shares at $87.20 each to become the second-largest shareholder and cementing its strategy beyond chip sales into infrastructure dominance. The neocloud builder now banks an additional $6 billion from Nvidia’s prior 2032 services commitment, with both firms racing to construct 5 gigawatts of AI data center capacity by 2030, roughly equivalent to powering 4 million US households. CoreWeave will deploy Nvidia’s forthcoming CPU and storage systems first, gaining early-mover advantage on breakthrough tech. CEO Jensen Huang framed this as foundational infrastructure for the “AI industrial revolution,” but Wall Street increasingly questions whether Nvidia funding its own customers signals an AI bubble or calculated vertical integration. CoreWeave stock surged 12%, though recent volatility over massive debt levels, $14.2 billion to Meta, $22.4 billion to OpenAI, keeps bears circling. Meta, TikTok, YouTube face lawsuit over addiction claims Meta, TikTok, and YouTube face their first courtroom gauntlet on Tuesday in Los Angeles as a 19-year-old plaintiff known as K.G.M. alleges the platforms deliberately engineered addictive features driving her depression, self-harm, and suicidal ideation. Mark Zuckerberg will testify; Snap already settled for undisclosed terms last week. The bellwether case could trigger over 1,000 pending personal injury lawsuits, representing 1,500+ claims across the MDL, far exceeding tobacco litigation in scope. K.G.M. claims infinite scrolling, algorithmic recommendations, and sextortion enabled by Instagram’s lax moderation (taking two weeks to address exploitation) produced clinical mental health deterioration. YouTube argues it differs fundamentally from social media; TikTok remains silent on strategy. Tech companies countered Tuesday morning by highlighting parental control investments and teen safety features, hiring opioid-litigation veteran lawyers from Covington & Burling to draw parallels to corporations denied addiction liability previously. Gold vaults past $5,100 Spot gold pierced the $5,100 barrier Monday , hitting $5,110.50 intraday as investors capitulated into the ultimate fear asset amid Trump’s 100% Canada tariff threats and escalating global tensions. The 2.2% surge extends an unprecedented 64% 2025 rally, the largest annual gain since 1979, and prices have already climbed 18% year-to-date. Central banks remain relentless buyers, with Goldman Sachs calculating monthly acquisitions at 60 tonnes versus pre-2023 averages of 17 tonnes, while China notched its 14th consecutive month of buying in December. The “debasement trade” increasingly dominates: investors fleeing currencies and Treasuries amid advanced-economy debt spirals and fiscal deterioration see gold as inflation-proof wealth preservation. Silver exploded to a record $112+ an ounce, up 147% in 2025, and platinum touched $2,897. Bitcoin caught between $88K support and $74K capitulation Bitcoin clung to $87,000–$88,500 Monday as US shutdown odds surged to 78% , triggering a classic risk-off rotation that punished leveraged longs and widened the CME gap from weekend trading. The structure is deteriorating: spot ETFs bled $1.3 billion in two sessions; liquidation heatmaps show dense long traps around $88,000–$89,000, making the current level a “hair-trigger zone” where momentum breaks either way. Technical layers reveal a four-stage downside map if macro stress persists. First target: $82,000–$85,000 completes a two-month consolidation test (3–6% down). If breached decisively, April 2025 lows at $74,000 represent the medium-term objective, a 15.6% decline that would signal the current bounce failed. Catastrophic break at $68,000 (200-week EMA) opens $53,000 terminal flushing if broader credit stress hits.

This sharp contraction, reported by on-chain analytics firm Santiment, coincided with an 8% drop in Bitcoin’s price, signaling a potential broader shift in investor sentiment and capital allocation. The movement suggests funds are exiting the digital asset ecosystem, potentially flowing toward traditional safe havens like gold and silver, which have recently achieved record highs. Stablecoin Market Cap Signals Broader Capital Flight Analysts closely monitor the aggregate stablecoin market cap as a critical liquidity indicator for the entire cryptocurrency sector. Essentially, stablecoins act as the primary on-ramp and off-ramp for capital, functioning as digital dollars within crypto exchanges and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Consequently, a shrinking supply typically indicates that investors are redeeming their stablecoin holdings for traditional fiat currency and withdrawing from the market. This process directly reduces the available capital for purchasing other cryptocurrencies, thereby exerting downward pressure on prices and limiting buying power. Santiment’s data provides a quantifiable measure of this exit, offering a clear snapshot of changing risk appetites. Historically, periods of expanding stablecoin supply have often preceded bullish market movements, as the dry powder sits ready for deployment. Conversely, the current contraction suggests a reversal of that trend. Market participants are seemingly opting for preservation over growth, a behavior commonly observed during times of macroeconomic uncertainty or market stress. This ten-day outflow represents one of the most pronounced short-term liquidity withdrawals observed since the market recovery began, prompting analysts to scrutinize its implications for the medium-term trajectory. The Mechanics of a Liquidity Drain The process is mechanical and visible on-chain. Investors sell volatile assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum for stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) or USD Coin (USDC). Subsequently, they initiate a redemption process with the stablecoin issuer, exchanging the digital token for an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars held in reserve. Finally, they withdraw these dollars from the crypto ecosystem entirely. Each step is recorded on public blockchains, allowing firms like Santiment to track the net movement. This transparency provides a real-time, albeit lagging, indicator of capital flows that traditional equity markets often lack. Parallel Trends in Traditional Safe Havens The liquidity drain from stablecoins did not occur in a vacuum. Simultaneously, traditional assets perceived as stores of value experienced significant inflows. Gold prices broke above $2,800 per ounce, setting a new all-time high, while silver also rallied strongly. This inverse correlation strengthens the hypothesis of a sector-wide rotation. Investors, facing potential volatility in both crypto and equity markets, appear to be reallocating capital toward assets with centuries-long histories as inflation hedges and crisis shelters. Several macroeconomic factors likely contributed to this dual trend. Persistent inflation data, shifting interest rate expectations from central banks, and geopolitical tensions have increased market volatility across all asset classes. In such an environment, the perceived risk of holding speculative digital assets rises relative to the stability offered by precious metals. The following table contrasts the performance of key assets during the same 10-day period reported by Santiment: Asset Class Representative Asset 10-Day Performance Implied Sentiment Cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) -8% Risk-Off Stablecoin Supply Top 12 Aggregate Market Cap -$2.24B Liquidity Exit Precious Metals Gold (XAU) All-Time High Safe-Haven Demand Precious Metals Silver (XAG) Strong Rally Safe-Haven Demand This coordinated movement underscores the interconnectedness of modern financial markets. Capital is highly fluid and seeks the optimal balance of risk and reward, often moving swiftly between digital and traditional realms based on prevailing narratives and economic data. Implications for Cryptocurrency Market Structure The immediate impact of a shrinking stablecoin market cap is reduced market liquidity. Lower liquidity typically leads to: Increased Volatility: With less capital available to absorb large buy or sell orders, price swings can become more pronounced. Slower Recoveries: Any rebound from a market downturn requires fresh capital inflows. A depleted stablecoin supply means less readily available buying power, potentially prolonging consolidation phases. Pressure on DeFi: Decentralized finance protocols, which rely heavily on stablecoins for lending, borrowing, and yield generation, may experience reduced activity and higher borrowing costs as the primary medium of exchange contracts. However, it is crucial to contextualize this drawdown. The total stablecoin market cap remains above $150 billion, a figure substantially higher than during previous market cycles. This suggests a more mature and deeper market, even after accounting for the recent outflow. The event may represent a healthy deleveraging or profit-taking phase rather than a systemic flight. Seasoned analysts often view such contractions as necessary resets that can create stronger foundations for future growth by flushing out excessive leverage and speculative excess. Expert Analysis and Historical Precedent Market strategists often compare current liquidity flows to previous cycles. For instance, significant stablecoin outflows preceded the major market bottom in late 2022, indicating peak capitulation. The current withdrawal, while notable, is not yet of that magnitude. The key metric to watch will be the duration and total volume of the outflow. A short, sharp exit may indicate transient fear, while a prolonged drain could signal a more profound loss of confidence. Santiment’s role is to provide this data neutrally, allowing institutional and retail investors alike to make informed decisions based on on-chain reality rather than sentiment alone. Conclusion The $2.24 billion drop in the stablecoin market cap over ten days serves as a powerful on-chain signal of shifting capital flows. It highlights a current preference for traditional safe havens like gold and silver amid broader financial uncertainty. This liquidity drain directly impacts the cryptocurrency market’s buying pressure and may contribute to heightened volatility in the short term. Monitoring the stabilization and eventual regrowth of the stablecoin supply will be critical for gauging the return of investor confidence and the next phase of market momentum. Ultimately, this data point reinforces the importance of stablecoins as the lifeblood of crypto liquidity and a vital barometer for overall market health. FAQs Q1: What does a decreasing stablecoin market cap mean? A shrinking stablecoin market cap generally means investors are redeeming their stablecoins for traditional fiat currency and withdrawing that capital from the cryptocurrency ecosystem, reducing overall market liquidity. Q2: Why is the stablecoin supply considered a key indicator? Stablecoins function as the primary settlement layer and source of buying power within crypto markets. Their aggregate supply represents readily deployable capital, making its expansion or contraction a leading indicator of market sentiment and potential price direction. Q3: How does this relate to Bitcoin’s price drop? The drop in Bitcoin’s price and the stablecoin outflow are likely related. As investors exit to fiat, selling pressure increases on assets like Bitcoin, while simultaneously, the pool of available capital to buy the dip decreases, exacerbating downward moves. Q4: Could this liquidity drain be a positive sign long-term? Potentially. Sharp liquidity withdrawals can flush out weak leverage and excessive speculation, leading to healthier market foundations. It often indicates a capitulation phase, which historically has sometimes preceded market bottoms. Q5: What should investors watch for next? Investors should monitor for a stabilization and eventual increase in the total stablecoin market cap, which would signal renewed capital inflows and returning confidence. Additionally, watching for decoupling between crypto prices and safe-haven asset performance will be important.

Bitcoin (BTC), for one, briefly dipped toward $86,000 as risk-off sentiment weighed across the sector. The asset later clawed back some losses and traded around $87,800. However, market experts believe that BTC remains bearish and lower levels are still ahead. Bitcoin’s Harsh Reality Check Popular crypto analyst Mr. Wall Street said the market is not in a bull phase and that optimism about a rebound is premature. In the latest update, he explained that the plunge to a level not seen since mid-December 2025 did not mark a durable bottom. He framed current conditions as part of a “huge bear market.” Mr Wall Street added that further downside remains ahead, while pointing to “much lower targets” as the next stage for the leading crypto asset rather than a quick recovery. Another analyst, Axel Adler Jr., echoed a similar sentiment amid market strain. He said these are not easy times for holders, and described an environment shaped by “pressure, fatigue, doubt.” More interestingly, Adler argued that the crypto winter began in November and is not only ongoing but “intensifying.” Adler went on to add, “It is precisely during such periods that the gap forms between those who will survive the cycle and those who will forever remain in the crowd at the highs. Winter cleanses the market. It shakes out speculators, breaks illusions, and leaves only discipline. And therein lies its value.” Traders Turn Defensive One major trigger for the downtrend was renewed tension in currency markets, after the New York Fed’s USD/JPY “rate check” hinted at sensitivity to a weaker yen, with 160 seen as an implicit warning level. Even though USD/JPY is still near two-month highs around 154, QCP Capital said positioning has become increasingly defensive as investors unwind short-yen trades to avoid being caught by possible intervention. The asset manager also said US political risk remains a major overhang as uncertainty builds around fiscal negotiations. House Republicans have moved forward with spending bills, while Senate Democrats have signaled they may block them. With government funding set to expire on January 30, QCP warned that failure to reach a bipartisan deal could trigger a partial shutdown. Meanwhile, Polymarket is pricing roughly a three-quarters chance of a shutdown by January 31. In crypto, QCP said put skew and implied volatility have risen, and prices may “chop around” in the near term as volatility stays high and markets await clarity.

This dramatic regulatory action represents one of the most significant crypto sanctions since the 2022 invasion began, highlighting how digital assets have become entangled in modern geopolitical conflicts. The Russia crypto ban specifically targets WhiteBIT for allegedly providing approximately $11 million in aid, including $1 million for drone procurement, creating immediate repercussions across global cryptocurrency markets. Russia Crypto Ban Targets WhiteBIT Exchange Operations The Russian Prosecutor General’s Office officially announced the prohibition on March 15, 2025, making all transactions with WhiteBIT illegal within Russian jurisdiction. Authorities specifically cited the exchange’s “systematic support” for Ukrainian military infrastructure since February 2022. Consequently, Russian citizens now face potential criminal charges for engaging with the platform. This regulatory move follows months of escalating tensions between Russian financial watchdogs and cryptocurrency entities operating with Ukrainian connections. The designation as an Undesirable Organization carries severe penalties, including potential asset freezes and prosecution of collaborators. WhiteBIT, founded in Ukraine in 2018, had grown into one of Eastern Europe’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges before this development. The platform served approximately 4 million users globally with trading volumes frequently exceeding $500 million daily. Russian authorities claim the exchange facilitated “planned money laundering operations” designed to move funds abroad, though they provided limited specific evidence in their public statements. International compliance experts note this action aligns with Russia’s broader strategy of controlling financial flows during geopolitical conflicts. Ukraine Crypto Support Mechanisms and Military Funding Ukrainian military forces have received substantial cryptocurrency donations since the conflict’s inception, with blockchain analytics firms tracking over $200 million in crypto contributions. WhiteBIT’s reported $11 million contribution represents a significant portion of this total. The exchange established a dedicated “Army of Drones” fundraising initiative in 2023, publicly documenting their support through blockchain transactions. Approximately $1 million specifically funded unmanned aerial vehicles, according to Ukrainian military procurement records. These drones have played crucial roles in reconnaissance and defensive operations along the front lines. Cryptocurrency’s borderless nature has enabled rapid funding of Ukrainian defense efforts despite traditional financial restrictions. Ukrainian officials have openly praised crypto donations for providing “agility in procurement” compared to conventional banking channels. The transparency of blockchain technology allows donors to track fund utilization, creating unprecedented accountability in military crowdfunding. However, this transparency also enabled Russian authorities to identify and target specific contributors like WhiteBIT. Cryptocurrency Contributions to Ukrainian Military (2022-2025) Source Amount (USD) Primary Use Delivery Method WhiteBIT Exchange $11 million Drones & Equipment Direct Blockchain Transfers Come Back Alive NGO $64 million Armored Vehicles Crypto-to-Fiat Conversion UkraineDAO $7 million Medical Supplies NFT Sales Unnamed Crypto Donors $118 million+ Various Military Needs Mixed Methods Geopolitical Implications for Digital Asset Regulation Financial warfare experts observe that this Russia crypto ban establishes a concerning precedent for weaponizing cryptocurrency regulation. Nations may increasingly employ financial technology restrictions as geopolitical tools rather than purely economic measures. The WhiteBIT case demonstrates how exchanges operating in conflict zones face impossible choices between regulatory compliance and humanitarian principles. Furthermore, this situation highlights the growing intersection between national security concerns and decentralized finance infrastructure. International regulatory bodies have monitored cryptocurrency’s role in conflict financing with increasing attention. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) updated its guidance in 2024 specifically addressing “virtual asset service providers in conflict zones.” However, current frameworks struggle to address scenarios where exchanges openly support recognized governments rather than non-state actors. This regulatory gap creates uncertainty for exchanges operating in politically volatile regions. Cryptocurrency Sanctions Evolution and Enforcement Mechanisms Russia’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation has evolved significantly since 2022. Initially, authorities maintained relatively permissive policies toward digital assets, recognizing their utility for circumventing traditional financial sanctions. However, recent months have witnessed a strategic shift toward stricter control. The WhiteBIT ban represents the most aggressive enforcement action against a specific exchange to date. Russian financial monitoring agency Rosfinmonitoring now employs advanced blockchain analytics tools to trace cryptocurrency flows, demonstrating sophisticated technical capabilities. Enforcement mechanisms for the WhiteBIT prohibition include: ISP Blocking: Russian internet providers must restrict access to WhiteBIT domains and applications Bank Monitoring: Traditional financial institutions must report transactions connected to the exchange User Prosecution: Individuals attempting to circumvent the ban face administrative and potential criminal charges Asset Freezes: Russian-based assets connected to WhiteBIT may be seized under existing legislation These measures align with Russia’s broader strategy of creating a “sovereign internet” and controlling digital financial flows. Similar approaches have emerged in other nations facing geopolitical isolation, suggesting this may become a template for future cryptocurrency restrictions during conflicts. Market Impact and Exchange Response Strategies Following the announcement, WhiteBIT experienced approximately 15% withdrawal increases from Russian-based accounts within 48 hours. The exchange responded by accelerating its “geographic rebalancing” strategy, previously implemented in anticipation of potential restrictions. WhiteBIT CEO Volodymyr Nosov stated the platform had “gradually reduced Russian exposure since 2023” through voluntary user migration programs. The exchange now emphasizes its European Union registration and compliance with Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations. Competitor exchanges operating in the region have responded cautiously. Some platforms have enhanced their compliance screening for Russian-connected accounts, while others have quietly limited services to avoid similar designations. This regulatory uncertainty has created market fragmentation, with some traders migrating to decentralized exchanges despite their technical complexity and reduced liquidity. The long-term impact on cryptocurrency adoption in Eastern Europe remains uncertain, though immediate disruption appears significant. Legal Precedents and International Law Considerations International legal experts debate whether Russia’s WhiteBIT designation violates bilateral investment treaties or international trade agreements. The exchange’s European Union registration potentially creates jurisdictional conflicts that may escalate to international arbitration. Previous cases involving digital asset seizures during conflicts have established limited precedents, leaving substantial legal uncertainty. Furthermore, the classification of cryptocurrency exchanges as “Undesirable Organizations” rather than traditional financial institutions creates novel legal questions regarding applicable protections and remedies. Human rights organizations have expressed concern that restricting financial channels for humanitarian support may violate international conventions. However, nations maintain broad discretion regarding financial regulation during armed conflicts. This tension between national security prerogatives and humanitarian principles will likely generate continued legal challenges as cryptocurrency becomes increasingly integrated into global conflict dynamics. Conclusion The Russia crypto ban targeting WhiteBIT exchange represents a pivotal moment in digital asset regulation, demonstrating how cryptocurrency platforms become geopolitical instruments during conflicts. This action highlights the complex intersection between decentralized finance and national security concerns, creating challenging compliance dilemmas for exchanges operating in volatile regions. As cryptocurrency continues evolving as both humanitarian tool and potential conflict financier, regulatory frameworks must develop greater sophistication to address these dual realities. The WhiteBIT case will undoubtedly influence how nations approach cryptocurrency regulation during geopolitical tensions, potentially reshaping global digital asset markets for years to come. FAQs Q1: What specific activities triggered Russia’s ban on WhiteBIT? Russian authorities cited WhiteBIT’s provision of approximately $11 million to Ukrainian military forces, including $1 million for drone purchases, as the primary justification. They also alleged the exchange facilitated money laundering operations to move funds abroad, though detailed evidence remains limited in public disclosures. Q2: How will Russian authorities enforce the WhiteBIT cryptocurrency ban? Enforcement mechanisms include internet service provider blocking of WhiteBIT domains, mandatory transaction reporting by traditional financial institutions, potential prosecution of users attempting to circumvent restrictions, and possible asset seizures connected to the exchange’s operations within Russian jurisdiction. Q3: What percentage of WhiteBIT’s user base was affected by this Russia crypto ban? While exact figures remain confidential, industry analysts estimate Russian users represented 15-20% of WhiteBIT’s customer base before the conflict. The exchange had been gradually reducing this exposure through voluntary migration programs since 2023 in anticipation of potential restrictions. Q4: How does this action compare to other cryptocurrency sanctions during the conflict? This represents the most aggressive direct sanction against a specific exchange to date. Previous measures focused more broadly on cryptocurrency mining restrictions or general warnings about crypto donations to Ukraine, rather than comprehensive bans targeting individual platforms. Q5: What are the implications for other cryptocurrency exchanges operating in conflict zones? The WhiteBIT case establishes a concerning precedent where exchanges may face impossible choices between regulatory compliance and humanitarian principles. Other platforms operating in politically volatile regions will likely enhance compliance screening, consider geographic rebalancing strategies, and increase transparency regarding their political neutrality or affiliations.

The company put out the revised numbers Friday. Executive Pradeep Vincent wrote on LinkedIn that the project “will deliver high-quality jobs, sustainable infrastructure, and long-term economic benefits to Doña Ana County.” It’s part of a broader trend. Data centers have gone from being relatively uncontroversial to facing real opposition from communities. People living near these facilities and their local representatives worry the power-hungry operations will jack up electricity bills, drain water supplies, and won’t create many jobs after they’re built. Tech companies have fought back with PR campaigns featuring TV commercials, studies that claim their facilities aren’t driving up costs, and promises they won’t harm local areas. Oracle’s site goes by “Project Jupiter” and sits just a few miles north of the border with Mexico. It’s tied to a massive contract between Oracle and OpenAI called Stargate. Local protesters have focused mostly on what it might do to the environment. The company got tax incentives and government-backed bonds to help pay for it. Company addresses environmental concerns Oracle tried to ease the concerns. The data center will use about as much water as an office building, the company said, because the liquid cooling the servers gets reused over and over. It’ll run entirely on gas generators sitting on the property instead of tapping into the public power grid, which Oracle says means “no impact to rate payers.” The company also plans to pay hundreds of millions to the county for schools and water systems. The new mexico project isn’t happening in isolation Last September, OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank announced five new AI data center sites around the country, including this one. Put together, they’re supposed to have nearly 7 gigawatts of capacity and represent over $400 billion in investment. Another site near Milwaukee is being developed by OpenAI, Oracle, and Vantage. That one’s a nearly 1-gigawatt campus with four buildings expected to bring more than 4,000 construction jobs and over 1,000 permanent positions. Microsoft’s been busy too , linking data centers in Wisconsin and Atlanta with fiber-optic cables. The company calls it an “AI Superfactory”, basically a networked system for training AI models.

This ambitious support program, announced via the project’s official X account, specifically targets early-stage founders building in several frontier sectors of decentralized technology. Consequently, this initiative represents a strategic investment in the next generation of blockchain infrastructure and applications. The fellowship focuses on critical areas like real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, prediction markets, and the emerging field of DeFAI, which merges artificial intelligence with decentralized finance. Sui Hydropower Fellowship Targets Strategic Web3 Sectors The Sui Hydropower Fellowship establishes a clear mandate to cultivate innovation in five distinct technological domains. Firstly, the program seeks founders working on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization , a process converting physical assets like real estate or commodities into digital tokens on a blockchain. Secondly, it supports developers in the prediction markets space, where platforms allow users to trade on the outcome of future events. Thirdly, the fellowship encourages projects in gamified trading , which uses game-like mechanics to enhance user engagement in financial activities. Furthermore, a major focus area is DeFAI (AI + DeFi) , representing the convergence of artificial intelligence and decentralized finance. This hybrid field aims to create more intelligent, automated, and efficient financial protocols. Finally, the program includes incentive design , which is crucial for structuring sustainable token economies and governance models. The selection of these sectors is not arbitrary. For instance, the RWA tokenization market alone is projected by firms like Boston Consulting Group to become a multi-trillion-dollar industry by 2030. Similarly, analysts from firms such as Galaxy Digital highlight DeFAI as a key trend for 2025, promising to solve scalability and user experience challenges in DeFi.

On Monday, the European Commission gave Meta’s popular messaging app a new status under the Digital Services Act. WhatsApp open channels now count as a Very Large Online Platform, which means Meta must now meet high legal standards for how it handles content, transparency, and user risks. This applies only to WhatsApp channels, not to the regular one-on-one chats. The law does not affect private messages. These new channels are used by celebrities, public figures, and news outlets to broadcast updates, and now, they come with legal obligations. EU adds WhatsApp after sexual deepfake scandal on X The announcement came just hours after EU regulators launched a case against Elon Musk’s X. They’re investigating the spread of sexually explicit deepfake images created by Grok, the AI bot running on X. That platform, which was fined €120 million in December, is already under the DSA. The White House said the law is being used to punish U.S. companies unfairly. The U.S. government is not happy. Last year, after the EU fine on X, the Trump administration blocked travel access for Thierry Breton, one of the officials who helped build the law. That came after Washington accused the EU of turning internet rules into a censorship tool. WhatsApp became a DSA target because of its numbers. Meta had already reported that the platform averaged about 46.8 million monthly users on its channels during the second half of 2024. That crossed the threshold needed for the Commission to step in. These rules are not suggestions. Once labeled, platforms like WhatsApp must publish user stats every six months and assess how their channels are used to spread illegal or harmful content. If they break the law, they could be fined up to 6% of their annual global sales. For a company like Meta, that’s a huge financial hit. Bloomberg first reported Meta had been told this was coming. But now it’s official, and WhatsApp is the latest to join Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and X in the EU’s strict list. EU lawmakers demand new digital agency to keep control Alexandra Geese, a member of the European Parliament from Germany, said none of this is about pressure from the United States. “The enforcement is not happening because there’s too much pressure from the Trump administration,” Geese said. She worked directly on the DSA and warned early on that the EU needed an independent agency to enforce these laws. “This is an ‘I told you so’ moment,” Geese added. And she wasn’t the only one. Last year, Portugal pushed for the EU to create a single digital enforcement agency. Gonçalo Matias, Portugal’s minister for state reform, invited 13 countries to a summit in October to talk about it. He said countries need to “coordinate responsibilities currently spread across multiple authorities.” In the final statement from that meeting, the 13 countries said a single regulator “can consolidate responsibilities, ensure coherent enforcement of EU digital legislation and foster an innovation-friendly regulatory culture.” But not everyone supported the idea. Hungary, Slovakia, and Poland opposed it. These countries don’t like giving Brussels more power. Mario Mariniello from Bruegel, a think tank, argued that this kind of enforcement shouldn’t stay inside the European Commission. “There, the level of politicization is so high that you would have a significant benefit,” he wrote last September. He said a separate agency would stop political interference, especially when outside countries like the U.S. get involved. He pointed to the EU’s delay in fining Google as an example. Trade talks with Washington were tense, and the EU’s trade chief held back the fine. The fine came later, but the delay showed the Commission was vulnerable to pressure. Geese said this shows why the Commission can’t keep doing everything itself. “It’s so political, there’s no real enforcement, there’s no independent enforcement, independent from politics,” she said. But she also admitted that trying to build a new agency now might be a bad idea. “You’re gonna debate this for two or three years, with the Council, and Hungary and Slovakia are going to say: No way. And in the meantime, nothing happens, because that becomes the excuse: The agency is going to do it,” she said. Geese said time matters. Europe is under pressure to respond to the Grok case, where an AI bot published sexual deepfakes online. She said it’s “one of the most egregious episodes of a large language model perpetuating gender based violence.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Spot gold prices gained 2.4%, trading at $5,102 an ounce, before paring gains to $5,086. The surge comes days after President Donald Trump warned Canada that the U.S. would impose a 100% tariff on goods sold in the U.S. if the country strikes a trade deal with China. “If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post . However, Ethereum is moving in the opposite direction, trading at $2,877.15 with a 24-hour trading volume of $24.69 billion. The token now sits 36% below its $4,953.73 peak. The $5K Race Ends The “Gold versus ETH: Which hits $5K first?” market on Myriad has reached a resolution, with gold hitting the $5k mark first. The precious metal jumped 7.28% on the week and was recently priced at $4,938 before Monday’s breakout. Source: Myriad While gold is typically compared to Bitcoin, predictors on Myriad favored ETH for months, betting on its volatile upward mobility, but they’ve become less confident as crypto markets slide. The prediction market opened in October 2025. Institutional Flows Tell the Story Western ETF holdings have climbed by about 500 tonnes since the start of 2025. Goldman Sachs lifted its December 2026 gold price forecast to $5,400 an ounce, up from $4,900, arguing that hedges against global macro and policy risks have become “sticky.” Central bank purchases remain robust as Goldman estimates central-bank purchases are averaging around 60 tonnes a month, far above the pre-2022 average of 17 tonnes. “While this rally in gold has not, and will not, be linear, we believe the trends driving this rebasing higher in gold prices are not exhausted,” Natasha Kaneva, head of Global Commodities Strategy at J.P.

Trump’s tariff threat follows tensions that mounted after Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney delivered an address at the World Economic Forum in Davos that was widely seen as a rebuke of the Trump administration’s policies. Earlier this month, Carney announced that Canada and China reached a preliminary deal to remove trade barriers. Under the tentative agreement, Beijing cut tariffs on some Canadian agricultural products, while Ottawa increased quotas for imports of Chinese electric vehicles. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said on Sunday that Ottawa has no plans to pursue a free trade deal with China, noting that the recent agreement only reduces tariffs on select sectors. Carney’s remarks came a day after President Trump threatened a 100% tariff on Canadian goods. What Desks Are Watching The gold-crypto divergence indicates a broader risk recalibration. Following a record-breaking 2025, gold entered 2026 with momentum intact as geopolitical tensions, falling real interest rates, and efforts by investors and central banks to diversify away from the dollar reinforce its safe-haven role. ETH failed to reclaim its “digital gold” narrative during peak macro stress. Analysts note that if ETH maintains support around the $2,500 level, it could reach an all-time high of $6,000 by 2026, but that thesis requires risk appetite to return. In August 2025, Trump raised the tariff on Canadian goods to 35%. A 100% tariff threat marks a major escalation. Markets are pricing in two interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve later this year. Traders await this week’s FOMC meeting, where the central bank is widely expected to hold rates steady.

Over the weekend, a prominent technical evaluation of XRP’s price structure has ignited concern among investors focused on trend dynamics and momentum. This warning emphasized the importance of understanding how key indicators are interacting as price action unfolds — and why some traders are bracing for further downside. In a video analysis shared on X, STEPH IS CRYPTO, a well‑known market analyst, spotlighted a pivotal development on XRP’s weekly chart that demands attention. Steph explained that XRP has recently slipped below its weekly exponential moving average (EMA) ribbon — a collection of moving averages that many traders use as a barometer of trend strength. A confirmed break below this set of averages often signals a shift in control from buyers to sellers, raising the probability of extended bearish pressure. $XRP WARNING! pic.twitter.com/p00Aa1adJO — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) January 26, 2026 Weekly EMA Breakdown and Historical Precedent Steph’s analysis centered on the weekly EMA ribbon, an area where price historically finds support during bullish regimes and resistance during bearish phases. When price trades above this ribbon, upward momentum tends to dominate; conversely, extended breaks below it have coincided with marked declines in prior cycles. Notable breakdowns in 2014, 2015, 2018, and 2022 all preceded periods of significant weakness in XRP’s multi‑year price structure. These historical parallels fuel concern that the current break could herald a continuation of bearish trends unless buyers reclaim this level soon. Market data corroborates the technical fragility: XRP’s price recently dipped below $1.90 and continues to hover near critical support levels, while momentum indicators remain skewed toward sellers. Technical reports highlight that price trading beneath key moving averages has reinforced selling pressure, and a sustained inability to break above these thresholds could expose lower support zones near the $1.80 range. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Mixed Signals Across Technical Indicators Despite the bearish backdrop, markets rarely move in straight lines. Analysts note that while the weekly structure leans negative, other indicators suggest the potential for stabilization or even reversal if key levels hold. For instance, RSI divergence and cycle timing factors indicate that downside momentum may be slowing near the broader demand zone between roughly $1.85 and $2.21 — a range that has served as a launch point for past rallies. Furthermore, there is historical precedent in recent years for brief excursions below major moving averages that resolved into strong rallies. In 2024–2025, XRP found support after periods beneath structural EMAs and produced sharp rebounds, underscoring the nuanced nature of technical patterns. What Traders Should Watch Next For traders, the immediate focus centers on weekly closes relative to the EMA ribbon and key psychological levels near $2.00 . A decisive reclaim of the EMA ribbon on sustained volume could shift sentiment and signal the end of the current bearish phase. Conversely, continued weakness below these thresholds might intensify selling pressure and open the door for deeper corrective moves. In the interim, market participants should integrate broader technical context with evolving price action, recognizing that while the current setup leans bearish, alternative scenarios remain viable if structural support holds and momentum indicators turn.

This shocking incident involves the child of an employee at CMDSS, a critical federal contractor responsible for managing digital assets seized by law enforcement agencies nationwide. The case immediately raises profound questions about security protocols surrounding government-held cryptocurrency and represents one of the largest potential thefts from federal digital asset reserves in American history. US Marshals Service Investigates Major Government Crypto Breach The U.S. Marshals Service confirmed its active investigation this week following initial reporting by CoinDesk. This federal agency, operating under the Department of Justice, manages one of the government’s most significant cryptocurrency portfolios through seized assets from criminal cases. Consequently, the alleged theft represents not just a financial loss but a substantial breach of federal asset management systems. The investigation centers on transactions occurring over several months, with blockchain analysts tracing movements from official government wallets to private accounts. Federal contractors like CMDSS play crucial roles in maintaining these systems. Specifically, CMDSS provides specialized IT services to both the Department of Defense and Department of Justice. Their responsibilities include securing and managing cryptocurrency seized during federal operations. Therefore, this incident exposes potential vulnerabilities in the chain of custody for digital assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The Marshals Service has historically auctioned seized cryptocurrency through approved channels, generating substantial revenue for federal crime victim funds. Contractor Security Protocols Under Scrutiny CMDSS, the contractor at the center of this investigation, maintains contracts with multiple federal agencies. The company specializes in secure information technology solutions for sensitive government operations. According to procurement records, CMDSS has received over $50 million in federal contracts during the past five years. Their work includes developing and maintaining systems for tracking and securing seized digital assets. However, this incident suggests possible failures in their security implementation or personnel oversight procedures. The alleged perpetrator, identified as the son of CMDSS President Dean Daghita, reportedly gained access through unclear means. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT noted the complexity of tracing the transactions. “The movement patterns suggest either sophisticated social engineering or compromised authentication systems,” ZachXBT stated in their analysis. Furthermore, the scale of the theft indicates it may have occurred over an extended period rather than as a single event. This pattern raises additional concerns about detection systems and regular auditing practices. Historical Context of Government Crypto Management This incident follows several high-profile cases involving mismanagement of government-held cryptocurrency. In 2023, the Department of Justice established new guidelines for seized digital asset management. These guidelines specifically addressed secure storage solutions and regular auditing requirements. Previously, in 2021, the Internal Revenue Service faced criticism for inadequate tracking of seized cryptocurrency during drug trafficking investigations. The Marshals Service itself has conducted multiple auctions of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies since 2014, developing what many considered robust procedures. The table below shows recent major government cryptocurrency seizures: Year Agency Asset Type Approximate Value 2022 Department of Justice Bitcoin $3.36 billion 2023 IRS Criminal Investigation Various Cryptocurrencies $1.2 billion 2024 U.S. Marshals Service Ethereum, Bitcoin $900 million These substantial holdings make effective security protocols absolutely essential. The alleged $40 million theft, while significant, represents a relatively small percentage of total government-held cryptocurrency. Nevertheless, the breach of trust and security implications carry substantial weight. Federal agencies increasingly rely on specialized contractors for technical expertise in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Blockchain Forensics and Investigation Methods Investigators employ multiple techniques to trace the alleged theft. Blockchain analytics firms typically use clustering algorithms to connect wallet addresses. They also analyze transaction patterns and timing to identify potential controllers. In this case, the movement of funds suggests attempts at obfuscation through mixing services or decentralized exchanges. However, most mixing services retain some transaction records that skilled analysts can potentially unravel. Key investigation challenges include: Wallet identification – Determining which addresses belong to government entities Transaction tracing – Following funds across multiple blockchain networks Timeline establishment – Creating accurate sequence of events Access verification – Determining how authentication systems were compromised Blockchain investigators like ZachXBT have developed sophisticated tools for these purposes. Their work often involves analyzing millions of transactions across multiple blockchains. Additionally, they collaborate with cryptocurrency exchanges to identify account holders associated with specific wallet addresses. This multi-pronged approach has proven effective in numerous high-profile cryptocurrency investigations worldwide. Potential Impacts on Federal Crypto Policies This incident will likely trigger significant policy reviews across multiple agencies. Congressional oversight committees have already indicated plans to examine government cryptocurrency management practices. Potential outcomes include stricter contractor vetting requirements, enhanced auditing protocols, and revised custody solutions. Some legislators may advocate for reducing government cryptocurrency holdings through more frequent auctions. Others might propose creating a dedicated federal digital asset management agency with enhanced security standards. The cryptocurrency industry closely watches these developments. Many blockchain companies provide custody solutions specifically designed for institutional clients. These companies emphasize multi-signature wallets, hardware security modules, and institutional-grade key management. Federal agencies have historically been slower to adopt such solutions than private sector financial institutions. This incident may accelerate adoption of more sophisticated security measures across government cryptocurrency operations. Legal Implications and Prosecution Pathways Federal prosecutors will likely pursue multiple charges if evidence supports the allegations. Potential charges include wire fraud, computer fraud, theft of government property, and money laundering. Each charge carries substantial prison sentences, particularly given the amount involved. Prosecutors must establish both the theft itself and the defendant’s knowledge that the funds belonged to the government. They must also demonstrate how the defendant gained unauthorized access to the wallet systems. The Department of Justice has developed substantial expertise in cryptocurrency cases. Their National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team, established in 2021, coordinates complex digital asset investigations. This team works alongside the U.S. Marshals Service and other agencies. Their involvement suggests this case will receive high-level attention and resources. Successful prosecution could establish important precedents for future government cryptocurrency theft cases. Defense strategies might focus on access authorization questions. If the defendant had legitimate access through their parent’s position, the case becomes more complex. Alternatively, defense attorneys might argue the defendant believed they were accessing legitimate test networks or demonstration systems. These arguments would require substantial supporting evidence regarding system configurations and access permissions. Conclusion The US Marshals Service investigation into the alleged $40 million cryptocurrency theft represents a critical moment for federal digital asset security. This shocking breach exposes vulnerabilities in contractor-managed government systems and highlights the evolving challenges of securing cryptocurrency holdings. As the investigation progresses, expect significant policy revisions, enhanced security protocols, and potentially landmark legal proceedings. The case underscores the urgent need for robust, auditable systems for managing government cryptocurrency reserves in an increasingly digital financial landscape. Ultimately, this incident will likely transform how federal agencies secure, manage, and audit their growing cryptocurrency portfolios. FAQs Q1: What is the U.S. Marshals Service investigating?

However, some lesser-known tokens have been on a winning streak. River (RIVER), for instance, has posted a staggering increase of more than 2,000% over the past 30 days. A Star is Born RIVER saw the light of day in September last year, but it made the headlines in the past weeks thanks to its whopping price ascent. Currently, it trades at around $83 (per CoinGecko’s data), meaning a gain of 2,020% on a four-week scale. Its market capitalization has soared past $1.6 billion, making RIVER the 64th-largest cryptocurrency and flipping well-known altcoins like Ondo (ONDO), Aster (ASTER), Pi Network (PI), Worldcoin (WLD), and others. One potential reason for the rally could be the solid support from numerous exchanges. HTX (formerly Huobi) listed RIVER in its Innovation Zone, while South Korea’s Coinone also launched trading services for the asset. Another factor that may have positively impacted the token’s price is the $12 million strategic round, which River recently closed . The financing supports the entity’s expansion across EVM and non-EVM ecosystems, including TRON, Sui, and other major networks. “Proceeds will be used to accelerate ecosystem deployments, deepen stablecoin liquidity, and advance satUSD integrations across trading, lending, staking, and yield use cases,” the disclosure reads. River also announced that it will introduce yield products for both users and institutions, including Smart Vault and Prime Vault. Some participants in the funding round include Arthur Hayes’ Maelstrom Fund and Justin Sun’s TRON DAO. Further Gains or…? Some analysts think RIVER has much more fuel left to chart additional increases. X user Shuarix predicted a pump to $100, whereas Crypto_Jobs thinks the price can reach that milestone only if it holds the $68-$70 support zone. At the same time, many others believe a painful crash could be knocking on the door. X user Erik said 94% of RIVER’s total supply is held by just five wallets, arguing: “After massive manipulation and bubble phase, we’ll see a glorious dump.” Honey was also skeptical, claiming that the project resembles previous rug pull schemes and warning investors to be utterly cautious.

Futures markets assign roughly a 97% probability that policymakers leave rates unchanged. This expectation reflects a steady message from Federal Reserve officials following three consecutive rate cuts last year . The focus now turns to how long the pause lasts rather than whether it begins. The December meeting delivered a 25-basis-point rate cut, bringing the federal funds rate to a 3.50%–3.75% range, in line with market consensus and marking the third reduction of the year. The decision reflected a divided committee. Two FOMC members dissented in favor of holding rates steady, while newly appointed Governor Miran voted for a deeper 50-basis-point cut, signaling a more aggressive easing preference. Rate table readings for December were revised to reflect this shift, with both the actual and forecast set at 3.75%, following the previous level of 4.00%. This adjustment aligns the data with the implemented policy move rather than the upper bound of the target range. Looking ahead to January, expectations point to a pause. Markets now price the previous rate at 3.75%, with the forecast also holding at 3.75%, indicating broad agreement that policymakers will maintain current settings. Source: ForexFactory This outlook reflects a balance between easing inflation pressures and still-resilient economic activity, leaving the Fed positioned to assess incoming data before signaling its next move. Inflation and Jobs Send Mixed Signals Economic data paints an unusual picture. Inflation remains stuck near 3.0%, still above the Fed’s 2% target. At the same time, labor market conditions show only modest cooling. Recent jobs data pointed to slower hiring, yet unemployment edged lower and initial jobless claims stayed subdued. Growth adds another layer of complexity. Estimates suggest the U.S. economy expanded at an annualized 5.4% pace in the fourth quarter. Fast growth alongside easing job momentum raises questions. Is productivity surging, or does the economy risk overheating beneath the surface? Market Pricing Reinforces the Pause Narrative Market-based tools underline expectations for inaction. The CME FedWatch tool shows overwhelming odds of no change in January, with only a small chance of a 25 basis point cut. Investors now price the next move around mid-year. This shift signals confidence that policy sits close to neutral and that officials see no urgency to act. The message remains clear. Policymakers want firmer evidence that inflation cools further or that the labor market weakens more decisively. Reaction Functions Point to Neutral Territory Economists often examine how the Fed reacted in similar conditions. Models using post-2022 data highlight two variables that matter most. The first is the real policy rate, measured against core inflation. The second involves initial jobless claims as a real-time gauge of labor health. These models estimate a neutral real rate near 0.5%, implying a nominal neutral range between 2.5% and 3%. Current settings place policy slightly restrictive but not extreme, reinforcing the case for patience. Politics Loom Over the 2026 Outlook The January meeting unfolds amid growing political tension. President Donald Trump’s administration continues to push for lower rates to support growth and reduce debt servicing costs. Reports point to internal pressure for deeper cuts late last year. Chair Jerome Powell faces unprecedented scrutiny, including legal challenges, while his term as Chair ends in May 2026. That date now acts as a policy horizon. Markets increasingly expect leadership changes to influence decisions later in the year. Dollar Weakness Reflects Governance Concerns Currency markets already reflect these dynamics. The U.S. Dollar Index has slipped toward 97.00 as investors anticipate lower rates ahead. Falling yield expectations reduce the dollar’s appeal. At the same time, visible tension between the White House and the Fed introduces a governance discount. The euro trades near $1.19, while the pound hovers close to $1.37. Gold above $5,100 signals where some investors seek safety. Why choose the dollar when hard assets beckon? What Comes After January? The path beyond January fuels debate. Markets expect two to three cuts in 2026, while the Fed signals closer to one. This gap drives volatility. A firm Fed stance could lift yields and pressure risk assets. A shift toward market expectations could extend rallies across equities and metals. For now, the January meeting looks set to pass quietly. Yet beneath the calm, forces gather that could define monetary policy for the rest of the year.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-26 19:17:58

Both setups point to a key decision zone, as ETH holds trend support while it sits below repeated resistance. Ethereum chart mirrors gold’s base, while breakout risk builds A side by side TradingView snapshot from X user apugeneral compares Ethereum on a two week chart with gold on an 18 day chart and argues the two markets share the same rhythm: a big peak, a long rounded bottom, then repeated tests under a rising ceiling. In the image, ETH last trades near $3,007, while gold prints near $4,832 after a steep run. Ethereum vs Gold Long Term Structure Comparison. Source: apugeneral on X On both charts, the curved white markings frame a similar cycle. First, each market tops and sells off. Next, each drifts through a broad, rounded basing phase that stretches for years. After that, both recover into a choppy range, where price keeps tagging a slightly rising resistance line. The yellow dots on each chart highlight those repeated touches, suggesting sellers keep defending the same zone, even as the floor trends up. However, the key difference sits on the right chart. Gold already broke above that resistance line and then accelerated into a near vertical move. Meanwhile, ETH still trades below its own rising ceiling, with the most recent swing failing to clear that marked barrier. If ETH follows the gold analogue, the “tell” becomes a clean two week close above the dotted resistance area, followed by price holding that line on a retest. In that scenario, the chart implies a higher probability of a fast expansion move toward the prior peak zone, because the range would shift from repeated rejection to acceptance. If ETH fails again and slips back into the middle of the range, then the comparison weakens, and the chart points to more sideways action before any decisive trend resumes. Ethereum stays inside rising weekly channel as price resets near mid range Meanwhile, A weekly TradingView chart from X user Crypto TheBoss shows Ethereum trading inside a long running ascending channel that has guided price since mid 2022. At the time of capture, ETH trades near $2,954, sitting close to the channel’s midpoint after pulling back from the upper boundary. Ethereum Weekly Ascending Channel Structure. Source: Crypto TheBoss on X The chart highlights a repeating structure. ETH rallies toward the upper band, fails to hold the highs, then corrects back toward the lower half of the channel before turning up again. The blue zigzag overlays emphasize that rhythm, with each downswing finding support above the channel floor rather than breaking the broader trend. As a result, the structure continues to define higher lows on a multi year basis. For now, price holds above the lower channel boundary, which remains the key technical reference. If ETH stabilizes above that rising support and reclaims momentum along the dashed midline, then the chart keeps the path open for another advance toward the upper band later in the cycle. However, a decisive weekly close below the lower boundary would mark the first structural failure of the channel since 2022 and signal a shift away from the established trend.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ETH|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-26 19:23:18

The company, which has developed what it terms an industrial ‘nervous system,’ aims to bridge the critical gap between physical operations and financial performance for large-scale manufacturers and utilities. This funding, led by Powerhouse Ventures, arrives as industries globally face intense pressure to optimize costs and supply chains, turning to AI-native solutions for a competitive edge. CVector’s Industrial AI Nervous System Explained Founded by Richard Zhang and Tyler Ruggles, CVector builds a software layer that acts as a central brain for industrial facilities. Essentially, the system connects disparate data sources—from sensor readings on valves and pumps to energy meters and commodity price feeds—into a unified economic model. Consequently, it translates small, operational actions into clear financial impacts. For instance, the system can demonstrate how adjusting a single valve’s operation affects overall energy consumption and, ultimately, the facility’s bottom line. This focus on ‘operational economics’ is the core of CVector’s value proposition. Previously, plant managers often lacked the tools to make this direct correlation. They could see operational data and financial results, but not the causal link between them. CVector’s platform provides that missing connective tissue. The startup has moved beyond its pre-seed phase and is now deploying its system with live customers, including public utilities, advanced manufacturing plants, and chemical producers. From Heartland Factories to San Francisco Startups: Diverse Early Adoption The $5 million seed round, which included participation from Fusion Fund, Myriad Venture Partners, and Hitachi’s corporate venture arm, enables CVector to expand its team and customer base. Interestingly, the startup’s early adopters showcase the broad applicability of its technology. One flagship customer is ATEK Metal Technologies, an Iowa-based metals processor that creates aluminum castings for companies like Harley-Davidson. For ATEK, CVector’s system helps predict equipment failures to prevent costly downtime, monitors plant-wide energy efficiency, and tracks commodity prices that influence raw material costs. This application demonstrates CVector’s strength in transforming established, skilled-labor operations. Simultaneously, the startup also serves innovative newcomers. Ammobia, a San Francisco materials science startup working to reduce ammonia production costs, uses CVector for surprisingly similar optimization tasks. This dual-market approach—serving both legacy industrial heartland plants and cutting-edge tech startups—highlights the universal need for operational clarity and cost control. The Shift from AI Skepticism to AI-Native Demand Zhang notes a dramatic shift in customer mindset over the past year. Initially, discussing AI in industrial settings carried risk, with about half of potential clients skeptical of its practical value. However, the last six months have seen a pronounced change. Now, companies actively seek AI-native solutions, even when the precise return on investment (ROI) isn’t immediately calculable. This ‘adoption craze,’ as Zhang describes it, is driven by global economic uncertainty and intense focus on supply chain resilience. Ruggles emphasizes that CVector’s appeal ultimately boils down to financial certainty. In an era of volatile costs, the ability to model a facility’s economics with AI provides a powerful tool for decision-making. This resonates equally with century-old manufacturers and new-energy producers. Building the Team and Defining the Market With the new capital, CVector has grown to 12 employees and secured its first physical office in Manhattan’s financial district. Strategically, Zhang has recruited talent from fintech and hedge fund backgrounds. Professionals from these fields are already adept at using complex data to gain financial advantages, making their skills highly transferable to CVector’s mission of industrial economic modeling. The market CVector operates in, often called Industrial AI or Industry 4.0, is crowded but fragmented. Many solutions focus on predictive maintenance or isolated process optimization. CVector differentiates itself by taking a holistic, facility-wide economic perspective. Its system doesn’t just predict a pump failure; it models the financial impact of that failure on production schedules, energy use, and delivery timelines. CVector Seed Funding & Early Traction Metric Detail Funding Round $5 Million Seed Lead Investor Powerhouse Ventures Key Participants Fusion Fund, Myriad Venture Partners, Hitachi Ventures Customer Examples ATEK Metal Technologies, Ammobia, Public Utilities Core Technology AI-Powered ‘Operational Economics’ Platform Primary Value Translating Operational Actions into Financial Savings The startup’s progress reflects several key trends in the 2025 technology landscape: AI Maturation: Movement from theoretical AI to applied, ROI-driven solutions. Economic Pressure: Companies prioritizing tools that deliver immediate cost management. Data Unification: Breaking down silos between operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT) data. Conclusion CVector’s successful $5 million seed funding underscores a growing conviction that artificial intelligence’s most immediate value may lie in optimizing the physical world of manufacturing and energy. By building an industrial nervous system focused on operational economics, CVector provides a critical missing layer for large-scale industry. As companies navigate persistent economic uncertainty, the demand for AI tools that deliver tangible savings and supply chain clarity will only intensify. The startup’s challenge now is to scale its promising early deployments and prove that its industrial AI nervous system can deliver systemic savings across the global industrial base. FAQs Q1: What exactly does CVector’s industrial AI platform do? CVector’s platform acts as a connective ‘nervous system’ for industrial facilities. It integrates data from machines, sensors, and market feeds to create a live economic model. This shows how operational changes, like adjusting equipment, directly impact costs and profits. Q2: Who led CVector’s $5 million seed funding round? The $5 million seed round was led by Powerhouse Ventures. It also included participation from early-stage funds Fusion Fund and Myriad Venture Partners, as well as strategic investment from Hitachi’s corporate venture arm. Q3: What types of companies are using CVector’s technology? CVector’s early customers range from legacy manufacturers like ATEK Metal Technologies in Iowa to innovative startups like Ammobia in San Francisco. It also works with public utilities and chemical producers, demonstrating wide applicability. Q4: How does CVector’s approach differ from other Industrial AI companies? While many Industrial AI tools focus on specific problems like predictive maintenance, CVector takes a holistic, facility-wide view centered on ‘operational economics.’ It directly links physical operations to financial outcomes, which is its key differentiator. Q5: Why is there suddenly more demand for AI in industrial settings? Over the past six months, economic uncertainty and supply chain volatility have forced companies to seek every possible efficiency. Industrial leaders have moved past initial skepticism and now actively seek AI-native solutions to manage costs and gain a competitive edge, even if the immediate ROI isn’t fully defined.

Several days ago, ETH fell below the $3,000 level and recently tested support near $2,700–$2,800. It has yet to recover with strength. Breakdown Pattern Raises Risk Analyst Trader Tardigrade shared a 3-day chart showing a bear flag forming on Ethereum. This pattern is characterized by a sharp drop and is usually followed by further downside. The asset is now breaking below the lower support of the flag. The post notes that Ethereum must close above $2,906 soon to avoid a larger drop. “ It has 1 day and 19 hours to reclaim above $2,906 to avoid this breakdown, ” the analyst wrote. If the breakdown holds, the target is around $1,666 based on the earlier move. $ETH /3-day #Ethereum is breaking down from a Bear Flag, targeting $1,666 It has 1 day and 19 hours to reclaim above $2,906 to avoid this breakdown. pic.twitter.com/1Q5XZjg1qP — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) January 26, 2026 Another analyst, Ted, posted that Ethereum is trading flat near $2,900 after a strong selloff earlier. Open interest is rising, reaching 5.255 million, showing more positions are being opened despite the sideways price. Funding remains slightly positive at 0.0011, but it has dropped, showing cooling interest. “ Old degens got liquidated, and now new ones have arrived, ” the post added. The rise in open interest while the price holds steady could mean traders are preparing for the next move. ETH/BTC Pair at Key Area Michaël van de Poppe, founder of MNF Fund, shared a chart of ETH against Bitcoin. ETH/BTC is holding a support level that has been important before. The price is sitting in a higher timeframe zone, though it is now below the 21-day moving average. “It would be enormously important to be holding this level,” van de Poppe said. If the support holds, ETH could gain against BTC. If not, the chart points to lower levels ahead. Meanwhile, CW pointed out that the current ETH price range matches previous whale accumulation zones. “ The current price is an attractive range for Ethereum whales, ” they noted. The realized price of large accumulation wallets is close to the current level. However, data from analyst Ali Martinez shows a steady drop in whale holdings since early January. Ethereum ETFs have also posted losses recently. Price weakness and reduced holdings suggest caution remains across larger accounts.

Blockchain intelligence firm Arkham detected unusual movement from wallet address 0x519Fe, which deposited and withdrew 61.63 billion SHIB tokens through Coinbase's hot wallet within hours. The wallet now shows a zero balance. The rapid round-trip transaction occurred as SHIB trades at $0.00000776, hovering just above critical support at $0.0000075. Market observers remain uncertain about the whale's intentions. The timing raises questions. Large deposits to centralized exchanges typically signal selling pressure. However, the immediate withdrawal suggests alternative motives. Traders speculate the move could represent portfolio rebalancing, off-exchange settlement, or strategic positioning ahead of anticipated price movement. Historical February Performance Creates Bullish Backdrop Shiba Inu has demonstrated consistent strength during February over recent years. Historical data reveals notable gains during this month across multiple years. In 2022, SHIB posted a 20.3% increase. The following year saw more modest growth at 1.59%. February 2024 delivered the strongest performance with a 41.3% surge. CryptoRank data confirms February ranks as the second-best month for SHIB performance. The average return for this period stands at 9.26%. Only one other month surpasses February's historical track record for the meme coin. The seasonal pattern has attracted increased attention from both retail and institutional traders. Many market participants position themselves to capitalize on potential February upside. The recent whale activity adds another layer of intrigue to these seasonal expectations. Technical Indicators Show Mixed Signals Price action tells a complex story. SHIB attempted a breakout toward $0.000009 in mid-January but failed to sustain momentum. The rejection led to a pullback toward current levels. Support near $0.0000075 has held multiple tests in recent weeks. Daily chart analysis reveals a pattern of higher lows forming. This technical development often precedes upward price movement. However, the token remains below key resistance levels that would confirm a trend reversal. Volume metrics add context to the price structure. Trading activity has remained relatively stable despite the failed breakout attempt. The large whale transaction occurred without triggering significant price volatility, suggesting the market absorbed the movement efficiently.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-26 19:28:24

Nvidia bought Class A CoreWeave shares at $87.20 each, cheaper than the $92.98 close on Friday. The move gives CoreWeave fuel to speed up its plan to build 5 gigawatts worth of AI data centers by 2030. CoreWeave CEO Mike Intrator told CNBC this deal helps them “accelerate our build” and reduce the company’s reliance on any single client. “This will lead to continued diversification,” he said during a live interview on Squawk on the Street. CoreWeave pushes ahead with more massive AI projects Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made it clear that while $2 billion is a big number, it’s just a fraction of what’s needed. “The amount of funding that needs to be raised yet to support that five gigawatts is really quite significant,” Jensen said. “We’re investing a small percentage of the amount that ultimately has to go and be provided.” The five-gigawatt goal isn’t just some marketing number. It equals the annual power use of around 4 million U.S. homes, based on government energy data. CoreWeave wants to hit that target in under four years. CoreWeave builds and runs data centers stacked with Nvidia GPUs, the chips used to train AI models and run heavy workloads. It’s how the company makes its money; renting out GPU-packed compute capacity. That makes CoreWeave part of a new breed some call “neocloud” providers. These aren’t general cloud giants. They exist for one job: power AI. Nvidia was already heavily tied to CoreWeave before Monday’s deal. In September, CoreWeave filed an SEC document showing Nvidia placed an order worth at least $6.3 billion. That agreement also commits Nvidia to buy any leftover compute capacity through April 2032. CoreWeave went public back in March on the Nasdaq. Since then, it’s pulled in billions in equity and debt, including earlier funding from Nvidia. But the company hasn’t had a smooth ride. The stock has been all over the place as investors watch CoreWeave load up on massive multi-billion-dollar deals, many of them debt-financed. Even with those concerns, CoreWeave keeps stacking up wins. The same month it landed the $6.3 billion order from Nvidia, it also agreed to supply Meta with $14.2 billion in AI infrastructure. That deal came just days after CoreWeave expanded its contract with OpenAI, taking the total value of that one to $22.4 billion. CoreWeave’s CEO isn’t worried about the pressure. Intrator told CNBC that AI is going to get baked into “absolutely everything we do,” and the infrastructure they’re building now will pay off for a century. “What you’re seeing is the base-load infrastructure being built right now at what has historically been a pace that wasn’t even considered,” he said. “Companies like CoreWeave, and there are others, are out there building the infrastructure to be able to deliver that for these clients.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

The traders that have been in the previous months chasing top cryptocurrencies are repositioning in cheaper altcoins that have better upside elasticity. When this rotation occurs it is seldom telegraphed beforehand. It starts humming in the participation data, then permeates price charts and sentiment feeds. In this quarter, the drawing attention token is a new crypto just passing through 3x of its original early price. Signal of Progression The altcoin that is on the rise is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . It has had a structured band system of price changes in its presale instead of arbitrary changes. MUTM was opened at the beginning of 2025 at a price of $0.01 and passed through several phases of allocation filling. At Phase 7, MUTM is selling out at $0.04 which translates to a 300% appreciation of the initial band. The envisaged launch price is $0.06. The financing and involvement has increased correspondingly with the stages of prices. The total financing is now up to $19.9 million and the number of investors has exceeded 18,900 shareholders. Approximately 830 million tokens have already been awarded. These numbers imply a consistent accretion process, and not a market spike of speculation, which is usually what must come before utility-driven repricing of altcoins still below the $1 mark. What Mutuum Finance Is Creating In addition to price and involvement, investors are tracking the protocol blueprint. Mutuum Finance is creating a decentralized lending platform on Ethereum that enables individuals to borrow in collateral as opposed to selling. The protocol facilitates a lending market and a direct borrowing market. Collateral regulations and liquidity frameworks enable lenders to get yield and borrowers to get access to liquidity. This design puts the project in the DeFi crypto category and not in the meme or narrative based tokens. mtTokens are in the middle of the yield system. Users who provide assets are given mtTokens which monitor growth and APY with time. Staking such mtTokens enables users to receive MUTM bought in the open market. The purchases are made up of a portion of protocol revenue. This buy-and-distribute model is important to analysts since it correlates token demand with usage, but not attention. Security is one of the significant causes of increased confidence. The independent audit of Mutuum Finance was performed by Halborn Security . It is also rated 90 out of 100 on the token scan of CertiK. And there exists an open $50k bug bounty to conduct additional code review until V1 activation. Lending protocols address collateral, reasoning of debt and liquidation, and thus this security layer should be regarded as valuable to the trust of the investors and valuation in the long term. Growth Trajectory The team also affirmed plans of stablecoin in its roadmap. Mutuum Finance seeks to roll out an overcollateralized stablecoin which its users can print out on locked assets. Stablecoin borrowers will hold the position longer than traders, which raises the stability of revenues and creation of fees. The most important aspect of sustainable DeFi valuation models is longer duration positions. Oracle feeds will be used on pricing and liquidation logic. Precise information in the volatility cases will prevent false liquidations and will enable the protocol to operate with rapid market swings. Most analysts that follow the development of DeFi designate oracles as one of the last infrastructure layers prior to significant user activity. Having these elements on the surface, a number of analysts started to model resets of expectation of MUTM. Given a moderate situation associated with V1 usage, some analysts hold that MUTM could reprice into the $0.25-$0.30 range in 2026. That would mean about a 525% to 650% increase in the value of the current band of $0.04 which was purchased today in case the roadmap materializes during the activation process. V1 Protocol Launch Sepolia testnet: Sepolia (testnet) is the first testnet to be confirmed in Q1 2026 as stated in the official Mutuum Finance X account . This is believed to be the point of departure between idea and action of the project. The lending rules are usually at a discounted rate up to such time since the distribution of the revenue, demand and borrowing flow cannot be modelled to precision before it is utilized. Phase 7 is selling at a faster rate than the previous stages. There have been whale entries such as one done last year amounting to more than $100,000. The 24 hour leaderboard is a reward given to the leading daily contributor of the day, consisting of $500 of MUTM that has been driving micro-competition in times of allocation. There is support for using card payments, which reduces the friction of non- crypto users in onboarding and increases the base of holders. Why Investors Care Ahead of Q3 2026 The appeal in this case is straightforward. MUTM is inexpensive, and it remains under 1, but the fundamental risks that are most characteristic of early altcoins are being mitigated while the infrastructure is being established. Cryptocurrency traders who are speculating on what to purchase in the crypto future (2026 rotations) refer to it as a window of opportunity in which the price has not yet become accommodating to utility anticipations.

His framework lands in the mid-$80,000s down to the low-$50,000s, while a separate technical view from analyst Aksel Kibar points to a broader “base building” process with support clustered in the mid-$70,000s. Price Levels Where To Buy Bitcoin Burniske wrote that he is “not a buyer yet,” but outlined several price areas he’s monitoring. In his view, roughly $80,000 matters as the November 2025 low and a local trough of the current downswing. Below that, he highlighted roughly $74,000, tying it to the April 2025 low and describing it as the “Tariff Tantrum” bottom; he also noted it sits just under Strategy’s (MSTR) stated Bitcoin cost basis of around $76,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Demand Hits Extreme Levels As Next Rally Loads Up He then pointed to around $70,000 as the top of the prior $50,000–$70,000 band near the 2021 high, before shifting to a more structural level near $58,000. That zone, he wrote, aligns with the 200-week simple moving average and an on-chain cost basis, with RV around $56,000. Finally, he flagged $50,000 and below as a psychological line, arguing that a break under it would likely revive “death of BTC” narratives. I’m not a buyer yet, but if I were to be a buyer, imo the areas to watch for $BTC are: ~$80K: Nov ’25 low, local low of this “bear” ~$74K: April ’25 low, Tariff Tantrum low, just below $MSTR‘s cost basis (~$76K) ~$70K: Top of $50-70K range, near ’21 high ~$58K: 200W SMA &… — Chris Burniske (@cburniske) January 25, 2026 Burniske’s posture is deliberately non-committal on timing. “Importantly, I don’t care what happens,” he wrote, adding that if Bitcoin rallies he will “ride what I have and diversify,” while a deeper unwind would have him buying more Bitcoin and “select crypto assets.” The thread also touched altcoins. Asked how he thinks about alts versus Bitcoin, Burniske said it’s “best imo to buy alts after you think btc is near bottom,” reinforcing that he’s treating BTC’s downside process as the key gating factor for broader risk-taking. On positioning, he said he is sitting “in treasuries, where yield > inflation,” and when asked about an upside level that would force him back in, he replied that he “wouldn’t chase,” preferring to hold existing exposure rather than re-risk at higher prices. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stuck In Bear Mode For 83 Days: Trend Pulse Confirms Structural Weakness Burniske’s renewed attention followed praise from Anthony Pompliano, who told him: “You nailed the SOL bottom and the BTC top over this cycle.” Burniske’s reputation for calling tops is partly tied to an October 2025 post in which he argued the market had likely been structurally damaged after a sharp selloff. “We can always get another weak bounce, but I’ve taken action accordingly,” he wrote at the time. “I’ll likely get interested in the market again when I see BTC $75K or lower.” Breakdown Or Bottoming Phase? Separately, veteran technician Aksel Kibar posted a BTCUSD daily chart on Sunday without additional commentary. When asked directly about a breakout or breakdown, Kibar cautioned against overweighting diagonal formations: “Not giving too much weight to diagonal short-term patterns breakout/breakdown. I think this is part of the base building, searching for a bottom.” Kibar had previously framed “technical support” as being “lower between 73.7K and 76.5K,” suggesting that if Bitcoin is indeed in a basing phase, the market may need time and repeated tests of those lower bands before a more durable trend reasserts itself. At press time, BTC traded at $87,812.

Hong Kong’s initial Suspicious Transaction Report and Management System (STREAM) is set to stop working by midnight on January 28 this year. In its place will be the Second Generation Suspicious Transaction Report and Management System, also known as STREAMS 2. Even with the cutoff date, there will be a five-day gap where users must report emergencies manually through email, phone, and fax. Hong Kong’s SFC sets deadline The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission ( SFC ) has officially set the timeline for financial institutions like licensed corporations, virtual asset service providers (VASPs), and associated entities to transition to the “Second Generation Suspicious Transaction Report and Management System,” also known as STREAMS 2. This new platform replaces the original STREAMS system and is designed to help the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (JFIU) process data faster. The SFC says the new system uses better automation and analysis to track suspicious money activities. According to the SFC circular, the JFIU will shut down the existing STREAMS platform at midnight on January 28, 2026. This will create a “blackout period” during which the JFIU cannot receive reports through any online portal. The blackout will last until the morning of February 2. A firm in urgent need to file a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) during these five days, must use traditional communication methods like email, phone and fax. Once launched, STREAMS 2 , will be the only legal channel for submitting STR reports. Any report sent through other channels after this time will not be accepted and will need to be resubmitted. All previous reports filed through the old system will be moved to STREAMS 2 where firms can log in to view their past records and check the status of their previous filings. New users must download the “STREAMS 2 User Registration Form” from the official JFIU website and email it to the unit afterwards in order to comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) laws. Regulatory changes planned for 2026 Hong Kong’s Financial Secretary Paul Chan recently spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos and confirmed that the country is ready to issue its first stablecoin licenses during the first quarter of 2026. Under these rules, any company that wants to offer or market stablecoins to the public in Hong Kong must get approval from the HKMA . They are required to have a minimum paid-up capital of HK$25 million and keep high-quality assets in reserve. They also must guarantee that users can redeem their stablecoins at par value. As of late 2025, 36 companies had already applied for these licenses. This includes major groups like a joint venture between Standard Chartered and Animoca Brands. In early 2026, a new bill is expected to reach the Legislative Council to amend the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (AMLO). This bill will create a license for those who provide advice on either buying or selling virtual assets. These managers will need to maintain at least HK$5 million in share capital.

This development, reported by The Block on April 9, 2025, signals a pivotal moment for traditional finance integration with DeFi’s core lending mechanisms. The launch represents a strategic expansion for Bitwise, a firm renowned for its cryptocurrency index funds and ETFs, into active, on-chain yield strategies. Consequently, this vault provides a regulated bridge for institutional capital seeking exposure to decentralized finance yields while managing counterparty risk through overcollateralization. Bitwise on-chain vault marks a new DeFi chapter The newly launched Bitwise on-chain vault operates directly on the Ethereum blockchain using the Morpho Blue protocol. Morpho Blue serves as a permissionless and efficient meta-layer for peer-to-peer lending. It allows vault creators like Bitwise to deploy capital into isolated, custom lending markets. Specifically, the Bitwise vault utilizes USDC, a fully-regulated dollar stablecoin, within these predefined markets. The protocol’s architecture requires all loans to be overcollateralized, meaning borrowers must lock crypto assets worth more than the loan value. This mechanism substantially mitigates default risk for vault depositors. Therefore, the vault offers a compelling yield target by tapping into organic borrowing demand within the DeFi ecosystem. Jonathan Man, Head of Multi-Strategy Solutions at Bitwise, provided crucial context for the launch. He confirmed the vault’s initial focus on USDC but indicated plans for future expansion. “The vault may support other stablecoins and crypto assets in the future,” Man stated. He further elaborated on Bitwise’s broader vision, noting the firm could expand into various DeFi strategies. These potential strategies include real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges (DEXs). This statement underscores a long-term commitment to building a diversified suite of on-chain products. The move aligns with a growing trend of TradFi institutions constructing modular DeFi offerings. Institutional adoption drives DeFi lending evolution The launch is not an isolated event but part of a larger narrative of institutional adoption in decentralized finance. Over the past two years, major asset managers and banks have progressively entered the space. They often start with custody and spot ETFs before exploring yield-generating activities. The Morpho protocol, with its focus on capital efficiency and risk isolation, has emerged as a preferred infrastructure layer for these sophisticated entrants. Its design allows institutions to create bespoke markets with specific risk parameters, a feature absent in more pooled protocols like Aave or Compound. This control is paramount for compliance and risk management teams. The competitive landscape for institutional DeFi yield includes several key players: Traditional Money Markets: Offer yields around 4-5% but are subject to central bank policy and banking system risks. On-Chain Lending Pools (Aave/Compound): Provide variable yields but involve exposure to a shared liquidity pool and communal risk parameters. Morpho Blue Vaults: Enable isolated markets with tailored risk, often allowing for more competitive and stable yields through direct market creation. Bitwise’s entry validates the latter model. It demonstrates that institutional capital demands both yield and precise risk compartmentalization. Furthermore, the 6% target yield, while subject to market conditions, is strategically positioned. It aims to be attractive compared to traditional fixed income while remaining achievable through sustainable DeFi mechanics. The vault’s performance will likely influence how other asset managers structure their own on-chain products. Expert analysis on risk, yield, and market impact Financial analysts highlight several critical factors behind this launch. First, the choice of overcollateralized lending is a deliberate risk-off strategy. It prioritizes capital preservation while chasing yield, a familiar approach for institutional portfolios. Second, using USDC provides a stable value denominator, avoiding the volatility of crypto-native assets like ETH for the principal. Third, the Morpho Blue framework minimizes smart contract risk by utilizing a simple, audited, and battle-tested core codebase. These technical and strategic choices collectively build a product that meets the high bar of institutional due diligence. The potential market impact is substantial. Bitwise’s vault acts as a proof-of-concept for other regulated entities. Success could trigger a wave of similar products, increasing total value locked (TVL) in permissionless DeFi protocols. However, analysts also note challenges. The yield is not guaranteed and depends on borrowing demand. Regulatory clarity, especially regarding the treatment of on-chain yield, remains an evolving area. Despite these considerations, the launch is widely viewed as a net positive. It brings professional risk management and significant capital to the DeFi lending space, potentially increasing its liquidity and stability. Future roadmap for Bitwise and on-chain finance Looking ahead, Jonathan Man’s comments point to a dynamic roadmap. The expansion into other stablecoins like DAI or USDT seems a logical next step. It would diversify the vault’s base assets and tap into different borrower communities. More notably, the mention of RWA tokenization and DEX liquidity provision reveals a broader ambition. RWA strategies involve tokenizing real-world debt, like treasury bills or corporate bonds, on-chain. Providing DEX liquidity would involve supplying trading pairs to decentralized exchanges to earn fee revenue. These are more complex strategies than basic lending. The following table contrasts the initial vault strategy with potential future avenues: Strategy Asset Focus Primary Risk Yield Driver Current: Overcollateralized Lending USDC Smart contract, borrower liquidation Interest rates from borrowers Future: RWA Tokenization Tokenized real-world debt Off-chain counterparty, regulatory Interest from real-world assets Future: DEX Liquidity Various crypto asset pairs Impermanent loss, market volatility Trading fees from the exchange This phased approach allows Bitwise to build institutional comfort gradually. It starts with a relatively straightforward yield product before introducing more complex on-chain financial engineering. The success of this first vault will directly fund and justify these future explorations. Industry observers will closely monitor the vault’s uptake, yield performance, and any subsequent product announcements from Bitwise. Conclusion The launch of the Bitwise on-chain vault on the Morpho protocol is a landmark event in the convergence of traditional and decentralized finance. It provides a tangible, yield-generating product that leverages DeFi’s efficiency while adhering to institutional risk standards. By targeting a 6% yield through overcollateralized USDC lending, Bitwise offers a compelling value proposition. Furthermore, the stated future plans for RWA tokenization and DEX liquidity signal a deep, long-term commitment to the on-chain ecosystem. This Bitwise on-chain vault initiative, therefore, serves as both a practical investment vehicle and a strategic blueprint for the future of institutional participation in decentralized finance. FAQs Q1: What is the Bitwise on-chain vault? The Bitwise on-chain vault is a new decentralized finance (DeFi) product launched by asset manager Bitwise on the Morpho Blue protocol. It allows investors to deposit USDC into overcollateralized lending markets with the goal of earning a yield, currently targeted at up to 6%. Q2: How does the vault generate yield? The vault generates yield by lending deposited USDC to borrowers on the Morpho protocol. These borrowers must post crypto collateral worth more than the loan value (overcollateralization). The interest paid by these borrowers, after protocol fees, creates the yield for vault depositors. Q3: What are the main risks of using this vault? The primary risks include smart contract risk (bugs in the Morpho or vault code), the risk that borrowers’ collateral is liquidated at unfavorable prices, and the variable nature of the yield, which depends on borrowing demand. The vault uses overcollateralization to significantly reduce default risk. Q4: How is this different from a traditional savings account? Unlike a bank savings account, this is a non-custodial, on-chain product. The yield is determined by decentralized market forces, not a central bank. It also involves different risk profiles, including exposure to blockchain technology and crypto asset collateral, but aims to offer a potentially higher return. Q5: What does Bitwise plan to do next in DeFi? According to Bitwise’s Jonathan Man, the firm may expand the vault to support other stablecoins and crypto assets. They are also exploring future DeFi strategies like real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

Demand for artificial intelligence computing power has skyrocketed, compelling cloud providers to find a balance between energy efficiency and performance or costs. Microsoft positions Maia 200 against Nvidia’s dominance As a key component in Microsoft’s cloud computing and AI chip strategy, Microsoft’s new Maia 200 provides an alternative to Nvidia’s dominance within this realm. Microsoft is positioning the Maia 200 as competition against Nvidia’s superior processing power. Through the introduction of each chip series in the Maia family, Scott Guthrie, Microsoft’s executive VP of Cloud and AI, stated that the Maia 200 is “the most efficient inference system that Microsoft has ever built”. An analyst with experience in hyperscale environments stated that the development of the Maia chip was overdue. This analyst noted that Microsoft has taken this step because they need to have their own proprietary chip technology to keep their costs low when using large amounts of processing power, rather than continually renting resources from Nvidia. A cloud consultant has stated that “for the largest cloud providers to remain competitive in the current marketplace, they must develop custom chip technology.” The Cryptopolitan previously reported that the introduction of Azure Maia 100 and Cobalt 100 chips in 2023 marked the first step in Microsoft’s journey into AI semiconductor production. These chips were poised to play a pivotal role in enhancing the capabilities of Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing service. Looking ahead, Microsoft is actively developing follow-up versions of these chips, suggesting a commitment to staying at the forefront of AI and semiconductor technology. Targets efficiency and power in data centres The Maia 200 processor, which has been made using 3-nanometre technology from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is targeted at inference workloads. As more businesses look to implement AI technologies instead of training models, this has become a rapidly expanding market for companies like Maia. According to Microsoft, the Maia 200 has 30% better performance than other similar processors on the market and can process more high bandwidth memory than either Amazon’s or Google’s. The engineer from Microsoft stated that inference efficiency is where the profit margins are gained or lost for the cloud business. The lower power consumption of the Maia 200 will improve its profitability. This has been a result of collaboration with Arm, which has been pivotal in this venture. Arm’s commitment to enabling a smoother path in the development of customized silicon solutions has played a crucial role. The Arm Neoverse CSS and Arm Total Design ecosystems are central to these efforts, simplifying the complex task of delivering custom, specialized solutions for data centers and networking infrastructure. Using the Maia 200 in Microsoft’s superintelligence group, Microsoft 365 Copilot, and Foundry AI will enable Microsoft to reach out to its current and potential customers, as well as enhance its cloud services. Roll-out of the Maia 200 will begin in Microsoft’s US central data centres, followed by additional locations. An early software developer testing the Maia 200 stated that usage is a key factor in the Maia 200’s success, saying, “The ultimate test is whether it can enable the customers’-realistically-use-the-product-at-scale.” Join a premium crypto trading community free for 30 days - normally $100/mo.",Tech|MSFT,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-26 19:55:47

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-the-pressure-is-building-for-xrp-heres-what-happened/,"XRP has entered a tense phase where market psychology may outweigh price action. After years of consolidation, the digital asset shows signs of building pressure, and traders are watching closely for the next major move. Recent insights from a prominent crypto voice shed light on what this pressure means for holders and the broader market. In a video clip posted on X, Austin Hilton framed the situation as mounting “pressure” on XRP and all of crypto. Hilton said, “There is pressure building, and what this means to you and your XRP and what it means to me and what I’m going to do.” He explained that this pressure comes from prolonged consolidation and a shift in sentiment. Highlighting XRP’s extreme pessimism, Hilton noted, “XRP’s in extreme fear,” pointing to how retail sentiment has turned sharply negative. The pressure is building for XRP (and all of crypto)… pic.twitter.com/73GExguGNM — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) January 25, 2026 Extreme Fear and Market Psychology Hilton emphasized the impact of this sentiment: “ A lot of interest, sentiment has turned negative , people have left.” Traders’ caution has created a market environment dominated by fear, yet Hilton stressed that not all participants are abandoning ship. He reassured viewers, “I’m not leaving crypto, I’m not leaving XRP,” underscoring the commitment of long-term holders even amid widespread pessimism. Consolidation as Latent Energy Hilton used a vivid metaphor to describe the current market setup. He said, “The pressure is going to break loose. The pressure is going to turn bullish.” He likened XRP’s extended consolidation to a compressed spring accumulating kinetic energy. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Once released, this energy could drive a significant market move. Hilton also shared his personal approach: “Continue to buy a little bit here and there because again, I have that long-term bullish outlook.” Decision Time for Traders Hilton highlighted that each investor must choose their approach carefully. “You have to decide, are you going to leave? Are you going to stay, or do you think XRP is never going to do anything?” he said. His message frames the current market tension as both a challenge and an opportunity: those who hold or strategically accumulate may be positioned to benefit when this pressure finally releases. While the timing remains uncertain, Hilton’s perspective underscores a crucial truth: extended consolidation and extreme sentiment can precede powerful price movements. As he concluded, “The pressure is building,” signaling that XRP’s next chapter could be defined by a dramatic shift once the market’s latent energy is unleashed.

That person is Michael Burry. He is the investor known for betting against the U.S. housing market before the financial crisis. He disclosed that he has been buying GameStop shares again. The stock rose more than 6% after his comments became public. Michael said he has been buying GameStop recently and sees the price near 1x tangible book value and 1x net asset value. He shared this in a Substack post published Monday. He also pointed to Ryan Cohen running the company and using capital and cash flow over a long period. The message was simple. This was not a short-term trade and not a meme bet. Burry lays out a long-term value bet Michael recently shut down Scion Asset Management. He said this position is a long-term value play. He said it is not based on renewed meme stock action. GameStop became famous about five years ago during a retail trading frenzy. Online traders pushed prices higher and forced hedge funds to cover short positions. That period ended. Trading later calmed down, and speculation faded. Michael wrote, “I am not counting on a short squeeze to realize long-term value.” He added, “I believe in Ryan, I like the setup, the governance, the strategy as I see it.” He also said he is willing to hold the stock long-term and be patient. He noted that he is fifteen years older than Ryan and still prepared to wait. After the meme surge ended, GameStop gave back most of its gains. The stock later traded around $25 a share. Even so, the company used heavy investor interest in the past to raise billions of dollars through equity offerings. Those sales left GameStop with a large cash balance. Michael addressed that directly. He wrote , “Ryan is making lemonade out of lemons.” He added, “He has a crappy business, and he is milking it best he can while taking advantage of the meme stock phenomenon to raise cash and wait for an opportunity to make a big buy of a real growing cash cow business.” The video game retailer also started buying Bitcoin last year . The decision followed a similar approach taken by MicroStrategy, now known as Strategy. Ryan said the move was driven by macro concerns. He said bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized design could protect against certain risks. Michael reacted cautiously and wrote, “I do not know about this Bitcoin thing, but I cannot argue with what has been done so far.” Michael is not alone in backing the company. Just last week, Ryan bought 1 million shares of GameStop. The purchase was disclosed in a Jan. 21 SEC filing. In that filing, Ryan said it is “essential” for a public company CEO to buy shares with personal funds to strengthen alignment with stockholders. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

This surge in activity signals growing uncertainty, adding doubt to the bullish XRP price prediction that has dominated recent sentiment. Bearish pressure is intensifying after Donald Trump threatened a 100% tariff on Canadian goods if the country strikes a trade deal with China. While XRP briefly rebounded from $1.80 during the Asian session, broader market jitters continue to weigh heavily on price action. The Fear and Greed Index shows that sentiment has soured in the past couple of weeks as this key metric dropped sharply from a 54 reading on January 14 to 29 at the time of writing. Now, traders are wondering whether XRP is going to zero, so it’s time to take a look at the charts. XRP Price Prediction: 11% Downside Risk Ahead If This Happens XRP is currently retesting a key structural resistance at $1.90. This is the previous low of the dominant bearish structure, meaning that a bullish breakout will confirm a trend reversal. If the price rejects a move above this mark, it could rapidly drop to $1.80 and increase the risk of a move to lower levels. In that scenario, the most likely target, one that hasn’t been touched in months, would be the $1.60 area. Hence, even though a move to zero is highly unlikely, the current setup does favor a bearish outlook. Meanwhile, while major altcoins struggle to hold key levels, crypto presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) are heating up with strong momentum and early investor interest. This Ethereum-based meme coin channels the same viral energy that sent Dogecoin soaring in 2021, and could deliver a similar breakout as soon as its presale closes. Maxi Doge Presale Is Channeling the Early Dogecoin Energy That Once Drove 1000x Gains Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is a fast-rising meme coin presale that’s flashing many of the same signals that powered Dogecoin’s breakout in 2021. Instead of empty hype, the project is building a trader-first culture where momentum, community, and rewards come first. At the center is an active group of like-minded traders sharing setups, early opportunities, and wins as the market heats up again. Engagement is fueled through weekly competitions like Maxi Ripped and Maxi Gains, where traders showcase their biggest Ws and climb the leaderboard for rewards and bragging rights. On top of that, $MAXI offers staking rewards of 69% per year for early participants who lock in during the presale phase. For anyone who watched DOGE explode from the sidelines, Maxi Doge offers a second chance to get positioned early in a meme coin that’s gaining momentum by the week. To buy $MAXI and join the pump, simply head to the official Maxi Doge website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can swap USDT, USDC, or ETH, or use a bank card to secure tokens in just a few clicks.
