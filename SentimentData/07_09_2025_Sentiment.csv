51305025,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=800872,1757192100,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51305025.jpeg,Here’s Why Many Solana Supporters Are Now Diversifying Their Portfolios With High-Potential Altcoins Like Remittix,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/heres-why-many-solana-supporters-are-now-diversifying-their-portfolios-with-high-potential-altcoins-like-remittix/,"Solana’s recent strength has drawn attention, yet many holders are growing restless and seeking fresh opportunities. Remittix is capturing interest with its bold promise reinforced by a $250,000 giveaway and a Q3 wallet beta launch scheduled for September 15. That move signals a departure from mainstream Solana performance to sharper, utility-driven altcoins. As Solana maintains momentum, more of its community is pivoting to Remittix for a higher growth narrative and stronger monetization path. Solana Holds Strength but Faces Strategic Fatigue With ongoing upgrades and growing adoption, Solana continues to be a standout. The price of SOL is currently sitting at $206, having recovered from the $190 level, thanks to rising activity across DeFi platforms and NFTs. Despite this, the path to a breakout above $215 remains uncertain, raising concern over stagnation for traders craving acceleration. Smart money appears to be diversifying into assets with higher implied upside potential. This growing discomfort among Solana holders reflects a broader trend: loyalty to technical robustness, yes, but also a hunger for clearer monetization and unleashing speculative gains sooner rather than later. Remittix Stands Out Where Solana Momentum Taps Out Remittix has emerged as an alluring pivot for former Solana supporters chasing sharper returns. Solana’s upgrades and ETF outlook offer stability, yet Remittix introduces a focused PayFi utility, immediate product events and a defined growth trajectory. That contrast, with Solana delivering incremental upgrades and Remittix promising fast-moving infrastructure, makes Remittix compelling. Remittix has sold over 645 million tokens, is priced at $0.1030 and has raised upwards of $24 million. It earned its BitMart exchange listing after surpassing $20 million in funding and followed with LBANK at $22 million raised. Now, its third centralized exchange listing is in progress. That sequence offers clarity and rollout pace that Solana’s deeper ecosystem updates have not matched. Here are five reasons why Remittix draws capital that might otherwise stay with SOL: Send crypto directly to bank accounts in 30+ countries Wallet beta launches this quarter with multi-currency support Audited by CertiK, built with trust and transparency Deflationary tokenomics designed for long-term growth Time-sensitive entry point before listings and parabolic growth These traits underline Remittix’s focus, tangible PayFi utility, vetted security, institutional-friendly tokenomics and a launch schedule that beckons faster upside. It is not just another altcoin; it is structured for adoption, not speculation. Strategic Diversification Between SOL and Remittix Solana continues to command respect for its ecosystem, performance, and institutional appeal. Yet, a growing subsection of its holders is exploring alternatives like Remittix , drawn by its roadmap, incentives and monetisation clarity. For Solana supporters seeking sharper returns without sacrificing credibility, Remittix offers an impactful option.

From presale milestones and whale moves to ETF updates and new integrations, the strongest names are rising to the top. While some coins are consolidating near support zones, others are preparing for bigger rallies fueled by major developments. These trends define what makes the top crypto coins worth tracking this year. BlockDAG, XRP, ADA, and TRX are four names commanding attention. Each brings unique progress, from record presale numbers to growing adoption, regulatory clarity, and ecosystem expansion. Here’s why they are considered among the top crypto coins shaping the current cycle. 1. BlockDAG Secures the Lead BlockDAG has cemented itself as one of the standout stories of 2025 through the scale of its presale and the speed of its adoption. Currently in Batch 30 at $0.03, the project has already raised nearly $400 million and sold more than 25.9 billion coins. Those who joined in Batch 1 at just $0.001 are now sitting on gains of about 2,900%. In the final run-up to its BDAG Deployment Event in Singapore, BlockDAG has set the presale price at $0.0013. The confirmed $0.05 launch means holders at this stage are positioned for gains as high as 38x. The growth isn’t confined to presale numbers alone. More than 3 million people are actively mining BDAG through the X1 mobile app, making it one of the most widely adopted mining tools. At the same time, the X10 hardware miners are shipping across global markets, ensuring the ecosystem expands through both digital and physical channels. Large-scale commitments add another layer of strength. Two whale entries have each crossed $4.4 million and $4.3 million, heating up competition on the leaderboard and reinforcing confidence in the project’s scale. Upcoming milestones, including a September 4 AMA and a major sponsorship reveal, are expected to keep attention firmly on BlockDAG . By merging fundraising success, wide adoption, and strong whale activity, BlockDAG has firmly secured its position as a leading name among the top crypto coins for 2025. 2. XRP Targets Higher Levels XRP is trading around $2.98 after a brief pullback, holding support at $2.89 and facing resistance near $3.08–$3.20. Analysts note a bull-flag setup that could trigger an upward breakout if resistance is cleared. Futures activity on CME has surged past $1 billion in open interest, marking the fastest growth rate for a crypto contract. Clarity from Ripple’s resolved SEC case, where XRP was confirmed not to be a security, has restored confidence across global markets. Demand in South Korea has been particularly strong, with XRP trading at ₩3.25 locally. Forecasts vary, with some calling for $4 short term and long-term outlooks pointing toward $27. With rising futures activity and regional demand, XRP is cementing its place as one of the top crypto coins to watch. 3. ADA Builds Toward ETF Catalyst Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.87, posting a small gain despite overall market consolidation. The SEC delayed its decision on the Grayscale spot Cardano ETF to October 26, 2025, which is seen as a potential game-changer for ADA’s future flows. On-chain, Cardano continues to expand, with more than 2,006 projects in development and over 1.33 million delegated wallets. Whale accumulation has also increased, with 150 million ADA purchased recently, supporting a market cap of about $32 billion. Analysts are tracking a possible breakout toward $1.20 in the near term, with longer-term projections ranging from $2 to $4.83. Key events like the Cardano Summit in Berlin this November and the launch of the Techstars + Cardano Founder Catalyst pre-accelerator in October could further strengthen its outlook. With this combination of growth and anticipation, ADA remains among the top crypto coins in 2025. 4. TRX Expands Through Stablecoin Activity TRON (TRX) is trading near $0.347, moving within a daily range of $0.3446–$0.3514. Technical signals show consolidation, with the possibility of retesting $0.330 if resistance isn’t reclaimed. A recovery above $0.345, however, could push the coin toward $0.370 or higher. Despite the chart challenges, TRX has maintained an eight-week winning streak supported by strong whale engagement and dominant stablecoin settlements. Recent data highlights TRON’s momentum: the network processed $23.5 billion in daily USDT transfers compared to Ethereum’s $20 billion. MetaMask integration has also been introduced, reducing reliance on third-party bridges and expanding access. TRON has further strengthened its security with the launch of the Beacon Network alongside TRM Labs. A governance proposal to cut transaction fees is under review, signaling continued focus on adoption. If momentum holds, forecasts suggest TRX could climb toward $0.45–$0.50, securing its role as one of the top crypto coins for 2025. Final Thoughts BlockDAG, XRP, ADA, and TRX each bring a different advantage to the table. BlockDAG is setting records with nearly $400 million raised, over 25.9 billion coins sold, and millions of active miners. XRP is leveraging legal clarity and futures activity to strengthen its global presence. ADA is anchored by developer growth and the prospect of an ETF decision, while TRX is expanding its lead in stablecoin settlements and ecosystem upgrades. Together, these names highlight what defines the top crypto coins in 2025. Whether through presale momentum, regulatory clarity, technical adoption, or payment dominance, each demonstrates how multiple paths can create lasting influence in the months ahead.

According to the announcement, this comes as the platform prepares to return to the United States. Polymarket is Bent on Setting New Records Shayne Coplan, the CEO of Polymarket, noted that the platform has also received important support from regulators. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) decided not to take action on certain reporting and recordkeeping rules for event contracts. This decision followed a formal request from QCX, a group that supports clear regulations in decentralized finance (DeFi). It is also worth noting that the CFTC’s no-action letter is important for the platform as it re-enters the U.S. market, which it had left due to regulatory issues. Last month, Polymarket users created 13,800 new markets, beating the previous record of 11,800 set in July. The rise in market creation indicates a greater demand for decentralized forecasting tools and real-money betting on real-world outcomes. Polymarket Set to Hit $1 Billion Valuation In June, the leading decentralized prediction market platform nearly raised $200 million in new funding . As reported by TheCoinRise, the investment brought the company’s total value to $1 billion, marking a major milestone in its growth. Notably, the new funding round comes when the prediction market platforms started regaining attention. Last year’s U.S. presidential election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris brought a lot of excitement to Polymarket . Reportedly, millions of users placed bets on who would win. This new $200 million deal adds to Polymarket’s earlier funding rounds. Recall that last year, the platform also considered raising $50 million and was working on launching its own token , which users could use to settle their bets on the platform. With this deal, it means Polymarket has raised far more than one of its main competitors, Kalshi. Furthermore, Polymarket’s total funding would place it in a much stronger financial position within the prediction market space. Polymarket Strives Abroad After U.S. Regulatory Setback Polymarket enables users to predict events, ranging from politics and sports to economics and global news. The platform runs on blockchain technology, meaning all trades are secure, transparent, and peer-to-peer. However, Polymarket has had some trouble with U.S. regulators . In 2022, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission fined the company $1.4 million, forcing Polymarket to shut down some of its services in the United States. Now, most of its trading volume comes from users outside the country. Meanwhile, Thailand’s cybercrime investigation bureau is also looking to ban Polymarket , citing online gambling concerns.

While ETH holdings make up the majority of his wealth, Buterin's portfolio is also supplemented by various altcoins and crypto venture investments. Buterin's known wallets hold approximately 240,000 ETH, making his wealth heavily dependent on the price of Ethereum. With the price of ETH rising above $3,000 in 2021, 2024, and 2025, Buterin re-entered the billionaire list. However, due to fluctuations in the price of ETH, his wealth has occasionally dipped below $1 billion, but has since recovered. Among his assets outside of ETH, he stands out for his investments in projects like AAVE V3 WETH, MOODENG, and WHITE tokens, as well as StarkNet. Buterin's memecoin holdings consist of tokens gifted by developers. He also acquired half of the Shiba Inu (SHIB) supply from the developer in 2020, which at one point led to his fortune reaching $20 billion. Buterin has burned or donated most of these tokens. Buterin's wealth was shaped by his share of Ethereum's founding. A 16.5% stake was distributed to the founders during the 2014 ETH presale. Buterin's share of this share has helped him grow his crypto holdings. As the only founder to remain active in the project since Ethereum's official launch in 2015, he has played a critical role in the network's development.

While his stake in companies like StarkWare remains unclear, his contributions to leading projects in the industry are contributing to his net worth. As of today, Vitalik Buterin is the largest individual ETH holder on Ethereum. Wallets holding larger amounts of ETH are primarily controlled by exchanges and institutional funds. Buterin entered the crypto world in 2011 and paved the way for decentralized applications with the Ethereum Whitepaper he published in 2013. Ethereum's transition to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system in 2022 also took place under his leadership. *This is not investment advice.

This isn’t just another memecoin; it’s an Ethereum Layer 2 solution that has already blown past $1.8 million in its presale. Analysts are whispering about 70x gains by 2025. Could this be the next big crypto to truly shake things up, offering genuine utility where many meme tokens just offer hype? Layer Brett is the best-looking crypto for the future Forget the struggles that some significant cap altcoins, like SOL and PI, face. Layer Brett offers something genuinely different. We’re talking about lightning-fast transactions, often clocked at 10,000 TPS, with gas fees that drop to an almost unbelievable $0.0001. That kind of performance is a game-changer. For those weary of high Ethereum gas fees or the congestion seen on other chains, this Layer 2 blockchain is an absolute breath of fresh air. It’s also offering a mind-boggling 917% APY on staking. No wonder investors are flocking to this best crypto presale. Layer Brett is a next-generation memecoin, yes, but one fused with real blockchain utility, built directly on Ethereum’s Layer 2. Picture the vibrant energy of meme culture meeting the serious power of scalability. It’s Brett, but evolved, escaping the limitations of its original Base chain. This project aims to disrupt the entire meme token landscape. The magic happens through its Layer 2 architecture, which allows Layer Brett to process activity off-chain while still drawing on Ethereum’s rock-solid security. This means transactions are nearly instantaneous and incredibly inexpensive. Users can jump in, buy, and stake $LBRETT in mere seconds using ETH, USDT, or BNB through MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Plus, those early staking rewards? They are amplified due to the lower operating costs that this efficient Layer 2 crypto provides. It’s a sweet deal for early birds seeking a top-performing crypto. Solana price and Pi Network price prediction general SOL (Solana) burst onto the scene, promising speed and low transaction costs, aiming to rival Ethereum. It’s a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain, hosting a vast array of DeFi and NFT projects. Pi Network, on the other hand, is a more enigmatic project. It attempts to allow everyday users to “mine” cryptocurrency on their phones, though its mainnet launch and practical utility remain topics of intense debate and speculation. The Solana price has experienced its share of volatility, while the Pi Network continues to expand its community. While the Solana price has shown resilience, it, like many altcoins, faces market headwinds and occasionally experiences trading volume dips. The Pi Network price prediction remains theoretical, mainly due to its unlaunched mainnet and limited practical application. Both SOL and PI are established in their own ways, but they don’t offer the fresh, hyper-incentivized opportunity Layer Brett presents. Investors often seek out new crypto coins with explosive growth potential when larger projects consolidate. Layer Brett is the future With its unique blend of meme power and robust Ethereum Layer 2 technology, Layer Brett is positioned for truly significant growth. The current presale price, coupled with that jaw-dropping 917% APY staking, suggests immense upside. $LBRETT could easily be a next 100x altcoin, even a next 100x meme coin, during the upcoming crypto bull run in 2025. It has a much smaller market cap than SOL or PI, creating a wider runway for astronomical gains. This is why it’s considered the best long-term crypto by many discerning investors right now. Get ready to connect your wallet, buy $LBRETT, and stake for those eye-watering rewards. This is the best crypto to buy now, and it won’t be in presale forever.

However, the premier cryptocurrency’s progress hit a stumbling block following the release of weaker-than-expected United States payrolls data on Friday, September 5. Despite the bearish pressure triggered by the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) release, the price of Bitcoin managed to stay above the psychological $110,000 level. Interestingly, the latest analysis suggests that the latest job data could guide the Bitcoin price to a new high. Macro Shift To Kickstart Next BTC Price Rally? In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, market analysis firm XWIN Research Japan explained how weak labor data in the US could see the Bitcoin price embark on its next bullish wave. According to the analytics firm, history shows a paradox despite rising unemployment often linked to weak performances by risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Nears Its Climax: Cycle Peak Indicates 95% Completion XWIN mentioned that on-chain stablecoin data offers insight into how this “macro story” could unfold, especially in relation to the cryptocurrency market. The crypto trading firm then highlighted two “distinct waves of activity” that establish the connection between unemployment and crypto market positioning. In the first wave (between late 2024 and early 2025), investors expected the Federal Reserve (Fed) to cut interest rates as the labor market weakness first emerged. Capital flowed into exchanges with the surge in stablecoin reserves from $30 billion to $50 billion, showing the investors’ preparedness for a macroeconomic shift. The second wave (from mid-2025 to present) has seen unemployment rising again. Similarly, stablecoin exchange reserves recently hit $58.5 billion, while depositing addresses have frequently surpassed 30,000 BTC, with highs near 40,000 BTC. “This isn’t just accumulation—it reflects broader participation, from whales to retail, mobilizing funds in anticipation of easier policy,” XWIN added. According to XWIN, the thinking is that the rising unemployment in the United States could be linked to stronger expectations of Fed rate cuts. With more capital stored in stablecoins on exchanges, ready to buy more coins, the weak jobs data could be the foundation for a fresh rally for Bitcoin. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $110,780, reflecting no significant changes in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the market leader is up by almost 3% in the last seven days.

Imagine a world where AI doesn’t just generate text or images, but resurrects lost cinematic masterpieces, challenging our very understanding of authorship and intellectual property. This isn’t a scene from a sci-fi film; it’s the audacious reality unfolding with Fable, an Amazon-backed AI startup, and its controversial plan to digitally reconstruct Orson Welles’ ‘The Magnificent Ambersons’. For anyone tracking the intersection of technology and creative industries, especially within the crypto and digital asset space, this development raises profound questions about ownership, authenticity, and the very soul of art in the age of advanced AI filmmaking . What is Fable AI and Its Ambitious Vision? On the surface, Fable AI presents itself as a pioneering force, often dubbed the ‘Netflix of AI.’ This ambitious startup, which recently secured significant funding from the Amazon Alexa Fund , aims to democratize content creation through artificial intelligence. Their core platform empowers users to craft their own animated stories using intuitive AI prompts, effectively putting a virtual animation studio at their fingertips. While currently focusing on its own intellectual property, Fable has openly expressed aspirations to extend these capabilities to established Hollywood IP, a move that has already seen it used to generate unauthorized ‘South Park’ episodes. The company’s latest innovation is a powerful new Generative AI model designed to produce long, complex narratives. This is where the story takes an intriguing turn, moving from cartoon creation to the ambitious task of cinematic resurrection. Fable’s technological prowess lies in its ability to understand and extend storylines, generate characters, and even simulate visual styles, making it a formidable player in the emerging field of AI-driven content creation. The Audacious Plan: Resurrecting Orson Welles’ ‘The Magnificent Ambersons’ The specific project causing a stir involves filmmaker Brian Rose, who has already dedicated five years to digitally reconstructing the lost 43 minutes of Orson Welles ‘ 1942 classic, ‘The Magnificent Ambersons.’ Rose now plans to leverage Fable’s advanced AI model over the next two years to complete this digital resurrection. But why ‘Ambersons’? For many, it might seem like an obscure choice, overshadowed by Welles’ more famous work, ‘Citizen Kane.’ However, among cinephiles, ‘The Magnificent Ambersons’ holds a special, tragic place as a lost masterpiece, severely truncated and altered by the studio after Welles was removed from the project. The film’s reputation as a ‘what could have been’ fuels the fascination. It’s a testament to Welles’ genius, even in its compromised form, and the destruction of his original vision remains a poignant moment in film history. Rose, in his statement, lamented the loss of a ‘four-minute-long, unbroken moving camera shot whose loss is a tragedy,’ with only 50 seconds remaining in the studio-recut version. This sense of profound loss is presumably what drew Fable and Rose to this particular project, seeing it as an ultimate test of AI filmmaking ‘s potential. Ethical Minefield: The Orson Welles Estate and Intellectual Property in Generative AI Herein lies the project’s most significant controversy: Fable has not obtained the rights to ‘The Magnificent Ambersons,’ nor has it consulted with the estate of Orson Welles . This omission has drawn sharp criticism from David Reeder, who manages the estate for Welles’ daughter, Beatrice. Reeder vehemently described the project as an ‘attempt to generate publicity on the back of Welles’ creative genius,’ asserting that it would amount to nothing more than ‘a purely mechanical exercise without any of the uniquely innovative thinking [of] a creative force like Welles.’ The estate’s reaction highlights a critical dilemma in the age of Generative AI : the clash between technological capability and artistic rights. While Reeder expressed less anger over the idea of recreation itself, he was deeply offended by the lack of ‘even the courtesy of a heads up.’ Interestingly, the estate itself has ’embraced AI technology to create a voice model intended to be used for VO work with brands,’ indicating a pragmatic openness to AI when handled respectfully and with proper authorization. This distinction is crucial: the estate acknowledges AI’s potential but insists on ethical engagement and proper compensation. The situation with Fable and the Welles estate underscores the urgent need for clear guidelines and legal frameworks governing the use of AI in creative endeavors, particularly concerning existing intellectual property. Without such frameworks, the line between innovation and infringement becomes dangerously blurred, setting a precedent that could destabilize entire creative industries. AI Filmmaking: A Double-Edged Sword for Creativity The Fable project forces us to confront the profound implications of AI filmmaking . On one hand, the technology offers tantalizing possibilities: Reviving Lost Works: The potential to reconstruct films, music, or literature lost to time or censorship. Democratizing Creation: Lowering barriers for aspiring filmmakers and artists to create complex narratives. New Storytelling Forms: Enabling interactive or dynamically generated content that adapts to viewers. However, the challenges and ethical quandaries are equally significant: Authenticity vs. Recreation: Can an AI truly recreate an artist’s vision, or does it merely produce a convincing imitation? The author of the original article aptly notes, ‘this is a tragedy that AI cannot undo.’ Artistic Intent: Without the original creator’s guidance, how can AI accurately interpret and extend their artistic intent? Intellectual Property: The Fable case exemplifies the legal quagmire when AI operates without proper rights, raising questions of ownership and fair use. The ‘Frankenstein’ Effect: As the original piece points out, using AI to swap faces onto new actors creates ‘Frankensteined replicas,’ which might lack the soul of the original performances. Historically, filmmakers have attempted to ‘fix’ or finish Welles’ movies, but these efforts typically involved using footage he himself had shot. Fable’s approach, described as a hybrid of AI and traditional filmmaking (reshooting scenes with contemporary actors and then face-swapping), goes a step further, entering entirely new territory. It’s a fascinating technical demonstration, but as Reeder suggests, it risks being ‘a purely mechanical exercise’ divorced from the human genius that defined Welles’ work. Beyond Hollywood: Generative AI’s Impact on Digital Assets and Events like Bitcoin World Disrupt 2025 The debate surrounding Fable AI extends far beyond the confines of Hollywood, resonating deeply within the broader tech and digital asset communities. The innovations in Generative AI are not just about film; they are reshaping how we perceive digital ownership, content creation, and even the value of unique artistic expressions. Events like Bitcoin World Disrupt 2025 serve as crucial platforms where such cutting-edge developments are dissected and discussed by industry heavyweights. Imagine the insights from leaders at Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, and Elad Gil, all slated to speak at Disrupt 2025. Their discussions will undoubtedly touch upon how AI is transforming media, investment, and the very fabric of startup growth. For those immersed in cryptocurrency and blockchain, the Fable scenario offers a preview of challenges related to provenance and intellectual property that Web3 technologies aim to address. How will NFTs and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) play a role in authenticating and compensating creators for AI-generated or AI-assisted works in the future? The 20th anniversary of Bitcoin World Disrupt promises to be a melting pot of ideas, where the future of tech, including AI’s role in creative industries and its intersection with digital assets, will be sharply defined. Learning from these top voices is crucial for anyone looking to sharpen their edge in this rapidly evolving landscape. Don’t miss the opportunity to gain insights into how technologies like Generative AI are shaping not just entertainment, but the entire digital economy. The Future of Storytelling: Who Owns the Narrative? Ultimately, Fable’s ambitious project with Orson Welles ‘ ‘The Magnificent Ambersons’ is more than just a tech demo; it’s a litmus test for the future of creative industries. It forces us to ask fundamental questions about the nature of art, the rights of creators, and the role of technology. While filmmaker Brian Rose seems genuinely motivated by a desire to honor Welles’ vision, the path chosen – without rights or estate consultation – undermines that very intention. The promise of AI filmmaking is immense, offering unprecedented tools for creativity and preservation. However, its ethical implementation will define its true legacy. If AI is to truly serve art, it must do so with respect for authorship, intellectual property, and the human element that imbues art with its profound meaning. Otherwise, we risk creating technically perfect but emotionally hollow imitations, forever chasing a ghost that technology, for all its power, cannot truly bring back.

DOGE Hovers Around $0.21 as Smart Investors Choose This Under-$0.035 DeFi Crypto,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/why-is-dogecoin-down-today-doge-hovers-around-0-21-as-smart-investors-choose-this-under-0-035-defi-crypto/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently falling, trading close to $0.21. This comes as the overall crypto market is uncertain and investors are unsure about where DOGE might go next. Because of this, investors are shifting their interest towards upcoming protocols in DeFi such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , an up-and-coming player valued at $0.035. MUTM is in the sixth presale level and missing an entry here will mean paying 14.28% more when phase 7 comes along. Over $15.45 million has been raised so far and the project has already registered over 16,100 investors. As liquidity flows and risk-on capital seek utility-oriented applications, the focus is quietly shifting off the better-known names such as Dogecoin and onto emerging DeFi coins, possibly paving the way to a new phase of decentralized finance development. Dogecoin Liquefies as Wider Market Swings Play out Dogecoin price has slipped over the last week, now just above $0.20. DOGE has seen mild price swings over the last 24h. This recent dip is part of a broader change in market sentiment and is influenced by technical factors such as resistance levels and low activity from large investors. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance is getting a lot of attention in this changing market. Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance is allowing investors to buy in cheap while the project is still in its early stage. It is currently priced at $0.035, but will go higher to $0.04 in an upcoming phase 7 of token sale. There is also a very high interest in investment and the amount of funds raised has surpassed $15.45 million and the number of individuals holding tokens has surpassed over 16,100. This makes MUTM one of the most qualified within the market of DeFi. $50,000 Bug Bounty Program As the presale progresses, MUTM has launched a new initiative where, users of the project can share in a $50,000 USDT pool for identifying bugs within the platform. The $50k reward will cover four different weak areas. These include: critical, major, minor, and low. The initiative is already live and anyone can participate. Dual-Lending, Bending The dual-lending frame of the project is a hybrid of the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. Since P2C is actively studying the market environment to pay interest, one can borrow at a reasonable rate and guarantee that the investors can be paid interest through smart contracts. P2P offers direct lending and borrowing without an intermediary and is highly decentralized, a feature particularly useful to risky assets such as meme coins. Infrastructure and Price Discovery The project relies on Chainlink to obtain the correct price in the market and ties it to the price of USD and tokens such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Other tools such as fallback oracles, aggregated feeds and in-chain metrics can assist in offering reliable and timely prices to manage collateral and undertake liquidations. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has grown into a key player this cycle. Expert analysis show DOGE could soon slip below $0.20 as bears take control. Buying MUTM today means getting into the project at the lowest price it will ever be, while waiting until the next phase, means buying in over 14% higher. The project has already collected more than $15.45M and received 16,100+ investors, which indicates a good movement. MUTM is utility-oriented with a $100K giveaway, a $50K CertiK bug bounty, and powerful oracle-driven price discovery. Stage 6 price is currently lower than it will be after the additional presale.

In 2025, fund managers are increasingly applying that same label to cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, Cardano (ADA), and Chainlink (LINK) are now frequently described as “digital blue chips,” reflecting their maturity, utility, and resilience across multiple cycles. Analysts argue that this recognition is a sign of how far crypto has come, moving from speculative fringe to mainstream allocation. Alongside these established assets, discussions also touch on cultural-driven plays with unusual credibility, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE , which is drawing early interest as a high-beta complement to the blue chip core. Bitcoin: the foundation of digital finance Bitcoin remains the most secure, recognized, and widely adopted cryptocurrency. With ETF inflows surpassing $20 billion in 2025 and adoption growing among sovereign wealth funds, its role as “digital gold” is cemented. Its scarcity and decentralization make it the anchor of every institutional crypto portfolio. While its multiples may be smaller than in early cycles, its reliability and recognition make it the quintessential blue chip. ADA: governance and sustainability Cardano has emerged as a long-term project with an emphasis on research and governance. Its Voltaire upgrade is introducing on-chain voting and treasury management, giving ADA holders direct influence over the network’s future. This governance-first approach appeals to institutions looking for projects that can withstand regulatory scrutiny. Cardano’s steady growth and commitment to sustainability strengthen its claim as a digital blue chip alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. LINK: the oracle powerhouse Chainlink’s role as the leading decentralized oracle network makes it indispensable for DeFi and beyond. By connecting blockchains to real-world data, LINK powers smart contracts in finance, insurance, and supply chains. With institutional partnerships expanding and more networks integrating its services, Chainlink has cemented its reputation as critical infrastructure. Fund managers now see LINK as one of the safest bets among altcoins, given its unique and defensible use case. Fund managers are quick to point out that portfolios often balance stability with growth. While Bitcoin, ADA, and LINK represent the “blue chip” core, analysts highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the most aggressive high-beta plays of 2025 . Passed audits from CertiK and HashEx add a level of credibility rare in cultural-driven tokens. Combined with its deflationary tokenomics and surging community growth , forecasts call for up to 55x upside before major listings . The PATRIOT50X bonus code has also amplified demand, giving early adopters a 50% boost in allocations. Analysts argue this mix of credibility and hype makes MAGACOIN FINANCE a perfect complement to digital blue chips: while the core provides resilience, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers asymmetric upside that can transform portfolio returns. Why fund managers mix core and growth In traditional investing, blue chips anchor portfolios, while growth stocks provide potential for higher returns. The same principle is increasingly applied to crypto. Bitcoin, ADA, and LINK deliver security and trust, while projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE bring innovation and volatility. Fund managers stress that the combination allows them to manage risk while staying positioned for exponential growth if emerging narratives explode. Conclusion Bitcoin, ADA, and LINK have earned their reputations as digital blue chips, cementing their place in institutional portfolios. Yet, even the most conservative managers recognize the need for higher-beta assets. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its rare mix of audits, scarcity, and cultural firepower, is being framed as that complement – the growth play to balance the blue chip core. For investors, combining both strategies could define success in the next market cycle.

51307126,https://timestabloid.com/?p=82110,1757196044,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Bitcoin to $135K, Dogecoin to $1 and MAGACOIN FINANCE Set to Explode",https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-to-135k-dogecoin-to-1-and-magacoin-finance-set/,"Bitcoin’s one-year chart shows a steady grind higher, reclaiming the $110k area and keeping bulls in control. With ETF demand absorbing new supply and miners selling less post-halving, traders are mapping the next major target at $135k . If spot ETF inflows remain positive and macro data stays friendly, that level becomes a reasonable stretch before the cycle cools. Dogecoin, meanwhile, is holding a broad range near the $0.20 zone while liquidity improves. The community’s long-standing $1 goal is back in conversation as on-chain activity rises and derivatives funding normalizes. Historically, DOGE’s biggest moves have arrived late in bull phases, which is why some traders are preparing for a momentum push if Bitcoin breaks into new highs again. As capital looks for higher multiples beyond large caps, attention is turning to smaller, earlier-stage plays that could deliver outsized returns. That’s where a growing number of retail traders and some crypto funds say they’re hunting for asymmetric upside. Bitcoin’s Route to $135k For BTC, the setup is simple: steady ETF inflows, thinning exchange balances, and resilient risk appetite. A weekly close above the recent local high would open room toward the mid-$120k area; from there, momentum and positive funding could carry price into the $135k magnet. Key risks are a hot inflation print or risk-off equities, either of which could stall the move and force a retest toward the low-$100k band. Can Dogecoin Really Reach $1? DOGE tends to run when retail participation spikes. If Bitcoin refreshes all-time highs, liquidity usually spills into high-beta names. A clean break above $0.30 would strengthen the argument for a stair-step advance toward $0.50 and, in a euphoric tape, a shot at $1. The bear case remains a failure to clear resistance with volumes fading, which would keep the range intact. The MAGACOIN FINANCE angle Early-stage capital is also chasing what they see as the cycle’s next breakout. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been drawing that crowd with a mix of scarcity and utility: limited early allocations, simple tokenomics, and a roadmap built around expanding real-world use. Community growth has accelerated, and multiple rounds have filled fast. The combined pitch is clear: early access is limited , the community is swelling, and upside projections from supporters point to potential 45x-style returns if adoption keeps building. In plain terms, some investors believe a small stake today could scale meaningfully if the project lands its next milestones. What Could Keep BTC and DOGE Moving Macro remains the biggest tailwind – cooling inflation and easier liquidity keep risk assets bid. On the crypto side, product expansion matters: more brokerages adding ETFs, new payments integrations, and healthy derivatives structure (no overheated funding) all help. Watch for sustained ETF net inflows, rising stablecoin supplies, and higher spot volumes; that trio has preceded most major legs up this cycle. Bottom Line Bitcoin has a credible path toward $135k if inflows stay firm, and Dogecoin’s $1 dream lives on whenever liquidity rotates to high-beta. At the same time, investors chasing bigger multiples are scanning earlier-stage opportunities in the middle of the market – where MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a talking point thanks to its fast-filling rounds, expanding community, and limited early access with high-upside potential .

This new contender, a next-generation Layer 2 crypto, isn’t just riding the wave of meme coin madness; it’s building a whole new one. With its presale already smashing past $2.8 million and early stakers eyeing a mind-boggling 917% APY, could Layer Brett be the low-cap crypto gem poised for a 5x surge this very weekend? Layer Brett offers genuine blockchain utility Let’s be real for a moment. Most meme coins, from the omnipresent Shiba Inu to the wildly popular Pepe, or even the original Brett, are purely driven by community hype and little else. They’re fun, absolutely, but they rarely offer genuine blockchain utility. Layer Brett changes the game. This isn’t just another trending cryptocurrency; it’s a Layer 2 blockchain solution, bringing real speed and ultra-low gas fees to the Ethereum ecosystem. Unlike Bonk or Dogecoin, which rely primarily on cultural relevance, Layer Brett is about substance. It offers a tangible escape from the slow, expensive confines of Ethereum Layer 1, providing a robust platform where meme energy meets cutting-edge technology. Layer Brett is a pioneering Layer 2 memecoin built right on Ethereum, designed to fuse viral meme culture with actual blockchain utility. Think about it: a meme coin that actually does something. It’s a community-first project, leveraging the power of memes while delivering real-world blockchain scalability. Layer Brett’s unique features boost long-term potential Near-instantaneous transactions, gas fees cut down to mere pennies (compared to the $10-$20 fees often seen on Ethereum Layer 1), and a significantly smoother experience. It is powered by the safest smart contract blockchain that is known, and it is swift, inexpensive, and scalable beyond imagination. Users can access those high-yield Layer 2-powered rewards within just a few seconds by purchasing and staking $LBRETT with either ETH, USDT, or BNB using MetaMask or Trust Wallet and tapping into such high-yield rewards. In addition, Layer Brett intends to be fully interoperable and bridged out of the restrictions inherent in projects such as the original Brett. Conventional meme coins, including Shiba Inu, Pepe, Dogecoin, and Bonk, are usually the result of an internet joke or viral phenomenon. Their value is primarily a result of speculation and hype within the community, rather than technological innovation or utility. Their explosive growth potential is inviting, but their long-term sustainability is often unpredictable without a clearly established development plan or an appealing business case. The original Brett token on Base, for example, gained traction but lacked the utility that Layer Brett now brings. Layer Brett is a powerful contender for the next big crypto in the upcoming 2025 crypto bull run The crypto market is notoriously volatile. While the Ethereum price prediction can pump spectacularly, bearish pressure remains. Shiba Inu and Pepe have both seen incredible surges, followed by corrections. These assets, though popular, often lack the fundamental utility that provides a strong floor during bearish cycles. With 917% APY staking rewards, a $1 million giveaway planned, and a capped supply of 10 billion tokens, $LBRETT is engineered for explosive gains. This isn’t just another meme token; it’s the best crypto presale, offering a unique blend of fun and functionality that makes it a powerful contender for the next big crypto in the upcoming 2025 crypto bull run and could outperform all Ethereum price prediction models. Layer Brett is still in its presale stages, offering early-entry pricing, but not for long. Don’t miss the opportunity to get in early on the most scalable meme project to ever launch on Ethereum. Brett has broken free, building his own future.

The hourly price chart confirms that bears are making efforts to prevent the Manta price from an immediate surge. However, if the Manta price successfully breaks above $0.204, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.218. MANTAUSD Price Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Manta’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.1869, resulting in a correction to $0.1789. Is MANTA a good investment? Manta’s rapid rise in DeFi TVL charts and alignment with Ethereum ‘s scaling roadmap via technologies like Manta Pacific suggest $MANTA’s potential. Grants support its ecosystem growth, and it leads in ZK technology adoption, promising for blockchain ‘s future. However, regulatory concerns over transaction privacy could affect its long-term viability, potentially impacting ZK protocols like $MANTA. Overall, Manta is a good investment if you want a profitable return in the long term. Why is the Manta price down today? Manta price triggered minor selling pressure after sellers strongly defended $0.2 level. This plunged the price below immediate Fib levels. Will Manta price recover? If bulls hold the price above $0.2, we might see further recovery toward immediate resistance channels. Will Manta price reach $10? In recent months, the Manta network expanded its offerings and established multiple partnerships. If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $10 mark. Will Manta reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment, the MNT price might take several years to reach the $100 milestone. We expect the Manta price to achieve $100 by 2060. Will Manta reach $1000? $1000 is a distant dream for Manta price. However, if everything remains in favor of the altcoin market, we might even see the MNT price hitting $1K. Is Manta a good long-term investment? Investors are bullish on Manta, which has gained significant attention in recent months. If developers continue to build robust utilities for Manta and the roadmap fulfills user demand, it can be a good long-term investment option.

Bitcoin seems to have hit a stable level with institutional investors intervening at key levels. At the same time, altcoins such as Polkadot (DOT) and Cronos (CRO) are emerging as breakout leaders . Analysts are also citing MAGACOIN FINANCE as a retail favorite that is FOMO triggered while marking it as one of the top altcoins to buy in 2025 . Bitcoin Price Prediction: $150K Still in Play Notably, Bitcoin price has been trading sideways between support at $108,000 and resistance at $123,000. Usually, as soon as BTC dips down to $108K, buyers act and form a support for a new upward move. On the other side, the $123K level has been serving as a ceiling which is capping the market for the moment. This price action usually occurs before a larger breakout. According to Fibonacci analysis, the next level is at $135,000 and it can be extended to $150,000 in case momentum is maintained. A daily close above $123K would confirm the bullish setup, and drop below $108K would trigger a pullback near $100K. Despite the short-term sentiment, the long-term outlook is still bullish. Institutional investors have continued to accumulate and the repeated support at $108K indicates hands that are firmly invested in holding higher levels. On the social media front, some of the big predictions are going around again, with some calling for Bitcoin to reach $1 million, including on Twitter from Andrew Tate. While those more extreme predictions catch people’s eye, most analysts are sticking to a more realistic projection of $150K as the peak of the current cycle. Polkadot (DOT): Strong Trading Range Coming Polkadot is one of the best altcoins that are catching up on the coattails of Bitcoin. Analysts estimate DOT will trade between $4.01 and $13.90 this year. With its focus on interoperability and strong developer activity, it has the potential to make bigger moves if altseason gains momentum. Meanwhile, DOT is expanding its ecosystem with the introduction of parachains, setting the stage for further adoption. With the current price still below $10, it is considered a potential gem for investors currently exploring mid-cap altcoin opportunities with greater upside potential. Cronos (CRO): Growth, Exchange Supported Cronos, the native token of Crypto.com, is another altcoin analysts see as a breakout contender. Price projections for 2025 vary widely from $0.072 to $0.76. On the other hand, more conservative models, such as DigitalCoinPrice, expect CRO to trade closer to $0.18 next year. CRO’s key features include its exchange-driven ecosystem, staking integration, and payment integrations. As the exchange activity intensifies during bull cycles, tokens such as CRO tend to experience liquidity and user adoption boosts. At its present price range, it is considered one of the more affordable altcoins with good recovery potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Best Altcoins to Buy and FOMO Play Alongside Bitcoin, DOT and CRO, MAGACOIN FINANCE is swiftly making a name for itself as one of the top altcoins to buy in 2025. One of the reasons behind its popularity is its emphasis on trust – MAGACOIN FINANCE has undergone two audits by HashEx and CertiK, confirming that its Ethereum-based smart contract is secure and transparent. On top of that, its development team is KYC-verified, providing a degree of confidence to investors not seen in many early-stage projects. Retail FOMO has been further fuelled by the fast-moving presale and security first approach. Analysts say this combination of meme energy and verified safety makes it a standout among the smaller-cap altcoins as a high-upside candidate for the next altseason. Final Take As long as the $108K support remains intact, Bitcoin’s trajectory towards $150,000 could be within reach. DOT and CRO are also making it to the list of breakout altcoins, with forecasts indicating steady growth and strong upside potential in 2025. For those investors who prefer early-stage opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE brings another flavor – retail energy, audited security, and rapid growth. As FOMO grows, analysts say it’s one of the most exciting small-cap plays to watch alongside the market’s established breakout leaders.

Back then, ETH surged from under $10 to nearly $1,400 in just over a year. Today, conditions are aligning for another explosive rally, with price projections placing ETH as high as $12,000 before the cycle ends. The catalysts include ETF speculation, institutional adoption of tokenized assets, and Ethereum’s dominant position in decentralized finance. These factors are giving investors a sense of déjà vu, as ETH appears poised to repeat its history of exponential growth. Alongside ETH’s outlook, smaller tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are capturing early-stage investor attention with ROI projections that echo the earliest days of Ethereum itself. Ethereum’s Growing Institutional Base Ethereum is now firmly on the radar of institutions. From JPMorgan to BlackRock, major financial players are exploring Ethereum for settlement, tokenization, and DeFi products. If Ethereum ETFs gain approval in the coming months, analysts believe it could unlock billions in inflows, propelling ETH’s price closer to $10,000 in a relatively short time. Tokenization and DeFi as Growth Engines The rise of tokenized treasuries, corporate bonds, and real estate is strengthening Ethereum’s role as the go-to blockchain for institutional finance. Combined with its established dominance in DeFi protocols, this dual engine of growth sets the stage for ETH’s valuation to surge beyond $12,000 during peak cycle momentum. Second-Chance Opportunity While Ethereum’s long-term story is undeniable, smaller-cap projects are stealing headlines for their short-term ROI potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been compared to early Ethereum for its disruptive potential. For investors who missed Bitcoin and Ethereum early — this is the second chance. With scalability-focused tokenomics and exchange listings expected soon, forecasts suggest MAGACOIN FINANCE could become one of the standout winners of 2025. ETH Price Scenarios Bullish case: ETH hits $12,000 as ETFs are approved and tokenization demand accelerates. Base case: ETH trades between $5,000–$7,000, sustained by steady institutional flows. Bearish case: ETH stalls below $4,500 if regulatory hurdles delay ETF approvals. Conclusion Ethereum’s setup in 2025 mirrors the conditions that fueled its legendary 2017 run, giving analysts confidence in bold price targets. While ETH’s climb toward $12,000 remains a best-case scenario, the foundations for major growth are already in place. For those seeking exponential returns, presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE offer a high-risk, high-reward complement to large-cap holdings. Together, they highlight the dual opportunity of stability and speculation in the current crypto cycle.

Unfortunately, this rollercoaster continues to produce two dangerous tendencies in traders: Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) and panic selling. Both can turn winning portfolios into costly mistakes. While the broader market is showing signs of slowing momentum, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE have managed to keep investor attention strong, raising $13 million in record time during its presale phase. The Trap of FOMO FOMO occurs when investors overwhelm themselves into a project simply because it’s pumping. For example, the token might have rallied 50% in one day or the influencer might have hyped a moonshot, encouraging traders to rush into the token at inflated levels. But most of the time, these late entries occur just before a correction, which leaves buyers stuck on top of the market. Why Panic Selling Hurts On the other side, panic selling is when prices go down and investors try to leave, at a loss, as quickly as possible. While a 20% drop or higher from a portfolio can and often does take place within just a few hours, the natural volatility of crypto can often turn into a polar night rather than the actual end of the world. Those that sell at the bottom miss out on the rebound that eventually happens. The Altcoin That Proves the Bull Market is not Dead Amid this backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a project that stands defiantly against the fear-driven mindset of the broader market. Its $13 million presale success in record time highlights how strong tokenomics and a growing community can create confidence even when other assets struggle. Now many analysts compare its early days to those of several altcoins that went on to skyrocket, leading those who got involved early on to potentially reap life-changing gains. Helpful Crypto Tips on Staying Calm To avoid getting excessively bullish or bearish, traders can embrace behaviors that impose discipline and remove emotional triggers: Have a proper plan : Decide your entering and exit points before buying. Dollar cost averaging (DCA): Invest systematically over time and smooth out volatility. Do Your Own Research: Only consider investments you understand and believe in. Automate decisions: Reduce emotion by utilizing stop-loss and take-profit features. Zoom out: The longer-term trend can be seen by looking at weekly or yearly charts. Step away from noise: Minimize exposure to hype-driven social media Invest sensibly: Only put in more than you can afford to lose. Final Thoughts Crypto success is rarely a matter of timing every move perfectly. It is a game of patience, tactics, and holding your emotions in check. By not succumbing to FOMO or panic selling, investors can remain confident while riding through the volatility. And as seen with the success of the MAGACOIN FINANCE presale, there are opportunities available for those who remain disciplined and focus on projects with strong fundamentals.

BTC Treasury Companies: Interesting 1:4 Ratio Pops Up,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-vs-btc-treasury-companies-interesting-14-ratio-pops-up/,"Bitcoin has held up strongly compared to the companies that have adopted it as part of their treasury strategy, but the gap between the digital asset and these firms is becoming more pronounced. Over the last 10 weeks, stocks of Bitcoin Treasury Companies (BTCTCs) have fallen sharply, shedding between 50% and 80% of their value. This divergence shows an unusual pattern, effectively creating a “1:4 ratio” in cycle behavior. Related Reading: MemeCore Explodes 3,800% For ATH — But Is A Collapse Around The Corner? 12 Mini-Bear Markets In 18 Months Bitcoin’s price action in the past 18 months has mostly been in a bullish cycle on the macro end, with the leading cryptocurrency creating new price highs upon new price highs within this period. This has caused an increase in many companies adopting a Bitcoin treasury strategy in their balance books, also known as Bitcoin Treasury Companies (BTCTCs). However, according to data from crypto commentator Mark Moss, the stock prices of companies with a Bitcoin strategy have diverged from Bitcoin, shedding between 50% and 80% of their stock value over the last ten weeks. This divergence, Moss noted, shows an unusual 1:4 cycle ratio where corporate Bitcoin holders undergo four mini-cycles for every one Bitcoin market cycle. The Japanese firm MetaPlanet is the prime case study for this occurrence. Over the last 18 months, its stock ($MTPLF) has gone through 12 distinct drawdowns, ranging from sharp single-day plunges to prolonged declines stretching over months. On average, these downturns erased 32.4% of value and lasted about 20 days. The shortest correction was a brutal one-day slide of 22.2% in April 2024, while the longest and deepest crash lasted 119 days from July to November 2024, wiping out 78.6%. The chart below, of MetaPlanet’s stock, shows repeated selloff cycles that appear far more compressed and extreme than Bitcoin’s price corrections in the past 18 months or so. MetaPlanet Stock Price: Mark Moss on X Correlation With Bitcoin? Interestingly, only 41.7% of MetaPlanet’s drawdowns have directly lined up with Bitcoin’s corrections. Out of the 12 mini-bear markets identified, just 5 occurred in sync with BTC’s declines. The majority (7 out of 12) were unrelated to Bitcoin and were instead caused by company-specific factors. According to Moss, these factors include warrant exercises, fundraising activities, and compression of the Bitcoin premium that MetaPlanet trades at compared to its BTC holdings. The two most severe drawdowns, however, did overlap with Bitcoin volatility. The -78.6% collapse in late 2024 and a -54.4% drawdown both coincided with periods when Bitcoin itself was undergoing corrections. These overlapping events suggest that while BTC volatility sometimes adds to the drawdown, MetaPlanet’s stock selloffs tend to extend beyond Bitcoin downturns. Essentially, what this means is that instead of BTC 4-year cycles, BTCTCs are now more like 4 cycles in 1 year. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is in a correction phase and is struggling to hold above the $110,000 support level. Popular BTCTC stocks are also struggling with downtrends alongside Bitcoin. Strategy’s stock is down 37.1% from its 52-week high, while MetaPlanet is down 58.6%. Others, like The Smarter Web Company PLC (-83.6%) and The Blockchain Group (-70.7%), are at greater losses.

In 2025, investors are looking for the top new meme coins to invest in this year, projects that blend cultural relevance with innovative mechanics. Among them, BullZilla’s presale stands out with its Mutation Mechanism, Bonk carries the banner for Solana’s community-driven surge, and Binance Coin shows how a token can evolve beyond utility into a powerhouse of momentum. Each of these represents a piece of the puzzle when it comes to identifying the top new meme coins to invest in this year, offering growth potential that appeals to students, analysts, and blockchain developers alike. For anyone evaluating strategies in this market, BullZilla , Bonk, and Binance Coin showcase why they’re among the top new meme coins to invest in this year. BullZilla Presale’s Mutation Mechanism Fuels Explosive Momentum BullZilla ($BZIL) is in its 1st stage, known as “The Project Trinity Boom,” currently in Phase 4. Its price sits at $0.00002575, with over $183,000 raised and more than 620 token holders already onboard. Early adopters have seen remarkable results, with ROI reaching 20,371.49% from Stage 1D to the listing price of $0.0052. Even the earliest joiners enjoyed 34.95% gains before Stage 1D, proving how quickly value can compound. At the heart of Bull Zilla is the Mutation Mechanism, which sets this project apart. Half of the total supply, 80 billion tokens, has been allocated to presale. The Progressive Price Engine automatically increases token cost every time $100,000 is raised or every 48 hours without that milestone being met. This time- and funding-driven model guarantees constant movement, rewarding those who act early while sustaining momentum across the presale timeline. Layered onto this is the Roar Burn Mechanism. Each milestone in BullZilla’s journey triggers a live burn of tokens from the Burn Pool Reserve. Every burn decreases supply, and each Roar Surge announcement amplifies the project’s progress across the community. Scarcity grows with every stage, supporting higher value over time. Bonk’s Buzz: Solana’s Meme Culture Engine Roars Back Bonk continues to dominate conversations as the leading meme coin on the Solana blockchain. With its roots tied to community culture, Bonk has grown into a utility token that integrates across Solana’s DeFi and NFT spaces. Its strength lies in its symbolism. Bonk embodies Solana’s resurgence, representing a community-driven comeback that goes beyond speculation. The coin’s ongoing burns and liquidity integrations have made it more than just a meme, it’s a cultural cornerstone with actual on-chain relevance. Market momentum shows resilience. Bonk’s short-term patterns point to steady consolidation with potential for breakout. Its role in Solana’s broader adoption strategy ensures that it remains deeply embedded in the ecosystem. Investors and developers alike are watching Bonk closely, not only for potential returns but also for its cultural importance in shaping Solana’s narrative. For financial students and analysts, Bonk demonstrates how meme coins can evolve into community assets that drive utility while retaining their viral appeal. Binance Coin’s Momentum: Utility Meets Technical Green Light Binance Coin (BNB) is not new, but its trajectory proves why it belongs in the list of top new meme coins to invest in this year. What started as a token for trading discounts has grown into a pillar of the Binance ecosystem, driving smart contract applications, staking, and cross-platform utility. BNB’s momentum in 2025 is powered by strong technical structures. Its support levels have held firm, with bullish patterns forming on charts that hint at breakouts toward new highs. Traders are eyeing resistance zones around $900, with potential paths extending into four-digit territory as adoption deepens. Beyond speculation, BNB holds undeniable utility. It underpins transaction activity, fuels decentralized applications, and serves as a governance tool across Binance’s network. That combination of tangible use cases and strong investor trust has turned BNB into a hybrid of meme culture momentum and institutional-grade utility. For blockchain developers and financial analysts, BNB exemplifies how utility and technical momentum can align to create a coin with both speculative and structural growth potential. Conclusion: A Trio That Defines Meme Coin Evolution BullZilla, Bonk, and Binance Coin embody the evolution of meme coins in 2025. BullZilla’s Mutation Mechanism and Roar Burn create a presale model that engineers scarcity and momentum. Bonk anchors Solana’s cultural revival while offering meaningful integration in DeFi and NFTs. Binance Coin proves that what begins as a meme-driven token can transform into a utility-backed force with technical momentum. These three projects together highlight the top new meme coins to invest in this year, showing how innovation, culture, and utility can converge. For investors evaluating strategies, this trio demonstrates why BullZilla, Bonk, and Binance Coin deserve a place on the shortlist of the top new meme coins to invest in this year. By combining presale design, community energy, and ecosystem strength, they illustrate why they stand tall as the top new meme coins to invest in this year.

51310537,https://timestabloid.com/?p=82112,1757201416,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP to $22? How Central Bank Investment Could Skyrocket XRP Price,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-to-22-how-central-bank-investment-could-skyrocket-xrp-price/,"A recent analysis examines the possible implications for XRP if the ten largest central banks worldwide were to allocate a share of their combined $13 trillion in foreign exchange reserves to the digital asset. The findings suggest that even limited exposure at this level could significantly influence XRP’s valuation, though such an outcome remains hypothetical. As of report time, XRP trades around $2.80 and maintains a circulating supply of roughly 59.4 billion tokens. This gives the asset a market capitalization close to $172 billion, placing it among the highest-valued cryptocurrencies. While this level is substantial, central bank participation would represent a scale of adoption that could redefine XRP’s market dynamics. Potential Outcomes Based on Reserve Allocations If the largest central banks, including those in the United States, China, Japan, Switzerland, India, and Russia, allocated 1% of their reserves to XRP, the purchase would equal about $130 billion. Under straightforward market cap arithmetic, this would raise XRP’s valuation to over $302 billion, translating to a token price near $5.09. Increasing the allocation to 3% (approximately $390 billion) would place the price around $9.47 per token, while a 5% commitment ($650 billion) could lift the market cap above $822 billion, with XRP trading near $13.84. Extended Case at 10% Reserves In a more aggressive scenario, where central banks committed 10% of reserves, approximately $1.3 trillion, XRP’s market cap would surpass $1.47 trillion. At that point, each token could be valued at roughly $22.58. This represents nearly an eightfold increase from current levels. It is important to emphasize, however, that these projections rely on direct arithmetic conversions between inflows and market capitalization. In practice, large-scale institutional purchases of this magnitude could produce a multiplier effect , with market reactions driving prices well beyond the calculated figures. Even comparatively smaller allocations, such as a $1 billion purchase by a single government, would likely generate disproportionate impacts on market sentiment and trading activity. Likelihood of Central Bank Participation While the numbers illustrate potential price effects, the probability of such adoption remains low. Governments and central banks have primarily concentrated on Bitcoin when discussing digital reserves. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 For example, the U.S. government has passed legislation governing stablecoins and has considered establishing a national cryptocurrency reserve, though its primary focus remains Bitcoin. Elsewhere, China and Russia have shown interest in using cryptocurrencies primarily as instruments to support their local currencies, with stablecoins and Bitcoin receiving most of the attention. Currently, ten countries collectively hold over 517,000 BTC, valued at more than $56 billion. This underscores the continuing dominance of Bitcoin in institutional strategies. By contrast, alternative assets such as XRP, Ethereum, and Cardano remain largely outside the scope of official government holdings. The analysis highlights that central bank allocations, even at minimal levels, could theoretically push XRP’s valuation to unprecedented levels. Nonetheless, the practical likelihood of such an outcome is uncertain. At present, Bitcoin continues to be the digital asset most favored by governments, leaving XRP and other altcoins in a speculative position regarding large-scale institutional adoption.

SUI 1-day chart analysis SUIUSD chart by TradingView SUI assumed a bear trend since mid-August after facing resistance at $4. The drop in the last 24 hours was correlated to the Altcoin Season Index, which fell 6.9% weekly as capital shifted to Bitcoin (+0.8% 24h). Support is at the 200-day SMA ($3.16). The MACD, however, shows the market’s negative momentum is dropping.

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000430. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000699 and an average trading price of $0.000673 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The recent launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1?

The key support to hold is $0.0000861, while the main barrier above is $0.0000915. On the 4-hour chart, the price is stuck in a tight range with low volume and moving averages flattening. FLOKI on the daily timeframe As of September 6, 2025, FLOKI continues to grind sideways near $0.000089 with little conviction, holding above local support at $0.0000861 but capped by resistance at $0.0000915 and higher at $0.0000946. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The 21-day SMA at $0.0000970 is sloping down, reinforcing broader bearish pressure, while MACD remains deep in negative territory with no crossover signal yet. The structure shows lower highs and mixed candles, suggesting indecision after the late-August drop. A daily close below $0.0000861 risks fresh downside continuation, while reclaiming $0.0000915–$0.0000946 would be the first step toward neutralizing the downtrend. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe On the shorter timeframe, FLOKI bounced modestly to $0.0000896 but remains squeezed between $0.0000880 and $0.0000900. The Alligator indicator shows its lines converging and flattening, reflecting stalled momentum and a potential volatility squeeze. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Volume has faded notably since yesterday’s surge, underscoring weak follow-through. Until price decisively breaks above $0.0000905 resistance (blue Alligator line) or loses $0.0000880, the chop continues.

Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~11x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need up to $95 billion market cap to hit $0.01, over 110x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

Because of its reputation on social media and its focus on community, Dogecoin is still one of the most well-known tokens in the digital space. However, as the market has matured, investors are now looking for initiatives that have long-term utility and concrete value. This has created space for utility-based tokens like Remittix (RTX) , a presale project that is picking up steam with a payments-first approach. Dogecoin Price Prediction and Market Trends Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.2168, up 0.78% over the previous day. Its trading volume has decreased by a significant 11.48% to $1.54 billion. These numbers obviously demonstrate that despite Dogecoin’s robust liquidity and market presence, trading activity is susceptible to the volatility typical of assets based on memes. Dogecoin Price Prediction is more of a market sentiment than technological development, so it is narrow in outlook compared to new crypto projects. This realization has led the majority of investors to diversify into low cap crypto gems and best crypto presale 2025 potential. Tokens with utility and adoption focus are now considered the next big altcoin 2025 and they are taking a different direction from speculative meme coins. Remittix Builds Momentum Ahead of Q3 Wallet Launch One of those projects that are gaining attention is Remittix (RTX), which is currently valued at $0.1030 per token. The project has already raised more than $24 million in its presale, with more than 645 million tokens sold. Unlike Dogecoin, which is based on community culture, Remittix comes across as a crypto with real-world utility, attempting to solve inefficiencies in cross-border remittances. The Remittix DeFi initiative facilitates the transfer of crypto directly to legacy bank accounts in over 30 nations, bridging digital and fiat worlds. With its beta wallet launch set for Q3, the initiative has already made public impending listings on BitMart and LBank, its push to centralized exchanges and broader liquidity. Why Remittix Is Gathering Momentum Global Reach: Direct crypto-to-bank transfers in a number of regions Utility-First: Focusing on real payments, not speculation Strong Presale: Raised over $24M with fast-growing adoption Wallet Beta Q3: Mobile-first solution for everyday use The Bigger Picture The shift in interest from meme tokens to crypto solving real-world problems reflects general investor sentiment. While Dogecoin is still in the limelight, whether it belongs in long-term portfolios is debatable. Compared to this, projects like Remittix answer to the demands of low gas fee crypto, cross-chain DeFi projects and crypto with passive income potential through scalable adoption. With a growing player base, secured exchange listings and a $250,000 giveaway ongoing, Remittix continues to build momentum. For those tracking the Dogecoin Price Prediction, the advent of projects such as RTX illustrates how the market is shifting toward utility-based innovation rather than hype-based pumps.

XRP seems stuck in a narrow trading range, while community sentiment is surprisingly drifting toward a new name, Remittix (RTX) . Many investors now see more upside in this utility-driven altcoin than in traditional picks. XRP Price Today: Stuck Below $3 XRP is trading around $2.81, stuck between resistance at $3.00–$3.10 and support around $2.70–$2.80. Technical indicators offer a mixed picture. The MACD suggests a bullish crossover in the near future, while the RSI shows increased buying pressure. For XRP to hit $3.70 or higher, a clear break over $3.10 would be required. If it fails to hold above $2.80, a decline toward $2.50 or below might be exposed. Future developments in regulations may also have an impact. While unfavorable decisions or market resistance may result in sideways or bearish pressure, a positive outcome or the approval of an ETF may provide bullish momentum. Why Remittix Is Becoming the Focal Point Despite XRP’s foundational strengths, enthusiasm is leaning toward Remittix (RTX) , a fresh PayFi altcoin with real-world use. It’s not just hype. Here’s what’s catching attention: Raised over $24 million in its presale by selling more than 645 million tokens at $0.1030 each The upcoming Q3 beta wallet launch supports instant crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries, enabling real-time Confirmed listings on BitMart and LBank, enhancing liquidity and access A deflationary token model, CertiK audit and a $250,000 community giveaway, raising visibility and trust Analysts call Remittix (RTX) “XRP 2.0”, fading back the meme narrative and spotlighting real usability. It’s being beaten down the hype path, not because of symbolic appeal, but due to tangible adoption potential in a $19 trillion global payments market. XRP vs Remittix: A Side-by-Side Look XRP trades on legacy trust, funded infrastructure and institutional connections, but momentum feels capped until the next big catalyst surfaces. Remittix stands out with a user-first design, funding traction, global usability and fast-rising investor heat. Remittix is gaining support from community members who once championed Ripple but now see greater upside in a project that solves current pain points. That’s a rare shift in the crypto world. The Takeaway for Investors Analysing today’s XRP price prediction paints a picture of cautious optimism but limited upside unless charts break cleanly above $3.10. Meanwhile, Remittix offers a more aggressive upside story grounded in real financial utility, not just chart patterns. Consider a mix to balance stability and growth: XRP could serve as your foundation. At the same time, a calculated position in Remittix offers a calculated bet on rapid adoption and utility-led expansion.

Recently, a crypto expert has added fuel to the discussion, unveiling a detailed step-by-step approach he believes could turn XRP into a million-dollar opportunity for investors. The $1 Million XRP Wealth Strategy Austin Hilton, a crypto investor and expert, has outlined his approach to building generational wealth with XRP in a video post on X social media. Rather than chasing speculative short-term gains , Hilton emphasized a strategy built on three strong pillars: patience, consistency, and discipline. Hilton revealed that he has been steadily accumulating XRP for years, treating it similarly to his diversified approach in traditional markets like stocks and bonds. Rather than placing all his capital in one asset, he considers XRP a part of his portfolio alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. His first step toward reaching $1 million with XRP is to hold the token until it delivers a 30x return or more—a move he projects could eventually push it toward the $80 to $90 price range. For him, time is the most important ingredient, whether it takes one year or several. The second part of his strategy is continuous buying, even during bearish periods . Hilton emphasized that many investors tend to panic during downturns, but he sees red days as opportunities to accumulate more XRP at discounted prices. He noted that the cryptocurrency’s present $2.8 – $2.85 trading range is a bargain relative to his long-term price expectations. Lastly, Hilton stressed the importance of removing emotions from investing. In his view, panic selling destroys potential long-term gains. He explained that sharp market declines do not shake his resolve, underscoring his confidence in XRP’s future outlook . The crypto expert has also clarified that the principles behind his $1 million XRP strategy are equally effective when applied across other digital assets like BTC and ETH. XRP Price Analysis: Key Levels To Watch Market expert Egrag Crypto has shared the near-term hurdles the XRP price must clear to break past its current consolidation range. His latest analysis revealed that XRP recently slipped to $2.77 , putting bullish momentum under pressure. The analyst noted that reclaiming the $2.85 on a 4-hour close is critical for establishing stability and reaching higher targets. If XRP can hold above this threshold, the next price milestones are expected at $2.9 and $2.95, with a potential breakout target of $3.13. Achieving these levels could open the door for XRP to challenge mid-range resistances at $3.45 and $3.65. Still, Egrag Crypto cautions that the risk of a pullback remains . His chart shows that a failure to close above $2.85 repeatedly could trigger a retreat to $2.65 or lower, reviving bearish momentum . The $2.75 level has emerged as a critical support zone, acting as the last line of defense before deeper corrections.",XRP|Austin Hilton|bitcoin|Egrag Crypto|Ethereum|ripple|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-07 00:00:01

Both remain respected assets, but 2025 is proving that digital assets may offer stronger long-term performance. Real estate markets are under pressure from rising borrowing costs, while gold, despite its stability, struggles to generate meaningful returns. Cryptocurrencies, by contrast, combine scarcity, utility, and growth potential. Analysts argue that holding the right coins over the next decade could deliver gains that far exceed traditional havens. While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate this conversation, a third contender — MAGACOIN FINANCE — is emerging as a high-risk, high-reward opportunity drawing investor curiosity. Bitcoin: digital gold with exponential reach Bitcoin is the natural comparison to gold. Both are scarce, but Bitcoin is more portable, divisible, and borderless. Its 21 million hard cap ensures that supply cannot be manipulated, making it an attractive hedge against inflation. In 2025, Bitcoin ETFs brought in over $20 billion in inflows, further cementing its credibility among institutions. Analysts believe that while Bitcoin may no longer deliver 100x returns, its growth potential still far outpaces gold. For long-term holders, Bitcoin is the anchor asset for building generational wealth. Ethereum: infrastructure for the new economy Ethereum extends beyond being a store of value. It is the foundation for decentralized finance, NFTs, and Web3 applications. The approval of ETH ETFs in 2025 added legitimacy, attracting pension funds and large asset managers. Meanwhile, Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum and zkSync are scaling Ethereum to mainstream levels. With its deflationary mechanism burning millions of ETH, scarcity is tightening. Analysts argue Ethereum’s dual role as both infrastructure and investment asset makes it uniquely positioned to outperform real estate, which faces liquidity and regulatory hurdles. While Bitcoin and Ethereum provide stability and infrastructure, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting attention as the high-beta complement capable of delivering exponential returns . Analysts suggest it could achieve a staggering 7,800% ROI , drawing parallels to SHIB’s early mania phase. What sets it apart is legitimacy: MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the few presales to pass both CertiK and HashEx audits , giving it credibility absent in most meme-inspired tokens. The PATRIOT50X bonus code has amplified demand, with thousands redeeming it to boost allocations by 50%. Rapid presale sellouts signal tightening supply, and forecasts of 35x growth at launch are fueling urgency. For investors used to the steady pace of gold or real estate, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the other side of the spectrum — asymmetric risk that could become life-changing reward if momentum holds. The case against traditional assets Real estate has historically been a reliable wealth builder, but current conditions are eroding its appeal. Rising interest rates, stagnant wages, and oversupply in certain markets are dampening returns. Gold remains a hedge, but it is limited by its inability to generate yield or scale. Compared to crypto’s innovation cycles and global reach, both appear sluggish. Analysts suggest that while traditional assets still belong in portfolios, their growth ceiling is increasingly obvious. Building a balanced allocation For long-term investors, balance is key. Bitcoin provides scarcity-driven security, Ethereum delivers infrastructure and scalability, and MAGACOIN FINANCE introduces cultural-driven asymmetric upside. Together, they cover the spectrum from stability to explosive potential. Analysts note that portfolios structured this way not only outperform traditional havens but also remain adaptable to market shifts. Conclusion Real estate and gold will always have their place as conservative stores of value, but the future of wealth creation is shifting. Bitcoin and Ethereum are positioned to outperform through scarcity and utility , while MAGACOIN FINANCE adds the element of exponential growth that traditional assets cannot match. For long-term holders, the next decade may prove that the best safe havens are not physical, but digital.

Tokens like Cardano (ADA) and Pepe (PEPE) have shown both powerful rallies and steep corrections over the past year, leaving investors eager for fresh opportunities. While these assets continue to trade with significant volatility, analysts are now pointing to a new contender gaining serious traction – MAGACOIN FINANCE. Seen as a project capable of redefining the crypto landscape, it is attracting both retail and institutional attention with its ambitious roadmap and rapidly growing community. ADA and PEPE Price Performance Cardano began late 2024 trading at just $0.33 before spiking above $1.20 in early 2025, fueled by renewed optimism around staking and Layer-2 developments. However, the coin struggled to maintain momentum, slipping back toward the $0.80 level as network growth slowed. For many, ADA remains a long-term play, but its price action suggests investor patience is being tested. Pepe, on the other hand, has experienced a rollercoaster year of extreme volatility. After surging on meme hype and community-driven demand, the token saw dramatic peaks and troughs before stabilizing around $0.000009. For short-term traders, PEPE’s swings offered opportunity, but for long-term investors, the unpredictability has become a concern. The Rise of MAGACOIN FINANCE In contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been turning heads with explosive presale growth and a unique strategy that goes beyond hype. Unlike meme tokens that rely heavily on trends, MAGACOIN has built its foundation on great tokenomics, utility-focused expansion, and a clear long-term vision . Experts believe this combination could allow it to capture the same type of early-mover advantage once seen in the early days of other legendary coins. What’s fueling the buzz? Early investors are eyeing potential gains as high as 40x from presale prices , thanks to soaring demand and limited early allocations. The project has already raised millions in record time, signaling that market confidence is strong. With utility-driven milestones ahead, MAGACOIN is positioning itself as one of the few emerging altcoins capable of redefining the market narrative in 2025. Looking Ahead for ADA and PEPE Both Cardano and Pepe will continue to have a role in the market. ADA’s future depends largely on whether its ecosystem upgrades can deliver sustained adoption, while Pepe’s fate remains tied to whether its community can keep momentum alive. Yet the spotlight has clearly shifted toward newer, high-growth projects that offer stronger upside potential. Conclusion The crypto market thrives on innovation, and investors are constantly searching for the next breakout. While ADA and PEPE have delivered exciting runs, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as the project many believe could deliver the next wave of massive returns. With analysts forecasting up to 40x gains , the project’s rise highlights just how fast the crypto landscape can be redefined.

51312205,https://thecoinrise.com/traders-choose-blockdags-4500-developers-2900-upside-over-doges-30-climb-aave-370-battle/,1757203221,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/51312205.jpeg,"Traders Choose BlockDAG’s 4,500 Developers & 2,900% Upside Over DOGE’s 30% Climb & AAVE $370 Battle",https://thecoinrise.com/traders-choose-blockdags-4500-developers-2900-upside-over-doges-30-climb-aave-370-battle/,"Crypto markets are heating up once more, but not every signal carries the same weight. Dogecoin is forming a symmetrical triangle that could trigger a 30% breakout if retail traders push it beyond resistance. AAVE is also drawing attention as it challenges the $370 mark, supported by a record $71B locked in DeFi, though the risk of rejection still lingers. Both stories show potential, yet they remain tied to confirmation before any decisive move. Traders are watching, waiting for the right signal to validate the next direction. Breaking from this pattern is BlockDAG (BDAG) . With 4,500 developers onboard and more than 300 decentralized applications in progress, it is not waiting for post-launch momentum. Instead, it is building adoption in advance, creating a foundation that sets it apart as the best-performing crypto analysis candidate in today’s market. What’s more, ahead of its upcoming Singapore Deployment Event, BDAG is available at a special rate of $0.0013, setting up a potential 38x return once it hits $0.05. Dogecoin’s Chart Signals Potential 30% Upside Dogecoin has regained attention after dropping from $0.24 to $0.21 and then rebounding above its earlier levels. This movement came alongside broader market shifts following recent Federal Reserve remarks, making DOGE one of the most-watched altcoins in the short term. Analysts note that a symmetrical triangle is forming on the 4-hour chart, often seen as a continuation pattern. If the price can break convincingly above the upper trendline, projections point to a move toward $0.30, nearly a 30% increase from current levels. Confirmation will be key, with traders watching for multiple candle closes above resistance. Given Dogecoin’s liquidity and retail-driven nature, such breakouts carry follow-through. Aave Approaches Critical $370 Breakout Aave is drawing attention as it nears the $370 resistance level, a threshold not held since the end of last year. The token recovered steadily from lows near $190 earlier in the year, reflecting improved structure and growing confidence. Now, the focus is on whether Aave can clear this ceiling to spark a larger upward rally. Supporting this momentum are strong fundamentals. The protocol’s total value locked has reached an all-time high of $71.15 billion, while borrowing costs remain attractive compared to traditional banking. Together, these factors suggest a favorable setup, though a failure to sustain above $370 could lead to a pullback that traders are watching closely. 4,500 Developers and Nearly $400M Raised Put BlockDAG Ahead of the Curve BlockDAG is rewriting the script on adoption in crypto. Where most projects launch first and then struggle to attract builders, BlockDAG has already secured more than 4,500 developers before its network even goes live. Over 300 decentralized applications are in progress, a clear sign that creators are committing resources and time to a system they see as part of the future. This kind of developer-led traction is rare and often signals the foundation for lasting growth. The team’s execution has matched this momentum with precision. Tools like the Explorer, IDE, and Smart Contracts Wizard are not promises but working frameworks that developers can already use. By delivering infrastructure early, BlockDAG is giving builders everything they need to test, refine, and deploy applications ahead of launch. This approach mirrors the disciplined rollouts of Silicon Valley, setting it apart from typical early-stage crypto ventures. For participants, the presale numbers confirm the story. With nearly $400 million raised and 25.9 billion coins sold, BlockDAG is not just capturing attention; it is converting that attention into capital at scale. To celebrate its next big chapter, BlockDAG has reduced its presale price to $0.0013 in advance of the Singapore Deployment Event. With launch already set at $0.05, this celebratory cut creates a 38x ROI opportunity for those who enter during this final phase. Early adopters have already seen a 2,900% return since batch 1, underscoring why timing matters. With 3 million miners active on the X1 App and a developer community that is already building, BlockDAG is entering the market with both momentum and infrastructure. History shows that when developers lead, price action follows, and BlockDAG appears positioned right on that threshold. Looking Forward Through the lens of market analysis, Dogecoin offers a retail-driven trade that relies on sentiment, while AAVE represents DeFi’s resilience with its test at $370. Both hold potential, but their outcomes remain tied to short-term confirmation. BlockDAG, however, shows traction that can be measured. With nearly $400M raised, 25.9 billion coins sold, and a community of 3 million miners, its foundation is already in place. Early buyers have gained 2,900% since batch 1, and at $0.0013, the path to further upside points to 38x. This makes BlockDAG the top trending crypto to watch in 2025.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-this-may-be-your-last-opportunity-to-buy-xrp/,"XRP has remained under pressure for several weeks, with prices stabilizing around $2.80. Despite this consolidation, some analysts argue that the current market may represent one of the final opportunities to acquire the asset at relatively low levels before an anticipated rebound. Vandell Aljarrah, co-founder of Black Swan Capitalist, recently stated that September could mark the final period in which investors are able to purchase XRP and other major digital assets at discounted prices. His comments have added to the ongoing debate about whether XRP is preparing for its next upward phase. This may be your last month to buy digital assets such as XRP and others at these low valuations. — Vandell | Black Swan Capitalist (@vandell33) September 5, 2025 Market Context The bearish tone surrounding XRP has largely mirrored broader market conditions. Bitcoin, the market leader, has fallen sharply from its August record of $124,457 and now trades near $110,800, reflecting an 11% decline. The shift occurred immediately after Bitcoin’s peak, placing downward pressure on most cryptocurrencies, including XRP. Over the past month, XRP fell as low as $2.69 before recovering slightly, resulting in a 6.2% monthly decline. Analysts argue that the prolonged sideways trend in both Bitcoin and altcoins is reaching an inflection point, with expectations of renewed momentum emerging across the sector. Analysts’ Views on XRP’s Outlook Several market commentators besides Aljarrah have provided bullish outlooks for XRP, each highlighting different technical indicators. Ripple Van Winkle, a crypto analyst, observed that XRP has declined by about 25% since reaching $3.65 in July. He noted that accumulation by large investors could signal a market bottom. According to his analysis, $2.70 serves as strong support, while breaking resistance at $2.90 could open the path toward $3.70, with potential for an extended move toward $5. Similarly, analyst Dark Defender has argued that XRP recently completed a corrective phase, positioning it to enter the next bullish cycle. Using Elliott Wave theory, he projected a possible rise to $4.39, contingent on XRP maintaining support at $2.85. This level also corresponds with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement, reinforcing its importance as a price floor. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another analyst, EGRAG, pointed to broader technical signals in favor of XRP’s longer-term strength. He emphasized three factors: resilience on the monthly chart, stability above the $1.99 Fibonacci level, and sustained price action above the 21-day exponential moving average. Based on these metrics, he suggested a near-term target of $3.90 and outlined long-term projections reaching as high as $46, which would mark gains of over 1,500% if realized. Diverging Market Reactions While analysts present increasingly bullish scenarios, market participants remain divided. Some investors responding to Aljarrah’s remarks questioned the likelihood of an imminent surge, noting that similar warnings about “last chances” to purchase XRP at low levels have been issued repeatedly without significant price appreciation. Others, however, share the view that XRP’s extended consolidation may be setting the stage for a broader upward trend. The discussion around XRP highlights growing expectations of a breakout after weeks of stagnation. Analysts point to technical support, whale accumulation, and broader market cycles as evidence of potential upside. Nevertheless, skepticism persists among traders who caution that further corrections cannot be ruled out. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Here’s what you need to do,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/buying-gold-for-the-first-time/,"Gold is exploding right now. New buyers are piling in, old names are breaking records, and global fear is doing what it always does, pushing people to chase this metal like it’s the last life raft in a sinking market. And if you’re thinking about grabbing a piece of the action for the first time ever, then you’re late, but luckily, not too late. You just need to know what the heck is going on, and for that, we got you. You see, investors are worried about war, inflation, central bank politics, and rate decisions that never seem clear. The result has been a stampede into gold, with the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index smashing through its all-time high for the first time since the 2011 euro debt crisis and the U.S. credit downgrade. This time, it’s the wars in the Middle East, Russia-Ukraine, and yes, Donald Trump trying to kick Lisa Cook out of the Fed, that’s stirred the pot. Nobody knows what interest rates are doing anymore. Gold mining stocks break records But hey, miners are on fire. Big names like Newmont Corp., Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd., Wheaton Precious Metals Corp., and Barrick Mining Corp. have all jumped more than 80% this year. Newmont’s earnings more than doubled in 2024. Analysts say it’ll go up another 50% this year. That’s after two full years of weak numbers. It’s now trading at the highest price in over three years. “Newmont is my top pick,” said Martin Pradier of Veritas Investment Research. “Return on equity is almost twice as high as last year.” He’s not the only one paying attention. Agnico Eagle also made his list, mostly because of their assets in Canada and “strong execution.” Agnico’s U.S.-listed stock soared over 90% this year, hitting record highs. Its earnings are also expected to grow, despite a drop in gold output. Barrick had some trouble in Mali and took a $1 billion net charge in Q2, but the stock still climbed 80% year-to-date. Behind all that? Simple. Spot gold is near $3,600 per ounce. That’s a 35% gain just this year. And when gold gets hot, miners follow. Some, like Blair duQuesnay, a financial planner and advisor at Ritholtz Wealth Management, are pointing to investor sentiment: “Gold has been trending higher and getting a lot of attention.” She says it’s the go-to when things fall apart. And it is. Always has been. Sameer Samana at Wells Fargo Investment Institute agrees. He calls gold a classic safety play in “bad economic times.” According to research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, gold does well in low-rate environments and periods of chaos. That box is checked. Multiple times. Wells Fargo’s latest strategy report says global central banks are buying more gold too. Add geopolitical stress to that, and the demand picture just keeps getting stronger. Investors choose ETFs over physical gold Now, if you’re serious about buying gold, there are two main ways to do it. You either buy the real thing, bars or coins, or you buy financial products that track the price. Most experts say skip the coins. Why? Because physical gold is expensive to store, and even more expensive to sell. You lose money on transaction fees, and keeping it safe is a problem. “It’s much more inefficient to own physical gold,” said duQuesnay. She’s not wrong. Once you’ve dealt with the logistics, you’ll wish you’d bought an ETF. That’s why most investors stick with ETFs. The biggest ones are SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU). They move with the price of gold, they’re cheap, and they’re easy to trade. “Gold ETFs are going to be the most liquid, tax efficient and low-cost way to invest,” duQuesnay added. But not everyone agrees on how much to hold. Most financial advisors don’t go above 3% of the full portfolio. Some, like duQuesnay herself, don’t use gold at all. “It’s a trendy asset. Are we in the third inning or the ninth inning of this rally?” she said. It’s a fair question. Meanwhile, Andrew Musgraves from VanEck warned about past cycles. “In past gold rallies of 2010, 2011, for example, they kind of blew out their budgets and were penalized by the market for that,” he said. This time, miners have kept their spending in check. They’re protecting margins and turning those high prices into real profit. So far, it’s working. But this isn’t a sure thing. Nothing in commodities ever is. But if you’re looking to get in, now you know how the game is being played.

The crypto market leader now trades near the $111,000 price level and stands 10.46% away from its all-time high. Meanwhile, recent data from blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant has highlighted an intriguing trend in the accumulating activity of Bitcoin treasuries. Related Reading: Old Bitcoin Supply Unlocks: 7,626 BTC Aged 3–5 Years Moves Onchain Bitcoin Treasury Holdings Hit 840K In 2025 In a weekly report posted on September 5, CryptoQuant reports that Bitcoin treasury holdings by public and private companies have reached a new record of 840,000 BTC in 2025, representing the overwhelming institutional interest seen in the present market cycle. However, beneath this headline milestone lies a stark, cautious shift in market dynamics. Notably, monthly purchases have slowed dramatically, raising questions about the sustainability of corporate demand for Bitcoin. Through combined efforts with bitcointreasuries.net.data, CryptoQuant has discovered that Strategy, being the most aggressive institutional accumulator of Bitcoin, has sharply reduced its buying pace by 97% over the last 12 months. Notably, after acquiring an all-time high of 134,000 BTC in November 2024, the Saylor-led company’s purchases dropped to just 3,700 BTC in August 2025. While other Bitcoin treasuries have stepped in more cautiously, adding 14,800 BTC in August compared to Strategy’s relatively small 3,700 BTC buy, their volumes remain far below the peaks seen earlier in 2025. Notably, these other companies had produced a temporary surge in early 2025, recording a 66,000 BTC all-time high purchase in January, which has clearly faded following their August reports. Notably, all this data indicates that while total holdings are at record levels, the flow of new institutional money appears to be drying up. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mining Turns To Clean Energy Alternatives — Here’s Why Bitcoin Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $110,942, up by 0.48% over the past 24 hours. Daily trading volume has also increased by 4.56% to $61.05 billion, indicating steady market activity. However, the cryptocurrency faces headwinds, with a 3.76% monthly loss underscoring its fragile momentum. The next key resistance level sits near $113,700, a zone that has already proven difficult to break on two separate occasions over the past month. Meanwhile, with Bitcoin price direction largely uncertain, CryptoQuant’s report suggests corporate treasuries appear hesitant to allocate further capital at scale, preferring smaller, more conservative purchases. This behavior signals that while the narrative of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset persists, incremental demand growth is slowing. In addition, it raises significant concerns about the potential behavior of these treasury companies during the much-anticipated crypto winter.

Recent news/opinion on Livepeer Livepeer recently achieved a milestone with the network’s participation percentage rising past the 50% mark. The achievement decreases the inflation and also strengthens the network’s economics . 📊 Livepeer’s participation rate has crossed 50.4%! Why it matters: once above 50%, protocol inflation begins to taper, strengthening token economics while keeping incentives aligned.

Analysts Say It’s Plausible With ETF Acceleration,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-to-200k-in-supercycle-analysts-say-its-plausible-with-etf-acceleration/,"Bitcoin’s historic rise to over $100,000 has already marked 2025 as one of the most bullish years in crypto history. Yet some analysts are going even further, suggesting that a supercycle could push BTC as high as $200,000 before this cycle is over. The reasoning lies in accelerating ETF inflows, institutional adoption, and a tightening supply dynamic that mirrors the most explosive periods of Bitcoin’s history. Institutional adoption has been the clearest driver of momentum. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted billions in inflows, transforming BTC from a speculative asset into a recognized store of value for both retail and institutions. But as Bitcoin consolidates near new highs, analysts argue that the biggest returns may come from altcoins — with emerging plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE drawing attention for their ability to replicate early-stage Bitcoin-like gains. ETF Flows Could Push BTC Higher ETFs have become a game-changer for Bitcoin. According to industry data, daily inflows have reached levels equivalent to several months of new supply issuance, creating significant upward pressure on price. If this pace continues, analysts believe $150,000 could be achieved by year-end, with $200,000 possible if altcoin rotation doesn’t dilute capital inflows too early. Supply Dynamics After the Halving Bitcoin’s most recent halving has reduced new issuance to just over 450 BTC per day. Combined with ETF demand, this supply squeeze creates a perfect storm for upward momentum. Analysts note similarities to the post-2020 halving, when Bitcoin tripled in just months after institutional demand surged. Altcoin With Supercycle Potential While Bitcoin dominates headlines, many investors are looking for outsized returns in the altcoin space. Market models project MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver a 45x ROI before the next macro bull rally expansion. Backed by transparent audits, sustainable tokenomics, and expected top-tier exchange listings, it has already attracted thousands of early investors. For those chasing a “second chance” after missing Bitcoin’s early run, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a presale of choice. Can Altcoins Outpace Bitcoin? Historically, once Bitcoin establishes new highs, capital rotates into altcoins. Ethereum, Solana, and XRP are often among the first beneficiaries. Analysts predict that this rotation could begin in late Q4, potentially fueling the start of a full-scale altcoin season where 10x to 50x returns are possible. Conclusion Bitcoin’s path to $200,000 remains speculative but far from impossible. ETF inflows, the halving supply squeeze, and institutional demand all point toward a continued supercycle. Yet for those aiming to maximize returns, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE provide higher multiples at higher risk. Together, they represent the dual opportunity of stability and speculation that defines this cycle.

51313741,https://timestabloid.com/?p=82125,1757206833,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Top Cryptos With Real-World Use Cases Driving Adoption,https://timestabloid.com/top-cryptos-with-real-world-use-cases-driving-adoption/,"In a world where hype and speculation typically fill headlines, a new wave of cryptocurrencies is making a difference for something far more significant: real utility . Unlike the meme coins that rise and fall overnight, these networks are solving real-world problems and building systems that have long-term value. They are transforming the future of global finance, technology, and infrastructure. Investors who recognize the need for use cases are beginning to focus on the longer term. While newer projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE have made headlines with their ambitious vision and growth potential, the cryptos with real-world applications are laying the foundations for what many see as the backbones of digital economies. Ethereum (ETH) – Fueling Decentralized Finance Applications Ethereum is the home of smart contracts, which have given rise to decentralized applications in finance, gaming, and more. From DeFi lending platforms to multi-million NFTs, Ethereum continues to be the undisputed champion of blockchain innovation. Its ecosystem also is being adopted by enterprises for applications in payments and supply chains. XRP – Redesigning Cross-Border Payments XRP is designed to be fast and efficient for money transfers around the world. By making settlement almost instant and low cost, it has become the preferred solution for financial institutions. For those sending remittances out of the country, XRP is quite a bit cheaper than outdated systems like SWIFT and sends them a lot faster. Emerging Player With Strong Momentum While these established projects grab the headlines, investors are increasingly keeping their eyes on MAGACOIN FINANCE. Its fast-growing community and utility-driven roadmap set it apart as a great breakout opportunity. With solid tokenomics and a clear vision, analysts think it can emulate the early breakout periods of today’s largest networks. Early investors are already eyeing life-changing returns as access becomes more limited. Solana (SOL) – Scaling for High-Performance Applications Renowned for its capability of handling tens of thousands of transactions per second, Solana has emerged as the platform of choice for projects demanding speed and scalability. From decentralized exchanges to gaming to powering decentralized wireless networks, Solana is demonstrating the ability of blockchain to support operational infrastructure at scale. Chainlink (LINK) – Real World Data On-Chain So, blockchains don’t have access to external data themselves. Chainlink addresses this with secured, tamper-proof feeds that bridge smart contracts to off-chain data such as price, weather, and even sports results. This paves the way for advanced financial products, insurance solutions and hybrid smart contracts that span the digital and physical realms. Cardano (ADA) – Research and inclusion in action Through a rigorous approach built on the tenets of peer-review and peer-assessment, Cardano is a truly secure and long-standing platform. Its applications range from supply-chain tracing, decentralized identity systems, to financial services for enabling the unbanked in emerging markets. Conclusion The next phase of crypto won’t be characterized by speculation, but by projects that have some tangible value. Ethereum, XRP, Solana, Chainlink, and Cardano are already revolutionizing industries through blockchain. At the same time, new players like MAGACOIN FINANCE are emerging with the potential to capture massive value as adoption grows. “In a rapidly changing digital economy, the combination of proven use cases and emerging high growth opportunities is arguably the smartest investment play for forward-looking investors.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has gone viral, quickly spreading throughout the trading circles and social networks of the market. MUTM accelerating presale has 16,100 investors. MUTM is cutting disruptive narrative at a time when ETH is fighting to regain an upward curve. This new coin has the potential to re-model the existing market. Ethereum Hold Steady Following an Unsuccessful Breakout Ethereum (ETH) is now trading at a price of $4,308.85 with recent price fluctuating between $4,269.20 and $4,430.67. Following another unsuccessful effort to overcome key resistance near the levels of $4,500-$4,800, ETH is in a consolidation process. Analysts say that such support level around $4300-$4400 might be the key to maintaining the picture. Other new tokens are also beginning to rise in parallel with the performance of Ethereum, such as Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale 6 Mutuum Finance is at Stage 6 presale and tokens are being bought at $0.035 each. Phase seven will add 14.29 percent to the price. Over 16,100 investors have already joined the presale and have contributed more than $15.45 million in capital. This degree of interest indicates that people believe in the long-term vision of the project and its integration into the DeFi market. Development of a Vaulted and Stable Platform The project will be powered by a USD-pegged stablecoin that is already being developed on ETH chain. This long-term overcollateralized non-algorithmic stablecoin is supposed to be stable and secure in the long-term and resistant to the same volatility risk as algorithmic stablecoins that may lose their peg to volatile markets. A Long-Term Outlook for DeFi Mutuum’s openness and efficiency have given the users the ability to easily switch between traditional direct peer-to-peer modalities and on-the-fly. The new vision of decentralized finance is stable and of institutional quality to meet the non-homogeneity of the organizational and individual needs. These are not uniform in the market and can be extended according to the needs of the clients. Control of Stability and Security Mutuum Finance is also requesting and paying off white hackers to stress-test the site. Those who find weaknesses in the code base will get a reward pool of $50,000 USDT. The severity should have four levels, which are critical, major, minor, and low. In its bid to align itself with the security element, community development and extended growth, the platform is even running a $100,000 giveaway in which 10 investors will win a reward of $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The goal of the team is to not just build a strong ecosystem but to attract attention to it too. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly spreading around as Ethereum (ETH) experiences one more failed breakout. Stage 6 presale tokens cost $0.035 with Stage 7 increasing by 14.29% to $0.04. The confidence in the market is strong as more than 16,100 investors have contributed over $15.45M. The platform is also introducing an overcollateralised USD-pegged stablecoin, two-tier lending system and a robust security infrastructure including a $50K bug bounty and a $100K giveaway. As ETH consolidates around $4,308, Mutuum Finance is a DeFi coin that has a strong upside potential as it continues to rise rapidly. Get your Stage 6 tokens prior to the next price rise.

The company has also joined the Linea Consortium, which oversees the distribution of 75% of the LINEA token supply . This strategic alliance helps SharpLink advance its own financial goals and also positions it as a key partner in the long-term development and governance of the Linea network. In an X post , SharpLink Gaming makes a clear statement that the company is fully compliant with Nasdaq rules and does not require further shareholder approvals to execute its At-the-Market (ATM) program for funding Ethereum purchases. SharpLink’s core strategy remains focused on raising capital only when it is accretive for shareholders, which adds to the value of the company’s stock. Recent media reports have suggested that some Digital Asset Trust (DAT) companies may need shareholder approval before issuing new shares to fund crypto acquisitions. However, these reports likely reference newer DATs that may face challenges meeting Nasdaq requirements or are under increased regulatory scrutiny. SharpLink maintains a rigorous commitment to compliance and transparency, ensuring all its transactions are conducted in accordance with Nasdaq rules and industry best practices. Institutional Inflows Fuel Ethereum Momentum The Ethereum narrative has shifted from a speculative play to a deeply convictional institutional bet. Amid this shift, CryptoBusy has revealed that Ethereum has seen a massive price surge of nearly 200% since April, driven by a confluence of powerful on-chain and institutional forces. According to recent data, Whales have added 5.54 million ETH to their holdings, reinforcing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential. Institutional bets are intensifying, with BitMine $65 million ETH purchase, and other major players increasing their exposure. Meanwhile, $151 million of ETH has moved into Aave, showing robust demand within the DeFi ecosystem. ETF inflows reached $3.87 billion in August alone, further strengthening ETH’s performance. These combined forces are building a solid structural floor under Ethereum, reinforcing market conviction and positioning ETH as a top-tier cyclical leader.",Ethereum|At-the-Market|ATM|BitMine|CryptoBusy|DAT|DeFi|Digital Asset Trust|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Joseph Chalom|Linea Consortium|Sharplink Gaming,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-07 01:30:18

Homeowners, stock traders, governments; no one’s getting out of this untouched. What started as a slow change in borrowing costs has now turned into what analysts at Deutsche Bank are calling a “slow-moving vicious circle.” They’re not wrong. Governments, from the U.S. to the U.K., France, and Japan, are all struggling with rising interest payments on massive deficits. When investors start doubting whether these countries can handle their debt, they demand more compensation to lend. That pushes bond yields even higher, which makes those debts worse. Rinse and repeat. Yields spike and home loans feel the hit By midweek, the 30-year U.S. Treasury jumped past 5%, the highest since July. In Japan, their 30-year bond hit a new record. The U.K.’s 30-year spiked to its highest level in 27 years. Even though yields eased slightly on Thursday and Friday, they’re still way above pre-2020 levels. The bigger issue? These high borrowing costs are sticking around. “Cooler heads will prevail, and markets will function as they should,” said Jonathan Mondillo, global head of fixed income at Aberdeen. But let’s not pretend this volatility is normal. Yields move in the opposite direction of bond prices, and this kind of price action means markets are nervous. Really nervous. Mortgage rates are feeling the heat. The 30-year Treasury yield directly impacts the 30-year mortgage, still the most popular home loan in the U.S. When that yield spikes, monthly payments go up fast. “That’s concerning,” said W1M Fund Manager James Carter. He pointed to rising long-term yields and said, flat out, “this is not going to help mortgage holders.” Yes, Trump’s pressure might lead to short-term rate cuts, and weaker job data already has Fed officials preparing for that. Carter called that “counterintuitive” and warned it could backfire. But Carter said the long end of the bond curve is reacting badly: “The long end of the curve is just going to panic… this is not what the White House typically does… those yields are likely if anything to keep moving higher.” Stocks slip, corporates tighten, and investors get nervous As we mentioned, higher government bond yields are punching stocks in the gut too. Normally, when markets get shaky, investors run to bonds. But that safe-haven status is cracking. This year, White House decisions on tariffs and erratic policymaking have made bonds part of the problem, not the solution. Kate Marshall, senior investment analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said rising yields pressure stock valuations. “As yields climb, reflecting higher yields from typically safer assets like bonds and cash and increasing the cost of capital, stock valuations tend to come under pressure,” she explained. And yeah, we’ve seen it: both U.K. and U.S. equities dropped recently. But it’s messy. Marshall pointed out that the correlation isn’t always perfect. Sometimes, stocks and bond yields rise together. Depends on what’s driving it. But in today’s environment, with inflation still high and rate policy still unpredictable, this dance between stocks and bonds is just adding more confusion. There’s one corner of the market that’s found a strange upside: corporate bonds. Viktor Hjort, head of credit and equity derivatives at BNP Paribas, said high yields help the corporate bond space in some ways. “It attracts demand… it reduces supply… it incentivizes corporates to be pretty disciplined about their balance sheets,” he said. Basically, borrowing gets more expensive, so companies think twice before adding more debt. Kallum Pickering, chief economist at Peel Hunt, said, “Just because we don’t have a crisis in the bond market doesn’t mean these interest rates are not having economic consequences.” According to him, high yields “constrain policy choices,” “crowd out private investment,” and leave markets wondering “every six months whether we’re going to suffer a bout of financial instability.” That’s not exactly a great setup for business expansion. Pickering even floated the idea that a new round of austerity (yes, government spending cuts) might be what it takes to break the cycle. “You would give markets confidence, you would bring down these bond yields, and the private sector would just breathe a sigh of relief,” he said.

In 2028, the DOT price can reach a maximum of $17.74 and a minimum of $15.05. The price of Polkadot is predicted to reach a maximum value of $53.47 in 2031. Polkadot (DOT) has shown impressive growth and resilience in a volatile cryptocurrency market, supported by its strong multichain protocol architecture and investor confidence. A major contributor to this success is the Sinai Upgrade on its Acala Network, enhancing functionality and security. With over 32 million transactions validated in October 2024 by the Polkadot Relay Chain, the network demonstrates significant activity and utility. A notable increase in unique wallets further signals growing user adoption and engagement, strengthening Polkadot’s position as a leading blockchain platform. Will DOT reach new heights soon? Let’s get into the Polkadot price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Polkadot Token DOT Price $3.80 Market Cap $6.14B Trading Volume $261.36M Circulating Supply 1.61B DOT All-time High $55.00 Nov 4, 2021 All-time Low $2.69 Aug 19, 2020 24-hour High $3.89 24-hour Low $3.79 Polkadot price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 3.31% 50-Day SMA $ 3.95 14-Day RSI 47.66 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 48(Neutral) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $ 4.12 Polkadot price analysis: DOT daily outlook and technical breakdown For range-bound movement, DOT is trading between $3.79 support and $3.88 resistance, showing consolidation with no clear trend. Strong resistance at $3.88, repeated failures to break above $3.88 confirm it as a strong resistance level limiting upside moves. Weakening Support at $3.79. Frequent tests of $3.79 raise the risk of a breakdown if selling pressure increases. Polkadot (DOT) on September 6, 2025, is currently trading at $3.80, showing a 0.27% increase over the last 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap data. The cryptocurrency experienced intraday movement within a tight range, establishing a support level at $3.79 and encountering resistance at $3.88. This price action highlights a cautious market environment, where bulls and bears are struggling to establish dominance. Polkadot 1-day timeframe analysis: DOT consolidation persists under key resistance On the 1-day chart, Polkadot is showing signs of prolonged consolidation. The price briefly surged toward the $3.88 resistance level but failed to break through, resulting in a pullback that tested the lower support boundary at $3.79. This price corridor has held firm over recent sessions, indicating a lack of directional bias in the market. POL/USDT Chart: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits near the neutral 50 line, signaling the absence of strong momentum in either direction. Meanwhile, the price remains tightly aligned with the 20-day EMA, further validating the asset’s range-bound nature. If DOT closes above $3.88, it could trigger a breakout rally toward the $4.00 mark. However, a daily close below $3.79 would indicate renewed bearish control and may lead to further downside. Polkadot 4-hour timeframe: DOT bearish pressure building below resistance The 4-hour chart shows repeated failures to break past the $3.88 resistance, with each bullish attempt resulting in a lower high. This pattern suggests weakening buyer strength and increasing downside pressure. The price remains confined within the same horizontal range observed on the daily chart, but with more frequent volatility spikes. The RSI on the 4-hour chart is slightly below neutral, pointing toward mild bearish momentum. A cluster of candles testing $3.79 support with long lower wicks implies that buyers are still active, but repeated tests raise the probability of a breakdown. If volume picks up on a move below $3.79, DOT could accelerate downward quickly. Conversely, a clean 4-hour close above $3.88 is required to invalidate this bearish setup and initiate a bullish reversal. Polkadot technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $ 3.82 SELL SMA 5 $ 3.85 SELL SMA 10 $ 3.88 SELL SMA 21 $ 3.91 SELL SMA 50 $ 3.95 SELL SMA 100 $ 3.86 SELL SMA 200 $ 4.12 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $ 3.79 BUY EMA 5 $ 3.81 SELL EMA 10 $ 3.85 SELL EMA 21 $ 3.89 SELL EMA 50 $ 3.91 SELL EMA 100 $ 3.98 SELL EMA 200 $ 4.30 SELL What can you expect next for Polkadot (DOT)? Polkadot (DOT) remains in a tight consolidation zone, trading between $3.79 support and $3.88 resistance, with no clear directional trend in play. Given this narrow range, the next move will likely be defined by a breakout or breakdown from this zone. If DOT breaks above $3.88 on strong momentum, it could trigger a short-term rally toward the $4.00 psychological level, attracting fresh buyers and potentially setting up a trend reversal. On the other hand, if the $3.79 support fails, especially after repeated tests, downside acceleration is likely, pushing the price into a new lower range and possibly extending bearish control. Is Polkadot a good investment? Polkadot (DOT) has strong long-term potential due to its focus on blockchain interoperability and unique multi-chain architecture. It remains a key project in the Web3 space. However, in the short term, price action is weak and range-bound between $3.79 and $3.88, showing no clear trend. At this stage, it may appeal more to long-term holders than short-term traders. Why is Polkadot Down today? Polkadot (DOT) is experiencing downward pressure primarily due to its repeated failure to break above the $3.88 resistance, which has capped any upward momentum. The asset has been range-bound, and with each attempt to rise being rejected, market sentiment has weakened, leading to mild selling pressure. Additionally, frequent retests of the $3.79 support level are raising concerns among traders, suggesting a potential breakdown. This uncertainty contributes to cautious behavior among buyers, and without a clear breakout, short-term sellers continue to dominate. DOT’s current weakness is technical in nature, rather than driven by fundamental news. Recent news Grayscale has updated its S-1 registration filings with the SEC for two proposed cryptocurrency ETFs—one for Cardano (ADA) to trade on NYSE Arca under the ticker GADA and another for Polkadot (DOT) to trade on Nasdaq under the ticker DOT. Both funds would hold the underlying assets directly, track CoinDesk pricing indices, and use Coinbase Custody, mirroring the firm’s existing Bitcoin and Ethereum products. The filings update earlier 19b-4 applications from February 2025, though SEC approval remains pending, with the Cardano ETF decision now delayed to October 26. 🚨Polkadot ETF Update: Grayscale filed S-1 registration statements with the SEC to launch @Polkadot (DOT).

In the 20th century, it was blue-chip stocks and real estate. Today, digital assets are joining that list. Cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals and adoption curves are increasingly viewed as vehicles capable of delivering multi-decade value. Ethereum and Solana lead this conversation, but analysts say smaller, early-stage tokens priced at fractions of a cent could hold the key to truly transformative returns. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE , currently valued at just $0.0004 , is emerging as one of the most talked-about presale opportunities. Solana: scalability and adoption Solana has staged a remarkable comeback since its early technical challenges. With transaction throughput exceeding 65,000 per second, it has become the go-to chain for NFTs, gaming, and high-frequency DeFi. Institutional partnerships and upgrades like Firedancer are making it more robust. Analysts argue that Solana’s scalability and adoption curve position it as one of the strongest long-term plays in the Layer 1 space. For investors, its combination of speed, efficiency, and cultural traction makes it a cornerstone for wealth-building strategies. Ethereum: the infrastructure cornerstone Ethereum is the backbone of Web3. It powers decentralized finance, NFTs, and an expanding ecosystem of applications. Institutional interest surged after ETH ETFs gained approval in 2025, bringing billions in inflows. Ethereum’s deflationary model, strengthened by EIP-1559, has removed millions of ETH from circulation, tightening supply. For those seeking generational wealth, Ethereum provides both credibility and utility, functioning as both infrastructure and a long-term asset. MAGACOIN FINANCE: the $0. 0004 opportunity While Ethereum and Solana anchor the conversation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the wild card attracting attention for its generational wealth potential. Currently priced at just $0.0004 in presale, analysts say its upside could be extraordinary. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the few presales to pass both CertiK and HashEx audits , giving it rare legitimacy among meme-inspired tokens. Forecasts project 35x growth at launch and even 10,000% ROI over the cycle , echoing the early mania around SHIBA INU. The PATRIOT50X bonus code has accelerated demand, with early buyers stacking allocations at record speed. Social media chatter shows Telegram and X communities buzzing with FOMO. Analysts emphasize that while Ethereum and Solana provide stability and scalability, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the asymmetric upside that could turn modest investments into generational wealth. Why balance matters Generational wealth is built not only on explosive growth but also on sustainability. That’s why combining blue-chip infrastructure like Ethereum with high-throughput challengers like Solana, and complementing them with speculative yet credible presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE – creates a balanced approach. It’s the same principle that guided portfolios in previous cycles: anchor with reliability, amplify with asymmetry. Risks and rewards The risks are real. Ethereum faces constant competition, Solana must maintain uptime and trust, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is still early in its lifecycle. Yet, the potential rewards far outweigh the risks for investors who size positions carefully. Analysts stress that even small allocations to emerging tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE can dramatically change long-term outcomes if forecasts prove accurate. Conclusion Ethereum and Solana are strong long-term assets, providing infrastructure and adoption at scale. But for those seeking the asymmetric opportunity that defines generational wealth, MAGACOIN FINANCE at $0.0004 offers a rare entry point . Combining stability with speculative upside may be the formula that shapes portfolios not just for years, but for decades.

51315997,https://timestabloid.com/?p=82130,1757210417,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Trump-Linked Token Disappoints, but MAGACOIN FINANCE Gets the Spotlight",https://timestabloid.com/trump-linked-token-disappoints-but-magacoin-finance-gets/,"After a roaring start that briefly pushed its valuation near $10 billion, WLFI – the flagship token of World Liberty Financial tied to the Trump family – has stumbled hard. Prices have retreated more than 30% from recent highs, raising doubts about its staying power. Meanwhile, a different project, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is quietly turning heads after raising $13 million in record time , making it one of the fastest-growing presales in the current market. WLFI’s Price Struggles WLFI’s slide has forced developers to float a buyback-and-burn program, designed to stabilize the token’s economy. Under this proposal, fees generated from liquidity pools managed by the protocol on Ethereum, BSC, and Solana would be used to purchase WLFI from the market, with the tokens permanently destroyed. The team has hinted that future revenue streams could also support the initiative , though details remain vague. Stablecoin Expansion Despite the rocky trading, WLFI’s broader ecosystem is expanding. Its USD1 stablecoin, recently deployed on Solana, has quickly added nearly half a billion dollars in value, lifting its total market cap to $2.67 billion . Supporters see this as a foundation for long-term adoption, even as the core WLFI token struggles to find a stable floor. At press time, WLFI trades near $0.236, after briefly dipping to $0.2095 earlier in the week. Spotlight on MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE, by contrast, has been riding a wave of momentum. Its presale has drawn thousands of early investors, drawn to its expanding ecosystem and ambitious roadmap. Analysts note that the project’s combination of strong tokenomics and community growth is reminiscent of the early stages of breakout tokens that later delivered life-changing returns . With demand already outpacing supply, some speculate that early backers of MAGACOIN FINANCE could be sitting on gains of 50x or more once it lands on major exchanges. Trump Family’s Role Meanwhile, WLFI’s derivatives market shows resilience. Open interest remains near $920 million, a sign that traders still see opportunity despite price weakness. The financial impact on the Trump family has also been significant: the Wall Street Journal estimated that WLFI’s launch instantly lifted their fortune by $5 billion , surpassing much of their traditional real estate holdings. Donald Trump himself holds only an honorary role, but his sons are actively engaged in the project. Outlook for WLFI and Investor Focus Whether the buyback-and-burn plan will restore WLFI’s momentum is an open question. For now, the market seems cautious, waiting to see if the team can deliver sustainable growth beyond headline hype. Investors looking for new opportunities are diversifying into projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where strong community backing and early-stage positioning suggest far more room for upside. Conclusion WLFI may yet recover if its tokenomics overhaul succeeds, but the disappointment of its initial slide has shifted investor focus elsewhere.

For the first time, the Ethereum exchange balance has turned negative, meaning more tokens are being withdrawn from trading platforms than deposited. This structural shift in supply dynamics has analysts labeling it a key bullish signal for the market’s next rally. Ethereum Exchange Balance = Negative Crypto market expert Cas Abbe shared a new report showing that Ethereum’s exchange flux has slipped into the negative territory for the first time on record. He suggests that the latest development could be bullish for ETH, as it signals reduced selling pressure and growing investor confidence. Related Reading: MemeCore Explodes 3,800% For ATH — But Is A Collapse Around The Corner? Historically, the exchange balance metric has served as one of the clearest indicators of investor behavior. When balances rise, it typically signals mounting selling pressure, as traders move coins for liquidation purposes. Conversely, when they fall, it indicates that coins are being withdrawn into private wallets, which are less likely to be sold. The analyst’s chart illustrates a sharp and accelerating drop in Ethereum’s exchange balances over the past few years, culminating in this historic low. Billions worth of ETH have been removed from centralized platforms, coinciding with the asset’s advance toward a target above $5,500. This indicates a clear reduction in liquid supply during already heightened demand. According to Abbe, the importance of this decline cannot be overstated. He noted that market tops in crypto generally occur after inflows spike back into these centralized platforms, not when balances are draining to new lows. In other words, Ethereum may not be positioned for a sell-off but for accumulation. As selling pressure subsides, long-term holders exert greater control over supply, creating conditions for potentially strong upward price momentum. If history is any guide, Abbe suggests that the shrinking exchange balance could set the stage for Ethereum’s next leg up. Analyst Sets $7,000 As ETH’s Next Target While Ethereum’s exchange supply hits uncharted lows, technical analysts like Crypto Goos are increasingly bullish on its price. The market expert announced in a post on X that ETH has officially broken out of a long-term wedge pattern, which has constrained price action since 2021. The accompanying chart illustrates ETH finally piercing through resistance after years of sideways trading. Crypto Goos points to the breakout level around $3,600, and with Ethereum now trading significantly above it, the move appears confirmed. Related Reading: XRP Poised For Amazon-Like Boom? Analyst Predicts $200 Rally Although Ethereum has experienced a number of price swings in the past few weeks, Crypto Goos remains confident that it can reach a new all-time high soon. The analyst’s projection from the wedge breakout targets the $7,000 region, representing a potential upside of about 62% from current price levels above $4,300. Should momentum persist, the cryptocurrency could extend even beyond the $7,000 milestone.

Avalanche is moving sideways, trapped between support and resistance, while Hyperliquid is consolidating after record-breaking activity. But BlockDAG(BDAG) has chosen a different path, by blending community incentives, global visibility, and top-tier security to fuel momentum. Its 25% referral bonus, head turning entry price of $0.0013 until October 1, and a security-first strategy are placing BDAG firmly in the conversation as the best crypto to buy right now. By contrast, Avalanche (AVAX) continues to oscillate without strong direction, leaving traders frustrated with its lack of breakout potential. Hyperliquid (HYPE), despite impressive growth in trading volume, is still caught between bullish enthusiasm and cautious consolidation. Against this backdrop, BlockDAG’s ability to align rewards with adoption and prove credibility ahead of launch has given it an edge that few competitors can match. Avalanche Technicals Reveal Ongoing Hesitation Avalanche (AVAX) remains locked in a neutral pattern, with price hovering near $23. For months, it has bounced between $16 as support and $26 as resistance, unable to make a decisive move. Multiple rejections at $26 highlight waning momentum, while doji candles on lower timeframes show market indecision. The technical picture reinforces the hesitation. AVAX is sitting slightly above the 21-day SMA, providing near-term support. However, if sellers push the token below $21, a drop back to $20 or even $16 could quickly follow. On the other hand, a successful break above $26 could ignite a run toward $36. This drawn-out sideways movement explains why AVAX has struggled to generate fresh excitement. Despite strong fundamentals and developer activity, its chart structure points to neutrality in the near term. Traders searching for conviction are increasingly shifting attention toward projects like BlockDAG, which are pairing adoption with narrative strength. HYPE Sees Massive Trading Volume but Faces Uncertainty Hyperliquid’s HYPE token has emerged as one of DeFi’s most active platforms, hitting an all-time high of $29 billion in daily trading volume. Over the past year, it has processed $1.57 trillion in trades, while Q2 2025 revenues exceeded $300 million. July alone recorded $319 billion in volume, a 47% rise from the previous month, with $7.7 million in daily fees fueling consistent HYPE buybacks. This growth has been supported by whale activity, including a $21 million USDC long position opened at $45, pushing its market cap above $10 billion. Institutional adoption is also increasing, as HYLQ Strategy Corp. now holds 30,000 HYPE tokens as part of its treasury, mimicking MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin playbook. Analysts forecast mid-term targets of $75–$100, but uncertainty lingers. While HYPE has strong fundamentals, its consolidation suggests the market is waiting for a clear catalyst. For now, it remains a leader in decentralized perpetuals, though momentum is less explosive than earlier in the year. BlockDAG’s Referral Bonus, Limited Time Entry Price, & Security Advantage BlockDAG is capturing momentum at a time when many projects are struggling to excite investors. Its 25% referral bonus has become one of the strongest adoption tools in the presale space. Referrers earn BDAG coins for every introduction, while referred buyers receive an additional 5% bonus, creating a two-sided incentive system that drives viral growth. Unlike short-lived campaigns that disappear after a few weeks, BlockDAG’s referral program is structured for transparency and longevity, ensuring that adoption continues to build as the project nears launch. Visibility has been another catalyst. At its upcoming BlockDAG Deployment Event in Singapore, the project is stepping into the spotlight with more than just promises. It will showcase Dashboard V4, upgraded mining solutions, and the X1 app that already has over 3 million users worldwide. In preparation for this milestone, BlockDAG also shifted its presale to a flat $0.0013, a move designed to reward loyalty and prevent last-minute speculation. Together, these steps highlight that BlockDAG is not just running a presale but demonstrating a working ecosystem. Security further strengthens confidence. Independent audits by CertiK and Halborn confirmed that vulnerabilities were addressed, while multi-signature protections and a parallel Proof-of-Work structure safeguard funds. In an environment where many projects collapse under hacks or rug pulls, this emphasis on safety makes BlockDAG stand apart. With almost $400 million raised, 25.9 billion coins sold, and a limited time entry price of $0.0013, BlockDAG is building adoption, visibility, and trust all at once. For buyers searching for the best crypto to buy, it represents a rare mix of opportunity and reassurance before its $0.05 launch. Final Takeaway Avalanche’s indecision has kept traders waiting, and Hyperliquid’s consolidation shows that even rapid growth can lose momentum. BlockDAG, however, is delivering a layered strategy that builds real conviction. Its 25% referral bonus continues to expand community scale, limited time price shift to $0.0013 elevated its presence on the global stage, and its audited security practices provide confidence in a market where trust is rare. This mix of adoption, visibility, and protection makes BlockDAG more than a speculative presale. It positions BDAG as a project with staying power. For those comparing options, the difference is clear: while AVAX hesitates and HYPE consolidates, BlockDAG is creating traction that investors can measure today. In the search for the best crypto to buy, BlockDAG is not only in the race, it is leading it.

Delegates from the alliance confirmed they’ve agreed in principle to increase production next month. The plan is to add about 137,000 barrels per day, starting in October, as part of a larger strategy to take back lost market share. The group, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, has already pushed forward an earlier phase of production hikes, and now they’re going ahead with the next one. This is part of a bigger plan to bring back the 1.66 million barrels a day of cuts that were meant to stay in place until the end of 2026. That timeline has now been thrown out the window. If they stick to the pace of 137,000 barrels a month, the full rollback could be done in a year. But it won’t be that clean. Some countries don’t have the spare capacity. Others are being told to sit out the increase to make up for earlier overproduction. So the real number is going to come in lower than advertised. Saudi Arabia and Russia push through the pivot The shift marks a full-blown strategy reversal by OPEC and its partners. The cartel used to fight tooth and nail to protect prices. Now? They’re chasing market share, no matter how crowded it gets. Just months ago, OPEC+ shocked the market by restarting 2.2 million barrels per day of halted supply, a full year ahead of schedule. That decision blindsided traders who had been expecting a long freeze due to surplus risks. So far, the gamble hasn’t broken the market. Yes, crude prices have fallen 12% this year. But the overall market has held up better than most expected. That’s giving Saudi Arabia more confidence to roll out even more barrels. And there’s more than oil at play. Donald Trump, back in the headlines, has been demanding lower prices as part of his inflation-fighting playbook. A supply flood serves his agenda. He’s also been using oil prices to put pressure on Russia over its war in Ukraine. The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, is scheduled to visit Washington in November. So, yeah, timing is deliberate. There’s still a gap between headlines and barrels. The group says one thing, but on-the-ground output depends on each country’s capabilities. Some producers, especially the smaller ones, just can’t keep up. A few have already exceeded their past quotas and are being told to hold back. For the rest, it’s go-time. Traders watch OPEC while Asia hosts oil’s biggest party Sunday’s meeting sent another message too: no one really knows what OPEC is going to do until it happens. At the start of the week, Bloomberg polled crude traders and analysts. The majority believed that OPEC+ would hold steady this month. Then, out of nowhere, rumors began swirling that an increase might be on the table, and those rumors became fact fast. Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, has got a track record of shocking the market just to keep traders off balance. This weekend was another classic example. Now, the group’s next move is going to dominate APPEC, the Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference, kicking off this week in Singapore. It’s Asia’s biggest oil gathering, and this year’s mood is already edgy. The International Energy Agency is forecasting a record oil glut in 2026, and concerns about oversupply are expected to dominate the discussions. Of course, there are a few things that could support oil prices short-term. Cold winters drive heating demand. Lower interest rates could make commodities more attractive again. But the main story is still the looming glut. That’s the only thing anyone in Singapore is talking about. The conference begins informally with a wave of private parties. TotalEnergies SE is hosting one at a hotel overlooking Marina Bay, but most guests are expected to be glued to their phones for updates on the OPEC+ decision. The gossip, as always, will flow faster at cocktail events than on stage. Top oil firms are rolling out the red carpet. Saudi Aramco, PetroChina, Equinor, BP, and Vitol are all throwing parties.

World Liberty Financial price prediction for 2025 expects the price of WLFI to surge toward $0.41. By 2031, we expect the World Liberty Financial price to record a maximum price of $1.4. Donald Trump has embraced the title of the “crypto president”, a label that has fueled massive speculation across the crypto industry. After Trump’s 2024 election victory, the price of Bitcoin surged, a move many analysts and traders called a bullish signal for the broader cryptocurrency market. Building on this momentum, Trump introduced his own branded tokens—most notably the $TRUMP token and $MELANIA memecoin—cementing his direct involvement in the world of digital assets. Whether Trump’s push into crypto is driven by policy goals or personal profit, one message is clear: he intends to make cryptocurrency part of both his political strategy and financial portfolio. However, Trump’s personal involvement in crypto tokens raises critical ethical questions. If a sitting or future U.S. president profits directly from token sales, DeFi projects, or blockchain ventures, it risks blurring the line between public duty and private gain. One project drawing major attention is World Liberty Financial after major listings, a Trump-backed decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. This article explores what World Liberty Financial is, and what Trump’s embrace of crypto could mean for the future of Bitcoin, memecoins, and U.S. crypto policy. Consequently, numerous analysts eagerly anticipate the future valuation of its native cryptocurrency, WLFI. This raises the question: Can WLFI price reach $1? This forecast for World Liberty Financial’s price examines factors such as ecosystem trends, adoption rates, underlying technology, and technical analysis to project the WLFI price prediction from 2025 to 2031.

Currently, the bulls are aiming for a recovery above $0.22. WLFI price chart prediction: World Liberty Financial faces buying pressure above $0.21 WLFI price is facing a surge as buyers push the price above $0.21. WLFI price is aiming for a hold above the immediate Fib channels. The 24-hour volume surged toward $258 million, showing increased interest in trading activity. The price is trading at $0.214, surging over 20% in the last 24 hours. WLFIUSDT chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line shows no value as the token has just launched. However, on the 4-hour chart, the trend line hovers above the midline at level 53, suggesting buying demand. WLFI/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for a hold above EMA trend lines The 4-hour WLFI price chart suggests WLFI continues to experience bullish activity around EMA lines, creating a positive sentiment on the price chart. As the price continues to face resistance near the Fib level, bears prepare for a domination by holding the price below the EMA20 trend line. WLFIUSDT chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a negative region at 0.41, hinting that sellers are trying to build pressure near support levels and boost a downward correction. The MACD trend line is yet to give an accurate signal on the 4-hour price chart.

The hourly price chart confirms that bears are making efforts to prevent the WLFI price from an immediate surge. However, if WLFI’s price successfully breaks above $0.2359, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.2878. WLFIUSDT chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, WLFI’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.1927, resulting in a correction to $0.1637. WLFI crypto news World Liberty Financial, the Trump-backed crypto project, froze Justin Sun’s wallet after he sent $9 million in WLFI tokens to his HTX exchange. Sun pushed back, saying he would buy $10M of ALTS and another $10M of WLFI, even though he already holds a $75M stake as one of the project’s biggest investors. The clash comes as WLFI has dropped 40% since launch, sparking rumors that insiders and early backers are selling off their tokens. Is WLFI a good investment? Trading $WLFI will be very risky. Since it’s a new and highly hyped token with only a small amount available at launch, the price could change quickly and unpredictably. Liquidity will be thin, so even one big trade might move the market. It’s normal for tokens like this to surge at launch and then drop as early buyers cash out. I predicted big things for this project. I feel they ran into a problem on launch by partnering with a toxic individual (not confirmed) but with him out of the picture I’m long. When it didn’t immediately shoot up a few crybabies tweeted at me. Keep in mind everybody bought… https://t.co/YmOzuWLlhE — Tristan Tate (@TateTheTalisman) September 6, 2025 However, considering its background and ongoing trading volume, WLFI can turn out to be a good investment option in the long-term. Why is the WLFI price up today? During its recent decline toward $0.16, WLFI price gained significant buying demand and a strong surge in its trading volume. This resulted in a push above $0.2 level. What is the WLFI price prediction for 2025? By 2025, analysts predict that World Liberty Financial (WLFI) will start the year at $0.15, with an average trading price of $0.37, and could climb as high as $0.41. Will WLFI price touch $1? Yes, WLFI price might touch the $1 milestone by the end of 2030. However, the token might attain this level much earlier, depending on the future market sentiment and buying demand. Will WLFI Price Reach $10? If everything remains good and WLFI gains recognition, its price might surpass $10 by 2040. Is WLFI a good long-term investment? As World Liberty Financial aims to expand its offerings, it might gain a significant position in the altcoin market. Hence, WLFI can be a good long-term investment option. The WLFI long term price outlook is looking strong due to its strong political support. WLFI price prediction September 2025 Analysts expect a steady surge in crypto market prices in September month. We expect WLFI to record a minimum price of $0.15 and a maximum price of $0.3, with an average of $0.2 in September.

WLFI historic price sentiment WLFI Price History The $WLFI governance token for World Liberty Financial, the Trump family–backed DeFi platform, launched for public trading and token claims on September 1, 2025, at 12:00 UTC.

If granted, such a move would mark a turning point for Ripple’s token, pushing it into the same institutional spotlight as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Analysts suggest an ETF could trigger an explosive rally, with XRP potentially delivering 1000% gains this cycle. But XRP may not be the only winner. Historically, the approval of institutional investment vehicles creates ripple effects across the market, lifting both major altcoins and emerging tokens. Investors are already asking which altcoins could follow XRP’s trajectory — and which presales, like MAGACOIN FINANCE, could mirror early-cycle moonshots. What an XRP ETF Could Mean An XRP ETF would unlock new levels of institutional participation, giving hedge funds and asset managers easy exposure. Analysts believe this could drive XRP’s price from its current levels into the $5–$8 range , with more bullish estimates calling for $10+ during peak altcoin season. Altcoins Positioned to Ride the Wave Avalanche (AVAX): Strong in real-world asset tokenization, AVAX could surge if institutional demand spills into smart contract platforms. Projections place AVAX at $200–$250 in a bullish scenario. Cardano (ADA): Known for its academic rigor and governance model, ADA could rally to $3–$4 as capital rotates into established altcoins. Polygon (MATIC): With enterprise partnerships and zkEVM scaling, MATIC may reach $4–$5 in tandem with Ethereum’s growth. Presale Opportunity With Massive Upside While XRP dominates ETF speculation, analysts eye a 12,000% upside for MAGACOIN FINANCE before late-stage euphoria drives the market. This presale has gained traction thanks to its audited framework, transparent tokenomics, and expected listings on leading exchanges. Thousands of investors have already participated, many securing bonus allocations that could magnify returns. For those seeking altcoin opportunities that mirror early Shiba Inu or Dogecoin entries, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as a breakout candidate. Could an XRP ETF Spark Altseason? If an XRP ETF gains approval, analysts believe it could mark the true kickoff of altseason. Just as Bitcoin ETFs legitimized BTC in the eyes of institutions, an XRP ETF would highlight altcoins as serious investment assets. This domino effect could trigger massive flows into the broader market, rewarding both established players and new projects. Conclusion The XRP ETF buzz is more than just hype — it’s a potential catalyst for a full-scale altcoin rally. While XRP itself could deliver 1000% gains, projects like Avalanche, Cardano, Polygon, and presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE are positioned to benefit from the surge of institutional and retail demand. For investors looking to maximize returns in 2025, this may be the moment to act before the next wave of adoption hits.

51318279,575775,1757214031,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51318279.jpeg,$6B In Bitcoin: Marathon Digital Treasury Now 2nd-Largest Among Public Firms,https://bitcoinist.com/6b-in-bitcoin-marathon-digital-treasury-now-2nd-largest-among-public-firms/,"According to a press release , MARA Holdings, Inc. now reports holdings valued at close to $6 billion , totaling 52,477 BTC. That level puts the miner among the largest public corporate Bitcoin holders, trailing only Michael Saylor’s Strategy in the public treasury rankings. Mining Output And Treasury Growth MARA produced a little over 700 BTC in August, and it kept an average pace of 22.7 BTC mined per day for the month. Bitcoin’s price fell about 5% during the period; prices peaked near $124,400 mid-month before slipping toward $107,000. Based on reports, the company chose to add to its treasury rather than sell, buying the dip and increasing its Bitcoin reserve to the current level. “Given the decline in Bitcoin price during the month, we took the opportunity to add to our treasury and currently hold over 52,000 BTC,” CEO Fred Thiel said. Hashrate Gains And Site Progress The firm said its energized hashrate edged up to 59.4 EH/s. All miners at MARA’s Texas wind farm are installed and connected, and the company says that site is on track to be fully operational by the fourth quarter of 2025. Production momentum carried into the summer: block wins rose by 27% in July after recovery at the Ellendale site, lifting monthly output from 591 BTC in June to 692 BTC in July, before the 705 BTC recorded in August. Position Among Public Holders Reports have disclosed that MARA ranks second among public companies by Bitcoin holdings, with Michael Saylor’s Strategy still in the lead, holding about 636,505 BTC following a disclosed additional purchase worth $449 million. Other firms listed near the top include Twenty One with 43,514 BTC, Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company with 30,020 BTC, and Bullish with 24,000 BTC. Meanwhile, shareholders have seen a total return of 700% over the past five years. That long-term gain contrasts with more muted recent returns, as Bitcoin’s swings and high operating costs have weighed on performance. Expansion Moves And Europe Push MARA is also moving beyond mining. The company announced plans to buy a 64% stake in Exaion, a unit of French energy company EDF, with an option to boost ownership to one-third by 2027. The stated goal is to pair MARA’s infrastructure with AI-driven edge solutions to lower costs and serve Europe’s growing AI needs. MARA is building its place as one of the biggest Bitcoin holders. With 52,477 BTC worth almost $6 billion, the company has secured a leading spot among public firms.

Traders are asking the big question: when will the next altcoin hype cycle begin? While Bitcoin often sets the tone, altcoins tend to explode with momentum once liquidity starts flowing deeper into the market. Investors who position themselves early often capture the steepest gains. Ethereum – The Engine of DeFi and Beyond Ethereum remains the backbone of decentralized finance and smart contracts. With scaling solutions rolling out across its ecosystem, transaction costs are falling while adoption rises. Analysts argue that Ethereum’s move toward staking-based yields and its role as collateral in tokenized asset markets could push ETH toward new highs in the next cycle. Long-term investors see today’s levels as attractive for accumulation. XRP – Institutional Adoption on the Horizon XRP has been fighting legal battles for years, but the narrative is changing. The possibility of spot ETFs and its growing use in cross-border settlement systems have brought it back to the spotlight. Should Ripple secure regulatory clarity and deeper institutional partnerships, XRP could finally unlock the upside that supporters have been waiting for since the last cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE – The Breakout Contender While legacy players like ETH, XRP, and LINK anchor many portfolios, some investors look for projects at an earlier stage with greater upside potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE has already raised $13 million in its presale at record speed , proving the level of community interest. Its expanding ecosystem and investor-first tokenomics have some speculating about returns as high as 70x once major listings arrive . Unlike many presale tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE has focused on building both hype and utility, creating a blend that reminds analysts of projects that went on to define previous bull markets. Chainlink – The Bridge Between Worlds Chainlink has quietly become one of the most critical players in the blockchain space. Its oracle network secures trillions in value by linking smart contracts to real-world data. With new products like CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol), LINK is setting itself up as a key infrastructure layer for multi-chain DeFi. Analysts expect this kind of utility to shine once speculation gives way to adoption-driven growth. Altcoin Hype Cycle Timing The big question is not whether altcoins will rally, but when. Historically, once Bitcoin establishes new highs and stabilizes, liquidity spills into altcoins. The combination of new institutional capital, ETF approvals, and global adoption trends could make 2025 the year altcoins steal the show. For investors, the strategy is clear: identify the strongest narratives, accumulate before the hype, and hold through volatility. Conclusion Ethereum, XRP, and Chainlink each provide unique strengths, but MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a high-risk, high-reward option that could deliver staggering multiples. As the altcoin hype cycle draws closer, these four assets stand out as must-watch picks for forward-thinking portfolios.

According to the analysis, more bullish candles are needed to sustain momentum and push the price toward the $120,000 resistance, especially as the market contends with ongoing fundamental pressures. Fundamentals Support Bitcoin Despite Weak NFP Print Cryptowzrd highlighted that the daily candle of Bitcoin closed indecisively, signaling uncertainty as the market evaluates its next move. Despite this indecision, BTC remains above the crucial $110,500 level, which continues to serve as a strong support zone. This level remains critical in determining whether bullish momentum can be sustained in the short term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Battles Key Support: Can September’s Dip Set The Stage For A Q4 Rally? The analyst noted that Bitcoin has maintained its bullish edge even in the face of a lower-than-expected NFP print, triggered by fundamental commentary. This development suggests that broader market sentiment is still supportive of BTC, and technical strength is being reinforced by macroeconomic factors. From a weekly perspective, traditional markets have closed on a bullish note, adding further support to Bitcoin’s potential upside. However, a series of consecutive bullish daily candles is needed to solidify confidence in a rally toward the $120,000 resistance level. Without this confirmation, the market could remain in a holding pattern, leaving room for volatility and short-term swings. On the downside, he cautioned that if Bitcoin breaks below the $110,500 level by mid-week, it could open the door for a deeper correction, potentially testing the $100,000 support zone. Such a move would shift market dynamics, increasing selling pressure and creating strategic opportunities for traders to position for short-term downside plays. Over the weekend, Cryptowzrd will be closely monitoring lower-time frame charts to identify actionable scalp opportunities while ensuring that the current position above $110,500 remains secure. Intraday Volatility Driven By NFP And Market Fundamentals Concluding his analysis, the analyst highlighted that the intraday chart of BTC has been volatile, influenced by recent fundamental commentary and the lower-than-expected NFP print. This volatility reflects the market’s uncertainty, as traders weigh both technical and macroeconomic factors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Base Turns Neutral-Bearish As Flows Stay Weak He noted that a decisive move above $113,200 would signal stronger bullish momentum, potentially pushing Bitcoin higher and helping to secure the current position. Such a breakout signals that buyers are regaining control of the market. On the other hand, a drop below $110,400 could open the door for additional downside. For now, the analyst plans to wait patiently for the market to form a more mature trade setup before taking the next actionable position.

But the 2020s are proving that digital assets may challenge, or even replace – those traditional models. With inflationary pressures, aging financial systems, and a surge of blockchain innovation, analysts argue that the next decade could belong to crypto. Five coins in particular stand out as candidates to redefine investment strategies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Chainlink, and a rising cultural-driven token, MAGACOIN FINANCE . Bitcoin: the ultimate store of value Bitcoin has already secured its role as digital gold. Its 21 million cap and growing ETF inflows make it one of the strongest hedges against monetary debasement. Institutional adoption has deepened, with sovereign wealth funds and pension managers now including Bitcoin in their allocations. Over the next decade, analysts predict Bitcoin will shift from speculative asset to permanent fixture in global reserves. Ethereum: programmable money and infrastructure Ethereum is more than a currency, it is programmable money and infrastructure. Billions of dollars in DeFi, NFTs, and tokenized real-world assets flow through its ecosystem. With Layer 2 scaling solutions driving efficiency and ETFs boosting institutional access, Ethereum is poised to underpin much of the Web3 economy for the next decade. Its deflationary mechanism adds a scarcity layer, creating a blend of utility and store-of-value dynamics. Solana: the speed advantage Solana’s story is one of resilience. Once criticized for outages, it is now powering some of the fastest-growing sectors in crypto: NFTs, gaming, and high-frequency DeFi. With upgrades like Firedancer improving stability and transaction throughput above 65,000 per second, Solana could dominate consumer-facing blockchain applications. Its trajectory resembles the early days of tech giants, where efficiency and adoption built unstoppable momentum. Chainlink: the oracle backbone Chainlink plays a quieter but equally critical role. Its decentralized oracle network connects smart contracts to real-world data, powering insurance, payments, and global finance. Institutional partnerships continue to grow, and Chainlink’s cross-chain interoperability could make it indispensable in tokenized markets. Analysts argue that without LINK, the blockchain economy would struggle to connect to real-world systems. MAGACOIN FINANCE: a cultural challenger with legitimacy While Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Chainlink represent infrastructure and value, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rising as a cultural-driven challenger capable of replacing speculative segments of traditional investing . With both CertiK and HashEx audits completed , it is one of the few presales that pairs meme energy with structural trust. Analysts forecast up to 35x growth potential , with some even suggesting 10,000% ROI over the cycle . Social media momentum has exploded, fueled by the PATRIOT50X bonus code , which lets early buyers expand allocations by 50%. Retail enthusiasm mirrors SHIB’s early mania, but MAGACOIN FINANCE distinguishes itself with audit-backed legitimacy. For those who see the next decade as a blend of utility and culture, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as the kind of high-beta play that could rival traditional speculative assets like penny stocks, but on a global, digital scale. Why crypto could replace traditional investments Traditional assets face structural headwinds. Real estate is constrained by rising rates and demographic shifts. Gold protects value but offers little growth. Equities remain central, but they are tied to cyclical economies and limited by slower innovation cycles. Crypto, by contrast, is borderless, programmable, and scalable. By combining scarcity, utility, and narrative-driven upside, these five coins represent the diversity of opportunity that traditional investments lack. Conclusion The next decade may see a gradual shift from physical to digital wealth stores. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Chainlink bring infrastructure, security, and adoption, while MAGACOIN FINANCE introduces cultural-driven asymmetry that traditional markets cannot match. For investors preparing for the future, this blend of reliability and exponential potential may define portfolios that truly replace old paradigms of wealth building.

With analysts already eyeing the next bull run, many investors are asking which coins could leave Bitcoin in the dust. Here are ten altcoins that could deliver outsized returns when momentum shifts. XRP – Regulatory Clarity and Payment Rail Ambitions Ripple’s native token has long promised to disrupt global payments. With lawsuits largely behind it and ETF conversations heating up, XRP may finally get its breakout moment. The key will be adoption by financial institutions, where Ripple already has a strong foothold. Cardano – Governance and Long-Term Vision Cardano stands apart with its scientific approach and emphasis on governance. As new dApps and sidechains launch, ADA could benefit from its reputation as a secure, research-driven network. If altcoin season favors long-term fundamentals, Cardano is well positioned. Solana – Speed and Ecosystem Growth After surviving past network troubles, Solana has rebuilt confidence with faster block times and new institutional partnerships. Its role in DeFi, gaming, and NFTs makes SOL a clear candidate for outperformance if volumes surge again. Binance Coin – Exchange Powerhouse BNB remains the lifeblood of the Binance ecosystem, giving it unmatched utility in trading, staking, and DeFi products. While regulation remains a risk, the size of Binance’s user base ensures BNB stays relevant in every cycle. Litecoin – The Veteran Contender LTC is one of the oldest cryptocurrencies still standing. Its halvings and solid brand recognition keep it in investor portfolios. While less flashy than others, it often tracks Bitcoin rallies with sharper moves, making it a reliable bull-run companion. MAGACOIN FINANCE – The Rising Star One new project among the giants has drawn a lot of interest. With thousands of early investors already on board, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale has soared past $13 million. Its aggressive roadmap and meticulously planned tokenomics, which seek to reward holders and reduce supply shocks, are what make it unique . According to some analysts, MAGACOIN FINANCE could provide early buyers with a life-altering 12,500% return on investment , emulating the kind of exponential gains previously observed with breakout tokens. As hype builds, it’s becoming one of the most closely watched launches of the year. Polkadot – Interoperability in Action DOT’s mission is to connect blockchains into one cohesive ecosystem. With parachains expanding and adoption growing, Polkadot is likely to play a central role in Web3 infrastructure, giving DOT strong upside potential. Avalanche – Scaling for Institutions AVAX has gained attention for its ability to handle high-throughput applications. With partnerships in finance and enterprise use cases, Avalanche could attract institutional flows in the next bull cycle. Sui – The New Generation Platform As a newer Layer-1, Sui is focusing on performance and developer incentives. Its growth in user-friendly applications positions it as a serious challenger for the next wave of blockchain adoption. Conclusion Bitcoin may set the pace, but these 10 altcoins have the potential to sprint ahead when altcoin season ignites. From established players like XRP, ADA, and Solana, to fast risers like Sui and MAGACOIN FINANCE, the field is packed with opportunity. Investors who diversify smartly could be rewarded when the market tide turns.

51322848,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/2025-analysts-reiterate-250k-btc-with-post-halving-momentum/,1757220018,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51322848.jpeg,Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025: Analysts Reiterate $250K BTC With Post-Halving Momentum,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/2025-analysts-reiterate-250k-btc-with-post-halving-momentum/,"The direction of Bitcoin in 2025 remains one of the most inherently controversial topics in international finance. Analysts are becoming increasingly confident in a narrative that the leader cryptocurrency could reach $250,000 by the end of next year — spurred by supply constraints post-halving, whale accumulation, and steady inflows from institutional investors. The Role of the Halving in Bitcoin’s 2025 Outlook Everything comes down to the Bitcoin halving And this is definitely a part of all of the price prediction models out there. Taking place about once every four years, it lowers the block reward to miners, slowing the rate at which new BTC is being added to the system. This supply shock has historically been the trigger for huge bull markets. The 2024 halving is already beginning to shift the balance of supply and demand. As new coins are trickling in less, there will be more buying pressure from retail and institutions to satisfy, which will move the price upwards, and increase the market’s overall liquidity even less than it is already. Analysts say the stage is set for Bitcoin to surge to $250K by 2025. Institutional Demand and Whale Accumulation The institutional adoption of Bitcoin has been gaining pace. Bitcoin Spot ETFs listed in major financial markets have introduced access to pension funds, asset managers and retail traders without directly owning the asset. Now these products are beginning to attract billions of dollars, offering continual, regular demand for BTC. Meanwhile, blockchain data indicates that whales have held $3 billion worth of Bitcoin in recent months. Historically, large holders have acted as a leading indicator of long-term price trends and have both soaked up supply during periods of weakness and driven further rallies. This confluence of institutional incentives with whale buying further compounds $250K price target. Technical Analysis: Charting the Path to $250K It is beginning to appear as if Bitcoin’s chart is a reflection of the previous halving-driven cycles. Analysts note some crucial price points that may decide how quickly the next bullish rally starts. The first signal is the $100,000 mark, which now serves as the psychological barrier for both short-term traders and long-term holders. If it can break this level with conviction, the first resistance area is around $120,000 and potentially $150,000. These prices may well spark profit-taking waves, but they may also serve as a springboard towards deeper price discovery. Looking downside, analysts note $80,000 as a key support level, a point where buyers continue to buy each dip, preserving the base and favoring a new breakout to the upside. Technical momentum indicators, including RSI and MACD, indicate that there is still space for Bitcoin to heat up before reaching overbought levels, which has emboldened bulls and paved the way for the ongoing rally. If Bitcoin clears $150,000 convincingly, historical fractals suggest that a parabolic move toward $200,000–$250,000 could unfold rapidly. Analysts note that such acceleration often happens in the latter stages of post-halving cycles when fear of missing out drives retail participation to new highs. Comparing Bitcoin’s Cycle to Other Leading Cryptos Bitcoin’s role as the leading digital asset makes it the benchmark against which other cryptocurrencies are measured. Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana are all projected to see growth in 2025, but analysts argue Bitcoin’s post-halving mechanics give it the clearest path to explosive upside. Whereas altcoins often depend on adoption narratives, Bitcoin is increasingly being treated as a form of digital gold. This narrative is resonating with both retail investors and institutional allocators, reinforcing its position as the cornerstone of the crypto market. Rising Interest in Alternative Tokens Like MAGACOIN FINANCE While Bitcoin dominates headlines, new entrants are also gaining attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE, for example, has been compared to early-stage ADA and SOL for its rapid growth and cultural relevance. Its recent milestone of crossing $13.5 million in valuation underscores how investors are diversifying beyond the top two cryptos in search of high-upside opportunities. This trend reflects a broader dynamic where capital flows not only into Bitcoin as a store of value but also into smaller tokens that may deliver higher multiples during the cycle. Conclusion The 2025 Bitcoin outlook is pretty good, with analysts reaffirming a $250,000 price target which is based on the halving effect, whales accumulation and institutional investments. Technical analysis shows $100K, $120K and $150K as key levels for supporting a “supercycle” up to $250K, providing investors with a clear roadmap to watch for this cycle. For individuals seeking alternative opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a rising star in the cryptocurrency landscape, offering potential upside speculation, much like the world’s leading cryptocurrency has demonstrated.

Among the emerging names, MAGACOIN FINANCE has drawn significant attention after hitting a $13.5 million valuation. Analysts are beginning to compare its trajectory to the early growth stages of Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL), both of which transformed from speculative plays into established giants in the crypto ecosystem. With narratives aligning around adoption potential and strong community engagement, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be one of the top rising stars for investors seeking the next big opportunity in digital assets. MAGACOIN FINANCE Crosses $13.5M and Gains Market Traction MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rise to $13.5 million comes at a time when altcoin markets are experiencing renewed interest. As investors rotate capital into fresh opportunities, tokens with thematic appeal and cultural resonance are seeing inflows that traditional assets cannot match. The token has carved out a unique identity with branding that appeals to a wide audience. This is translating into community growth and broader recognition across crypto forums. While still relatively small compared to multibillion-dollar market cap projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE is demonstrating the kind of early-stage momentum that marked the breakout phases of ADA and SOL. Comparing MAGACOIN FINANCE to Cardano and Solana Analysts have not been shy in drawing parallels between MAGACOIN FINANCE and early-stage Cardano or Solana. Cardano, for instance, spent years building its governance and research-driven ecosystem before breaking through resistance to deliver massive returns. Solana followed a different path, leveraging scalability and transaction speed to dominate NFT and DeFi markets. MAGACOIN FINANCE sits at the crossroads of narrative and utility. While it has not yet achieved the level of technological innovation of Solana, nor the research depth of Cardano, it benefits from a growing cultural movement that is helping it capture investor imagination. Analysts note that cultural adoption often plays as strong a role as technical utility in driving early speculative cycles. Technical Analysis and Growth Potential From a charting perspective, MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing early breakout behavior. The token has established strong support near recent lows and is beginning to test higher ranges on increased volume. If momentum holds, a move beyond short-term resistance could quickly accelerate gains toward the next psychological levels. Momentum indicators such as RSI suggest that while the token is not yet overbought, it is gaining strength. Traders point to the possibility of 2× to 3× upside in the near term if the current trajectory continues. Longer term, the comparisons to ADA and SOL imply even higher ceilings if adoption and liquidity continue to grow. Analyst Commentary and Investor Sentiment Market watchers are increasingly vocal about MAGACOIN FINANCE’s potential. Some analysts describe it as a “cultural token with breakout potential,” while others argue it could become a speculative favorite for traders seeking low-cap opportunities in 2025. Community sentiment is also fueling momentum. As retail investors rally behind the token, liquidity is gradually deepening. This is creating conditions where institutional players could eventually take interest, just as they did with Solana and Cardano in earlier stages. MAGACOIN FINANCE in the 2025 Altcoin Landscape The altcoin market in 2025 is evolving around a mix of utility-driven projects and narrative tokens. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out because it straddles both worlds. Its growing community and thematic branding give it visibility, while its development roadmap provides a foundation for future growth. For investors weighing exposure to emerging tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as more than just a short-term play. If it continues building on its momentum, it could transition from a niche cultural project into a recognized altcoin competitor. Conclusion MAGACOIN FINANCE’s $13.5 million success story signals a shift where investors are starting to take note. With references to Cardano and Solana when they were beginning, the project is becoming a potential project to keep a close eye on in 2025. The pieces of a strong narrative are piling up beneath the surface, with technical setups, community adoption and cultural relevance all aligning. For those interested in the best crypto opportunities this year, MAGACOIN FINANCE joins established favourites like ADA and SOL in the spotlight. Its expansion might just be getting started.

In a sea of over 10,000 coins, the challenge is separating short-lived hype from those building real adoption. This cycle has already introduced a new contender that’s stealing attention: BlockDAG . With a presale price locked at $0.0013 and nearly $400 million raised, BlockDAG is setting records before it even launches. Alongside it, established networks like SUI, HBAR, and VeChain are shaping their own paths through utility, partnerships, and adoption milestones. Together, they form a critical snapshot of where the smart money is flowing. Below, we break down why BlockDAG is leading the charge, and how SUI, HBAR, and VeChain compare in today’s volatile but opportunity-rich market. BlockDAG BlockDAG has quickly become one of the strongest contenders for the best crypto right now, rewriting presale history with staggering adoption. The Deployment Event price is locked at $0.0013, giving investors what may be their final golden entry before an explosive listing. The numbers tell the story: more than $400 million raised, 312,000 holders onboarded, and 25.8 billion coins sold across batches. The grassroots traction is unmatched, with the X1 mobile miner app surpassing 3 million users worldwide. Industrial adoption is accelerating too, as 19,000 ASIC miners have shipped across 130 countries, a feat few presale tokens have ever achieved. At its core, BlockDAG runs on a DAG + Proof-of-Work hybrid architecture, achieving speeds of 10 blocks per second with ambitions to exceed 100. This gives it the scalability of Solana, the resilience of Bitcoin, and the flexibility of Ethereum. Whales are noticing: massive buys of $4.4M and $3.6M signal institutional-scale confidence. With a confirmed listing price of $0.05 and forecasts eyeing $1, early investors stand to capture an astonishing 76,815% ROI . For anyone weighing the best crypto right now , BlockDAG’s combination of adoption, funding, and technological advantage makes it the standout pick of this cycle. SUI SUI is consolidating in a tight trading range near $3.35, drawing attention for its potential breakout. Analysts view the $3.15–$3.20 support zone as critical holding this level could unlock a rally toward $3.90. Technical charts show SUI forming a wedge pattern, a classic precursor to sharp price moves. On-chain data is equally supportive, with token burns and gradual supply contraction improving scarcity. Despite wider market caution, investor faith in SUI remains strong due to its fast-growing developer ecosystem. Traders are closely watching volatility, as global sentiment could amplify momentum either way. If the bullish case plays out, SUI could reward patient buyers, solidifying its place among contenders for the best crypto right now in the short-to-medium term. HBAR Hedera’s HBAR is navigating a tricky phase, currently trading near $0.2206 after weeks of selling pressure. Yet its fundamentals remain robust, highlighted by the launch of TransAct , a tool enabling enterprises to use Hedera’s distributed ledger without needing HBAR directly. This simplifies adoption for businesses and strengthens Hedera’s enterprise-focused narrative. Despite this, technicals flash bearish warnings, with downside risks toward $0.20 if momentum stalls. Long-term believers highlight Hedera’s consistent enterprise partnerships and institutional appeal, positioning it as a blockchain for corporate-scale solutions. While not the flashiest pick, HBAR holds its ground as a pragmatic option within the best crypto right now conversation, especially for investors betting on real-world use cases over speculative hype. VeChain VeChain (VET) continues to build relevance through supply chain innovation, though its price action remains modest around $0.02386. Analysts point to mixed signals: a potential decline toward $0.01820 if bearish momentum continues, but also the possibility of a bullish breakout past $0.02725. A double-bottom near $0.020 provides some optimism for reversal, with upside targets stretching as high as $0.0575. Longer-term projections suggest average prices around $0.0544 by 2026, reflecting steady enterprise adoption. As VeChain expands its blockchain applications across logistics and retail, its fundamentals remain strong. While it may not have the explosive trajectory of BlockDAG, VeChain remains an important pick for diversification when considering the best crypto right now with enterprise-driven growth potential. Conclusion When evaluating the best crypto right now , the choice comes down to balancing near-term momentum with long-term scalability. BlockDAG stands as the clear breakout, combining unprecedented presale success with real adoption metrics and whale confidence, a mix that could deliver extraordinary returns. SUI offers a technical setup with breakout potential, while HBAR provides enterprise-grade utility and VeChain anchors itself in supply chain transformation. Each brings a unique edge, but only BlockDAG unites hype, adoption, and scale into one cohesive story. At $0.0013, it offers what may be the final chance to secure life-changing ROI before broader markets catch on. For investors scanning the horizon, the conclusion is clear: BlockDAG isn’t just trending, it’s defining the best crypto right now for those willing to act before deployment.

51286893,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=817367,1757221229,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/51286893.jpeg,Analyst Forecasts XRP To Stage Amazon-Like Rally To $200,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/analyst-forecasts-xrp-to-stage-amazon-like-rally-to-200/,"XRP has drawn plenty of comparisons over the past few months, but one analyst believes the best way to understand its future is to look at Amazon’s past. Nick Anderson, better known as BULLRUNNERS on the social media platform X, says XRP is going through the same kind of consolidation Amazon faced in 2010, and it still has the potential to rally to $200. The key difference, however, is the patience investors will need before this rally can happen. Related Reading: XRP Poised For Amazon-Like Boom? Analyst Predicts $200 Rally Amazon’s Breakout Holds The Clues For XRP XRP’s price action in the past seven days has been highlighted by a trading range between $2.8 and $2.9. The cryptocurrency now seems stuck within this range, but it has managed to hold above $2.8 for the meantime. Interestingly, Anderson likened this consolidation move to a similar retest of a previous high by the Amazon stock (AMZN) back in 2010. In his post, Anderson highlighted how Amazon stock spent roughly 3,800 days consolidating after the dot-com crash before finally breaking past its previous high and entering a meteoric run. However, before entering into this meteoric run, it consolidated for a few months in 2010 just after breaking above its previous high during the dot-com bubble. According to Anderson, XRP’s current structure is tracing out a massive cup and handle that mirrors this exact Amazon stock setup, with the cryptocurrency now using past highs as support in the same way Amazon did. Just as Amazon transformed once it cleared resistance, Anderson believes XRP could follow a similar breakout trajectory that could eventually push its price above $100, and possibly as high as $200. Short-Term Expectations Between $5 And $30 In his assessment, Anderson noted that this predicted rally to $200 might take many years to come to fruition. Comparing today’s price of around $2.80 to Amazon’s $5 launch point before its monumental rally, this would probably be the best time for XRP investors to accumulate for the long term. For younger investors, holding XRP for the next 10 to 15 years could prove transformative, with as little as 10,000 XRP amounting to $1 million in value if the cryptocurrency eventually climbs to $100. Despite his long-term forecast, Anderson is more cautious about what XRP might achieve this cycle. He stated that while a push to $100 in the near term would be “absolutely insane”, a more realistic target for this bull run could lie between $5 and $30. After that, he expects another correction to set in before the rally resumes sometime around the end of the decade.

Anderson also left room for a more explosive scenario, noting that XRP could deliver what he called a “giga rally” if liquidity rushes into the market faster than expected. This is based on the growing anticipation around the adoption of ISO 20022 by the US Federal Reserve. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.81.

It’s coming in the category of low-cap altcoins, having a sub-10-cent price, and is now worth over $2, pointing to past breakout roads. Within these shifts, mature narrative tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are being adopted by the average investor. ETF Buzz Adds Institutional Fuel to Solana’s Bull Case And there’s a real buzz among investors now with the rumors of the Solana ETF that’s coming. Firms like Bitwise, 21Shares, and Franklin Templeton are all putting out clean filings, an indication that there’s a lot of demand for regulatory sign-off. Historically, the approval has resulted in monster rallies – think Bitcoin – so if the approval to list Solana does actually happen, then so might the monster rally. That momentum comes even as on-chain activity has grown. Builders from DeFi and NFT have continued to fall in love with Solana for its fast transactions and low fees, and even applications in government—such as for publishing data—have been showing that the tech can be put to a wider range of uses. Technical Trigger Words: SOL Eyes $250 Breakout Chart-wise, Solana is developing a breakout setup. Price action now closed above some crucial level between $210 and $218. Technically speaking, if SOL holds that zone, the next target up is $250 with further upside going up toward $300 to $305. Momentum studies such as RSI stationed at 63–64 and a positive MACD architecture all support for upward continuation. These patterns are considered to indicate an alignment of institutional positioning to technical formations by analysts. Tiny Altcoin Makes Big Moves While SOL Targets $250 From the chart, Solana is a breakout setup in the making. The price action even closed above a certain significant level which is located between $210 and $218. If SOL stays in the zone, the next target up is $250, with extension upside up to $300 to $305. Momentum studies, RSI, at 63-64 and a MACD construct tracer below zero, all indicates for upwards continuation. Analysts have deemed chart patterns as reflection of institutions positioning alignment to a technical pattern. While SOL has $250 in its sights, another lower cost altcoin piques the interest. That token has already already accrued over $2 in value and more interestingly, comparisons to other strong-return plays like Solana’s own pump Here are some of the startups that have caught investors’ eye with their prospects for a home run. And while people froth at the mouth and get noisier, with the real world just starting to chip in, this low market cap token may be just one big speculative FOMO energy bet on a playing market that only now slowly turning into the next Bitcoin/ETF/BNB-fueled SOL narrative. Narrative Divergence: MAGACOIN FINANCE Enters the Frame Beyond established tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to surface as an alternative narrative play. Its thematic branding around cultural alignment has caught analyst attention—making it another speculative option for investors blending storyline exposure with traditional assets. Analyst Commentary “A close above $218 could be the green light for Solana to test the $250 zone,” says one market chartist, noting the bullish alignment. Another strategist highlighted ETF developments: “If Solana gains ETF clarity, it should attract a wave of institutional capital—even before retail jumps in.” Regarding the low-cap altcoin mention: “Tokens under $0.10 that already exceed $2 tend to show narrative breakout potential. They often mirror early momentum we saw in Solana years ago.” Conclusion The $250 price prediction for Solana has been given a new lease of life, ETF and network adoption, and strong technicals. The ETF hopes that network adoption and technical installations will be convincing enough. Now, breakout alts under $0.10 are already experiencing insane moves, and seem to be signaling some speculative parallel narratives. And for those who want yet more thematic options, MAGACOIN FINANCE provides a narrative path into the niche world of altcoins. You can learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE via the official website.

Analysts are naming Dogecoin a leading meme asset, XRP is on a bullish rally after the clarity provided by regulatory clarity, and an under-the-radar low-cap token below $0.10 is starting to generate buzz. for their own analyst executive chat MAGACOIN FINANCE has also entered the talk as a story-driven competitor. 1. Dogecoin (DOGE) — Meme Power Meets Liquidity It’s not totally clear what has sustained the meme train of dogecoin — now several cycles deep! Analysts say that DOGE has plenty of room to surprise. “DOGE’s liquidity and its community size make it one of the easiest meme coins to trade when sentiment shifts,” one market strategist said this week. “Going into Q4, those things matter more now than ever.” On social media, DOGE communities are abuzz once more, with hashtags popping up again in trending lists. Traders add that a clearance of the $0.25 resistance would open the door for follow-on buying. Meanwhile, Dogecoin continues to be near the top of the Q4 watchlist for those watching meme coins. 2. XRP — Regulatory Clarity and Institutional Momentum Ripple’s token has seen renewed energy since resolving much of its battle with the SEC. Analysts point to this legal progress as a turning point for market sentiment. “Investors are reassessing XRP not just as a speculative asset, but as a currency with ongoing institutional interest,” commented a research analyst from a major crypto desk. “That combination makes it stand out as we head through Q4.” Community channels also highlight increased whale transactions, suggesting larger players are accumulating XRP in anticipation of the next leg up. If institutional adoption of its cross-border payment features continues to scale, XRP could deliver further gains. Investors can follow live XRP updates here .0 3. Low-Cap Hidden Pick — Under-$0.10 Altcoin With Breakout Buzz There’s also a $0.10 crypto that analysts are saying is ready to surge as well. Its low valuation and early community momentum have given it extra visibility this quarter. “These under-the-radar tokens are high risk, but they also offer asymmetric rewards,” observed a crypto analyst in a recent Q4 outlook. “If the adoption or even speculation ramps, they can outperform in a short time. In online forums, early holders describe the project as having “a Solana-in-its-early-days vibe,” which explains why retail traders are circling back to it. This altcoin’s position as a budget-friendly bet makes it attractive for risk-tolerant investors looking beyond top caps. For more, you can see trending low-cap tokens here . 4. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Narrative Token Gains Attention Bullish market analysts also have one watchful eye on MAGACOIN FINANCE, as it continues to flourish in its capacity as a politically-themed, narrative-driven asset. It’s not yet the size of DOGE or XRP, but it is starting to pop up in analyst writes as a play on the other side of the coin. Among trader groups MAGACOIN FINANCE is marked as “one to watch” for anyone looking to get into cultural tokens. Narrative coins, observers say, tend to do well in cycles where attention is as much of a value driver as the fundamentals are. Conclusion As we move further into Q4, Dogecoin continues to be a formidable meme-driven asset, boasting both liquidity and social might. And here we note one more reason why XRP has chances for the upside — institutional demand and fewer regulatory burdens. Hidden under-$0.10 altcoin is marching up and attracting chatter as a breakout candidate, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is trending as a narrative-driven wildcard.

His post highlighted XRP’s trajectory from its early price movements near $0.05, its climb to $3.84, and the possibility of a future rise toward $227. The chart he shared spans over a decade of XRP price data. It plots monthly candles to emphasize long-term structural trends. The analysis was framed around the idea that while history does not replicate exactly, it can often “rhyme.” The chart identifies two clear consolidation phases, each forming a symmetrical triangle pattern . The first pattern, from the early years of XRP’s trading, concluded with an explosive move from pennies to over $3 in 2018. From $0.05 → $3.84 → NEXT $227? History doesn’t repeat, but it sure RHYMES… #XRP pic.twitter.com/6GR2lpDNHX — Amonyx (@amonbuy) September 4, 2025 Patterns Emerging from the Chart According to the chart, XRP has been trading within a second, much larger triangular formation since 2018. This pattern resembles the earlier consolidation period in both structure and duration. The highlighted breakout zones suggest that XRP may be preparing for a significant price expansion. The suggested target of $227 is presented as the next possible phase in this sequence. While no guarantees accompany such chart-based projections, the analysis emphasizes the cyclical nature of markets and the tendency for assets to revisit and extend prior patterns when long-term structures align. Notably, other analysts have shared the $227 target for XRP . By mapping the two consolidation zones side by side, the chart signals that XRP’s long period of sideways trading could be laying the groundwork for a substantial breakout. Extended compression within triangular patterns often precedes sharp directional moves, and in this case, the precedent points upward. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Assessing the Potential Target The projection of $227 stands out as highly ambitious, particularly when compared with XRP’s current price of $2.81. Reaching this triple-digit target would require a climb of 7,978%, and the analysis does not present it as a random figure. Instead, it is derived from the scaling of the earlier breakout relative to the size and timeframe of the present consolidation. XRP beats expectations in 2025, and despite recent underperformance , analysts and experts are convinced that the digital asset could see a major breakout this year.

His post included an image excerpt from the Review of Banking & Financial Law, Volume 36, which contained references to Ripple’s potential role in the global payments ecosystem. By presenting this document, SMQKE highlighted an important perspective on Ripple from Morgan Stanley, one of the world’s largest financial institutions. Even Morgan Stanley “considers Ripple to be a leading international payment alternative to SWIFT.” Yes, it’s documented. https://t.co/ZiU0osDC6D pic.twitter.com/brEUefFXon — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 6, 2025 What the Document Shows The image shared by SMQKE features a passage that outlines Ripple’s cost-saving advantages for banks and remittance providers. It notes that using Ripple, banks can reduce processing costs by up to 60% on certain payments. This efficiency directly benefits remittance recipients by making more funds available after fees. The excerpt goes further by pointing to Ripple’s distributed ledger technology as a possible alternative to the long-established SWIFT system for interbank transactions. Specifically, it references Morgan Stanley’s evaluation of Ripple, citing the firm’s position that adopting a Ripple-like system could “shorten settlement periods, speed up transactions and reduce the risk of fraud.” Importantly, the document also states, “Morgan Stanley considers Ripple to be a leading international payment alternative to Swift,” reinforcing the role XRP and Ripple can play in global finance. What This Means for Ripple and XRP This statement is significant because it reflects the perspective of a global financial powerhouse analyzing the impact of blockchain technology on traditional banking. It also shows XRP’s viability as a competitor in the international payments space . The efficiency gains outlined in the excerpt highlight the asset’s ability to streamline transactions, improve liquidity, and lower costs. These observations indirectly strengthen XRP’s adoption. The broader ecosystem supporting Ripple’s solutions relies on XRP to provide on-demand liquidity and enhance cross-border settlement processes. If Ripple’s technology serves as an alternative to SWIFT, XRP will play a central role in supporting the infrastructure, acting as a bridge currency for the payment system. SMQKE’s post sheds light on a documented perspective that elevates Ripple’s status beyond a niche blockchain solution. By referencing Morgan Stanley’s view of Ripple as a leading international payment alternative to SWIFT, the excerpt reinforces the seriousness with which Ripple’s model is taken in mainstream finance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 For observers of XRP and its ecosystem, this adds weight to the argument that Ripple has established itself as a credible force in reshaping global payments , with XRP at the forefront.

With technical resistance, ETF demand, and on-chain patterns in play, ETH’s path remains dynamic. Also in focus is MAGACOIN FINANCE, drawing attention as a thematic counterpoint for speculative-minded investors. Resistance at $4,450 Defines Next Move Ethereum price is holding ground above $4,411, with the $4,450 to $4,500 area acting as a hurdle. Analysts also note this as key technical pivot: a daily close above this level might spur a move to $4,593 and then $4,729, perhaps unlocking an implied target of $6,000. On-chain data does, however, reveal strong ETF demand and significant accumulation from whales when taken into consideration, which is consistent with a bullish structure. These forces imply that investor conviction is still awash even as spot prices are choppy for now. Technical Patterns Support Upside if Key Levels Clear The chart pattern suggests Ethereum may be developing a Wyckoff accumulation, a pattern that precedes an upside breakout when demand surpasses supply. In addition, medium-term Fibonacci analysis suggests upside targets around the $6,000-$6,750 price range, and a successful retest of the $4,400 support may increase the likelihood for continuation of gains. There would probably be good momentum to the upside for a clean break. Fundamental Backing from ETF Flows and Scarcity Trends Ethereum’s fundamentals back the technical narrative. ETFs continue to see steady inflows, suggesting increasing institutional adoption. At the same time, on-chain data indicates that Ether supply on exchanges is tightening, increasing scarcity and demand for a higher price. These settings rhyme with previous cycles, when soaring demand and limited supply incited steep rallies. Investors view this recipe as setting the stage for a move toward the $6,000 level, despite some short-term spot weakness.

CryptoPotato reported the XRP Trust launch, which saw the light of day on September 5, 2024, and was immediately followed by an impressive price increase for the underlying asset. Yet, its valuation at the time of under $0.6 was nowhere near the heights of today at almost $2.8. The product had an impressive initial year as it enables investors to gain exposure to the token without having to worry about the challenges of buying, storing, and safekeeping it, as the website explains. The Trust tracks the XRP market price, but the fees and expenses are more modest. With 301,500 outstanding shares, the total assets under management have skyrocketed to almost $17 million, according to the site as of Friday’s closing. Grayscale’s XRP Trust Performance ETF Next? As with its BTC and ETH Trusts, Grayscale was quick to file with the US SEC to convert its XRP product into a fully regulated spot exchange-traded fund. This happened shortly after Donald J. Trump was inaugurated as the 47th US president, Gary Gensler stepped down as SEC Chair, and it became more than evident that there would be more favorable regulations for the cryptocurrency industry. Given its success in converting its Bitcoin and Ethereum Trusts into spot ETFs, the filing with the securities regulator is regarded as almost a guaranteed path for an XRP ETF. However, Grayscale has tons of competition in that field as the total number of such applications sitting on the SEC’s desk is 15. The odds for an approval by the end of the year on Polymarket have skyrocketed to 94% after dipping below 70% just a few weeks ago. Moreover, many experts believe that the actual chances are closer to 100%.

The company revealed that Maxwell Stein, BlackRock’s Director of Digital Assets, will feature as one of the event’s speakers. His inclusion quickly became one of the most discussed points about the conference, given the asset manager’s influence in traditional and digital finance. Stein is scheduled to appear alongside Rory Callagy of Moody’s Investors Services. According to Ripple’s published agenda, their session will explore the impact of tokenized financial assets on capital markets. While the program outlines the broad scope of his presentation, it does not specify whether Stein will address the possibility of a BlackRock-backed XRP exchange-traded product. This uncertainty has fueled anticipation among XRP supporters, many of whom are eager to learn more about BlackRock’s current position on digital assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. XRP Community Watches for ETF Clues BlackRock has long been a central player in the digital asset investment space, offering dedicated funds tied to Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, the firm has so far refrained from applying for an XRP-based ETF . Market watchers have frequently linked this decision to the prolonged legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Even though the lawsuit concluded last month , BlackRock has maintained that there are no immediate plans to launch an XRP fund. Stein’s appearance at Swell comes at a time when institutional interest in XRP is steadily growing. Several asset managers have already submitted filings for potential XRP ETFs , making BlackRock’s silence more notable. The presence of its Director of Digital Assets at Ripple’s flagship event has raised questions about whether the firm might reconsider its position in the near future. Ripple Reveals Full Conference Agenda Beyond BlackRock’s participation, Ripple also shared the full agenda for Swell 2025. The program confirms that the two-day conference will bring together executives from leading financial and technology organizations. Among the listed participants are Ripple Chairman Chris Larsen, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, Nasdaq Chair Adena Friedman, and OKX CIO Jason Lau. The event will open with a welcome reception on November 3, followed by the official start the next morning. Ripple President Monica Long will deliver the opening remarks and later join Adena Friedman for a fireside chat. Other sessions on the first day will cover topics such as stablecoins in cross-border payments and the evolving role of crypto ETFs. The day will end with a social gathering branded “Swellebration.” Day two will shift the focus toward broader issues facing the industry, including the global adoption of digital assets, the regulatory landscape in the United States, and strategies for addressing illicit activity in the sector. A keynote session and a fireside chat with Ripple’s chief executive will conclude the conference. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 BlackRock’s Role While Ripple has confirmed Stein’s role at the conference, it remains uncertain whether his remarks will signal any change in BlackRock’s approach to XRP. For now, the asset manager continues to concentrate on Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, its presence at Swell ensures heightened attention from investors who want to gauge how traditional finance leaders view the future of the digital asset market.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized lending protocol that is currently in presale is demonstrating both. MUTM is already one of the most discussed under-one-dollar DeFi projects with over 16,100 holders already involved and experts estimating it will produce 30x returns. Proof of Demand The most obvious manifestation of traction is in the numbers. Mutuum Finance has gradually increased in price since its earlier presale in early 2025 at only $0.01 per token, undergoing 6 stages to get to its present value of $0.035. The presale has accumulated over $15.4 million so far, which indicates that retail buyers and whale investors have a strong appetite. The newest inflows are six-figure buys by larger players, which is good news to the smaller investors who tend to use whales as a gauge of conviction. In the meantime, the next Phase 7 price increase of $0.04, almost 20% points higher than today, explains the rush to enter before prices rise further. History has shown that the largest multiples can be delivered by tokens priced less than 1 with real utility. Ripple (XRP), Aave (AAVE), and Solana (SOL) all began small and grew to household names. XRP provided 100x to early adopters, Aave shot to more than $600 in the 2021 DeFi boom and Solana soared to a few dollars and over $250 at its peak. However, what made them generate such disproportionate returns was not price, but time and adoption. First-movers knew that the tokens were resolving very real issues in blockchain infrastructure, and the affordability and demand created ideal circumstances to blow up. MUTM is now being positioned in a similar way. With a launch price set at just $0.06, it carries both affordability and an adoption-ready roadmap that could place it on the same growth trajectory as previous cycle leaders. Why MUTM Fits This Pattern Mutuum Finance is developing capabilities that will be adopted over the long-term. It is a dual lending market structure that integrates Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools, where users lend out assets and receive interest in the form of mtTokens, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, where borrowers are able to negotiate stable or variable rates. Such flexibility makes it more attractive to conservative and risk-takers. The other driver of adoption is its beta platform that will be launched alongside the listing of the token. This would imply that lending and borrowing will occur on day one, which is not a common feat in presale projects that normally take months to become operational. To go a notch higher, the Layer-2 integration is in the pipeline, which promises cheap-fast transactions and also makes the protocol scalable to mass adoption. This combined with the fact that MUTM has an advantage as a protocol that is prepared to compete in the current environment of DeFi, rather than a few years later. Built for Longevity In addition to short-term characteristics, MUTM is designed with the concept of sustainability. One of the biggest achievements will be the release of its overcollateralized stablecoin, with a mint-and-burn system like the established players but directly embedded in the protocol. Such a stablecoin will be a source of trustable liquidity, a vital part of a lending ecosystem. Another support layer is the buy-and-distribute model. Part of the protocol fees will be spent to buy MUTM on the open market and redistribute it to the community. This generates the continuity of purchasing pressure, and the price of the token is directly linked to the activity of the platform. Meanwhile, mtTokens (like mtUSDT) allow depositors to earn interest automatically and stake for additional rewards, creating multiple income streams for users and encouraging long-term participation. Security Layer Security has been and will always be the most significant aspect of DeFi, and Mutuum Finance has gone a long way to establish trust. The project has already passed a CertiK audit receiving a score of 95/100 one of the highest scores that a new protocol can receive. To cap it all, there has been the introduction of a $50,000 bug bounty program to motivate white-hat hackers to test the system to the limit and expose vulnerabilities before full implementation. Additional security measures that protect the platform include risk controls like overcollateralization, liquidation, and integrating oracles through Chainlink and fallback systems. Such precautions are taken to ensure that Mutuum Finance is ready to face the technical and market risks as it expands its adoption. Investment Case Study The possible upward potential is better understood in terms of percentage gains in stages. At the present price of $0.035, investors who make an entry will experience close to 100% growth at the time of launch, which is at 0.06. Phase 1 early investors at 0.01 are already sitting on returns of approximately 300% and have an option of enrolling 500-600% at launch. However the real multiples, says analysts, start after listing. Existing investors would make almost 1000% with short-time goals of about $0.4. On the long-term forecasts of $1.5-$2.00 in 2026, it would imply over 4,000% increase in the current levels. The explosive crypto growth formula has never been difficult: mix evidence of demand with actual utility, and long-term prospects. Ripple demonstrated it through 100x returns, Solana through its rocket-ship growth and Aave through its DeFi supremacy. Similar early signs are present now at Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Having more than 16,100 holders already invested, having raised over $15.4M, audited security and a roadmap that brings utility on day one, experts believe it has the ingredients to become a 30x token. To the ones seeking the next breakout under $1, the argument in favor of MUTM is gaining more and more weight each day.

WLFI froze Tron founder Justin Sun’s wallets after unusual transactions raised concerns of insider selling. Sun is pressing the project to unfreeze his allocated tokens. World Liberty Financial Drama Continues On launch day, the community allocation, initially expected to be 5%, only saw 4% of tokens actually go live, as not everyone utilized the designated lockbox. WeRate co-founder Quinten Francois explained that liquidity and marketing, initially reported as 1.6%, actually accounted for 2.8% of the supply. This brought the circulating supply effectively to 6.8%. Meanwhile, other allocations, such as the 10% ecosystem fund and 7.8% reserved for Alt5 Sigma, weren’t truly circulating. In fact, Francois said that they were simply unlocked but not subject to vesting schedules, which created an illusion of available supply that complicated price dynamics. Adding to the complexity, Justin Sun held 3% of WLFI’s total supply. Only 20% of his stake was technically unlocked at launch. He publicly promised not to sell, saying that he supported World Liberty Financial’s long-term goal. The token debuted at $0.20, with a $1 billion market cap, while trading volumes spiked into the billions, generating intense hype. Despite this, WLFI’s price steadily declined, and the on-chain price action appeared suspiciously mechanical rather than driven by genuine community selling. Francois suggested a likely scenario behind the volatility. Exchanges may have offloaded part of the 2.8% liquidity allocation, while Sun allegedly leveraged his connections with HTX, offering users 20% APY to deposit WLFI. This setup would allow him to quietly sell his personal holdings while making it seem as if tokens were being staked by users, and even backfill user withdrawals with his own stack if necessary. Reports indicate Sun moved early $9 million worth of WLFI tokens through HTX and Binance from his addresses, activity tracked by Nansen, Bubblemaps, and Arkham Intelligence. Ultimately, WLFI froze Sun’s wallet using the guardianSetBlacklistStatus function, following these suspicious transfers. The freeze fueled speculation that Sun used user deposits to liquidate his holdings, turning retail investors into exit liquidity. Sun’s Public Appeal A community member praised WLFI’s governance vote that froze Sun’s address, saying it at least temporarily blocks him from repeating prior patterns of alleged pumping and dumping tokens on retail investors. Meanwhile, Sun has publicly appealed to the World Liberty Financial team to restore access. He described the freezing of his tokens as “unreasonable” and stressed that, like other early investors, he “deserves the same rights.” In a bid to calm nerves and regain investor confidence, Sun also went into damage control mode and tweeted that he sees US-listed crypto stocks as “an undervalued opportunity.” He further pledged to personally buy another $10 million of WLFI.

It is important to start here, since the proposed vehicle, does not buy cryptocurrencies, but buys shares of companies whose business depends heavily on the crypto ecosystem (miners, exchanges, custodians, infrastructure providers, asset managers, and also some large companies with relevant crypto initiatives). This means that its performance is closely linked to the health of the sector, to activity in crypto-asset markets, and, by extension, to the prices of assets such as bitcoin or ether, but it does so through quoted shares, with the operation and regulation of a traditional ETF. The fund’s own documentation underlines that it does not invest directly in crypto or derivatives; the exposure is indirect via corporates (“Crypto Innovators”). With this, the reader will wonder how the index decides which companies enter and with what weight in it. The methodology used by the management team divides the universe into two levels. Tier 1 (at least 80% of the index) groups so-called “pure-play,” which are companies that earn more than 75% of their revenues from the crypto market (for example, miners or trading and custody platforms) or that have more than 75% of their assets in bitcoin or ether. Tier 2 (up to 20%) includes large companies (capitalization ≥ $10 billion) with a significant and public initiative in the field of crypto – by business or by holding crypto-assets. In each quarterly review, the index selects the top 20 in Tier 1 and the top 10 in Tier 2. The weight of Tier 1 is set at 85% of the index and Tier 2 at 15%; within Tier 1 it is weighted by free float adjusted capitalization, and Tier 2 is weighted equally. That construction has practical consequences for the investor. On the one hand, it provides “clean” exposure to the heart of the ecosystem—the sector’s so-called “picks & shovels”—and avoids excessive dilutions toward generalist technologists. On the other hand, it introduces different sensitivities within the same ETF: miners depend on variables such as the price of bitcoin, the difficulty of mining, and the electric cost; exchanges/custodians live off activity (volume and new highs), in addition to prices; and companies that hold BTC/ETH on their balance sheets move largely with those assets. In recent data, the fund's own prospectus breaks down a relevant weight into segments such as Mining and Trading & Custody, illustrating those operating levers within the portfolio. Like any equities ETF, its NAV rises or falls depending on the shares it owns. In a bullish environment, the crypto industry usually benefits in three ways: better miners’ margins (high BTC price versus costs), higher commission income and new lines of business in exchanges/custodians when volume rises, and direct balance sheet appreciation with BTC/ETH in treasury holding companies. In contrast, in downturns or with regulatory repression, volumes fall, margins are compressed, and on-balance-sheet crypto holdings subtract. To this must be added the equity risk (dilutions, capital issues to finance mining capex, technological and cyclical risks, etc.). Analysis - Macro Fundamental In this section, we will analyze some macroeconomic indicators in detail to try to offer the reader an accurate perspective and a sound recommendation on the vehicle in question. For this analysis, the first metric we analyzed is the Node Analytica indicator called Liquidity Scanner. This metric summarizes, in terms of quarterly change, whether the US dollar financial system is injecting or withdrawing liquidity, and breaks it down into four broad channels: (1) Fed bank reserves (when they rise, it is usually gasoline for risky assets), (2) issuance of Treasury bills (“bills”) and (3) commercial paper (which tends to absorb cash from the money market), and (4) repo operations linked to stress episodes or technical adjustments. Visually, positive tranches indicate net supply and negative net drainage. For an ETF like the one discussed here, which does not buy crypto directly but rather companies whose business depends on the ecosystem’s pulse, this “water level” is crucial. Higher USD liquidity typically translates into a better risk appetite, more generous multiples, and more activity (volume) across platforms and custodians. Conversely, if liquidity were to contract, it would imply multiple compression, more expensive funding for capex-intensive miners, and often volume drops that weigh on commission income. Today, the graph suggests a more volatile and mixed regime than the big boost of 2020–2021. We can see tranches of supply associated with increases in reserves or episodes of repo, but also tranches of absorption when the Treasury pulls short issuance and the money market takes a large part of those dollars. This indicator could be used as a regime filter. When the indicator chains positive readings and accelerates (rising reserves and lower absorption per bills), beta crypto tends to expand, and the ETF tends to benefit via mining margins and brokerage fees. Node Analytica Second, we delve into a more specific metric of the digital asset sector, which is the analysis of factors of the same. This indicator shows us what factor is commanding right now in Bitcoin and, by extension, what kind of exposure tends to work best. When the purple block (“UpBeta”) dominates, the market is rewarding the upward directional beta, which means clean impulses, stretches where you buy risk and let the trend run. For an ETF like the one analyzed here, which brings together miners and intermediation platforms, that regime is especially favorable, because they are companies with operating leverage to the crypto cycle. If the price rises steadily, miners’ margin improves and exchange activity picks up, and both tend to widen the advance against an equivalent move by BTC itself. By contrast, when the frame shifts to Mean Reversion (turquoise) or there are flashes of breakout intermittently, the message is another: more noise, more comings and goings, and more risk of a high-beta ETF like BITQ “over-reacting” in short corrections. Today, the chart shows us a long stretch with UpBeta as the winning factor, chained since late spring and with few interruptions, while the price of BTC is trading at the top of the range of recent months. The investor’s reading is clear in this regard. The trend environment is still active, and as long as it remains, BITQ tends to perform well for the mix of cyclic miners and volume-linked businesses. In other words, this metric is not meant to guess the future, but to describe the regime you're sailing in, which, combined with the Liquidity Scanner in the first section, can help you distinguish when the tide is ticking (positive liquidity + UpBeta) and when it's prudent to deleverage or demand clearer confirmations. Node Analytica Conclusion As a conclusion and to finish this analysis, my recommendation right now is to buy tactically (staggered tickets and in reversals). The Factor Framework marks a sustained UpBeta regime, that is, the market is rewarding the upward trend, and that usually amplifies the profitability of our ETF for the operating leverage of miners and the rebound of activity in exchanges. At the same time, the Liquidity Scanner does not show as broad a tailwind as 2020–21, but neither does it show persistent drainage, rather a mixed pattern that allows for stretches of risk when it coincides with a favorable narrative.

Solana currently trades at $202.35, down a slim 0.88%. While the token continues to be in favor as one of the top Layer 1 networks, the spotlight is increasingly turning to Remittix (RTX). At a presale price of $0.1050 per token, the cross-border payments project has raised over $24,2 million and sold over 649 million tokens. As it builds up to its soon-to-be-launched wallet beta, many whales are setting up RTX as the best crypto to buy now. Solana Price Trends Amid Broader Market Activity Although the Solana Price dropped recently, its market cap of $109.56 billion reflects strong investor sentiment. The trading volume has also increased by 43.62% to $7.3 billion, reflecting ongoing liquidity. Solana remains one of the top choice blockchains for DeFi applications, NFT stores and low gas fee cryptocurrency transactions. But as investors monitor Solana, more and more are looking for the next altcoin 2025 big one. It is here that initiatives such as Remittix take top position, with practical everyday utility which is significantly more than speculation. How Remittix Is Positioning for Wider Adoption Remittix is a cross-chain DeFi platform solving a $19 trillion global payments problem. Its technology enables individuals to send cryptocurrencies directly to bank accounts in 30+ nations, linking decentralized finance with actual use. Unlike most crypto presales live now, RTX offers immediate use cases such as instant payments, low gas charges and real-time FX conversion. Global Utility: Fast transfers of crypto to fiat within minutes Wallet Launch: Q3 2025 beta launch Strong Momentum: Raised $24,2 Million+ and continues to grow Major Listings: BitMart and LBANK as initial centralized exchanges The project is leaving commitments behind and entering the phase of product delivery with its Remittix Wallet announcement. The wallet will offer users seamless borderless payments, crypto staking possibilities and enhanced security. Presale Success and Exchange Listings Remittix has quickly become one of the top-performing crypto under $1 with whales driving its bullish momentum. Presale recently crossed $20M, triggering the initial exchange listing on BitMart. Not long after, the project crossed $22M, announcing a second listing on LBANK. These centralized exchanges are crucial for expanding global reach, adding liquidity and exposure to RTX. And making it even more thrilling, Remittix launched a $250,000 Giveaway, incentivizing pioneers and encouraging community engagement. Such encouragement, combined with deflationary tokenomics, makes RTX a compelling option for early-stage cryptocurrency investment. Looking Ahead With over 649 million tokens traded and strong demand, Remittix is one of the leading DeFi projects 2025. With its utility, adoption and exchange pull, it’s a new altcoin to monitor this year.

While most larger-cap alts are sluggish during the weekend, some, such as M, WLFI, and OKB, have marked impressive gains. BTC Defends $110K The primary cryptocurrency had a volatile week that started on the wrong foot on Monday. It traded around $109,500 on Sunday, but the bears quickly took control and pushed it south to a multi-month low of $107,200 (on Bitstamp). It reacted well, initially, to this decline, but tested that level once again on Tuesday. The bulls finally reemerged at this point and didn’t allow another retracement. Just the opposite, BTC started to build momentum and pushed past $112,000 on Wednesday. It was stopped there at first, but the cryptocurrency went on the offensive once again on Friday when it surged beyond $113,400 after the latest US jobs report. However, that was another fakeout as the asset plummeted by over three grand almost immediately. Although the weekend has been calmer, BTC still slipped to $110,000 yesterday. So far, it has remained above that level as it even tested $111,000 minutes ago. Its market cap sits at $2.210 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is stagnant at 56.4%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView OKB Above $200 Most of the larger-cap alts have failed to post any big moves in the past day. ETH, SOL, TRX, and SUI are slightly in the red, while XRP, BNB, DOGE, ADA, LINK, and HYPE are with minor gains. CRO has declined the most from the larger caps, losing over 3% of value. In contrast, M continues with its massive run as of late. Another 20% surge has pushed MemeCore to almost $1.9. WLFI is also on the run, surging to $0.24 after a 29% daily pump. OKX’s native token has returned to over $200 after a 13% jump. The cumulative market cap of all crypto assets has added a few billion since yesterday and is up to $3.910 trillion on CG.

He recently shared a chart noting that the digital asset is trading within a descending triangle with a potential 25% breakout on the horizon. The observation comes at a time when XRP has been struggling to maintain upward momentum, reflecting a broader cooling period in the altcoin market. $XRP consolidates in a triangle ahead of a 25% price move! pic.twitter.com/zeuFQNkc5s — Ali (@ali_charts) September 6, 2025 Recent Market Performance In recent weeks, XRP has failed to reclaim the strong gains it posted in July. The price slipped back from its all-time high of $3.65 , weighed down by profit-taking and broader risk-off conditions in digital assets. By early September, the digital asset experienced another decline , finding support close to $2.7. XRP had settled near the $2.80 mark, but the decline has underlined the asset’s inability to sustain its mid-August rally, leaving traders cautious about the next directional move. Technical Structure on the Chart The chart Martinez shared provides a closer look at the current market setup. On the 12-hour timeframe, XRP is confined within a descending triangle pattern . The structure is defined by a series of lower highs meeting strong horizontal support in the $2.7 to $2.8 zone. Fibonacci retracement levels drawn from the recent price swings provide context, showing the asset’s price activity repeatedly rejecting the downward trendline. The combination of resistance along the descending trendline and support close to $2.7 highlights an increasingly compressed trading range. Market participants often view such formations as precursors to strong volatility, as consolidation phases tend to resolve with a decisive move once price breaks beyond established boundaries. The Projected Move According to Martinez’s assessment, XRP may be approaching the point of resolution. A breakout from this formation could trigger a move of approximately 25% from current levels. With the token trading at $2.8155 at the time of his post, such a projection implies a potential upside target close to $3.52. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If XRP were to reach this target, it would mark the first significant test of resistance above $3.4 since late July, an area that previously capped upward attempts. The asset may also turn that level to support, creating a base for another price surge. While the market has exhibited weakness in recent weeks, accumulation at lower levels suggests that buyers are still active. A breakout above the descending trendline would be required to confirm the anticipated 25% rally. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Ripple Officials and Experts Respond,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-coinbase-manipulating-the-xrp-price-ripple-officials-and-experts-respond/,"A recent controversy in the cryptocurrency world has centered on allegations that Coinbase manipulated XRP prices. The allegations were raised by XRP community activist Stern Drew using the on-chain analysis tool XRPScan. According to Drew's analysis, Coinbase's XRP holdings fell from around 970 million in June to between 260 and 300 million by the end of August. During the same period, the number of the exchange's XRP wallets also fell from 52 to 16. Drew claimed that Coinbase sold XRP during periods of low liquidity and distributed it across multiple wallets, coinciding with XRP's failure to break through the $1.20 resistance level at the time. He also claimed that these transactions were directed to over-the-counter (OTC) desks affiliated with traditional financial institutions, suggesting that the price suppression strategy may have been designed to create opportunities for institutional buying. Related News: Controversial Claim from Bloomberg Senior Analyst: ""Bitcoin Price Could Lose One Zero"" There is currently no official evidence to support these claims. Coinbase has not commented on the matter, and there are no investigations or sanctions in the works. Experts believe the decline in Coinbase's XRP holdings is largely due to liquidity management and portfolio adjustments. Similar trading patterns are also being observed on major exchanges and OTC desks. “We all know Coinbase doesn't like XRP, but the price movements were similar when it was delisted from Coinbase in the past. The actual price movements are tied to overall market trends,” said XRP advocate Bill Morgan. Ripple CTO David Schwartz also rejected allegations of market manipulation, arguing that the XRP price is determined by market uncertainties, regulatory issues, and macroeconomic trends. Claims that Coinbase is manipulating XRP prices are currently just speculation based on internal community analysis. *This is not investment advice.

USDH will be deployed on both HyperEVM and HyperCore. The company ensures global distribution compliance with the U.S. GENIUS Act, Europe’s MiCA, and regulatory frameworks across APAC, the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa. Paxos believes its global compliance coverage and connectivity to consumer banking will enable Hyperliquid to transition from an ecosystem for crypto natives to a financial platform for global users. Paxos plans to use USDH yield for HYPE buyback and redistribution Proposal submitted: USDH powered by Paxos USDH issued by Paxos would mean: ❏ Global issuance that is GENIUS compliant ❏ Revenue sharing that fuels HYPE, protocols and validators ❏ Regulatory clarity + global scale to match @HyperliquidX 's explosive growth Hyperliquid. pic.twitter.com/iKIFUOT0bQ — Paxos (@Paxos) September 6, 2025 Paxos said its mission has always been to scale access to on-chain finance by partnering with platforms while maintaining enterprise-grade security, technology, and compliance. According to the company, USDH has a revenue-sharing mechanism that supports HYPE, and the validators. It ensures compliance and scale to match Hyperliquid’s rapid growth. Hyperiquid was the first to introduce the concept of sharing exchange revenue with those who drive volume to its protocol. Paxos said its USDH will boost the initiative to allow those who contribute to the growth of the stablecoin to retain a share of the underlying revenue. The company plans to use 95% of the interest generated by its reserves backing USDH to repurchase HYPE and redistribute it back to ecosystem initiatives. Paxos plans to hold the highest quality reserves of T-Bills, Repos, and USDG, acknowledging that USDH will be required to be supported by U.S. market makers and exchanges. According to the report, revenue share will equal the USDH balances and volumes across partnering Hyperliquid platforms. The redistribution initiative aims to allocate the bought-back HYPE among protocols, validators, and users. Paxos argued that Hyperliquid’s next phase of growth requires the trust of institutions and consumer enterprises that want to interact on-chain. The firm hopes to use its global enterprise distribution to integrate Hyperliquid into the global financial system by expanding beyond crypto-native users towards major enterprises. “We believe Hyperliquid will be the foundational platform for global, decentralized finance. This is why Paxos is committed to making Hyperliquid the first priority with Paxos Labs, a new entity dedicated to accelerating stablecoin adoption within decentralized ecosystems.” – Bhau Kotecha , CoFounder of Paxos Labs. Kotecha revealed that Paxos Labs has acquired Molecular Labs in a bid to accelerate stablecoin adoption in the Hyperliquid ecosystem. Molecular Labs is the infrastructure provider behind LHYPE and WHLP, which have powered the Hyperliquid ecosystem since HyperEVM launched. Paxos said LHYPE will contribute to the Hyperliquid ecosystem since it utilizes Hyperlend, HypurrFi, Felix, and is deployed on Pendle, HypurrFi, and other decentralized exchanges (DEXs). WHLP aims to enable composability with Hyperliquid’s foundational yield source deployed on DEXs. The tokenization platform stated that the USDH stablecoin is purpose-built to drive global adoption and align incentives with builders and users on Hyperliquid. The blockchain company also plans to add support for HYPE as an asset within Paxo’s brokerage infrastructure. Hyperliquid seeks proposals from teams ready to launch USDH Hyperliquid said it’s launching its dollar-pegged asset in its network upgrade and is opening the process to competition among development teams to submit proposals. The firm said that after a validator quorum approves a candidate, the chosen team will still need to win a gas auction before deployment goes live. Omar Kanji, partner at Dragonfly, explained that Hyperliquid’s initiative could significantly impact existing stablecoin providers on the protocol. According to him, the initiative could disrupt Circle’s USDC, which is currently the main settlement stablecoin for derivatives trading on Hyperliquid. Kanji believes that a complete switch to USDH could generate an additional $220 million in annualized revenue for HYPE token holders, based on a 4% yield assumption. He also stated that the migration would cut into Circle’s revenues by the same amount. The tech executive also mentioned that the initiative would represent a 7% reduction in USDC’s outstanding supply, currently sitting at $5.5 billion on the platform.

Why USDC & USDT Dominate in 2025,https://bitzo.com/2025/09/betting-with-stablecoins-why-usdc-usdt-dominate-in-2025,"In 2025, stablecoins have become the backbone of online betting and crypto gambling platforms. While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain popular, their volatility makes them less practical for day-to-day wagers. Instead, two stablecoins—USDC (USD Coin) and USDT (Tether)—dominate the space, offering gamblers stability, speed, and accessibility. Stability Meets Speed For bettors, the biggest draw of USDC and USDT is price stability. Pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, both stablecoins remove the uncertainty of fluctuating token values. This means that a $100 bet today will still be worth $100 tomorrow—something that cannot be guaranteed with BTC or SOL. On top of that, transactions settle quickly, particularly on low-fee chains like Tron or Solana, allowing instant deposits and withdrawals on most platforms. Widespread Adoption Both coins are accepted almost universally across betting sites. USDT, thanks to its long-standing dominance in crypto trading, is integrated on virtually every exchange and payment rail. USDC, backed by Circle and increasingly used in regulated environments, has gained traction for users who prefer transparency and stronger compliance. Together, they cover both ends of the spectrum: USDT for sheer liquidity and USDC for trust in audits and oversight. The Network Effect Another reason for their dominance is network effect. Many betting platforms prefer stablecoins because they simplify accounting and reduce the risk of volatility-related losses. Players, in turn, flock to platforms that support stablecoins, creating a feedback loop of adoption. By 2025, it’s become rare to find a gambling site without USDC or USDT support. Why They Beat Other Options Alternatives like DAI, FRAX, or algorithmic stablecoins exist, but they haven’t achieved the same scale. Concerns about collateralization, liquidity, or regulatory pressure keep them in the niche category. For now, USDC and USDT hold the lion’s share, with unmatched liquidity, market trust, and utility. Dexsport: Multi-Chain Betting With Stablecoins and Beyond One of the best examples of how stablecoins power betting in 2025 is Dexsport.io , a crypto-native sportsbook and casino built for speed, privacy, and control.

The sportsbook side covers 100+ markets per football match, along with MMA, basketball, and esports such as CS2, Dota 2, and Valorant. Live streaming is available even without a deposit. For transparency, Dexsport operates a public live bet desk where all bets and outcomes are visible in real time.

The platform continuously adds content too, recently expanding its Bitcoin casino with 5,000+ games from providers like NetEnt, Pragmatic Play, and Evolution.

Boost Your Odds, Stack Your Rewards — Try Dexsport Platform Now Outlook for the Future Looking forward, the landscape could shift if new regulatory frameworks boost USDC further or if decentralized stablecoins gain credibility.

A truly significant Bitcoin price surge has captured global attention, with BTC remarkably climbing above the $111,000 mark. This thrilling development, confirmed by Bitcoin World market monitoring, shows Bitcoin trading robustly at $111,000 on the Binance USDT market. It signals a renewed wave of optimism and highlights the immense potential still held by the world’s leading digital asset. What’s Fueling This Astonishing Bitcoin Price Surge? This impressive rally isn’t happening in isolation; rather, it’s often the culmination of various interconnected factors. Understanding these elements helps us grasp the broader picture behind such significant movements in the crypto market. Growing Market Optimism: A prevailing positive sentiment frequently drives investor confidence. This leads to increased buying pressure as more individuals and entities seek to participate in the potential upside. Institutional Adoption: We are witnessing growing interest and adoption from large financial institutions and corporations. Their entry often injects substantial capital, providing significant momentum to the market. Macroeconomic Landscape: Global economic conditions, including concerns about inflation or traditional asset performance, can position Bitcoin as an attractive alternative or hedge. Investors look for safe havens, and sometimes, Bitcoin fits that role. Technological Progress: Continuous improvements and innovations within the Bitcoin network, alongside the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, enhance its utility and security, boosting its overall appeal to a wider audience. Each of these factors, individually or in combination, contributes to the powerful upward momentum seen in this current Bitcoin price surge . The Significance of BTC Reaching $111,000 Reaching such a high valuation is far more than just a numerical achievement; it represents a crucial psychological and technical milestone for Bitcoin. This particular Bitcoin price surge validates the asset’s inherent resilience and its rapidly growing acceptance within the mainstream financial world. Reinforced Market Confidence: This price point strengthens investor belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its potential as a store of wealth. Setting New Precedents: While not an all-time high, breaking significant psychological barriers like $111,000 often sets the stage for further gains, building positive sentiment for future price discovery. Increased Mainstream Visibility: Such substantial price movements invariably attract widespread media attention. This heightened visibility introduces Bitcoin to new audiences, potentially drawing in fresh capital and participants into the ecosystem. Ultimately, this milestone underscores Bitcoin’s increasing maturity and its undeniable presence as a significant global financial asset. Navigating the Volatility: Opportunities and Risks with a Bitcoin Price Surge While an exciting Bitcoin price surge offers considerable opportunities, it is absolutely essential to remember the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Prices can fluctuate rapidly, and what goes up can also come down. Potential for Substantial Gains: For investors who entered the market earlier or bought during previous dips, this surge can translate into significant unrealized or realized returns. Risk of Market Corrections: After any substantial rally, market corrections are a common and natural occurrence. Prices may retrace to find new, stronger support levels before attempting further upward movement. Importance of Risk Management: Savvy investors always prioritize sound risk management strategies. This includes diversifying portfolios, setting clear investment goals, and crucially, only investing capital that one can comfortably afford to lose. Understanding these dynamics is paramount for making informed and responsible decisions in such a fast-moving and often unpredictable market. What Does the Future Hold for Bitcoin After This Surge? The recent Bitcoin price surge naturally sparks widespread conversations and speculation about its future trajectory. While making precise price predictions is impossible due to market complexities, current trends and expert insights offer some valuable perspectives. Continued Institutional Integration: Many analysts anticipate that institutional adoption will only deepen, with more traditional financial players integrating Bitcoin into their offerings and portfolios. This could drive sustained demand. Technological Evolution: Ongoing technological advancements, such as improvements to the Lightning Network for faster and cheaper transactions, aim to enhance Bitcoin’s scalability and practical utility. Regulatory Landscape: Greater global regulatory clarity, when it materializes, could provide a more stable and predictable environment for Bitcoin’s growth, potentially attracting even more mainstream investment. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s long-term future will be shaped by a complex interplay of market forces, continuous technological evolution, and broader macroeconomic shifts. Its journey remains one of the most compelling stories in modern finance. The impressive Bitcoin price surge above $111,000 is a compelling reminder of cryptocurrency’s dynamic nature and its increasing relevance in the global financial landscape. This milestone highlights Bitcoin’s enduring appeal, its capacity for significant growth, and its position as a transformative asset. As the market continues to evolve, staying informed, practicing due diligence, and adopting a balanced, long-term perspective remain paramount for all participants.

While broader conditions remain subdued, technical signals suggest that the current phase may not last much longer. Xoom (@Mr_Xoom), a crypto analyst active on X, drew attention to XRP’s technical setup by sharing a chart that places the token within a descending triangle . He stated that the market will soon stop its sideways movement and emphasized that the structure is nearing its conclusion. XRP & the whole market will NOT keep moving sideways. XRP's triangle seems to be closing into itself in the next 7-8 days (no I'm not saying moon in 7 days, I'm showing what the chart shows us) Usually, we see a break to either side before it closes into itself. pic.twitter.com/hDLoafg3uQ — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) September 6, 2025 XRP’s Descending Triangle According to him, “XRP’s triangle seems to be closing into itself in the next 7-8 days.” He clarified that this projection is not a price prediction but rather an illustration of what the chart shows. The chart he shared marks clear support levels around the $2.7 range, with lower levels drawn beneath as potential downside zones. XRP tested this support in early September after a notable decline caused it to fall below the $3 support level. A descending trendline formed in early August, shortly after the digital asset hit its all-time high in July , and it has capped XRP’s highs since then, pressing the price closer toward the apex of the triangle. This technical formation typically precedes movement in one direction, often before the structure fully converges. XRP Price Performance and Technical Analysis XRP’s recent price action has been defined by underperformance in late August and early September. Sellers have repeatedly tested the lower boundary of the triangle, bringing the price close to the highlighted support area. The token now trades around $2.8, holding just above the lower red support line marked on the chart. The descending trendline illustrates a sequence of lower highs, reflecting persistent selling pressure over the past month. Simultaneously, the support region beneath $2.8 has held on several occasions, preventing a decisive breakdown. This combination has narrowed the trading range, leaving XRP consolidating in increasingly tight territory. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Next Resistance Level The blue horizontal level just above $3 represents the resistance that XRP would need to overcome to regain its momentum. Until such a breakout or breakdown occurs, the triangle remains the dominant formation governing price behavior. As Xoom noted, it is common to see a move before the triangle closes entirely. The technical compression suggests that market participants are waiting for confirmation in either direction. A sustained breakout above the descending trendline could shift momentum toward the upside, while a move below the defined support would indicate renewed weakness.

But the latest numbers are making his concerns harder to ignore. America’s national debt has now climbed above $37 trillion , while household debt has reached a record $18.39 trillion. Credit card delinquencies are also rising, showing that everyday Americans are struggling to keep up with higher borrowing costs. MAKES ME SAD: In 2025 credit card debt is at all time highs. US debt is at all time highs. Unemployment is rising. 401 k’s are losing. Pensions are being stolen. USA may be heading for a GREATER DEPRESSION. I get sad because as I stated in an earlier X….Tweet….I warned… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) April 18, 2025 On top of that, the labor market, which has long been one of the strongest parts of the U.S. economy, is beginning to weaken. In August, the economy added just 22,000 new jobs, and unemployment rose to 4.3%, the highest level in four years. BREAKING: US NONFARM PAYROLLS ACTUAL 22K (FORECAST 75K, PREVIOUS 73K) $MACRO — FinancialJuice (@financialjuice) September 5, 2025 Meanwhile, inflation is proving stubborn, and the Federal Reserve is under pressure. If it cuts interest rates too slowly, growth could stall further. But if it cuts too aggressively, it could spark new problems of its own. Rising bankruptcies, falling consumer confidence, and slower growth are already feeding the sense of fragility. Against this backdrop, Kiyosaki’s warning feels more relevant than ever. And for many investors, Bitcoin’s built-in scarcity is once again drawing attention as a possible hedge against economic uncertainty. Bitcoin’s Scarcity Advantage Bitcoin’s structure offers what fiat currencies cannot: a fixed limit on supply. With a hard cap of 21 million coins, and more than 19.9 million already mined, the remaining issuance is shrinking. The next halving in 2028 will slow new supply even further, tightening availability at a time when traditional assets risk dilution. Unlike gold, Bitcoin is borderless, transparent, and instantly transferable, making it an increasingly attractive hedge during monetary uncertainty. If fears of recession deepen, its limited supply could amplify its role as a store of value. For many, the very risks Kiyosaki warns about may highlight why Bitcoin’s scarcity matters most. Bitcoin Short-Term Technical Outlook Bitcoin is consolidating near $110,800 inside an ascending triangle, a pattern that often signals upward continuation. Since late August, the chart has shown higher lows pressing against resistance at $113,400, reflecting steady accumulation. The 50-SMA at $110,209 is acting as a floor, while the 200-SMA at $112,543 serves as a pivot. Bitcoin 4-Hour Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum indicators lean constructive, with the RSI near 51 and candlestick activity, Doji and spinning tops, pointing to buyers absorbing pressure. A breakout above $113,400 with volume could open the door toward $115,400 and $117,150, confirming the bullish trajectory. If $110,000 fails, support sits lower at $108,450–$107,400, though the rising trendline suggests such pullbacks remain corrective rather than a trend reversal. For traders, a tactical long above $113,400, with stops under $110,200, offers a clear setup. Bitcoin Long-Term Forecast: Higher Zones Ahead Bitcoin’s broader trend remains firmly bullish, anchored by its rising channel on the weekly chart. Price is consolidating above $110,000, with immediate resistance at $124,750 and a critical test at $134,500. Clearing this zone would likely open the way toward Fibonacci targets near $171,000, with $231,000 as the next long-term milestone. Bitcoin Weekly Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The 50-week SMA at $95,928 provides strong dynamic support, while the 200-week SMA around $42,869 marks the ultimate structural floor. The RSI at 62 signals healthy momentum without being overbought, leaving space for continued expansion. Candlestick action shows no signs of major reversals, reinforcing buyer control. For long-term investors, dips toward $100,000–$104,000 may provide accumulation opportunities rather than risks. With issuance slowing and demand rising, Bitcoin’s scarcity-driven appeal strengthens the case for six-figure levels in the next cycle.

Do Kwon took his pleas to the nation’s high court and subsequently saw his claims dismissed by the judge in charge of proceedings. According to reports, the sum represents half of the $28.4 million needed to purchase the Orchard Road penthouse. The former Terraform Labs boss had set his sights on the Sculptural Admore unit, which was valued at S$38.8 million, five months before the unfortunate collapse of his digital assets TerraUSD and Luna in 2022. According to court documents, Do Kwon had chosen his preferred 7,600 square foot duplex with four bedrooms on the 19th floor of the development, one of three penthouses in the development. Singapore court strikes out Do Kwon’s bid to recover penthouse deposit Do Kwon, originally from South Korea, had paid about S$19.4 million, which was half of what he needed to secure full ownership of the property. According to records , he paid for the penthouse in option fees and subsequent payments through his wife. He was unable to complete the purchase of the unit, and the penthouse was later resold to another party for S$34.5 million. While the developer claimed that he had forfeited the money he got from Do Kwon, the Terraform Labs founder argued that the forfeiture was invalid, and filed a claim at the Singaporean High Court through his wife. His application was subsequently dismissed. In addition, Kwon and his wife signed a 16-month lease from February 2022 to June 2023 for the apartment, paying about S$40,000 per month. The couple paid S$640,000 upfront and carried out renovations on the property. In May 2023, Kwon asked his wife to pay S$1,000 to the developers, exercising the option to purchase the property, but his wife was unable to complete the transaction as required by May 31, 2023. The option to purchase and the lease expired in June 2023, and the developers terminated the sales and retained the funds paid. Kwon’s wife continued to live in the unit till July 2023, having paid an additional month’s rent. The developer claimed that she breached the terms of the contract and asked her to pay another month’s rent, moving to recover S$90,000 in repair costs. However, in his claims, the High Court Judge Philip Jeyaretnam struck out the seller’s repair claims, awarding him an additional month’s rent, and asked Do Kwon to cover his legal costs. Legal ruling compounds Kwon’s woes The ruling adds to the legal challenges of Do Kwon after the collapse of the Terra-Luna ecosystem, which saw more than $40 billion in investor funds erased. Kwon had pleaded guilty in August 2025 in New York for conspiracy and wire fraud in a United States prosecution case linked to the collapse. As part of his plea deal, he agreed to forfeit about $19.3 million and some properties. The judge in charge of his case moved his sentencing to December 11. Do Kwon and the Luna Foundation Guard were sued by more than 366 investors at the Singapore International Commercial Court in May and face demands of about $66 million to $90 million. Notably, Kwon’s business was originally registered in Singapore. The case mirrors that of FTX executive Sam Bankman-Fried, who was indicted for multiple fraudulent schemes he carried out while he was CEO at the company. He was found guilty of two counts of wire fraud, two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. The court sentenced SBF to 25 years in prison and three years of supervised release.

The chosen list includes an unexpected newcomer among meme coins. The results feature notable choices that could attract attention from trend watchers. Discover which coins qualified and why one emerging meme token particularly distinguishes itself. PEPE: The Meme King Riding Digital Waves PEPE launched on Ethereum in April 2023 as a tribute to Pepe the Frog, featuring zero taxes, deflationary burns, and pure community momentum. No team allocations, no roadmap—just meme culture meeting crypto. The spring 2023 explosion created overnight millionaires and triggered ""memecoin season 2.0"" where countless animal tokens launched and crashed within hours. Today, PEPE maintains a devoted community and ranks among top cryptocurrencies by market cap. The green frog's survival depends on social media hype and crypto's love affair with internet culture. In a market full of complex projects, PEPE's honest proposition—""we're just here for the memes""—continues to resonate powerfully. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price, far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.005 by Stage 13, with over $15 million already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a target listing price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity VeChain: Tracking Goods, Boosting Trust VeChain was born in 2015 when Sunny Lu left Louis Vuitton to give products a digital spine. Each item gets its own ID and tiny sensor. The data lives on VeChainThor, a public network made just for business use. Food, cars, and shoes can show where they have been in real time. Big names like Walmart China, BMW, and PwC already plug into it. This real world use helps its coin, VET, stay among the top 40 by size. Many coins promise grand dreams, yet few leave the lab. VeChain ships today and earns fees with a second coin, VTHO, so VET holders gain small but steady income. It avoids high power costs by letting chosen leaders confirm moves, keeping speed high. In the current market fresh money often chases hype, but history favors working tools. If supply chain worries and fake goods stay in the news, VET could ride the next cycle harder than pure finance tokens. IOTA’s Tangle: A Fast Lane for Web3 Value and Data IOTA works like a busy spider web instead of a single chain. This web, called the Tangle, links each new action to two earlier ones. No miners stand between users, so fees fade away and speed grows with traffic. The code is open for all, from hobby builders to big firms. With Shimmer as its testing ground, the team rolls out tools for custom networks, smart contracts that speak the Ethereum language, native coins, NFTs, and even digital IDs. In a market that swings like a pendulum, projects with clear use cases shine. IOTA bets on machines paying machines, supply chains talking in real time, and cities that manage power on their own. Unlike many coins that still fight scaling troubles, IOTA gains speed as more people join. New rewards on Shimmer also pull fresh builders. If the next cycle prizes real adoption over hype, this lean and fee-less network could catch the spotlight. Still, every cycle has surprises, so timing remains an art. HBAR: The Silent Sprinter of the Crypto Track Hedera Hashgraph runs on a web of computers that talk in a new way. Instead of long blocks like Bitcoin, it uses tiny chats called gossip to record moves. This cuts power use because no one mines. Fees stay small, and deals finish in seconds. HBAR, the coin of the network, pays those fees and keeps the system honest. Owners can lock up their HBAR and earn extra, so the network stays safe. Banks, games, and supply chains already test this speedy tool. Market moods shift fast, yet HBAR holds a quiet edge. Big names like Google and Boeing sit on its council, adding trust. As traders hunt for coins with real use and green goals, HBAR fits both lists. It has lagged the big rallies, so its price still looks light compared with rivals aiming for smart contracts. The closed patent could slow hobby developers, but it also guards the design from copycats. If the next cycle rewards speed, low cost, and eco care, HBAR may sprint ahead. Conclusion PEPE, VET, IOTA, and HBAR look good in the 2025 bull run, yet XYZVerse (XYZ) emerges stronger, mixing sports passion with meme energy and eyeing a 20,000% climb.

51333763,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=801560,1757237400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51333763.jpeg,Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Price Prediction: Can This DeFi Token Climb From $0.035 to $5 by 2030 as Analysts Expect?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/mutuum-finance-mutm-price-prediction-can-this-defi-token-climb-from-0-035-to-5-by-2030-as-analysts-expect/,"Cryptocurrency price projections are never an easy subject to discuss, more so when we are talking about early-stage tokens that are relatively cheap and useful. A project that is being taken seriously is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a lending protocol that is decentralized. Investors are now wondering whether MUTM can possibly hit $5 by 2030 as some analysts believe it can with the token having only priced at a mere $0.035 right now. To address the question, it is useful to consider the progress of Mutuum Finance in phases since its inception during the presale up to its adoption milestones, and eventually, its future growth prospects. 2025: The Beginning In Phase 1, which opened in early 2025, Mutuum Finance presold at basement-level prices of $0.01, and early adopters were given access to a baseline price of $0.01. Since that time the token has progressed in several phases, and currently at Phase 6 the price is at $0.035, and the official launch price is at $0.06. Investors at this level today are also geared towards approaching 100% gains at the time of listing, which makes it essential to invest at the earliest point possible to avoid being left at the last stages. Mutuum Finance has already raised over $15.4 million and has over 16,100 holders already, evidence of a highly interested market even prior to exchange listings. The presale is designed to pay off early entrants, and the next round will increase the cost to $0.04, an almost 20% increase over current prices. What makes MUTM even more unique is that, unlike most other presale tokens that lapse for months before becoming functional, its beta platform will be launched on the same day as the token listing, so that live lending and borrowing can occur immediately. This is one of the key reasons why it can have early adoption and enable MUTM to gain credibility within a short period. 2026: The First Growth Wave Mutuum Finance is likely to face the first year after launch. The protocol supports both conservative and risk-seeking participants with its dual lending markets, Peer-to-Contract pools that issue mtTokens and its Peer-to-Peer lending with variable or stable borrow rates. The analysts estimate that when the lending markets take off, the token will increase to a short-term objective of between $0.25 and $0.45. This would be a 600% to 1,200% growth over the current presale price of $0.035. It is the kind of infancy phase that a project such as Aave or Solana underwent before it was widely known in the market. The early user adoption, inflows of whales, and the ongoing effects of the Mutuum Finance buy-and-distribute mechanism, which recycles protocol fees by purchasing back MUTM in the market and redistributing it to users, should make this growth phase self-propagating due to the constant buy-side pressure. 2027: The Expansion Phase Mutuum Finance anticipates growing its feature-set by launching its overcollateralized stablecoin, which will be based on a mint-and-burn mechanism. Stablecoins will support the foundation of DeFi, and its direct integration into the system of Mutuum will ensure both liquidity and stability, stimulating an increase in the number of borrowings and lending operations within the protocol. Simultaneously, the intended Layer-2 implementation of the project will make the transaction costs less expensive and faster, and the platform will be more scalable and will be more appealing towards larger numbers of users. Listings on major platforms will also have a wider reach as well. Together, these adoption drivers will help push MUTM closer to the $1.00 milestone. At that price, early Phase 6 participants would see gains of more than 2,700%, a transformative return for those who entered before the launch. 2030: Maturity Phase Moving forward, analysts are estimating that by 2030, Mutuum Finance will be trading at $5.00. The thinking is this simple: the more people use the platform, the higher the demand of borrowing and lending, and as each transaction contributes to the buy-and-distribute system, there is constant pressure to buy, which contributes to appreciation of value in the long term. At this point, not only would Mutuum Finance have its two lending markets and stablecoin operational, but it could also have possibly spread across multiple blockchains, becoming a liquidity marketplace across DeFi networks. The mix of powerful tokenomics, practical adoption, and scalability over the long run is what supports the $5 forecast. Today, the entry of $0.035, at a price of $5.00, would be a markup of over 14,185%, even a gain that could rival the breakout stories of XRP, Aave, or Solana during their early phases. Why Experts Believe It’s Possible Critics might ask how realistic a $5 price target of Mutuum Finance might be, but history makes it very plain what to expect. Aave used to sell at a few dollars and then it rose over $600. Solana shot up by a small fraction of less than $1 to over $250. Early believers were rewarded with 100x with Ripple (XRP). The driving forces in all these situations were utility, timing and adoption. These projects addressed actual issues, were initiated at a time when the demand was gaining momentum and captured the liquidity that propelled them to the top in a short time. Mutuum Finance is also poised to do so, with platform flexibility in borrowing, direct functionality at its inception, and long-term tokenomics that anchor activity in the platform to token demand. Cryptos have always favored tokens which are both pocket-friendly and have practical applications and Mutuum Finance fits that description perfectly. Since it started at presale levels of $0.035, analysts project it to grow to $0.25–$0.45 in its initial growth stage, close to $1.00 in 2027 and will hit $5 in 2030. To investors, the XRP, Aave, and Solana experience is pretty straightforward: first movers get the biggest multiples. Mutuum Finance is yet to become a household name, but with its adoption roadmap continuing to unfold according to schedule, the project may become one of the most notable DeFi success stories of the decade.

Key Takeaways: Michael Saylor joins the Bloomberg Billionaire Index with a $7.37B net worth, most of it tied to his company Strategy. Strategy holds over 659,000 BTC, worth nearly $73B, making it the largest public Bitcoin holder globally. Despite meeting criteria, Strategy was excluded from the S&P 500, possibly due to qualitative judgment by the selection committee. Saylor now holds the 491st spot on the list , after seeing his fortune climb by nearly $1 billion since the start of 2025, a 15.8% increase. Majority of Saylor’s $7.3B Fortune Tied to Strategy Holdings The bulk of Saylor’s wealth, approximately $6.72 billion, is tied to his equity in Strategy, the Nasdaq-listed firm known for its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Bloomberg estimates another $650 million of Saylor’s assets are in cash. The billionaire joins other crypto industry leaders on Bloomberg’s top 500, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, currently ranked 234th with $12.8 billion, and Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao at 40th with $44.5 billion. Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced former CEO of FTX, was previously on the list before the exchange’s collapse in 2022. Strategy currently holds around 659,739 BTC, or approximately 3.42% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, according to data from StrategyTracker. At current prices, that stash is worth nearly $73 billion. Despite concerns from critics, the company maintains that its massive Bitcoin purchases are executed in ways that do not impact market prices. “The way we buy Bitcoin is we do not move the price of the Bitcoin,” said Shirish Jajodia, Strategy’s corporate treasurer. JUST IN: Michael Saylor is now one of the top 500 richest people in the world — Bloomberg The #Bitcoin effect pic.twitter.com/iNCMaOXQ5N — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 6, 2025 Shares of Strategy (MSTR) closed Friday up 2.53%, but remain down over 12% for the month. The company was notably excluded from the S&P 500 during the latest reshuffle in August, despite meeting listing requirements and already being a part of the Nasdaq 100. Analysts suggest the exclusion may stem from qualitative considerations by the S&P selection committee, which evaluates candidates using a broader set of criteria beyond market cap and trading volume. Saylor’s Strategy Adds 7,714 BTC in August as Bitcoin Dips Below $108K Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin-heavy firm, Strategy, added 4,048 BTC for $449.3 million between August 25 and Monday, bringing its total holdings to 636,505 BTC. The latest buy came as Bitcoin’s price briefly touched $113,000 before sliding under $108,000, with the average purchase price at $110,981 per coin. In total, Strategy acquired 7,714 BTC during August, down from 31,466 BTC in July, through multiple smaller purchases, including 3,081 BTC last week. The firm has now spent roughly $46.95 billion on its Bitcoin reserves, averaging $73,765 per coin. According to the SEC filing, the purchases were funded via proceeds from four of Strategy’s at-the-market equity offerings. Saylor previously called these offerings the core of the company’s “Bitcoin defense department.” He has repeatedly stated that Bitcoin represents “digital gold” and a superior form of money. His strategy has been to convert a large portion of Strategy’s balance sheet into Bitcoin, financing some purchases through debt and equity offerings.

Decentralized compute network Spheron has kicked off an ongoing buyback-and-burn program for its native token, $SPON, executing the first cycle this week. The company said it repurchased 0.625% of total supply, worth $500,000 at an $80 million FDV, with all tokens set to be permanently burned, reducing overall supply. This process will now continue on a recurring basis, with future buybacks tied to network revenue and compute demand. How the Mechanism Works The move is part of Spheron’s “Secure Compute” initiative, which links revenue from GPU rentals directly to token scarcity. The Secure Compute Flywheel is built around a simple principle: every increase in network usage creates value for $SPON holders. Compute providers collateralize GPUs with $SPON and offer subsidized rates to users. When demand spikes, surplus margins are generated and funneled back into the ecosystem through buybacks at or above the token’s launch floor value. All repurchased tokens are permanently destroyed, introducing consistent deflationary pressure. “Our first $SPON buyback shows real impact, linking decentralized compute usage to tokenomics,” said Prashant Maurya, Spheron’s co-founder and CEO. “Every workload on Spheron powers AI innovation while making $SPON scarcer, stronger, and more valuable.” Burn the Token, Grow an Ecosystem Spheron has rapidly scaled its network, now counting 44,000+ nodes across 170 regions, more than $100 million in distributed compute, $16 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), and a community of over 400,000 members. The $SPON token facilitates transactions, governance, and now deflationary mechanics. The company said the recurring buyback-and-burn cycle is designed to reward providers, lower costs for users, and benefit token holders to reinforce its goal of building a sustainable compute economy for its growing community.

As emerging projects appear, several capture investor attention from those hoping to identify the next breakthrough opportunity. These tokens appear as potential market disruptors before 2026. Their upside potential matches their inherent unpredictability. Hyperliquid: The Gas-Free Speedster Aiming to Rewrite DeFi Hyperliquid runs on a fresh base chain built for fast moves. Its own voting system, called HyperBFT, locks trades in seconds while keeping them safe. Every order sits on the chain, so anyone can check the book at any time. Traders zip in and out of endless future swaps without paying gas. This makes the service feel like a top web app, yet it stays fully open and public. A team of sharp minds from Harvard, Caltech, and MIT guides the code, and they fund it themselves, keeping choices clear of outside pull. Many users now hunt for lower fees and faster trades; that trend lifts chains like Solana and Arbitrum. Hyperliquid goes further by cutting fees to zero and keeping the book on-chain, a combo few rivals match. If the bull run keeps warming, fresh volume could rush to places that feel smooth yet fair. Early signs show tight spreads and lively flow, hinting that the idea clicks with pro and casual players alike. While no one can promise price moves, a lean set-up, clear vision, and growing need for speed make the coin one to watch this cycle. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.005 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early for Maximum Gains Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Pocket Mining: Pi Network Lets You Earn Crypto with a Daily Tap Pi Network puts coin mining in your pocket. Since 2019, the Stanford-born app has let anyone hit a single button each day and earn Pi. No loud rigs, no hot chips, barely any battery loss. You grow speed by inviting 3-5 trusted friends, forming small safety rings that join into a giant trust web. This web keeps records safe and removes need for power-hungry machines. Extra boosts come from running a home computer node or locking away coins to help apps inside the system. Right now the coin lives on its own chain in a closed phase, so users must pass a simple identity check before moving Pi around. The team says an open door is next; once that happens, Pi can flow to markets and other chains. Many traders hunt fresh projects with low energy use and big crowds, and Pi’s millions of members tick both boxes. Unlike Bitcoin’s costly math or meme coins with no plan, Pi blends green tech and social pull. If the open launch lands during the next crypto upswing, today’s daily taps could age well. PEPE: The Meme King Riding Digital Waves PEPE launched on Ethereum in April 2023 as a tribute to Pepe the Frog, featuring zero taxes, deflationary burns, and pure community momentum. No team allocations, no roadmap—just meme culture meeting crypto. The spring 2023 explosion created overnight millionaires and triggered ""memecoin season 2.0"" where countless animal tokens launched and crashed within hours. Today, PEPE maintains a devoted community and ranks among top cryptocurrencies by market cap. The green frog's survival depends on social media hype and crypto's love affair with internet culture. In a market full of complex projects, PEPE's honest proposition—""we're just here for the memes""—continues to resonate powerfully. When 6900 Beats 500: The Meme Coin Chasing a $69 Trillion Dream Money once meant shiny metal. Now it means digits that dance on screens. SPX6900 is the loudest dancer of all. Born from online jokes, it claims 6900 is better than 500, so it must beat the S&P. The goal is bold: a $69 trillion cap. Fans post memes, trade tokens, and shout the mantra “bigger number, better coin.” This wild energy has pushed SPX6900 from hidden chat rooms to front-page buzz. People now watch the chart like a game, waiting for the next leap. Behind the jokes sits real code that locks supply, burns fees, and rewards holders. That keeps the chart climbing when hype fades. Think of it as Dogecoin with brakes and turbo. In today’s market, Bitcoin rests and traders hunt fresh thrills. Meme coins move fastest, and SPX6900 leads the pack. Volume is rising while rivals like PEPE cool off. If the mood stays bright, the token could sprint again. For buyers who live for headline heat, SPX6900 still looks hot. Conclusion HYPE, PI, PEPE, and SPX thrill in the 2025 surge, but first all-sport memecoin XYZVerse merges fandom and memes, targeting 20,000% upside through a community-driven, GameFi-powered movement.

Remittix (RTX) is quickly earning a reputation as perhaps the next “XRP,” with high-growth potential that institutions now appear to notice. XRP Stays Grounded But Faces Resistance Ripple price remains steady in the $2.80–$2.90 range. Some analysts eye a $4 run by 2026, driven by renewed institutional backing and potential ETF approvals. RSI and MACD signals suggest XRP is consolidating and waiting for a pickup in volume to break above $3.10–$3.20. The shift in sentiment is subtle yet real. Investors recognise XRP’s legacy value, but the recent traction suggests a drive for projects that combine reliability with real-world utility. Ethereum’s Momentum Meets Competition Ethereum (ETH) continues to embody mainstream DeFi and smart contract utility. Its Fusaka upgrade, designed to boost scalability and reduce gas costs, reinforces its infrastructure strength. But even amid this foundation upgrade, institutional attention is pivoting toward altcoins solving real problems. Demand for ETH remains high, but some capital is already edging toward younger tokens with sharper growth profiles. Institutions Eye Remittix for Explosive Utility-Driven Gains Remittix (RTX) is gaining investors’ attention for all the right reasons. Investors are drawn not by hype, but by what the token promises: real-world utility via PayFi, crypto solutions designed for everyday payments. Key developments are fueling institutional interest: Raised over $24,2 million in presale, with 649+ million tokens Confirmed listings on BitMart and LBank, ensuring market access. Beta wallet set to launch on September 15, 2025. Designed for the $19 trillion remittance market, blending utility with scale. Accumulation by “smart money” investors seeking high utility + speculative upside. Now called the “Next XRP”, Remittix (RTX) is a token drawing institutional capital precisely because it bridges DeFi with real-world needs. Institutions Are Calling RTX the Next XRP XRP still holds relevance and ETH remains essential. But as crypto evolves, institutions are betting on utility paired with adoption. That has firmly put Remittix on their radar. With strong presale performance, listings and a built-for-purpose model, it’s shaping up as the hottest “next XRP” offering both practicality and explosive potential.

El Salvador increased its gold reserves with a historic $50 million purchase, while retaining its ambitious Bitcoin policy, strengthening its hybrid approach to stability and innovation. On the other hand, HIVE Digital Technologies expanded in Paraguay, completing Phase 2 of the Yguazú Project and reaching 18 EH/s of Bitcoin mining power using renewable hydroelectric electricity. El Salvador strengthens reserves with gold and Bitcoin El Salvador made a historic purchase of $50 million in gold, its first in 35 years. This move increases the nation’s reserves by more than 31%, bringing the total to approximately 58,105 ounces, valued at $207 million. At the same time, the country continues to amass Bitcoin, with more than 6,290 BTC worth over $706 million. El Salvador’s reserve strategy aims to strike a balance between risk and opportunity by combining gold, a traditional safe-haven asset, and Bitcoin, a symbol of financial innovation. Beyond accumulation, the government has redistributed its Bitcoin into several wallets with less than 500 BTC each as a safeguard against future technical risks, such as those posed by quantum computing. The gold acquisition not only mitigates cryptocurrency volatility, but it also sends a strong message to institutions such as the IMF: El Salvador is not only relying on Bitcoin, but is also strengthening its financial credibility with traditional assets. HIVE reaches 18 EH/s with Yguazú phase 2 completion On September 3, HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. announced the successful completion of Phase 2 of its Yguazú Project in Paraguay, surpassing the global Bitcoin mining capacity of 18 exahashes per second (EH/s). The milestone was met ahead of schedule following the installation of the most recent ASICs, putting the company over its original 17 EH/s target. With this development, HIVE is now mining more than 8 Bitcoin per day globally, cementing its position as one of the industry’s major competitors. The Yguazú mining plant, powered by 200 MW of renewable hydroelectric electricity from the Itaipú Dam, is the company’s largest to date and was finished in record time. The business stated that work on its Phase 3 site in Valenzuela, a 100 MW green energy project, is nearly complete and would be ready for ASIC installation in the following weeks. Once operational, HIVE anticipates its global hashrate to exceed 25 EH/s, accounting for roughly 3% of the total Bitcoin network, with a daily output of approximately 12 BTC. Itaú asset launches dedicated crypto division Itaú Asset Management, Brazil’s largest private asset manager, established a cryptocurrency business within its multibillion-dollar mutual fund arm. João Marco Braga da Cunha, former portfolio management director at Hashdex, will lead the business. Hashdex was a pioneer in Brazil’s cryptocurrency ETF sector. The new branch of Itaú aims to produce alpha for customers by harnessing the volatility and unique opportunities of digital assets, building on current products like its Bitcoin ETF and retirement fund with crypto exposure. Itaú Asset now manages over 1 trillion reais ($185 billion) throughout its portfolio. Itaú’s mobile app already allows for direct trading of 10 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, and USD Coin, with in-house custody management. This endeavour adds to the company’s overall focus on digital assets. The cryptocurrency business intends to provide new financial products ranging from fixed-income style instruments to high-volatility strategies combining derivatives and staking-based funds.

Over the past week alone, the network absorbed $6.7 billion in stablecoin inflows, a larger amount than many chains manage in years. That brings Ethereum’s total stablecoin base to $145B+, more than half of the entire market, solidifying its position as crypto’s settlement layer for dollar-backed tokens. This matters because stablecoin inflows often act as dry powder, ready to rotate into ETH or other assets once sentiment shifts. $ETH pulled in $6.7B of stablecoins in the past 7 days. That’s more new inflows in a week than most chains have managed in years. Ethereum’s total stablecoin base now sits around $145B+ over half of the entire market. pic.twitter.com/HsUGXH7Lcj — NekoZ (@NekozTek) September 4, 2025 At the same time, institutional demand is picking up. Ether ETFs, particularly BlackRock’s spot product, have seen steady growth in assets under management, showing that regulated structures are becoming a gateway for professional investors. Macro and Network Tailwinds On the macro side, the U.S. economy is slowing, and expectations for Fed rate cuts later this year are rising. Looser financial conditions tend to benefit crypto, while stablecoin policy momentum in Washington is adding legitimacy to Ethereum’s role as the backbone of tokenized dollars. Layer-2 networks are also expanding throughput and reducing costs, which continues to strengthen ETH’s long-term adoption case. Key highlights: $6.7B in new stablecoins entered Ethereum in one week. Ethereum now hosts 50%+ of the global stablecoin supply. ETF inflows and policy clarity support institutional growth. Ethereum Technical Setup: $5K in Play At the time of writing, Ethereum price prediction is neutral as ETH trades near $4,305, consolidating inside a descending triangle that has capped upside since late August. Sellers lean on resistance at $4,490, while buyers defend a triple-bottom support near $4,250. The 50-SMA ($4,363) is acting as immediate resistance, with the 200-SMA ($3,885) anchoring the broader trend. The RSI at 47 is neutral but not oversold, leaving room for a breakout. Ethereum 4-hourly Price Chart – Source: Tradingview If ETH clears $4,490 with conviction, the path opens toward $4,665 and the $4,865 zone, which aligns with its all-time highs. A bullish engulfing or three white soldiers formation would confirm momentum. On the downside, losing $4,250 risks a drop to $4,070 and potentially $3,940–$3,785. For traders, the setup is clear: a long entry above $4,490 with stops under $4,250 could target $4,665–$4,865 in the near term. With record stablecoin inflows, ETF demand, and improving macro conditions, Ethereum’s case for a $5,000 breakout this cycle looks stronger than ever. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining BTC’s unmatched security with Solana’s high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $14.3 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today’s stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012875—but that figure will increase as the presale progresses.

With the crypto industry evolving, athletes and their management are now choosing brand reputation ahead of financial rewards from crypto companies. In a recent interview featuring Shelly Socol, marketing executive at BTCC Exchange, the days of athletes taking crypto endorsement deals with huge benefits are long gone, noting that the hype is seriously fading. According to Socol, the management in charge of athletes now carry out deep research and extensive checks, looking for track records, regulatory compliance, and long-term viability of the crypto firm before allowing athletes under their control to sign on as ambassadors. Athletes are prioritizing safe crypto endorsement deals The development comes amid recent scandals that have trailed exchanges in the past, with firms like FTX and Binance serving as examples. While Binance remains a household name in the crypto industry, its popularity hasn’t come without a few issues. According to BTCC, which just signed NBA star Jaren Jackson Jr. as its ambassador, crypto firms are also using the athletes to protect their credibility. Socol mentioned that partnerships like that are no longer about crypto firms gaining popularity, highlighting that crypto and several digital assets have made sure the world knows a thing or two about the digital asset space. He mentioned that most endorsement deals are just about athletes choosing to align with brands that promise stability and other benefits in addition to the financial incentives. The need for research is something that has become a topic worth discussing in the past few years. According to a 2024 report from CoinGecko, there was a 38% drop in crypto and sports sponsorships, dropping sharply from its peak in 2021. The report noted that one of the major reasons why there has been a drop is the state of the market. In addition, athletes are demanding transparency from crypto firms, asking experts about everything they need to know in terms of legal and financial aspects before signing. Digital assets impact endorsement deals Some athletes are also choosing to take their payments in Bitcoin, seeing the asset as the best among all digital assets in the industry. They also see it as the perfect hedge against inflation, something financial experts would have told them time and again. Also, crypto sponsorships have evolved, with firms now adding fan engagements and other metrics across their social media into the contracts. This way, the athletes use their popularity to drive in the crowd, hoping that the firm does better and protects their integrity. Reports also claim that this year has seen athletes seek evidence of firms following the needed regulatory guidelines and approvals before choosing to do business with them. In other cases, crypto firms that boast high-profile players provide the evidence others need to commit to them. For instance, Cristiano Ronaldo’s deal with Binance makes him a face of the brand across his social media, a move that could lure others to sign with the brand. However, the challenges in the sector remain, with factors like the decline in the general crypto market affecting endorsement values. While some athletes prefer to be paid in cash, most exchanges would prefer to pay them in digital assets, and a drop in the price of the asset might affect the financial package of their endorsement deals. Meanwhile, the consensus remains that these firms will be looking to maintain user trust, which would translate into these athletes trusting their brand enough to commit to them.

Key Takeaways: The updated 2025 crypto bill proposes clear roles for the SEC and CFTC, plus a joint advisory committee with mandatory public responses. It includes protections for DeFi developers, validators, and wallet builders, so long as protocols are not centrally controlled. Airdrops, staking rewards, and DePIN tokens would be exempt from securities laws under the bill’s new definitions. The updated draft bill also introduces protections for DeFi developers and emerging blockchain sectors like DePINs. Furthermore, it proposes the formation of a Joint Advisory Committee on Digital Assets, comprised of members from both the SEC and CFTC. SEC and CFTC Must Respond Publicly to Crypto Committee Findings While the committee’s recommendations would be nonbinding, both agencies would be required to publicly respond to any findings, signaling a stronger push for transparency and coordination. “The SEC and CFTC must align to reduce regulatory overlap, eliminate unnecessary friction, and support innovation,” SEC Chairman Paul S. Atkins and CFTC Acting Chair Caroline D. Pham said in a joint statement . The two agencies are also planning a public roundtable on September 29 to further discuss harmonization efforts. Significantly, the draft includes explicit protections for developers and users in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Developers who contribute to decentralized protocols, validators, liquidity providers, wallet builders, and infrastructure contributors would not automatically fall under traditional financial regulations, so long as the protocol isn’t centrally controlled. HUGE: SENATE CRYPTO BILL NOW SAYS TOKENIZED STOCKS ARE STILL SECURITIES! The crypto bill clarifies tokenized assets stay under SEC oversight and can NOT be treated as commodities. pic.twitter.com/xMgQ9U357q — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) September 6, 2025 This provision responds to growing concerns in the wake of legal actions like the conviction of Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm . Critics argued the case blurred the line between software development and criminal liability, raising alarm throughout the developer community . The bill also aims to ease regulatory fears over common crypto activities. Airdrops, staking rewards, and liquid-staking outputs are defined as “gratuitous distributions” that wouldn’t be considered securities offerings under current law, shielding users from unintended legal exposure. DePINs and Tokenized Assets Included For the first time, Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs) receive specific treatment under federal law. Tokens powering these networks would be exempt from securities classification if no single entity controls more than 20% of the supply. The safe harbor is meant to support decentralized telecom, storage, and sensor networks that often rely on community participation. The bill also addresses tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), noting that the act of tokenization doesn’t turn a non-security into a security. It instructs regulators to study verification, custody, audit, and enforcement standards for RWAs, especially as more financial institutions explore blockchain-based asset issuance. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), a key architect of the bill, said the goal is to present a reconciled version of the legislation for President Trump’s signature before the end of the year. The Senate’s version will need to be aligned with the Clarity Act, which passed the House in July .

According to Dalio, a rate cut could lead to a depreciation of the dollar and a drop in stock prices. Speaking during a Reddit Q&A session, Dalio said, “If the Fed cuts interest rates, short-term rates and the dollar will weaken, while long-term rates will rise, steepening the yield curve.” He added that in this situation, stocks could perform poorly, as expected, due to weakening investor confidence and stagflation concerns. While the possibility of a 0.25 point interest rate cut in September is prominent in the markets, major institutions such as Bank of America are predicting at least two additional rate cuts this year and an expansionary policy that will last until 2026. Dalio also highlighted long-term economic risks. He noted that the US national debt, which has reached $37 trillion and is equivalent to 124% of GDP, is the highest level since World War II. Dalio, who has previously likened the US debt problem to “plaque accumulating in the veins” and the economy to “a ship heading towards the rocks,” predicted that the country could face a debt-related crisis within the next three years. Stating that confidence in the dollar and US bonds may weaken due to the increasing budget deficit, rising borrowing costs and financial indiscipline, Dalio wanted 15% of portfolios to be allocated to alternative assets such as gold and Bitcoin. Related News: JPMorgan Chief Analyst Reveals What Will Happen If the Fed Cuts Interest Rates Dalio made the following statement in his assessment of Bitcoin: Bitcoin is now an alternative currency with a limited supply. If the supply of dollars increases or demand decreases, cryptocurrencies could become an attractive alternative. However, Bitcoin also has its drawbacks: it can be monitored and potentially controlled by governments, and its programming can be broken by new technologies. Therefore, it is unlikely to become a reserve currency. Gold, on the other hand, has a stronger position thanks to its longer history and its holding as a reserve by governments. That's why I hold a small amount of Bitcoin but a lot more gold.

While Cardano continues to make headlines in “Cardano news” feeds, traders are increasingly realizing that the biggest upside is happening elsewhere. And in September, that’s Layer Brett , the Ethereum Layer 2 meme coin presale that’s already approaching $2.9 million in funding. With meme season heating up, analysts say Layer Brett is emerging as the play that could outshine big caps in 2025. Cardano news sentiment cools despite technical optimism For months, Cardano has struggled to break out of its long-term downtrend. ADA currently trades near $0.83, repeatedly failing to sustain moves above stiff resistance at $1. On-chain metrics and technical indicators show buyers trying to defend key support around $0.80, but rallies have consistently stalled. Analysts now see risks of a deeper retracement toward $0.68 if momentum fails to keep up. At the same time, broader market sentiment is flashing warning signs. Google Trends data shows a surge in crypto-related searches, often a telltale signal that the market is overheating. Historically, these peaks in search activity have coincided with whales taking profit while retail sentiment runs high. With ADA’s inability to clear resistance and broader signals pointing to a local top, many Cardano holders are reassessing whether this cycle’s upside has already been priced in. Ultimately, while ADA might eventually grind back toward $1 if market conditions align, it lacks the speculative heat that defines this part of the cycle. That speculative energy is flowing directly into Layer Brett, and the charts show it. Why Layer Brett is primed to leave Cardano in the dust Unlike Cardano, Layer Brett combines meme appeal with real Ethereum Layer 2 infrastructure. It offers near-instant transactions, ultra-low fees, and staking rewards north of 800% APY, creating both narrative buzz and tangible incentives for early buyers. As Ethereum cements its role as the backbone of decentralized finance and Layer 2 adoption accelerates, every inflow into ETH infrastructure trickles down to projects like Layer Brett. At a presale price of just $0.055, the token offers asymmetric exposure to Ethereum’s growth story — the kind of early positioning that ADA investors wish they had during Cardano’s launch years. Analysts argue that while ADA may eke out gains in 2025, Layer Brett’s upside could extend into the 4,000% to 8,000% range, making it one of the most compelling meme plays of the year. Layer Brett: The clear frontrunner for meme season in 2025 and beyond The writing is on the wall: Cardano news may keep flowing, but meme capital is flowing elsewhere. With whales selling into euphoric peaks and retail sentiment shifting fast, ADA risks being left behind while the next generation of meme coins takes center stage. Layer Brett ’s presale milestone of nearly $2.9 million proves the market sees where the real opportunity lies. For traders seeking life-changing returns in 2025, the choice is becoming increasingly clear — ADA might limp higher, but Layer Brett is sprinting toward meme stardom. LBRETT is available now at $0.0055. Don’t miss out on the next 100x—join the Layer Brett presale today.

One such opportunity is Layer Brett, a meme coin built on Ethereum's Layer 2 solution, which is currently making waves with its ongoing successful presale. A Fresh Look at Cardano's Market Position Despite the historical achievements and technical advancements of Cardano, it faces challenges breaking through key price resistances, with its value hovering around $0.83. The consistently strong support near $0.80 signifies investor interest, but the inability to surpass the $1 mark raises doubts about its short-term growth potential, particularly when compared to emerging coins like Layer Brett . Market indicators suggest a cooling interest in Cardano as Google Trends show a spike in general crypto searches, a scenario typically associated with market peaks and subsequent sell-offs by large holders. Why Investors are Eyeing Layer Brett As a Meme Coin Leader Unlike traditional crypto assets, Layer Brett merges the meme culture with significant technological backing of Ethereum's Layer 2. This not only enhances transaction efficiency and reduces costs but also aligns with the current trend towards decentralized finance (DeFi). The project offers staggering staking rewards, potentially exceeding 800% APY, making it an attractive investment. Industry experts posit that Layer Brett's current presale value of $0.055 provides a rare asymmetric investment opportunity, especially when juxtaposed with Cardano's slower growth trajectory. The Meme Season of 2025: What to Expect As the crypto market continues to evolve, the narrative and financial momentum are increasingly leaning towards projects like Layer Brett. With a presale nearing the $2.9 million mark, it’s clear that the community sees a massive potential in this meme coin over established cryptocurrencies like ADA. For those considering diversifying their portfolio or looking for high-return investments, Layer Brett is emerging as a viable contender. Early participation in the presale could be the key to securing substantial gains in the burgeoning meme coin sector.

Key Takeaways: Crypto sentiment slipped into “Fear” over the weekend as traders moved into major assets like BTC, ETH, and XRP. Analysts say altcoin season may not return until later this year, with volumes fading and caution rising across the market. Some traders remain optimistic, arguing that altcoins are undervalued and this cycle may not follow historical halving patterns. On Sunday, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index dropped to a score of 44 , after hovering in the “Neutral” range for several days. Traders Ditch Obscure Altcoins for Bitcoin, Ether and XRP: Santiment Data provider Santiment said traders are retreating from obscure altcoins and refocusing on major assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and XRP. “A heavy focus on large-caps can indicate a more cautious or ‘risk-off’ sentiment among traders,” Santiment noted in a Saturday report. The shift comes amid growing anticipation around the possibility of an altcoin season. However, analysts at Bitfinex suggest that renewed momentum in lower-cap assets may not materialize until more crypto ETFs come online later this year. Bitcoin is down 5.38% over the past month, while Ether has gained 9.44%, according to CoinMarketCap. The broader altcoin landscape remains under pressure despite signs of isolated strength. The Altcoin Season Index, published by CoinMarketCap, stood at 56 on Sunday — a level that technically qualifies as “Altcoin Season” but still reflects uncertainty. The metric weighs performance of the top 100 altcoins versus Bitcoin over a 90-day window. “This is the final shakeout for altcoins,” trader Rekt Fencer said, pointing to fading volumes and nervous sentiment.

Daan Crypto Trades said BTC price action is “undecisive” and could sweep monthly lows to shake out late longs. “That should then cause some panic and fear of it losing $100K,” the trader added. Michael van de Poppe, founder of MN Trading Capital, pushed back on the bearishness, arguing that altcoins are “extremely undervalued” relative to prior cycles. He added that 2025 is shaping up to be “completely different” from earlier market patterns. Bitcoin analyst PlanC echoed that view, warning against drawing firm conclusions based on only three previous halving cycles. “Anyone who thinks Bitcoin has to peak in Q4 of this year does not understand statistics or probability,” he wrote on X. Anyone who thinks Bitcoin has to peak in Q4 of this year does not understand statistics or probability. The halving is completely irrelevant at this point, and there is zero fundamental reason—other than a psychological, self-fulfilling prophecy—for the peak to occur in Q4… — PlanC (@TheRealPlanC) September 5, 2025 Eric Trump: ‘No Question’ Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million Eric Trump, co-founder of American Bitcoin (ABTC) and son of US President Donald Trump, has said there is “no question” BTC will hit $1 million in the coming years. Trump pointed to surging demand from governments, major corporations, and wealthy families as key drivers behind his conviction. “Everybody wants Bitcoin. Everybody is buying Bitcoin,” he said. “That’s why I’ve always said Bitcoin is going to hit $1 million. There’s no question.” However, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz has pushed back on predictions that Bitcoin could hit $1 million in the near term, warning that such a move would likely reflect a collapse in the US economy rather than a crypto success story. “People who cheer for the million-dollar Bitcoin price next year, I was like, guys, it only gets there if we’re in such a shitty place domestically,” Novogratz told Natalie Brunell on the Coin Stories podcast recently. “I’d rather have a lower Bitcoin price in a more stable United States than the opposite.” The post Crypto Market Slides Into Fear as Traders Pull Back From Risky Altcoins appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|Bitcoin|Cryptocurrency|Ethereum,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|ALTCOIN|MARKET|ETH,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-09-07 09:58:27

Among them sits a recently launched meme token that differentiates itself from competitors. The compilation aims to highlight tokens with strong upside potential, appealing to those seeking opportunities in the dynamic market landscape. PEPE: The Meme King Riding Digital Waves PEPE launched on Ethereum in April 2023 as a tribute to Pepe the Frog, featuring zero taxes, deflationary burns, and pure community momentum. No team allocations, no roadmap—just meme culture meeting crypto. The spring 2023 explosion created overnight millionaires and triggered ""memecoin season 2.0"" where countless animal tokens launched and crashed within hours. Today, PEPE maintains a devoted community and ranks among top cryptocurrencies by market cap. The green frog's survival depends on social media hype and crypto's love affair with internet culture. In a market full of complex projects, PEPE's honest proposition—""we're just here for the memes""—continues to resonate powerfully. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Hits the $15M Milestone XYZVerse ($XYZ), recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, is drawing significant attention thanks to its standout concept. It is the first ever meme coin that merges the thrill of sports and the innovation of web3. Unlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse offers real utility and a clear roadmap for long-term development. It plans to launch gamified products and form partnerships with big sports teams and platforms. Notably, XYZVerse recently delivered on one of its goals ahead of schedule by partnering with bookmaker.XYZ, the first fully on-chain decentralized sportsbook and casino. As a bonus, $XYZ token holders receive exclusive perks on their first bet. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.005, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.01. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $15 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $20 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors are rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price, and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits VeChain: Tracking Goods, Boosting Trust VeChain was born in 2015 when Sunny Lu left Louis Vuitton to give products a digital spine. Each item gets its own ID and tiny sensor. The data lives on VeChainThor, a public network made just for business use. Food, cars, and shoes can show where they have been in real time. Big names like Walmart China, BMW, and PwC already plug into it. This real world use helps its coin, VET, stay among the top 40 by size. Many coins promise grand dreams, yet few leave the lab. VeChain ships today and earns fees with a second coin, VTHO, so VET holders gain small but steady income. It avoids high power costs by letting chosen leaders confirm moves, keeping speed high. In the current market fresh money often chases hype, but history favors working tools. If supply chain worries and fake goods stay in the news, VET could ride the next cycle harder than pure finance tokens. IOTA’s Tangle: A Fast Lane for Web3 Value and Data IOTA works like a busy spider web instead of a single chain. This web, called the Tangle, links each new action to two earlier ones. No miners stand between users, so fees fade away and speed grows with traffic. The code is open for all, from hobby builders to big firms. With Shimmer as its testing ground, the team rolls out tools for custom networks, smart contracts that speak the Ethereum language, native coins, NFTs, and even digital IDs. In a market that swings like a pendulum, projects with clear use cases shine. IOTA bets on machines paying machines, supply chains talking in real time, and cities that manage power on their own. Unlike many coins that still fight scaling troubles, IOTA gains speed as more people join. New rewards on Shimmer also pull fresh builders. If the next cycle prizes real adoption over hype, this lean and fee-less network could catch the spotlight. Still, every cycle has surprises, so timing remains an art. HBAR: The Silent Sprinter of the Crypto Track Hedera Hashgraph runs on a web of computers that talk in a new way. Instead of long blocks like Bitcoin, it uses tiny chats called gossip to record moves. This cuts power use because no one mines. Fees stay small, and deals finish in seconds. HBAR, the coin of the network, pays those fees and keeps the system honest. Owners can lock up their HBAR and earn extra, so the network stays safe. Banks, games, and supply chains already test this speedy tool. Market moods shift fast, yet HBAR holds a quiet edge. Big names like Google and Boeing sit on its council, adding trust. As traders hunt for coins with real use and green goals, HBAR fits both lists. It has lagged the big rallies, so its price still looks light compared with rivals aiming for smart contracts. The closed patent could slow hobby developers, but it also guards the design from copycats. If the next cycle rewards speed, low cost, and eco care, HBAR may sprint ahead. Conclusion PEPE, VET, IOTA, HBAR remain solid low-cost picks, but First All-Sport Memecoin: XYZVerse (XYZ) targets 20,000% gains by merging sports passion with meme culture, GameFi plans, and community-led growth.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Joins XRP and SOL on Analyst Top Picks,https://timestabloid.com/best-cryptocurrency-under-0-04-mutuum-finance-mutm-joins/,"Investors on the hunt for high-growth opportunities often eye cheap cryptocurrencies under $0.04. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out in this group, now being acknowledged alongside major names such as XRP and Solana (SOL). While XRP and SOL provide stability and established infrastructure, MUTM represents early-stage potential with exponential growth opportunities. Let’s examine why analysts group them together and what truly sets MUTM apart. XRP and SOL: Strength in Market Presence Ripple (XRP) continues to attract attention due to its role in cross-border payments and growing institutional adoption. It trades around $2.81, has high liquidity, and regained momentum after recent regulatory clarity and product filings. Solana, priced at about $207, supports a strong DeFi and NFT ecosystem. Despite regulatory scrutiny, its hybrid consensus model and fast transaction speed keep it competitive with top protocols. Both tokens anchor portfolios, one with a payments utility (XRP), the other with app-building infrastructure (SOL). Their presence on analyst watchlists reflects proven value and upward potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) By contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) remains in its presale phase at under $0.04, having already secured more than $15.4 million and attracted over 16,100 holders. This early traction has positioned MUTM as one of the strongest new entrants in the market, with analysts pointing to its potential for 40x growth—a return that makes it a standout in the “cheap crypto” category. At the core of its design is a lending framework built around dedicated liquidity pools for each supported asset. This model provides lenders with predictable returns by linking yields directly to pool utilization rates, while ensuring borrowers gain access to loans that remain consistently overcollateralized. The approach not only maintains stability for participants but also makes liquidity more dependable across the platform. Mutuum Finance’s Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model enhances efficiency by eliminating the need for direct counterparties in lending transactions. Instead, users interact with smart contracts that automatically enforce terms, set interest rates according to pool activity, and preserve fairness in every deal. To enhance user flexibility, Mutuum Finance offers both variable rates, which adjust with liquidity conditions, and stable rates, which give borrowers predictable repayment costs. By design, the dual-rate structure accommodates traders pursuing quick opportunities and borrowers focused on predictable costs. The result is a lending market that blends transparency with flexibility, backed by an infrastructure that scales with user adoption. It’s this mix of strong presale momentum, robust architecture, and clear yield mechanics that explains why many investors now rank Mutuum alongside much larger names in the DeFi sector. Core Features When users supply assets, they receive mtTokens (e.g., mtBNB or mtBTC) on a one-to-one basis. These tokens steadily increase in redemption value as yield accrues. For instance, depositing 4 ETH issues 4 mtETH today, tokens that will be worth more ETH over time. Transferable and yield-bearing, mtTokens offer a simple and transparent way to earn passive income, making them one of the most compelling low-barrier yield opportunities among emerging cryptocurrencies. Mutuum Finance boosts rewards through a buy-and-redistribute mechanism: platform revenues fund MUTM buybacks on the open market, and the repurchased tokens are distributed to users staking mtTokens in the safety module. That creates consistent demand, benefits active users, and aligns incentives across the ecosystem. Stablecoin Launch Looking ahead, Mutuum Finance plans to issue an overcollateralized on-chain stablecoin pegged to the U.S. Dollar, extending the protocol’s utility beyond lending and borrowing. Each unit of this stablecoin will be created only when users deposit collateral worth more than the minted value, ensuring that the token remains fully backed and stable even during market volatility. When loans are repaid or liquidations occur, the stablecoin is burned, dynamically adjusting supply and reinforcing its peg to the dollar. By embedding it directly into the lending markets, Mutuum Finance strengthens usability while driving adoption, building trust, and sustaining demand across its ecosystem. MUTM vs. XRP & SOL The difference becomes clear when Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is compared with established players like XRP and Solana (SOL). At roughly $2.81, XRP leverages its payments use case and institutional support to provide investors with consistent, if moderate, gains. Solana, trading near $207, continues to thrive through its developer ecosystem, transaction speed, and scalability, making it a solid play for infrastructure-driven growth. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance, still under $0.04 in presale, brings an entirely different value proposition with its yield-generating mtTokens, buy-and-redistribute tokenomics, and a planned overcollateralized stablecoin. Analysts suggest this early-stage setup could give MUTM the potential to deliver 20–40x returns, far outpacing the upside of its more established peers. Why MUTM Deserves a Spot on Watchlists Mutuum Finance is positioned to upgrade how DeFi lending, yield generation, and stablecoin issuance integrate. With the mtToken yield system and buy-and-redistribute mechanics, early adopters tap into passive rewards and structural demand for MUTM. For investors eager to back the next big crypto under $0.04, MUTM stands up next to established picks like XRP and SOL. And while risk is part of the equation, its feature set, presale traction, and clear incentive design make MUTM a timely choice in the hunt for outsized returns, before ADA hits $1, and certainly before many mainstream assets break higher.

In 2025, one of those projects is XYZVerse (XYZ)—a token that combines sports culture with crypto engagement. With a presale already attracting significant participation, XYZVerse is positioning itself as a sports-focused meme coin that emphasizes community building, staking, and gamified interaction. Understanding XYZVerse – The First All-Sports Meme Token Coin name: XYZVerse ($XYZ)Current Stage: Presale Funds Raised: $15M+Community: 21K+ followers on X, 12K+ members on TelegramContract Safety: Audited by Pessimistic Audit and SolidProof XYZVerse.io is designed around sports betting, gamified staking, and meme coin culture. Its positioning as the “first all-sports meme coin” aims to connect with fans who follow both digital assets and athletic competition. One of the early partnerships is with bookmaker.XYZ, a decentralized sportsbook and casino. This collaboration gives token holders access to sports-related features and benefits within the bookmaker’s ecosystem. Looking forward, the team has outlined plans for Telegram-based mini games, airdrop events, and decentralized applications (dApps) focused on staking and community rewards. Presale Structure and Growth XYZVerse launched its presale using a tiered model where the token price increased step by step. Early on, the token rose from an initial $0.0001 to $0.0054 by the time of the latest stage. Instead of fixed stages, the token price adjusts incrementally with every $100,000 raised. This dynamic approach is intended to keep the process continuous and transparent, with the goal of reaching a cap of $30 million. To support visibility, the team set up a dedicated Telegram channel where participants can track presale contributions in real time. So far, the presale has raised over $15 million, showing sustained engagement from its community. Security and Reliability Measures Though XYZVerse is still pre-launch, several steps have been taken to address transparency and security. Independent Audit : The project’s smart contract has been audited by Pessimistic, a blockchain security firm. The results, published publicly, reported no critical or high-risk vulnerabilities. A secondary review by SolidProof has also been completed. Deflationary Mechanism: XYZVerse incorporates token burns through buybacks to gradually reduce supply, aiming to manage inflationary pressure. Fixed Supply: With a total of 100 billion tokens, the design emphasizes scarcity from the outset. What’s Ahead for XYZVerse? The roadmap outlined by the team includes: Staking and rewards-based dApps for token holders Telegram-based play-to-earn mini games Collaborations with influencers and athletes to expand reach Marketing and sponsorship campaigns to connect with sports communities Ongoing token burns and liquidity initiatives If delivered, these features may help XYZVerse establish itself as a project that sits at the intersection of meme coin culture and sports entertainment. Conclusion XYZVerse is still at an early stage, with its presale ongoing and core features yet to launch. However, the combination of a growing community, independent audits, and a clear tokenomics framework has already drawn attention. As with all emerging crypto projects, outcomes will depend on execution, adoption, and broader market conditions. For now, XYZVerse represents one of the more visible attempts to merge sports fandom with the meme coin space, making it a project worth monitoring as 2025 progresses.

In a post on X, Chad stated, “DNA stored on the XRP Ledger. You will be recorded for all of human history.” He linked to the DNA Protocol, a project that aims to merge biological data with distributed ledger technology , presenting a concept that moves beyond traditional financial applications of blockchain. However, XRP Army remains skeptical about its genuineness. In the comments, some experts warned the community members to be watchful, saying the project seems too good to be true. DNA stored on the XRP Ledger. You will be recorded for all of human history. https://t.co/rhhLQWueAh pic.twitter.com/ssZRlcHoyw — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) September 6, 2025 The DNA Protocol and Its Process The DNA Protocol describes itself as a system for anchoring genomic information onto the XRP Ledger. The project describes its process as one that takes DNA sequences and transforms them into cryptographic hashes. These hashes are then distributed across a Byzantine Fault Tolerant validator network, which secures the data. To establish identity, the system relies on additional layers that reference both epigenomic records and contingency genome ledgers, creating a framework for verifiable yet privacy-preserving proofs. This framework suggests that DNA sequences can be represented in a secure, verifiable format without exposing the raw genetic data. Using cryptographic methods, the protocol focuses on proof and verification rather than storing sensitive biological information directly. By situating this process on the XRP Ledger, the project aligns with a blockchain known for its speed and scalability . It proposes that distributed consensus mechanisms can handle transactions and sensitive data anchoring in a way that is immutable and auditable. Tokenization and Broader Implications Steingraber’s comments frame this development in a historical context, emphasizing the permanence of recording DNA on a blockchain ledger. His statement highlights the significance of tokenization in this process. Tokenization, in this context, transforms complex genetic sequences into cryptographic representations that can be validated and exchanged across networks without exposing underlying information. The implications extend into areas such as identity management, medical data security, and personalized healthcare. While the technical architecture remains complex, the foundation rests on the principle that information as fundamental as DNA can be secured, proven, and transmitted through blockchain protocols. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Steingraber sees the DNA Protocol as a step toward permanent, verifiable records that may redefine how humanity treats genetic information. The XRP Ledger has become a major hub for tokenization projects . Whether it is needed for identity, research, or medical use, tokenizing DNA represents a frontier in applying blockchain beyond finance and into the core of human data.

While Solana’s institutional interest is holding up its price, Cardano ecosystem efforts are beginning to attract serious interest. Yet, the market is yearning for a missing piece: massive returns. Traders are pivoting to Layer Brett to bring in life-changing gains. The meme coin is building steam for a 100x rally by combining viral energy with blockchain utility. Layer Brett (LBRETT): The meme coin with the 100x market opportunity Layer Brett is not your typical meme coin. It does not rely on hype, celebrity tweets, or viral memes. Instead, it is powered by the much-coveted Layer 2 technology. Ethereum Layer 2s like Layer Brett are expected to process more than $10 trillion transactions in 2027. If Layer Brett can seize just a fraction of the inflows, then it is in pole position to rival the market capitalization of Cardano and Solana. When this happens, Layer Brett’s value could easily achieve up to 100x in the meme cycle. Even if adoption plans do not move according to plans, Layer Brett could still fetch up to 30x. Market participants rush to take advantage of the Layer Brett presale Investors are beginning to notice the market opportunity Layer Brett is building as they rotate their capital for early entry participation. At the moment, millions of tokens have already been sold to more than 5,000 holders. The ICO launch has raised more than $2.9 million , and tokens remain available at $0.0055 each, making it a crypto presale full of promise. Beyond speculative gains, the Layer Brett presale is fostering a community where its participants can thrive on passive income. With yields north of 900% APY, early holders can earn massive returns without price appreciation. This mechanism also creates both scarcity and utility. As tokens are staked, supply dries up, and demand compounds. Solana news today: $1 billion treasury sparks excitement Solana has just confirmed a $1 billion digital asset treasury initiative. This institutional project could fundamentally change the game for Solana. Crypto experts believe such an approach would effectively decrease its circulating supply, potentially increasing SOL’s value. The venture is being spearheaded by a collective of tech powerhouses. Some of these proponents include Multicoin Capital, Galaxy Digital, and Jump Crypto. Kyle Samani, managing partner at Multicoin Capital, will likely be at the forefront of this strategic move. He plans to build on Multicoin's early investment in Solana from 2018. The goal here is to mimic the successful approaches seen in traditional finance, particularly the corporate treasury strategy popularized by MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings. Cardano updates: XRP integration fosters market sentiment Cardano’s integration with XRP is unlocking a new frontier for the blockchain. The project is now expanding into crypto payroll solutions. With this integration, businesses could soon deliver real-time salary settlements using stablecoins like RLUSD. This development would reduce ADA’s exposure to volatility while providing SMEs across Europe and beyond with an institutional-grade payroll tool. For employees, the benefits could be transformative. Think, instant salary advances, reduced payment friction, and greater control over finances. Basically, this Cardano update could drive inclusion and reshape workplace compensation. Conclusion Cardano and Solana are among the most established blockchains, but at best they remain headline makers. Investors searching for life changing gains are looking to Layer Brett’s 100x explosive momentum. The Layer Brett presale won’t last forever, especially with its unique blend of high staking rewards and massive growth potential. The project is already shaping up to be one of the breakout stars of the current crypto cycle.

The involvement of industry titans such as Multicoin Capital, Galaxy Digital, and Jump Crypto, with Multicoin Capital’s managing partner, Kyle Samani, spearheading this initiative, suggests a significant shift. Samani's strategy, inspired by traditional finance methods like those of MicroStrategy with Bitcoin, could substantially reduce SOL's circulating supply, potentially boosting its market value. The Emergence of Layer Brett in the Crypto Arena While traditional cryptocurrencies like Solana and Cardano continue to make waves, a new player, Layer Brett, is starting to carve out its niche in the market. Unlike conventional meme coins, Layer Brett is built on the robust Layer 2 technology, aiming to process a massive scale of transactions, which is projected to exceed $10 trillion by 2027. If Layer Brett captures even a small market share, it could rival the likes of Cardano and Solana. Investors are lining up to capitalize on this potential, with the ICO launch having raised over $2.9 million . Moreover, participants are drawn not only to the speculative potential but to the community and passive income benefits, offering yields over 900% APY. Cardano's Innovative Integration with XRP Cardano's recent decision to integrate with XRP marks a significant evolution in its blockchain capabilities. This development extends into the realm of crypto payroll solutions, potentially enabling businesses to execute real-time salary transactions using stablecoins like RLUSD. Such advancements could drastically reduce ADA's exposure to market volatility and provide businesses, especially SMEs across Europe, with a dependable payroll tool. Final Thoughts While Solana and Cardano continue to strengthen their positions in the market, the rise of new coins like Layer Brett illustrates the dynamic and evolving nature of the cryptocurrency landscape. With its potential for large returns and a strong technological foundation, Layer Brett is gaining attention, poised to make significant impacts in the coming years.

According to BCR , the acquisition increased holdings from 44,106 to 58,105 troy ounces following International Monetary Fund guidance. Source: BCR The gold purchase follows the IMF’s confirmation that El Salvador halted Bitcoin acquisitions in February 2025, pausing President Nayib Bukele’s aim of making daily purchases. The fund’s July review revealed no new state-backed Bitcoin buys despite on-chain movements attributed to internal wallet transfers rather than fresh acquisitions. Strategic Reserve Diversification The Central Reserve Bank positioned the gold acquisition as a medium and long-term strategy for strengthening international reserves. Gold represents approximately 20% of global central bank reserves worldwide, ranking second only to dollar-denominated holdings. Various central banks purchased over 1,000 tons of gold annually during the past three years. The transaction was made possible by the strengthened Central Reserve Bank assets under President Bukele’s administration, which coincided with improved macroeconomic stability. Gold serves as a universal strategic asset, helping ensure diversified and secure long-term reserves for the nation. El Salvador continues to hold approximately 6,244 BTC, valued at $742 million, according to the Bitcoin Office. The treasury remains profitable with 127% gains based on the average acquisition price of $46,000 per Bitcoin. Bitcoin Policy Retreat Under IMF Pressure Earlier this year, Congress approved amendments eliminating mandatory Bitcoin acceptance for businesses in January 2025, passing legislation 55-2 just minutes after Bukele submitted the bill. El Salvador has approved amendments to its Bitcoin laws, aligning with a deal struck with the IMF to scale back its crypto exposure. #ElSalvador #Bitcoin https://t.co/2BDlo3RCGg — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 30, 2025 The reforms align with the $1.4 billion IMF loan agreement, while maintaining Bitcoin’s status as a legal tender. The IMF praised policy changes for reducing fiscal risk and improving transparency. Bitcoin no longer receives mandatory treatment, with the fund pushing El Salvador to classify cryptocurrency as a financial asset rather than a currency. Blockchain analysts have observed steady daily transfers of 1 BTC from exchanges like Binance and Bitfinex to government-linked addresses. However, the IMF attributes these movements to technical accounting rather than official purchases. Due to the recent reforms, the Chivo wallet, once promoted as a flagship adoption tool, will be privatized and removed from government oversight. Officials said the shift reduces strain on public finances while maintaining operational capability under private control. Quantum Security and Regulatory Adaptation Notably, the country recently split its Bitcoin treasury across 14 separate addresses to enhance security against quantum computing threats. Officials emphasized the need for preparations to address potential vulnerabilities from advancements in quantum technology that could compromise Bitcoin’s cryptographic security. El Salvador fortified its treasury by splitting its $682M BTC holdings into 14 separate addresses to guard against quantum computing threats. #Bitcoin #ElSalvador https://t.co/pSeC02I2Fm — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 1, 2025 Quantum computers using qubits can process vast amounts of data at massive speeds. Shor’s algorithm could break elliptic curve cryptography, which secures Bitcoin’s public and private keys, if deployed on sufficiently powerful quantum machines. Cybersecurity specialists estimate 30% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, roughly 6-7 million BTC, remains vulnerable in older address formats, exposing public keys. Deloitte researchers suggest 25% of all Bitcoin could face risk if quantum capabilities mature faster than expected. The security overhaul addresses warnings from industry veterans about “harvest now, decrypt later” strategies where adversaries collect encrypted blockchain data for future quantum decryption. Some experts suggest such capabilities may emerge within years rather than decades. As part of the country’s crypto adoption, El Salvador proposed cross-border regulatory sandbox programs with the SEC for real estate tokenization and capital raising pilots. The initiative aims to generate practical data on token classification and custody solutions within U.S. frameworks. The country’s National Commission on Digital Assets has implemented tokenization projects across various asset classes, with risk matrices potentially informing U.S. regulatory approaches.

Microsoft reroutes data traffic to mitigate pressure from cable cuts Microsoft didn’t specify how the cables were severed, but acknowledged that its engineering teams are working to mitigate the situation. Microsoft also claimed that undersea fiber cuts take time to repair, promising to continuously monitor, rebalance, and optimize routing to reduce customer impact. Microsoft acknowledged that rerouting data traffic has eased some of the pressure from the disruption. According to the company, users are still facing delays and slower-than-usual connections. According to the tech giant, the damage has affected several systems, including EIG, AAE-1, and SEACOM/TGN-EA. It has resulted in the disruption of a large share of data flow across continents. Network traffic services had slightly improved by Sunday morning, but customers of telecoms companies in the UAE, Du and Etisalat, said home broadband and mobile services were running more slowly the previous night. According to NetBlocks, both firms also confirmed that many websites and apps failed to load. The global internet monitoring organization also revealed that the subsea cable outages had degraded internet connectivity in other countries, including Pakistan and India. The firm said the incident is attributed to failures affecting the SMW4 and IMEWE cable systems near Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Nayel Shafei, founder of telecom company Enkido, argued that NetBlocks is limiting its coverage of the outage to the transient impact on remote India and Pakistan to the south, despite reporting the damage taking place from Jeddah. Pakistan Telecommunications also confirmed on Saturday that the cuts had occurred. Human activities cause most subsea cable disruptions Subsea cables are responsible for 99% of the world’s digital communications, meaning that a disruption could lead to a disaster for a whole country’s internet. Oceans have approximately 1.4 million km (870,000 miles) of telecommunication cables delivering data between continents. “There are 150 to 200 instances of damage to the global network each year. So if we look at that against 1.4 million km, that’s not very many, and for the most part, when this damage happens, it can be repaired relatively quickly.” -Mike Clare, Marine Environmental Advisor at the International Cable Protection Committee. Stephen Holden, head of maintenance for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa at Global Marine, said that 70-80% of sea cable faults are related to accidental human activities like dropping anchors or dragging trawler boat nets. He added that only 10-20% of sea cable faults are linked to natural disasters such as submarine volcanic eruptions, typhoons, and floods. Previous Red Sea cable cuts in the region have also raised concerns that Yemen’s Houthi rebels are responsible for attacks on the infrastructure. Yemen’s internationally recognized government revealed in early 2024 that the Houthis were allegedly orchestrating a planned attack on undersea cables in the Red Sea. The group denied being responsible after several cables were cut at the time.

Since hitting a new all-time high of around $4,900, the prominent altcoin has experienced an extensive price pullback. However, Pillows’ insights suggest further price drops may lie ahead, before another explosive rally. Related Reading: Ethereum Exchange Balance Turns Negative For The First Time – Why This Is Bullish For Price Ethereum Heading To $3,900 Before Major Surge – Here’s Why In an X post on September 6, Pillows reports that Ethereum appears to be replicating some part of Bitcoin’s price movement from the last market cycle. Notably, the premier cryptocurrency had experienced a 20% correction after reaching the previous ATH of $20,000 from the 2017 bull run. Thereafter, Bitcoin embarked on a bullish price run to establish a new ATH around $69,000. Similar to these conditions, the chart below shows that Ethereum has recently broken out of a forming symmetrical triangle, touching its previous ATH of $4,860 from 2021. Since then, the altcoin has slipped into a corrective phase, with present market levels now within the $4,200 region, leading to Pillows’ suggestions of a duplicated price movement. However, if Ethereum is indeed mirroring Bitcoin’s price performance from 2021, ETH bulls should expect a further price decline to around $3,800-$3,900 to complete the 20% price correction. While such a price loss would represent an additional 9.68% from present market prices, it could also complete the perfect bullish set-up for a parabolic rally. Going by BTC’s price history, Ethereum could likely experience a 4.5x price surge with potential price targets around $22,000. Notably, this projection exceeds the $10,000 ceiling that many analysts currently anticipate. However, a potential decline below the predicted $3,800-$3,900 could invalidate such bullish forecasts, presenting new downside targets around $3,400-$3,600.

Ethereum Market Outlook At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $4,263, reflecting a 1.35% decline in the past day and a 1.53% loss over the past week. However, on the broader timeline, ETH remains in positive territory, posting a 10.53% gain over the past month as bulls maintain longer-term momentum. According to on-chain data from analytics firm Sentora, the altcoin is showing signs of heating activity. In particular, Ethereum’s total network fees for the week increased to $11.93 million, up 19.4% compared to the previous week, signaling heightened transaction activity and demand for block space. Meanwhile, exchange netflows stood at -$2.09 billion, pointing to substantial outflows from centralized exchanges as investors opted to move their assets to personal wallets. With a market cap of $516.03 billion, Ethereum continues to rank as the 2nd largest cryptocurrency and 22nd largest asset in the world.

Don’t Get Caught,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-to-xrp-holders-dont-get-tricked-by-this-dont-get-caught/,"Crypto commentator Austin Hilton released a new video for XRP holders, urging them not to be misled by the current market behavior. Sharing his observations on the digital asset’s trading pattern, Hilton explained that XRP has been consolidating for approximately 48 days. He described consolidation as a sideways trading movement, noting that XRP has been confined within the range of $2.80 and $3.30. According to him, this type of market activity often leads investors to believe that the asset has stalled, which could prompt premature selling. Hilton acknowledged that this pattern may appear uneventful to new investors, but emphasized that it is a common occurrence across both cryptocurrencies and traditional stocks. Drawing from his three decades of investing experience, he said markets do not move upward continuously and that periods of consolidation frequently precede stronger upward momentum. XRP holders don't get tricked by this! Don't get caught! pic.twitter.com/2tiBUedfLW — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) September 6, 2025 The Risk of Selling Too Early In his message, Hilton cautioned investors against interpreting sideways trading as a sign of stagnation. He explained that many individuals, frustrated by the lack of movement, sell their holdings during these phases only to miss significant gains when the market resumes its upward trajectory. He used XRP’s performance in July as an example, when the asset recorded a 61% increase after a previous consolidation phase. Hilton stated that similar gains could be missed by those who allow short-term boredom to dictate their decisions. Hilton noted that this behavior is not unique to XRP. He claims that it extends to other assets such as Bitcoin and major equities like Amazon and Nvidia. He argued that impatience during these consolidation periods often results in investors losing potential profit opportunities. According to Hilton, what some perceive as inactivity is a building support for the next upward move. Market Context and Trading Approaches The video also placed the current XRP trading pattern within a larger market context. Hilton mentioned that the broader crypto sector has been experiencing slow activity during the summer months, with June, July, and August historically being less active periods. He pointed out that investors are currently awaiting the outcome of an upcoming Federal Reserve meeting scheduled within the next two weeks, which could provide the catalyst for renewed movement across markets, including XRP. In addition to his long-term investment perspective, Hilton shared details about his trading strategy. He explained that his portfolio consists of both buy-and-hold positions in cryptocurrencies such as XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum, as well as shorter-term swing trades. Highlighting the role of trading software he uses, Hilton demonstrated how alerts indicating buy and sell signals could have captured significant profits during XRP’s July price surge. He extended this example to stocks like Netflix, showing how the same system guided both gains and protection from losses. Final Remarks Hilton’s central message was directed at newer investors who may not have experienced prolonged consolidation phases before. He reiterated that the current XRP trading behavior should not be mistaken for a lack of growth potential and stressed the importance of patience. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Hilton’s advice centered on avoiding the mistake of selling during periods of low excitement, which he argued could lead to missed opportunities when the asset breaks out of its consolidation range. By combining his analysis of XRP’s recent trading history with his long-term investment approach, Hilton positioned his commentary as both a caution and a guide for navigating the current market. He clearly urged investors not to allow short-term trading to influence long-term strategies, as consolidation is often followed by upward movement.

According to sentiment sources, most traders are choosing to move further away from the risk curve. “It’s clear traders are less interested in obscure altcoins and are instead debating which major asset will break out next,” sentiment platform Santiment said in a report on Saturday. Santiment also highlighted the increase in focus on larger-cap assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. “A heavy focus on large-caps can indicate a more cautious or ‘risk-off’ sentiment among traders,” Santiment said. Crypto sentiment slides into fear as Bitcoin price remains indecisive The development comes amid growing altcoin season calls from traders. However, analysts at Bitfinex have repeatedly said that it may not arrive until more crypto ETFs launch later this year. The analysis claimed that the big rally being expected from altcoins may not come until the approval of crypto ETFs, which would expose investors further down the risk curve. Crypto investors have been eagerly waiting for the altcoin market rally as Bitcoin dominance reportedly dropped by 6% in the past 30 days. However, the analysts have claimed in a recent report that the market will experience a big rise later in the year when inflows into Bitcoin products regain momentum. “These products are likely to generate sustained, price-agnostic demand, creating the conditions for a broader re-rating across the digital asset complex,” they added. Meanwhile, on Sunday, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a metric that measures overall crypto market sentiment, posted a Fear score of 44, a score that came after several neutral readings in the past two days. Some traders are also questioning the near-term direction of some of these major assets. Analysts make Bitcoin movement predictions In the past month, Bitcoin has been down 5.38%, while Ethereum is up by 9.44%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. However, other indicators suggest that the market is still on its way down the curve. CoinMarketCap’s Altcoins Season Index posted an altcoin season score of 56 out of 100. The indicator moves between altcoin season and Bitcoin season based on how the top 100 digital assets have performed against Bitcoin in the past 90 days. Crypto trader Rekt Fencer mentioned that this is the final shakeout for altcoins, while MN Trading Capital founder Michael van de Poppe noted that altcoins are extremely undervalued. “I try to stay away from timing the markets with their peak. The cycle has proven that this cycle is completely different than previous cycles. I also know that #Altcoins are extremely undervalued. I’ll just see how the cycle develops and what my risk parameters say,” he said on X. The same sentiment was shared by Bitcoin analyst Plan C. He mentioned that traders who are predicting that Bitcoin will reach a cycle high this year are just doing so for a “psychological, self-fulfilling prophecy.” “Anyone who thinks Bitcoin has to peak in Q4 of this year does not understand statistics or probability,” the analyst said in an X post. He also argued that relying on the last three Bitcoin halving data will not provide accurate, statistically significant data.

51337094,575909,1757243342,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51337094.jpeg,Pepenode’s Presale Reaches $800K As It Allows Users to Create Virtual Crypto Mining Rigs,https://bitcoinist.com/pepenode-presale-reaches-800k-allows-users-to-mine-meme-coins/,"Pepenode’s presale just passed the $800K mark, following a surge in investor interest shortly after it started. The project’s appeal comes from its mine-to-earn mechanics, which enable meme coin mining in a customized rig, but that’s not necessarily the innovative part. The innovative part is that you get to craft your own rig yourself and customize its nodes for higher hashrate, energy, and rewards. It’s also quite advantageous that you don’t have to deal with high energy bills or need to upgrade your system to handle the higher mining throughput. This makes Pepenode ($PEPENODE) extremely appetizing for investors who prefer to control the rewards they’re getting from a presale. How Pepenode Changes the Way Crypto Mining Works Crypto mining is a good way to boost your portfolio without investing in the assets themselves. Instead, you invest in building and refining your mining system to maximize output, lower energy costs, and decrease the wear on the mining rig itself. Once you’ve figured those factors out, you’d have created a source of passive income. Unfortunately, the mining business comes with severe limitations and problems which are baked into the system itself. These include the high costs associated with building the rig, the high electricity bills, and, last but not least, the lack of interactivity. Pepenode addresses all these problems during its presale by turning mining into an engaging and rewarding activity with its mining simulator. The process is simple: buy the nodes, build your virtual mining facility, upgrade it, and start earning. The nodes are tiered, so you can upgrade them gradually to boost your facility’s mining output and energy efficiency. Unlike traditional mining, Pepenode achieves two things: it makes crypto mining engaging and more accessible and drives investor engagement during presale. You no longer need expensive, premium rigs, expertise, and extra capital to cover for the spicy electricity bills. Pepenode does everything for you, offering a sense of progression and rewarding proficient miners. Pepenode is compatible with MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and WalletConnect and is currently only accessible via your web browser. The mobile version will release after the public launch. The mining platform also has a detailed dashboard showcasing the most important stats like hashrate and rewards, allowing you to keep track of your progress and performance. Pepenode offers plenty of incentive to join the presale early on, including higher staking rewards for holders (1,786% now) and additional rewards in meme coins and other bonuses for top-performing miners. Pepenode Presale Numbers and Roadmap The Pepenode ($PEPENODE) presale is at over $800K right now with a token price of $0.0010491 and it’s gaining traction fast. If you want to join in, now’s the perfect time given the early incentives, including the staking APY of 1,786%, which will drop the more investors join the staking pool. The four-phase roadmap details a long-term developmental phase, with the Virtual Mining Simulator going live in Phase 3. Phase 4 is the real kicker, since it introduces meme coin rewards like $PEPE and $FARTCOIN and allows for a more expansive customization process to make your mining rig more effective. The coming partnerships with influencers and other meme projects will also help increase visibility and potentially drive Pepenode into the mainstream. Based on Pepenode presale’s growth rate and scope, our price prediction for $PEPENODE considers a price point of $0.0023 by the end of 2025. By 2030, the token could reach $0.0244 with sufficient community support and involvement. Should You Buy $PEPENODE? Whether or not you should invest in $PEPENODE depends on your risk tolerance and investment strategy. However, Pepenode shows great long-term potential thanks to its mining simulator, which keeps investors engaged and rewards their loyalty with actual meme coin drops. If you want to invest, you can read how to buy $PEPENODE right here and finalize your transaction on the official presale page. But remember do to your own research. This is not financial advice.

AI Predicts the Bigger Winner for 2025 Price Gains (Conclusion Will Surprise You),https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-or-ada-ai-predicts-the-bigger-winner-for-2025-price-gains-conclusion-will-surprise-you/,"TL;DR The most utilized AI solution speculates on which of the two highly popular altcoins will post more substantial price increases (if any) by the end of the year. So far, the battle between the two has been won by Ripple’s native token, but will this trend continue in the following months? XRP Vs. ADA Recall that both assets struggled for most of the previous year, especially in the months leading up to the US presidential elections. At the time, ADA was confined in a tight range between $0.3 and $0.5 from late April to early November. XRP fluctuated between $0.4 and $0.6, with occasional deviations above the upper boundary. It all changed once Donald J. Trump won the elections. However, even though both marked substantial gains at one point or another, one stood out as the winner, for now at least. After all, XRP managed to break through several milestones, such as $1, $2, and $3, and even tapped a new all-time high of $3.65 in mid-July. At the same time, ADA rocketed past $1.3 in early December following some big promises by Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson, but ultimately failed to maintain its run and has since slipped to under $0.9. As such, XRP has undoubtedly won the war for the past ten months, but with that said, what lies ahead for both? Naturally, any price predictions are mere speculations, but we decided to ask ChatGPT about its take on the matter, basing its analysis on historical performances, technical analysis, market sentiment, and other factors. XRP Case OpenAI’s solution noted that XRP leads ADA in terms of ETF applications, with 15 against 1, which is a massive divergence and shows that investors as well as issuers are much more inclined to opt for Ripple’s native token. The SEC has until October to make a decision, and the potential approval of such important financial vehicles can send the underlying asset flying. ChatGPT also said Ripple and XRP have and will continue to benefit from the regulatory clarity in the US after Trump’s presidential election victory and the internal changes at the SEC. Consequently, XRP is now finally seen as a “more compliance-ready altcoin.” Being a cross-border payments and settlement cryptocurrency, XRP is also appealing to institutions such as banks, remittance providers, and fintech firms. The AI chatbot outlined a few risks as well. It warned that the $3.65 ATH reached in July could be a yearly ceiling for the asset, especially since it has failed to hold above the crucial $3 level, which turned from support to resistance. Additionally, ChatGPT noted that retail hype might have shifted from XRP to other trendier tokens. ADA Case Although not as many as the XRP ETF filings, Grayscale’s application for a spot ADA ETF could also benefit the underlying asset. Following the S-1 update from a few weeks back, the odds of approval have shot up to 87%, according to Polymarket. Granted, the percentage for the XRP ETFs is identical. ChatGPT noted that Cardano continues to have a robust development ecosystem, with DeFi, NFTs, and frequent governance upgrades. ADA’s lower market cap compared to XRP’s could also benefit it more since its percentage gains could outpace Ripple’s token. It also faces its fair share of risks, including frequent critiques for its gradual and sometimes sluggish rollout of features compared to some of its rivals. Speaking of rivals, Cardano has a long list of L1s to fight with, such as SOL and ETH. Conclusion As a bottom line, ChatGPT classified XRP as the “safer play” due to the institutional narrative and its larger market cap. It said it’s more likely to hold its value and benefit from regulation.

The blockchain infrastructure provider is currently seen as the leading candidate for validator selection due to its acquisition of Molecular Labs and its decade-long stablecoin expertise. The proposal comes as Hyperliquid prepares to launch its native stablecoin through a validator vote process, slashing its trading fee by 80% . The decentralized exchange reserved the USDH ticker and invited teams to submit deployment proposals, with selection determined by on-chain validator consensus. Paxos Labs Acquires Hyperliquid Infrastructure Provider Paxos established Paxos Labs specifically to accelerate stablecoin adoption within decentralized ecosystems, and will make Hyperliquid its first priority. Proposal submitted: USDH powered by Paxos USDH issued by Paxos would mean: ❏ Global issuance that is GENIUS compliant ❏ Revenue sharing that fuels HYPE, protocols and validators ❏ Regulatory clarity + global scale to match @HyperliquidX 's explosive growth Hyperliquid. pic.twitter.com/iKIFUOT0bQ — Paxos (@Paxos) September 6, 2025 The new entity acquired Molecular Labs, the infrastructure provider behind the LHYPE and WHLP tokens that have been operational since HyperEVM’s launch. The acquisition provides native Hyperliquid ecosystem experience while leveraging Paxos’s track record issuing stablecoins for Binance, PayPal, Kraken, Robinhood, and OKX. The company has achieved a cumulative issuance volume of $160 billion across seven tokenized assets. Paxos offers multi-jurisdictional compliance, including adherence to the GENIUS Act in the United States and MiCA compliance across Europe. The firm claimed it maintains banking licenses in Singapore and Abu Dhabi while operating payment corridors across Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Turkey, the UAE, and the Philippines. According to the company, USDH will be deployed natively on both HyperEVM and HyperCore blockchains, with full regulatory oversight. The stablecoin will hold reserves in Treasury bills, repurchase agreements, and USDG tokens meeting institutional market maker requirements. The revenue-sharing model allocates 95% of interest earnings toward HYPE buybacks, which are distributed among protocols, validators, and users. Distribution will be proportional to USDH balances and trading volumes across partnering Hyperliquid platforms. Hyperliquid’s Record-Breaking Performance Drives Stablecoin Demand Earlier this month, a report by Cryptonews showed that Hyperliquid generated $106 million in perpetual futures trading revenue during August, marking 23% growth from July’s $86.6 million. The platform captured a 70% market share among DeFi perpetuals, processing $383 billion in monthly trading volume. The exchange operates with just 11 employees while achieving an annual volume of $330.8 billion, creating efficiency ratios that surpass those of traditional payment giants. Trading activity peaked at $29 billion in 24-hour volume during market volatility, generating $7.7 million in daily fees. Total value locked climbed to $762.57 million from $230.48 million in April, while cumulative perpetual futures volume reached $2.57 trillion. At the time of writing, the HYPE token is trading at $47.33 following the Paxos announcement, maintaining gains of 2% in the past 24 hours. Source: CoinGecko Late last month, Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes projected 126x returns on HYPE by 2028 as Treasury-backed stablecoins reshape global banking. Revenue Model Creates Ecosystem Flywheel Effect USDH aims to extend Hyperliquid’s builder code concept, which shares exchange revenue with volume drivers, to stablecoin economics. The proposed revenue distribution aims to create aligned incentives for application builders, validators, and community members. Current analysis suggests USDH could generate $191 million annually in additional HYPE buybacks if replacing USDC usage on Hyperliquid. paxos proposing to spend 95% of interest earned in HYPE buybacks using the current bond/cash ratio of USDC, if USDH replaces USDC in hyperliquid, that'd be an extra 191m/yr in buybacks https://t.co/BavB15qmlA pic.twitter.com/AZjqFNj4Hy — 0xngmi (@0xngmi) September 6, 2025 The calculation uses existing bond and cash ratios from Circle’s USDC reserves applied to Hyperliquid’s stablecoin volumes. Paxos plans to integrate HYPE as a tradeable asset within its brokerage infrastructure, powering crypto trading for PayPal, Venmo, MercadoLibre, Nubank, and Interactive Brokers. The integration would provide additional liquidity and institutional access for the governance token. The stablecoin will support comprehensive funding capabilities, including direct fiat banking rails through SWIFT, ACH, and wire transfers. Moreover, native conversion from Circle’s USDC, PYUSD, and USDG to USDH eliminates secondary market price exposure for users. USDH also enables real payment functionality through card issuance, merchant acceptance, and enterprise fintech integrations. The infrastructure connects Hyperliquid to global consumer banking systems beyond crypto-native users. Community response has been positive, with users highlighting Paxos’s unmatched stablecoin experience and regulatory coverage as differentiating factors. This is the strongest proposal yet and I feel comfortable endorsing @Paxos I feel strongly that the team responsible for undertaking this project should have experience in stablecoin issuance AND have native ties to Hyperliquid Paxos checks both boxes, albeit the native to… https://t.co/5Lg8WfqkCN pic.twitter.com/8VoVP4p5NC — Ramen (@Ramen_HL) September 6, 2025 The proposal portrays USDH as a globally compliant infrastructure that supports Hyperliquid’s transition from a crypto-native platform to mainstream financial infrastructure.

51338791,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=801563,1757244600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51338791.jpeg,"Institutional Demand Pushes DeFi Higher, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Seen as the Next Big Lending Protocol",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/institutional-demand-pushes-defi-higher-mutuum-finance-mutm-seen-as-the-next-big-lending-protocol/,"The trend of institutional demand on decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocols is gaining momentum and it is transforming the industry. Hedge funds experimenting with yield strategies to fintechs accessing on-chain liquidity are no longer on the fringes. This increased demand has already increased the awareness of projects such as Aave and Compound. Analysts are now questioning whether a new protocol called Mutuum Finance (MUTM) can be the next large lending protocol to receive the benefits of institutional inflows. The Bigger Picture The reason why institutions are attracted to DeFi is that when compared to the traditional markets, the latter provides yields, transparency, and programmable finance. Where traditional lending involves intermediaries, DeFi protocols offer non-custodial, automated, and open alternatives. To institutions, this implies greater returns on idle funds, less counterparty risk, and blockchain information transparency. Also, complex strategies, e.g., collateralized lending and automatic risk management, can be implemented via programmable finance, and run trustlessly. This efficiency and control has led DeFi to become the logical follow-up to companies that are already experimenting with Bitcoin ETFs, ETH staking products, and assets tokenized. Institutional money will not only introduce liquidity into a protocol, but also token demand. The best examples are Aave and Compound. During previous cycles, AAVE rose to highs above $600 and COMP to almost $900 as institutional inflows flooded their lending pools, pushing demand of their governance tokens to the max. The same trend might happen once again. Analysts point out that each additional dollar of liquidity will tend to be multiplied: it can allow more borrowing, more people to use the product, and it generates more fee income, which in turn pushes token valuation higher. This is particularly significant to investors because it allows them to determine the next lending protocol that is likely to attract institutional inflows. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an emerging DeFi project that is gaining popularity due to a rare blend of initial hype and realistic groundbreaking idea. MUTM is already demonstrating indications of market demand at an industry in which many presale projects do not seem to garner any significant interest. At only a cost of $0.035 during Stage 6 of its presale, the token has seen a flood of investors who realize the potential to gain early exposure before its official release. The presale was launched in early 2025 and has gone viral. Mutuum Finance has so far raised over 15.4 million dollars and has developed a community of over 16,100 holders. These numbers by themselves are indicative of the retail excitement, but they also show that bigger players have increased confidence. Already, the whales have contributed half a dozen figures, continuing to confirm the project momentum and implying the start of an institutional-style capital inflow. The presale model is created to compensate the first mover and indicate the increasing demand. The token prices grow by about 15-20% with every new step, gradually approaching its official price of listing at $0.06. To the investor who buys it today (at a price of $0.035) this structure will ensure close to a hundred percent increase in price by the time of the launch, without even considering the post-listing growth. The second step will increase the price to $0.04, which is nearly a 20% increase on the current price, meaning the ones who delay will pay considerably higher when entering. The reason why MUTM is being followed by Analysts Dual Lending Markets — Peer-to-contract pools enable users to deposit assets such as ETH, BNB, or USDT and receive mtTokens which earn interest and can be staked to earn more. P2P lending links borrowers with lenders and allows them to choose variable rates that change with the demand in the liquidity market or a set rate at which costs can be determined with accuracy. Beta at Launch — Perhaps the strongest feature of the Mutuum Finance roadmap is that the beta platform will be released on the same date as the token listing. This implies that lending and borrowing will be in full operation on the first day, which is not common in the presale space where most projects issue tokens without products to use. Being functional immediately serves as a credibility-builder and also sparks token demand at the outset. Integration Layer 2 – Intended upgrades will reduce charges and accelerate transactions, increasing scalability and attracting users with higher volumes. Collectively, these traits make MUTM a protocol that is designed to support the current generation of DeFi users as well as institutions that require scalability, transparency, and trust. Institutions Could Fuel the Next Big Lending Protocol To investors the figures paint a pretty picture. By buying in at a presale price of $0.035 to-date, the investors are basically securing nearly double returns at the launch price of 0.06. However, the real upside to the analysts is in the post-launch waves. Once MUTM reaches the level of 0.25 during its initial growth period, this will translate to an increase greater than 600% compared to the present price of 0.035. Farther into the future, a medium-term goal of $1.00 would boost the returns to more than 2,750%, putting early investors in a place akin to those that invested in Aave or Solana prior to their breakout spurts. And as long-range projections suggest a rise to $2.50–$3.00 by 2030, the possible upside is even further, over 8,400% of the current price The institutional demand is driving DeFi to the next level and history tells us what can happen when liquidity flows into lending protocols, token valuations will tend to follow. Compound and Aave were the demonstrations that the model works. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now being pitched as the next big candidate with a presale of more than $15.4 million and 16,100 holders already onboard. To investors, the lesson is straightforward: with institutions seeking scalable, secure, and transparent DeFi tools, MUTM could be affordable and innovative enough to become one of the protocols that come to define the next cycle of lending.

This move is part of the Trump administration’s “Crypto Sprint” initiative, which aims to reshape the regulatory environment for the U.S. crypto market. CFTC Acting Chair Caroline Pham stated that this policy not only allows Americans to trade more “safely and efficiently” under a regulated framework but also reconnects the U.S. market with the global crypto space. She emphasized that it marks a significant achievement in the “Crypto Sprint” plan. This new policy is seen as a key step in breaking down previous “regional restrictions.” For example, with Binance, U.S. users can currently only trade through Binance.US, which is not available nationwide. However, with the loosening of regulations, Americans will soon be able to freely trade on Binance’s global platform.

By 2028, SPX may achieve a peak price of $5.59 and an average trading price of $5.24. In 2031, the target price for SPX is between $8.39 and $9.09, with an average price of $8.74. SPX6900 (SPX) functions primarily on the Ethereum network. The token was created as a meme to entertain wider audiences. It has no real connection with stock market, equities, or securities. The meme coin generates interest through spot trading, market speculation, or perpetual and leveraged trading on different decentralized exchanges; the latter is not recommended for non-professionals due to its high risk and highly volatile nature. SPX6900 is traded on different centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges. The most popular centralized exchange for trading SPX tokens is Bybit, which has the highest trading volume for this meme coin. SPX6900 (SPX) can be stored in various wallets, including Trust Wallet, Bitget Wallet, and hardware wallets like Ledger. It can also be stored on a centralized exchange like KuCoin and another option could be Kraken, providing easy access to the coin. Early users attest to its credibility and remarkable price performance; however, the meme token still holds the interest of many investors with a daily trading volume in millions and a current circulating supply of 930.99 million SPX, which is also its total supply, although its max supply will be 1 billion tokens. Starting as a non-serious venture, the coin established itself as one of the most high-ranking coins of the year 2024. It was initiated as a useless token but ultimately ended up earning profits in the millions. For example, over a month, SPX earned up to a 9000% return following its ascent through September 2024. What’s next for the meme token in 2025 and beyond? Let’s get into the SPX6900 price prediction and technical analysis.

SPX6900 price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin value has increased to $1.17 in the past 24 hours. If buyers push the price above immediate resistance channels, we might see the SPX6900 price surging toward $1.23 level. On the other hand, a drop below the $1.07 support line can strengthen sellers’ domination. In such a case, a decline toward $1 is highly likely. Is SPX6900 a good investment? Investing in SPX necessitates an evaluation of the SPX market and its emphasis on adaptability. Despite the earlier price spikes and enormous price gains, investors are advised to exercise caution on account of the market volatility of meme coins. Earnings from SPX require long-term investment decisions, whether holding or trading, but in this dynamic market, risk management is primarily achieved through diversification and keeping abreast of developments. Why is SPX up? SPX’s price increased to $1.17 during the last 24 hours. The buyers have rushed into the market again; moreover, the token’s market sentiment remains neutral today. SPX’s nearest resistance level is at $1.23. Will SPX6900 reach $2? SPX token may reach $2 in 2025. With the current price action, this seems quite possible, as the token is trending above $1 and its market cap will nearly double when it reaches this level. Will SPX reach $3? Per SPX price prediction, it has a chance of reaching $3 by 2026 if positive sentiment prevails, which makes SPX tokens a good purchase option. Will SPX reach $5? To reach $5, SPX’s value along with its market cap will have to increase fivefold. Though not impossible, there are chances of reaching this level by 2028. Does SPX6900 have a good long-term future? Long-term forecasts suggest a gradual increase in the value of SPX over the next two years. Following this period, projections anticipate sustained upward price movement with a potential resurgence in 2029. By 2031, SPX is expected to trade above $9, solidifying its position as a valuable long-term asset. SPX6900 does not only capitalize on mere entertainment but is also driven by the community surrounding it.

However, the service will only be available on overseas platforms due to a comprehensive ban on digital assets in mainland China. According to the statement, Wetour will accept XRP payments for some of its international services. This will include services such as airport transfers and private car rentals. This move is considered a notable example of a state-controlled airline partner testing digital asset payments.

Air China is part of the central government-controlled China National Aviation Holdings (CNAHC). China bans all digital asset-based payments and encourages the use of the digital yuan (e-CNY). Therefore, XRP payments will only be available to Air China's 60 million PhoenixMiles members living or traveling abroad.

While these tokens remain in the spotlight, a less obvious trend is taking place in favor of Remittix (RTX). The project has joined the crypto presale scene with decent momentum and a planned Q3 2025 beta wallet launch. With payments in the real world at the forefront, RTX is now being pitted against other DeFi projects designed to meet the next generation of adoption challenges. Bitcoin & Solana Price Snapshot Bitcoin is trading at $110,759.41 as of now, with a 0.91% decrease in the past 24 hours. Its market capitalization is $2.2 trillion, backed by a $56.16 billion trading volume, though it is down by 9.68%. Solana also shifted, trading at $202.45 with a decline of 1.12% over the same period. Its $109.55 billion market cap is underpinned by $7.26 billion of trade volume, up 42.66%. While both tokens remain essential to liquidity on centralized exchanges, new players like Remittix are being watched by investors seeking the next popular altcoin 2025. Remittix Presale And CEX Milestones Remittix (RTX) is priced at $0.1050 per token and has raised more than $24,2 million, selling more than 649 million tokens already. These achievements prompted major announcements for early crypto investors. With the achievement of the $20 million raised milestone, RTX announced BitMart to be its first centralized exchange listing. Following the surpassing of $22 million, a second LBank listing was announced. Both CEX announcements raise Remittix visibility and liquidity, thus giving it initial credibility compared to other crypto presales that are currently live. Beta Wallet Launch: Real-World Utility Coming In Q3 2025 The most significant aspect of the Remittix roadmap is the release of a beta wallet in Q3 2025. The wallet will be mobile-first and will bridge decentralized exchange functionality and traditional banking infrastructure. It will support 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies with real-time FX conversion and low gas fee crypto transfers. The wallet also enables instant payments to bank accounts in 30+ countries, offering solutions for freelancers, corporations and cross-border remitters. This puts RTX firmly in the list of crypto that is solving real world problems, alongside low cap crypto gems and leading DeFi projects 2025.

Retail-sized transfers, counting transactions under $250, crossed $5.84 billion in August alone, the highest ever recorded, according to data by Visa and Allium cited in the report. With nearly four months left in the year, 2025 has already become the busiest period yet for stablecoin transfer volume at the consumer level. The figures underscore stablecoins, a group of cryptos tied to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, becoming increasingly embedded into everyday financial activity, from cross-border remittances to microtransactions, the report pointed out. Survey data from emerging markets, asking over 2,600 consumer in Nigeria, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Indonesia, reinforced this picture, CEX.io analysts. A majority of respondents said they turned to stablecoins to avoid high banking fees and slow transfers, the report said. Nearly 70% of them reported using stablecoins more frequently than last year, and more than three-quarters expect usage to keep rising, the report said. Ethereum gains, Tron falls back The distribution of activity among blockchains have shifted, the report noted. The Tron (TRX) blockchain, traditionally popular for retail transfers due to its low fees and wide support for Tether's USDT (USDT), has given up market share. Monthly transaction counts fell by 1.3 million, or 6%, and its growth in volume lagged behind its closest competitors. In its place, Binance Smart Chain (BSC) emerged as the top choice for retail users, capturing nearly 40% of retail stablecoin activity, the report said. The network’s transaction count jumped 75% this year with transfer volume rising 67%. Much of the momentum came after Binance delisted USDT in March for European users and a resurgence of memecoin trading on PancakeSwap on BSC. The Ethereum complex, with the base chain and layer-2 networks combined, made up over 20% of transfer volume and 31% of transaction counts, the report noted. While small transfers largely took place on L2s, the mainnet enjoyed a significant rise in the retail segment. Sub-$250 transfers on the mainnet rose 81% in volume and 184% in count. Ethereum has been mostly used for large-value transactions due to its high fees, but transaction costs have dropped more than 70% over the past year, making mainnet transactions more competitive even in the sub-$250 range, the authors said.

Meanwhile, there’s a tiny, cheap altcoin at $0.10 that could blast off 40×. MAGACOIN FINANCE also finds its way on the list of speculative alternatives for more narrative exposure. Bull Flag Pattern Targets $5 for XRP Technical charts have shown XRP trading in a bull flag pattern, which comes during a period of consolidation or correction following a strong advance. A close above the daily resistance line (green on the chart below) at $3, not to mention the 50DMA around $3.08, could potentially confirm a breakout. If those were to be hit, price targets would consolidate around the $5 zone — a 77%-plus move higher. Resistance comes in at $3.40, followed by the July high of $3.66, while support is the $2.68 and $2.48 levels needed to preserve the bullish pattern. Institutional ETF Tailwinds and Regulatory Optimism Whilst XRP forges its move, analysts are also keeping tabs on an emerging altcoin valued at $0.10, which appears poised for significant price increases. Although it’s not its own Ethereum level 2 meme, it is being mentioned for the user narratives it will host and its potential upside, which could be up to 40× its current trading price. The investment outlook appears to be bifurcated between established names and high-risk entries, with these coins emerging as the best crypto to watch heading into 2025. Speculative Spotlight: A $0.10 Altcoin Poised for 40× The odds XRP will get that coveted ETF approval are increasing, with market expectations now standing at roughly 87%, according to Polymarket data. Here are some crucial SEC decision deadlines between October and November. Analysts point out that approval could result in an additional $5 billion to $8 billion in capital inflows into XRP. JPMorgan and ETF strategists are pointing to accumulating institutional demand as fuel for the bullish narrative. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Thematic Alternative Beyond XRP and breakout tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains on the radar for narrative-driven investors. Its branding and analyst coverage place it among speculative options worth monitoring—especially for portfolios balancing proven structural growth and cultural momentum. Conclusion XRP bulls have placed nicely; the bull flag is now in bullish territory as ETF approval optimism peaks. The MAGACOIN token, currently in the $0.10 territory, has lopsided growth narratives that could attract investor money. Throw in some technical setups, regulatory tailwinds, and buzz in a bottle, and you’ve got some narratives brewing based on XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE as the tokens to watch into 2025.

The online gaming platform announced the update on Friday during its Roblox Developers Conference (RDC). The short clips video format is called “Roblox Moments,” and it’s available in beta for users who are 13 years old and above. Roblox introduces short clips Roblox Moments lets players capture and edit videos of their gameplay. For example, users can trim videos into 30-second clips, add music, and write a description. Roblox users can then share their gameplay moments with everyone, making them discoverable in the clips feed. People who view the short clips will have the option to react with an emoji or even jump into the game experience directly from the video. This feature helps creators drive more traffic to their game. In a blog post , Roblox wrote, “The Moments experience is a direct demonstration of what’s possible with our new creator-focused tools.” The gaming company wants to support creators and developers further by adding a Moments API. Creators will be able to pin clips showcasing their game, and they can even create a dynamic leaderboard of the best Roblox Moments related to their game. Roblox wrote, “A dynamic billboard could use the Recommendations API to showcase real-time highlights of the coolest overtakes.” The company will share the source code of Roblox Moments so developers and creators can start building immediately. The gaming platform will roll out Roblox Moments gradually, allowing it to test and refine moderation measures. This will ensure that the content follows community standards and is age-appropriate. The APIs of the short clips feature will be available later this year. Introducing Roblox Moments, the ultimate discovery experience. Now you can easily capture and share your epic wins (and fails) with the world. Beta is live— discovery starts now. #RDC25 pic.twitter.com/c3YZF1tT2O — Roblox (@Roblox) September 5, 2025 Roblox adds new AI tools for gamers and creators During the RDC conference, Roblox announced the release of new AI tools . Creators will be able to create interactive in-game items, like a car or weapon, through prompting the AI tool. The gaming platform will then create the car or weapon, and add it to the game so the character can drive around or use the weapon. The AI tools provide a creative leap compared to generating static 3D objects. Roblox is also releasing other AI tools that provide real-time voice chat translation. Users who speak English, Spanish, German, and French can communicate and socialize easily through this tool. Moreover, the company announced AI tools for creators, providing text-to-speech and speech-to-text APIs. Creators will be able to add AI narrations using the text-to-speech API. For example, in-game characters could have dialogues, and creators can choose from 10 English voice presets. The speech-to-text feature will let gamers talk to their characters using voice commands. Roblox is raising the Developer Exchange (DevEx) rate for creators. This change lets them earn 8.5% more when converting Robux into cash. For example, 100,000 Robux will now equal $380 instead of $350. Get seen where it counts.

The tweet, which included a video by XRP YouTuber and crypto enthusiast Working Money, referenced an official Basel Committee letter dated August 19, 2025. The document from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) identifies a select group of cryptocurrencies, including XRP, as compliant assets under liquidity classifications set out by Basel III regulations. In the video, Working Money explained that the Basel Committee’s letter classifies certain digital assets as Group 2A crypto assets. Under the committee’s framework, these assets must meet three hedging recognition criteria to be placed in this category. Only Bitcoin , Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin were listed as meeting these requirements. This classification is significant because it means banks can use these assets to meet liquidity requirements established under Basel III standards. XRP Basel “Ripple has a good chance of replacing parts of the existing financial infrastructure.” @WorkingMoneyCH pic.twitter.com/YZWem7iQB6 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 6, 2025 Role of XRP in Liquidity Management According to Working Money, XRP’s potential role extends beyond being a listed compliant asset. He emphasized that XRP allows banks to consolidate reserves into a single bridge asset, which reduces reliance on multiple Nostro accounts and cuts foreign exchange and treasury costs. The video highlighted how this streamlines liquidity management and lowers infrastructure expenses associated with processing cross-border payments. Working Money pointed out that Ripple has long envisioned XRP being used as a universal bridge asset, capable of providing banks with liquidity on demand once the market capitalization and trading volumes grow sufficiently. This aligns with Ripple’s stated goal of reducing opportunity costs for financial institutions by replacing or lowering their dependence on lower-yielding high-quality liquid assets required under Basel III regulations. Industry Perspectives and Academic Commentary The video also cited academic perspectives on the potential role of Ripple and XRP in financial infrastructure. Working Money referenced comments from a professor at the University of Basel, who stated that Ripple has a strong chance of replacing parts of the existing financial infrastructure. This view was reinforced by a passage he quoted from earlier research shared by SMQKE, which suggested that whenever protocols and interfaces can be unified and databases synchronized more efficiently, distributed ledger technology such as Ripple’s should be implemented. Examples of centralized systems mentioned in that research included Ripple and the R3 consortium, with both being described as having the potential to replace parts of the financial system. These observations support the argument that Ripple’s technology and the adoption of XRP as a liquidity tool are not just theoretical but are increasingly being integrated into broader discussions of regulatory frameworks and banking practices.

As Working Money emphasized, this development shows progress toward real-world utility for XRP within regulated banking structures. By enabling banks to simplify liquidity management and cut costs, XRP’s classification as a compliant asset could further support its use as a bridge currency in cross-border settlement.

To help identify long-term opportunities, Finbold turned to OpenAI’s latest artificial intelligence (AI) model, ChatGPT-5 , to highlight two assets worth considering. Sei (SEI) Sei positions itself as a high-performance Layer-1 blockchain designed to serve as the “speed layer” for decentralized finance. Its architecture leverages parallel transaction execution and a specialized consensus mechanism, enabling low-latency and high-throughput operations. According to ChatGPT, this makes Sei particularly suited for decentralized exchanges, order book protocols, and other applications requiring fast execution. The model noted that Sei’s expanding ecosystem of DeFi applications and strong community engagement have positioned it as a potential “next Solana ,” offering speed, scalability, and infrastructure tailored for trading-focused applications. By press time, SEI was trading at $0.29, up 3.5% in the past 24 hours and about 2% on the weekly timeline. SEI seven-day price chart.

The project focuses on bridging traditional finance with decentralized platforms by bringing yield-bearing instruments such as U.S. Treasuries and corporate bonds onto the blockchain. Indeed, Ondo has been attempting to hold its price above the $1 level. By press time, the token was trading at $0.90, up nearly 1% in the past 24 hours. ONDO seven-day price chart.

Speaking on behalf of the organization, Ola Olukoyede, Executive Chairman of the EFCC, says Nigeria risks exposing its financial system to large-scale abuse if cryptocurrency activities continue without proper regulation. Olukoyede was represented by his Chief of Staff, Michael Nze, speaking to the stakeholders and members of the Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria (SiBAN), led by its president, Obinna Iwuno, at the EFCC headquarters in Abuja. During the courtesy visit, Olukoyede described cryptocurrency as the engine of global innovation and wealth creation. In addition, he noted that in the wrong hands, it could become a tool to carry out vices like terrorism financing and fraud if left unchecked. EFCC Chairman reiterates the need for crypto regulation in Nigeria Olukoyede described crypto as the new oil, noting that there is so much money to be made in the industry. However, he noted that the ecosystem needs to be properly regulated, noting that it would help people thrive without stifling innovation in the space. The EFCC boss also added that without proper regulation, genuine actors in the space are also bound to fall prey to bad elements looking to take advantage of their inexperience, haste, or the need to make money. “There is a thin line between genuine crypto operators and fraudsters. Sadly, we are seeing politically exposed persons and even so-called legitimate actors exploiting crypto for laundering money,” Olukoyede said. He also urged SiBAN and other blockchain-affiliated stakeholders to ensure they carry out prompt awareness and education for people looking to enter the scene. Further, Olukoyede charged the association to play its part in curbing the menace of bad actors in the space, noting that they can do well to report them to the relevant authorities. “You can collaborate with us to stop money laundering. You can blow the whistle. You can be whistleblowers. The more enlightenment and training we provide, the stronger our economy becomes,” he added. SiBAN president calls for regulation without stifling innovation Obinna Iwuno, as part of his remarks, said the association has already come up with a code of ethics modeled after the best global practices, revealing its readiness for regulation in the crypto industry. “We have drawn from international standards to create a code of ethics for practitioners and operators in Nigeria. This demonstrates our commitment to be ethical, regulated, and compliant with both local and global laws,” Iwuno said. Iwuno stressed that the group has been calling on the government to regulate the crypto space since it became mainstream in 2018, noting that without it, the country risks losing out on capital. He added that SiBAN is keen to collaborate with the EFCC in creating awareness through investor education, anti-scam campaigns, and different fraud reporting methods. In his words, Iwuno claimed that the group had already mandated Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance for crypto platforms. The group also mentioned that they have instructed crypto firms and related platforms to set up a compliance officer to ensure they are accountable. However, Iwuno cautioned that while regulation is great for any country, it should not hinder the growth of the crypto industry. “As much as we push for regulation, we also want to make sure innovation is not strangulated,” he said. He highlighted that Nigeria has one of the highest youth populations in Africa, and most of them are very active in the crypto space. “However, without proper regulation, we stand at risk of money laundering, terrorism financing, threats to national security, and proliferation financing,” he said.

AppLovin and Emcor replace MarketAxess, Caesars, Enphase. Robinhood shares surge 7% after-hours on the announcement. Robinhood Joins the S&P 500: What It Means Trading platform Robinhood Markets Inc. will officially join the S&P 500 stock index on September 22, 2025, marking a major turning point for a company that rose to fame during the pandemic’s retail investor boom. The update was confirmed by S&P Dow Jones Indices and reported by Bloomberg . Alongside Robinhood, AppLovin Corp. and Emcor Group Inc. will also be added, replacing MarketAxess Holdings Inc., Caesars Entertainment Inc., and Enphase Energy Inc. Robinhood’s Shares Jump After the News The announcement immediately boosted investor confidence. Robinhood shares surged more than 7% in after-hours trading. AppLovin rose 7.5% , while Emcor gained 2.5% . Founded in 2013 by Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, Robinhood revolutionized investing with its commission-free trading and easy-to-use app. The platform became a household name during the GameStop and AMC “meme stock” frenzy. Why Robinhood’s Inclusion Matters Robinhood gains greater liquidity and visibility , as index funds and pensions will now automatically include its shares. The company joins other crypto-focused players already in the index, such as Coinbase Global Inc. and Block Inc. This inclusion could help broaden its investor base and strengthen long-term credibility. Robinhood manages billions in client assets across stocks, options, and cryptocurrencies. Its entry into the S&P 500 not only validates the company’s market presence but also reflects how retail trading and crypto adoption have reshaped modern finance.

Tron (TRX) price prediction models point to a possible breakout toward $0.38 after holding strong support at $0.33, showing resilience in sideways markets. Chainlink (LINK) price analysis highlights the importance of the $28 threshold, failure there could send it to $16, but holding momentum may allow a rally into the low $30s. Both coins demonstrate promise but also face risk tied to broader market conditions. Then comes BlockDAG (BDAG), the outlier. Unlike TRON and LINK, it isn’t relying on speculative chart setups but entering with fundamentals already in motion, 4,500 developers, 300+ dApps, 3M mobile miners, and $400M raised. With presale pricing locked at $0.0013 and ROI structured up to a projected $1, the story here is fundamentally different. TRON Eyes a Breakout: Could $0.38 Be Next? TRON (TRX) is currently trading around $0.34, and market analysts suggest the token could be preparing for a breakout toward $0.37–$0.38 in the weeks ahead. The price has managed to hold above key support near $0.33, while technical readings such as the Relative Strength Index remain neutral, showing that the market is neither overbought nor oversold. At the same time, momentum indicators point to underlying strength, giving TRX a chance to retest higher resistance levels. On the downside, a slip under $0.33 could trigger a short-term pullback, but deeper declines appear less likely at this stage. For investors assessing the best crypto for the future, this consolidation period offers a chance to enter before a potential upward move. If TRON clears the $0.38 resistance zone, the momentum could expand further, making the current price an interesting level for those watching its next trend. Chainlink’s Line in the Sand: $28 Support or Dive to $16? Chainlink (LINK) is trading near $23 after recovering from recent lows, but analysts warn the coming weeks could be decisive. According to Ali Martinez, the $28 level stands as a key threshold that will determine whether bulls remain in control. A failure to hold momentum above this zone could see LINK slide toward $16, an area many view as a strong support base where fresh buying interest could emerge. On the other hand, if LINK manages to convert the mid-$20s into reliable support, it could pave the way for a push into the high-$20s or even the low-$30s. Exchange outflows and signs of accumulation are strengthening the bullish case, but risks remain. For investors considering the best crypto for the future, Chainlink’s current price zone offers both risk and opportunity , making now a pivotal point for positioning. BlockDAG Is Listing With 4,500 Developers Ready , Why $0.0013 Could Be the Last Cheap Entry BlockDAG is proving it isn’t just another presale project, it’s entering the market with an ecosystem already loaded and ready to scale. While most new Layer-1 networks list first and scramble later to attract developers, BlockDAG is flipping the script. With 4,500 developers already onboard and more than 300 decentralized apps (dApps) seeded before listing, the question for investors is no longer “will adoption happen?” but instead “how fast will this scale?” This kind of preparedness is rare, and it immediately shifts the risk profile. The presale framework itself adds more confidence. Early entries at $0.001 have already delivered 2,900% ROI, and with the Deployment Event price set at $0.0013, the upside to the confirmed $0.05 listing and long-term $1 target is staggering. That’s a 76,815% potential gain for those buying now. Add in 3 million mobile miners on the X1 app, 312,000 coin holders, and 19,000 miners shipped, and BlockDAG’s scale is visible, not speculative. Investors are realizing that BlockDAG isn’t a “wait and see” story. It’s a project entering exchanges with adoption, utility, and momentum already in motion. At $0.0013, the entry point feels like a door about to slam shut. The ecosystem is built, the only thing left is to watch it explode. BlockDAG Is Not a Bet - It’s a Structured Path to 76,815% ROI When comparing Tron (TRX) price prediction, Chainlink (LINK) price analysis, and BlockDAG’s presale framework, one truth becomes clear: BlockDAG offers what the others don’t, structured ROI with adoption already loaded in. TRON may push toward $0.38, and LINK may rally if it holds $28, but both depend on technical signals holding firm in volatile conditions. BlockDAG, however, is not waiting for the charts to validate its story. With 76,815% ROI potential from today’s $0.0013 entry, a $600M presale target, whale activity in the millions, and an ecosystem already functioning, it represents a presale where the upside isn’t theoretical, it’s engineered.

While ETH inches toward a potential breakout, a new contender is gaining rapid traction. Remittix (RTX) , a PayFi token bridging crypto and bank transfers, is emerging as a top pick among traders searching for the best crypto to buy today. Ethereum Price Prediction Hints At Imminent Supply Shock Ethereum price prediction remains on the table as ETH continues to consolidate between the $4,200 and $4,500 levels. Despite Ethereum being 13% lower than its recent all-time high of $4,956, there are signs of strength being shown by Ethereum. The sharp drop in the Ethereum Exchange Supply Ratio (ESR) suggests that there are fewer coins available for sale, which typically precedes major higher moves. Data from CryptoQuant indicates that ETH’s ESR on Binance fell from 0.041 to 0.037 in just two weeks. Historically, such shifts have triggered bullish rallies, especially when prices remain stable. Analysts say this reflects rising investor confidence, with holders opting for self-custody over exchange storage. Ethereum price prediction now hinges on multiple bullish indicators. Exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows remain strong, while leverage across futures markets has declined, reducing the risk of liquidations. In addition, whale activity has softened, indicating that long-term investors are holding, not selling. Remittix Stands Out Amid Ethereum Price Prediction Buzz While Ethereum price prediction continues to dominate headlines, many traders are turning to alternative tokens with higher upside. Remittix has emerged as a top contender for September, especially among those looking for tokens under $1 with real-world application and centralized exchange momentum. Remittix has raised over $24,2 million, sold more than 649 million tokens and is currently priced at $0.1050. Its rising adoption stems from the PayFi utility it brings to the market, bridging crypto-to-bank transfers across 30+ countries with over 40 supported digital assets. Here are some important milestones Remittix has achieved: The Remittix wallet beta is scheduled to launch this September, supporting 40+ cryptos and live FX conversion. The project is already listed on BitMart and LBANK, with a third listing reportedly in progress. It features a Pay API for merchants, freelancers and gig workers to receive crypto and settle to fiat easily. Remittix raised over $24,2 million in under 4 months, showing serious investor interest before TGE. Its deflationary model and mobile-first design are built to attract mass-market adoption. Conclusion: Best Crypto To Buy Today? Ethereum price prediction supports a broader bullish narrative in crypto, but Remittix may offer the asymmetric upside that today’s traders crave. With over $24,2 million raised, two CEX listings secured and a product rollout imminent, it is increasingly viewed as the best crypto to buy today for those aiming to multiply their portfolio before year-end. As the utility race heats up, Remittix appears to be winning early.

Analysts say the outcome of that cluster could decide whether billions of dollars in institutional funds flow into the token before year-end. Related Reading: American Bitcoin, Backed By Trump, Ends Nasdaq Debut Up 17% Filings Point To October Decision Reports show that six issuers have active S-1 filings or amendments waiting for review. The list includes Bitwise, WisdomTree, 21Shares, Canary Capital, CoinShares, and Franklin Templeton. The timing of these filings, following the SEC’s dismissal of its case against Ripple, has raised expectations that issuers are preparing for a launch window tied to October’s calendar. Demand Shock Could Stress Supply Industry insiders project that more than $5 billion could enter through spot ETFs in the first month alone. Estimates run as high as $10–18 billion by the end of 2025 if approvals are granted and appetite is strong. XRP’s effective supply is limited, with about 35 billion tokens still locked in escrow and much of the circulating amount held by exchanges and large investors. This thin float means a sudden demand wave could trigger sharp price swings. Analyst Upbeat About A $50 Target Veteran Bitcoin investor Pumpius has tied these supply and demand pressures to a bold forecast. He believes that if ETFs launch in the fourth quarter and inflows reach $10–18 billion, XRP could climb to $50 by December 2025 — and it is not “hopium“. From today’s price of $2.80, that would be a 1,680% rise, lifting market capitalization from $168 billion to about $3 trillion. Pumpius says the setup mirrors Bitcoin and Ethereum before their ETF approvals, pointing to the recent launch of XRP futures on CME and Coinbase Derivatives as proof that institutional infrastructure is already in place. 🚨 If the SEC approves all spot XRP ETFs by October, the path to $50 by December ’25 isn’t hopium, it’s math + market structure. Read this before everyone else catches on. 🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/2bNjEbbnIp — Pumpius (@pumpius) September 3, 2025 Skepticism Over The Timeline Many market participants have pushed back against the forecast, arguing that the timeline is too short for XRP to grow that much. Critics on social platforms point out the difficulty of scaling from a $168 billion market to $3 trillion in just over a year. Some also question whether early ETF inflows will meet the higher-end projections cited by Pumpius. Related Reading: MemeCore Explodes 3,800% For ATH — But Is A Collapse Around The Corner? What Approval Would Mean Should the SEC approve the filings in October, ETFs could channel regulated exposure for pensions, wealth managers, RIAs, and corporate treasuries. That would test XRP’s liquidity, potentially forcing larger holders to adjust positions as new demand arrives. If the applications are denied, expectations for a breakout rally would likely be pushed further out. For now, XRP continues to trade at $2.84. With the SEC’s October cluster approaching, traders are weighing whether the path to $50 is a realistic outcome or just a bold scenario tied to one investor’s high-stakes call.

At current prices, those coins are worth nearly $5 billion, putting renewed scrutiny on Berlin’s choices last year. Arkham Tracks Dormant Movie2K Holdings According to Arkham, the dormant stash sits across more than 100 wallets linked to the defunct Movie2K site. Reports have disclosed that Movie2K operators were arrested in 2019, and that German authorities recovered nearly 49,858 BTC in January 2024. Those coins were later sold off in June and July 2024. The newly identified 45,000 BTC, however, showed no movement after 2019, suggesting control by the same operators rather than state custody.

It appears that… pic.twitter.com/l0w0OkdU0H — Arkham (@arkham) September 5, 2025 Government Sold Earlier Holdings At Lower Prices Based on reports , the January 2024 seizure — close to 49,860 BTC — was liquidated at an average price of $57,900, generating about €2.64 billion, or roughly $2.90 billion. Germany defended the move by warning of a possible “significant loss of value of around 10% or more” if it held the coins longer. Market prices have since climbed, and Bitcoin has reached an all-time high above $123,000, making the earlier sale look, in raw numbers, like a large missed upside. Legal And Technical Hurdles Remain The new finding does not automatically mean those wallets can be taken by the state. Legal steps would be required to prove ownership and to secure court orders. Technical challenges exist too: dormant keys, complex custody chains, and cross-border links can all slow or block enforcement. Analysts say recovery is possible in some cases, but it is rarely quick or simple. If another large tranche of coins were to be moved into markets, it could create pressure similar to what was seen after the mid-2024 disposals. Debate Over State Bitcoin Reserves Joana Cotar , a German lawmaker and Bitcoin supporter, wrote an open letter urging a rethink. She argued that holding confiscated Bitcoin as a sovereign reserve could have produced far larger returns for the state. At the same time, Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel has warned that Bitcoin is volatile and compared its surge behavior to Tulip Mania – a financial bubble that happened in the Dutch Republic during the early 1600s. It’s often called the first recorded speculative bubble in history. Other countries have taken different paths. Reports note that El Salvador recently shifted $678 million in Bitcoin into 14 wallets to guard against quantum risks while keeping the holdings visible on the blockchain.

This setup, defined by converging support and resistance trendlines, reflects a period of consolidation where buyers and sellers are testing each other’s conviction. The 50-SMA at $205 now acts as immediate resistance , while the 200-SMA at $194.37 provides longer-term structural support. Momentum is balanced, with the RSI at 52 showing neutral conditions but tilting slightly upward after a rebound from oversold levels earlier this week. #Solana is consolidating near $203 inside a symmetrical triangle.

Solana (SOL/USD) Key Levels to Watch Market structure suggests that the next move could be decisive. Traders are closely monitoring support and resistance levels that may guide short-term direction: Solana Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Upside Trigger: Breakout above $208.62 could target $212.81 and $217.65. Immediate Support: Holding $199.25 keeps bullish structure intact. Downside Risk: A slip below $199.25 could expose $194.22 and $189.91. Higher lows since late August continue to strengthen the bullish case, showing that buyers remain active even as upside momentum stalls. Short-Term Outlook and Long-Term Potential If Solana clears the $208.62 resistance with convincing volume, momentum could accelerate toward the mid-$220 range. This move would align with the broader bullish trajectory highlighted by TradingView’s path projection. A bullish engulfing candle or the classic “three white soldiers” formation would confirm market conviction, while a failure at resistance could invite short-term selling pressure back toward the $190 zone. A breakout above $208.62 could ignite moves toward $212.81 and $217.65. Failure to hold $199 risks pullback to $194.22. A confirmed breakout may open the path to $250+ in the next cycle. $SOL #Crypto — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) September 7, 2025 For traders, a tactical long entry becomes attractive on confirmation above $208.62, with stops placed below $199 to manage risk. In the near term, this breakout could set the stage for Solana to retest the $250 level, last seen during its peak rallies. Beyond technicals, Solana’s growing ecosystem of DeFi projects, NFT activity, and institutional inflows continues to bolster investor interest. As liquidity rotates into large-cap altcoins, SOL’s resilience above $200 suggests it could be among the frontrunners in the next altcoin rally. If momentum holds, Solana price prediction may turn bullish, and SOL may not only sustain its position above $200 but also push toward reclaiming a new all-time high.

His net worth climbed 15.8% to $7.37 billion, placing him at No. 491 on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index . MicroStrategy Stock and Bitcoin Holdings Fuel Growth MicroStrategy shares (MSTR) have risen 12% in 2025, according to Google Finance. A Bloomberg breakdown shows Saylor’s wealth consists of about $650 million in cash, with the rest tied to his massive stake in MicroStrategy. The company remains the largest public holder of Bitcoin, with 636,505 BTC worth around $70 billion—equal to 3.42% of the entire Bitcoin supply. Despite the enormous holdings, MicroStrategy says its buying strategy avoids disrupting markets. “We buy Bitcoin in such a way that we do not influence its price,” explained Shirish Jajodia, the company’s treasurer.

Vitalik Buterin highlights 2025 milestones for scaling and decentralization. LeanVM introduces new ZK-friendly architecture for safer growth. Ethereum LeanVM Update Promises Faster Scaling and Lower Costs Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said the network has made significant progress in 2025 toward long-term scalability, decentralization, and sustainability. He highlighted leanVM , a minimal zero-knowledge proof virtual machine (zkVM), as a key innovation designed to reduce costs and improve efficiency. This new virtual machine is optimized for XMSS aggregation and recursion , features a four-instruction ISA , uses multi-line STARKs , and incorporates logup-lookups cryptography to cut commitment costs compared to Cairo. The current recursion speed is 2.7 seconds, and the team aims to increase this tenfold. “The team has done impressive work this year, making Ethereum more scalable while keeping it decentralized and sustainable. LeanVM is designed to support these goals efficiently, and we expect it to be ready as the short-term roadmap hits its milestones,” Buterin explained. LeanVM Milestones and the Roadmap Ethereum has already completed the Pectra update on the mainnet as of May 7, 2025. Buterin emphasized that leanVM deliberately lags slightly behind short-term scaling milestones so it can be fully prepared when the new features are live. “LeanVM is designed to integrate safely with mainnet operations. By keeping it behind the short-term roadmap, we ensure that scaling happens smoothly without requiring extra infrastructure,” he added. The update focuses on simplicity in protocol design, minimizing code complexity while maintaining robustness and reliability. Buterin described protocols as carefully crafted tools, not something to rush, ensuring they are clean, efficient, and long-lasting. Long-Term Benefits for Ethereum The leanVM update is expected to: Reduce costs for large-scale computations. Speed up recursion for ZK-proof computations. Maintain network decentralization and security. These improvements position Ethereum for sustainable growth and set the stage for future innovations in zero-knowledge proofs and scalable blockchain solutions. “We want Ethereum to remain a network that scales efficiently while staying decentralized. LeanVM is just one of the steps toward that vision,” Buterin concluded.",News|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ETH|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-07 13:14:37

With the largest assets such as Solana, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu already consolidating after years of growth, wise investors seek the next vehicle of exponential returns. Ozak AI, still in presale at $0.01, is drawing attention for its deep utility and aggressive upside forecasts. With more than $2.7 million raised and momentum climbing, the narrative is shifting toward a project capable of outperforming established giants by orders of magnitude. The Case for Rotation Solana, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu each have established communities and liquidity. However, their market limits and price ceilings generate natural limits. DOGE trades near $0.21, SOL around $24, and SHIB relies on meme cycles more than utility. Even under optimistic conditions, returns from these tokens over the next two years are generally pegged in the 2x–5x range. For long-term wealth builders, that may be too conservative. Ozak AI’s Unique Proposition Ozak AI is an Ethereum-based token that combines artificial intelligence with blockchain infrastructure. It provides predictive analytics, AI-driven trading indicators, decentralized data feeds, and DePIN integrations. This multi-layer approach positions it far beyond meme or single-chain utility. The presale token price of $0.01 will soon move to $0.012, with a stated target of $1 and long-range models projecting $2.80 by 2026. At those levels, early entries could see 100x to 280x gains, and bullish scenarios extend the possibility to 500x. Already, 854 million $OZ tokens have been sold, confirming steady demand and community traction. Presale Structure and Demand Each presale stage develops an upward pricing pressure. Buyers gain by locking in prior to listing by exploiting orderly growth rather than subsequent slippage. Having raised $2,707,443.64, the investor sentiment is sustainability, as opposed to a hype cycle. CertiK and SolidProof independent audits contribute to credibility, while a scheduled listing in CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap indicates transparency. Why Timing Matters The crypto market has a tendency of shifting towards altcoin breakouts in Q4. This has historically been characterized by capital movement into new stories. Provided that 2025-2026 replicates previous bull cycles, tokens of lower cap with defined utility, such as Ozak AI, will multiply incredibly. Legacy names such as SOL, DOGE, and SHIB will still capture flows, but their upside appears modest compared with a token priced under a cent. Final Take Moving from well-known assets into Ozak AI is a high-risk, high-reward bet. Yet the math is compelling: even a partial achievement of its roadmap could eclipse traditional gains. For investors prepared for volatility, flipping into Ozak AI now may be the strategic play that defines their 2026 portfolio.

Established giants like Solana, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu, while popular, are currently seeing a plateau in growth, prompting investors to look towards newer, potentially high-growth investments. Ozak AI represents such an opportunity, currently available in presale at an enticing entry price of $0.01. Understanding the Shift in Investment Trends Traditional cryptocurrencies have shown impressive growth trajectories, but as they mature, their potential for exponential returns diminishes. In comparison, Ozak AI stands out with its innovative integration of AI and blockchain, which not only provides advanced trading indicators but also enhances predictability and security in transactions. With more than $2.7 million already raised in its ongoing presale and a growing base of interested investors, Ozak AI is drawing significant attention in the crypto community for its robust utility and scalability. What Makes Ozak AI a Promising Investment? Ozak AI is much more than a typical cryptocurrency; it is designed to function on the Ethereum blockchain, supporting features like predictive analytics and decentralized data feeds, which are not commonly found in meme coins or single-purpose cryptocurrencies. The token's presale price is set at $0.01, with a strategic plan to increase to $0.012 soon, aiming for a future value of $1, and analytical models suggesting a potential rise to $2.80 by 2026. For early investors, this could translate to gains ranging from 100x to 280x, with the most optimistic outlooks suggesting up to 500x returns. The Strategic Advantage of Early Investment The presale structure of Ozak AI is designed to create upward pricing pressure, offering early investors the chance to secure tokens at a lower price before it lists on exchanges. This method potentially limits losses that might come from price slippage post-listing. Independently audited by CertiK and SolidProof, and with upcoming listings planned on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, Ozak AI is setting a precedent for transparency and investor trust in the crypto presale arena. Why Diversify Into Ozak AI? The crypto markets often see a surge in altcoin investments in Q4, with new and innovative tokens gaining traction. Ozak AI, with its robust utility and low initial pricing, is poised to be a standout for potential exponential growth, especially as we approach the next bull cycle anticipated around 2025-2026. Moving investments from legacy cryptocurrencies like SOL, DOGE, and SHIB to a dynamic and emerging token like Ozak AI could be a strategic move for those looking for greater returns and a diversification of their portfolio. Enhance Your Crypto Strategy with Ozak AI For those looking to shake up their investment portfolio or capitalize on the next big thing in crypto, diving into Ozak AI’s presale could present a golden opportunity. Interested investors should consider not just the potential financial rewards, but also the innovative technology behind Ozak AI.

The coin hit an all-time high in August 2025. As Ethereum becomes the dominant smart contract platform, another player has emerged that integrates the functionality of AI and blockchain in one, Ozak AI (OZ) . Will Ozak AI be able to duplicate or even surpass the meteoric growth of Ethereum? The Presale Surge: Early Signs of Growth The presale of Ozak AI is already underway, and the trend is hard to dispute. As Phase 5 approaches completion and more than $2.7 million has already been raised by selling 850 million tokens, the project is obviously catching on. The present price of the $OZ token is at the $0.01 mark, and when each Phase is finished, its cost is bound to increase, making the investors anxious, and the 20% price increment in Phase 6 would bring in even more investors. The implied 100x gain of the current presale price of $1 has attracted retail and institutional investors to the target price of $1. But what is so interesting about Ozak AI and how does it compare to the early days of Ethereum? What Sets Ozak AI Apart? In contrast to Ethereum, which first gathered traction as a smart contracting platform, Ozak AI aims at a niche that integrates predictive AI with a blockchain infrastructure. Ozak AI relies on the Ozak Stream Network (OSN), which is a new technology that offers ultra-low-latency, cross-chain data streaming that feeds live data to its Prediction Agents (PAs). These are AI-based modules that process large volumes of data and provide trading signals to both individual traders and institutional investors to make well-informed decisions. A Growing Ecosystem and Strong Partnerships Ethereum was not only successful due to its technology but also due to its capacity to generate an environment of decentralized applications (dApps), protocols and projects. The same path is being taken by Ozak AI, which has been in strategic partnership with the likes of SINT , HIVE and Weblume. Such partnerships increase the utility of the $OZ token by incorporating predictive analytics of Ozak AI with automation tools and smart contract technologies. Security and Trust: Audit and Transparency Trust is one of the biggest issues with any blockchain project, and Ozak AI has taken into account leadership opportunities to keep its ecosystem safe. The project has been audited by CertiK, one of the leading smart contract security firms, so there are no vulnerabilities to hacks or exploits on the platform. The findings of the audit create an extra touch of transparency and assure investors that the money is not going down the drain. The platform is also secure and efficient, as Ozak AI is integrating decentralized validation with EigenLayer AVS and Arbitrum Orbit to execute smart contracts with a high degree of scalability. This would drastically decrease the risks of the high-volume decentralized applications and increase the maximum potential of the project to grow in the long term. Is Ozak AI Going to be even more successful than Ethereum? The surge in Ethereum in 2020-2021 was the result of a bunch of events: institutional interest in it, a rapid rise of DeFi, and the rapid spread of NFTs. The ETH 2.0 upgrade also increased its popularity as a smart contract platform of choice. Ozak AI is using AI and blockchain to address selected pain points in real-time data processing, decentralized finance and automated trading. Its AI-driven predictive analytics have the potential to make it at the leading edge of the next crypto adoption wave, as artificial intelligence gains a greater presence in the financial markets. A 100x from its current presale price is the target price of OZ of $1, and in case of adoption of its technology and uses on a large scale, it may not be impossible to see Ozak AI go beyond the 2020-2021 Ethereum rally.

While Solana continues to test key resistance zones, many new crypto investors are redirecting their focus toward Remittix . The PayFi altcoin has raised more than $24,2 million through the sale of over 649 million tokens at $0.1050 each, making it one of the best crypto to buy now in September. Solana Price Prediction Stays Range-Bound Source: Ali Martinez In terms of technicals, the Solana price prediction indicates that the immediate support is at $198, and the next resistance is at $217. An ascending triangle would be considered complete with a breakout above $218, opening up upside potential to $240 and $260. Yet, failure to break over $198 would send SOL down to either $175 or even $155. Analysts believe that before Solana makes a rebound, it must dip to the $206 levels. The token currently trades near $202 . Despite a positive Nasdaq listing for a Solana-linked firm, trading volumes show caution. The Relative Strength Index is near neutral levels, indicating indecision. While analysts believe Solana can push higher in the medium term, the near-term outlook remains tied to whether buyers can defend the $198–$200 range. Remittix Gains Momentum Among New Investors As Solana remains in consolidation, Remittix is capturing attention for its fresh growth story. Unlike speculative meme tokens, Remittix offers a clear roadmap tied to PayFi innovation and real-world adoption. This narrative has made it stand out as the best crypto to buy now for those chasing long-term value and short-term upside. Some of the key drivers fueling investor confidence include: Beta launch of the PayFi wallet on September 15 Confirmed listings on BitMart and LBank in Q4 2025 $250,000 giveaway program attracting global retail traders Early staking rewards with sustainable RTX yield mechanics Cross-border partnerships expanding into 30+ countries With these milestones, Remittix has been labeled by analysts as the kind of altcoin that could outperform older layer-1 tokens and be the best in September and beyond. Why Speculators Are Choosing Remittix Over Solana While Solana price prediction suggests the token may take weeks to break out of its range, Remittix is drawing capital inflows right now. The PayFi model provides a strong utility backbone, while listings and global partnerships point to liquidity and adoption growth. For traders and investors scanning September’s leaderboard, Remittix is not just another project; it is shaping up as the top crypto under $1 with 60x upside potential.

Speculation stirs: could DOGE finally reach the coveted $1 mark by 2025? This article delves into which cryptocurrencies show the most promise and whether this bullish outlook could turn into a reality. Dogecoin's Path: Steady Growth with Room for More Source: tradingview Dogecoin is currently trading between twenty and twenty-three cents, showing a stable pattern. This digital coin is slightly underperforming this week with a small decline of about 3.66%. However, it has gained over 8% in the past month and nearly 12% in the last six months. The coin's price has a chance to rise towards the twenty-four cents resistance level soon. Over time, further growth could push it past twenty-seven cents, a significant long-term goal. If it reaches these levels, investors could see about a 20% increase from its current range. With its trends and support levels, Dogecoin remains a promising bet for keen watchers. Conclusion Dogecoin’s outlook remains one of cautious optimism. Its steady price base and gradual upward climb suggest the coin has the strength to challenge higher resistance levels in the near future. If media-driven catalysts and renewed mining interest align with market momentum, DOGE could make a serious attempt at the long-discussed $1 milestone. For now, traders and long-term holders alike are watching closely to see whether 2025 might finally be the year Dogecoin lives up to the hype.

XAUT stablecoin is backed by real gold reserves for security. Partnerships include Elemental Altus and mergers with EMX. Tether Expands Into Gold Mining With Over 100 Million in Investments Tether, the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, is making strategic moves in the gold mining industry, planning over 100 million in investments, the Financial Times reported . The company has held talks with multiple counterparties and aims to invest across the entire gold production chain, from ore mining to trading and financing companies that purchase deposits to earn royalties. Strategic Partnerships and Investments Tether previously invested $89 million in Elemental Altus, a firm that finances gold mining companies in exchange for royalties and preferential terms for purchasing gold. On September 4, Tether entered into a new agreement to purchase an additional $100 million in shares, while Elemental Altus merged with EMX, expanding its operational capacity. The company has also maintained a significant reserve of real gold, which serves as collateral for the XAUT stablecoin, strengthening the stablecoin’s backing. Despite these ambitious moves, Tether’s entry into the gold industry has been met with skepticism. Industry insiders suggested the company “hardly has a strategy” and “just likes gold.” Tether also held discussions with Terranova Resources, but the talks were unsuccessful. The company has not publicly commented on these negotiations. Why This Matters Tether’s investments could reshape the gold mining and stablecoin landscape by: Strengthening XAUT collateral with real gold reserves.

On-chain analysis shows that the wallet transferred over 10.3 million DOGE, worth about $2.25 million, after sitting inactive for almost two years, according to data from Arkham , retrieved by Finbold on September 7. DOGE whale transfers. Source: Arkham Dogecoin ETF speculation The transfer, involving cryptocurrency exchange Binance , has fueled speculation that whales may be positioning themselves ahead of the first Dogecoin ETF. Notably, the REX-Osprey Dogecoin ETF, trading under the ticker DOJE, has received an effective date of September 9, 2025. Structured under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the product sidesteps the more contentious spot ETF approval process. Instead of holding DOGE directly, the fund will gain exposure primarily through derivatives such as swaps and futures, alongside a portion in cash and other assets. At the same time, the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering new listing standards that could streamline approvals for single-asset crypto ETFs. If adopted later this month, the rules could open the door to additional products tied to tokens like Solana and XRP. DOGE price analysis As of press time, DOGE was trading at $0.22, up 2.5% in the last 24 hours, and about 3.5% higher over the past week. DOGE seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold On the technical front, Dogecoin’s short-term outlook shows mixed but slightly bullish signals. The 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) sits at $0.224, just above the current price, signaling near-term resistance before confirming stronger upside momentum. However, the longer-term 200-day SMA stands at $0.198, keeping DOGE above its broader trend support and hinting at sustained bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the 14-day RSI at 47.82 indicates neutral conditions, neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting DOGE still has room to move in either direction without being technically stretched.

This monumental transaction, valued at approximately $930 million, originated from the HTX exchange and found its new home on the decentralized lending protocol, Aave. Such a significant move by a major crypto whale often signals deeper market dynamics at play, prompting the community to question the motivations and potential ripple effects of this enormous shift. What Exactly Happened with This Massive USDT Transfer? On a recent day, the blockchain tracking service Whale Alert detected and reported a single, enormous transaction. This USDT transfer involved nearly a billion dollars worth of Tether moving from a prominent centralized exchange, HTX, to Aave, a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform. For context, 930 million USDT represents a substantial portion of Tether’s circulating supply, making this transfer an undeniable point of interest for market analysts and investors alike. Such a large movement of stablecoins from a centralized exchange to a DeFi protocol is not an everyday occurrence. It immediately raises questions about the intent behind the transfer and what the whale plans to do with such a vast sum within the Aave ecosystem. Understanding the roles of both HTX and Aave is crucial to deciphering the potential implications of this event. Understanding the Players: HTX and Aave’s Roles To fully grasp the significance of this USDT transfer , it’s important to know the functions of the platforms involved: HTX (formerly Huobi Global): This is a long-standing centralized cryptocurrency exchange, offering a wide range of trading services. Users typically hold assets on HTX for trading, staking, or simply storing them. Centralized exchanges act as custodians for user funds. Aave: Aave is a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can lend and borrow cryptocurrencies. It operates on smart contracts, allowing individuals to earn interest on their deposited assets or take out loans against their crypto collateral without intermediaries. The movement from a centralized exchange to a DeFi protocol like Aave often suggests a shift from traditional trading or holding to more active participation in decentralized finance, potentially for yield generation or leveraging assets within the DeFi ecosystem. Why Such a Significant USDT Transfer? Exploring Potential Motives A USDT transfer of this magnitude rarely happens without a strategic reason. While the exact motives of the whale remain speculative, several common reasons could explain such a large movement into Aave: Yield Farming and Lending: The most common reason for depositing stablecoins like USDT into Aave is to earn interest. Aave offers competitive lending rates, allowing holders to generate passive income on their assets. Collateral for Loans: The whale might be planning to use the 930 million USDT as collateral to borrow other cryptocurrencies, potentially to engage in further trading, arbitrage, or investment strategies without selling their USDT. Liquidity Provision: By adding such a large amount of USDT, the whale could be enhancing Aave’s liquidity, which benefits the entire protocol by enabling larger loans and improving market efficiency. Portfolio Rebalancing: It could be part of a broader strategy to rebalance a large portfolio, shifting assets to optimize for current market conditions or future expectations within the DeFi space. Institutional Strategy: Such large transfers sometimes originate from institutional players or large funds executing complex strategies that involve both centralized and decentralized platforms. What are the Implications of this Massive USDT Transfer for the Market? The impact of a nearly billion-dollar USDT transfer can be far-reaching. For Aave, this injection of liquidity is significant. It increases the protocol’s capacity for lending, potentially lowering borrowing rates or increasing the amount of assets that can be borrowed. For the broader crypto market, large whale movements can sometimes signal shifts in sentiment or upcoming trends, though it’s essential to interpret such events cautiously. While this particular transfer does not directly affect USDT’s peg to the dollar, it highlights the continued trust in Tether as a stable store of value for large-scale operations within both centralized and decentralized finance. It also underscores the growing maturity and utility of DeFi protocols like Aave, capable of handling transactions of this immense size. Navigating Large Crypto Transactions: Insights for Investors For everyday investors, monitoring significant transactions like this USDT transfer offers valuable insights. While it’s not a direct signal to buy or sell, it indicates where large capital is moving and what strategies major players might be employing. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow blockchain analytics services like Whale Alert to track major movements. Understand DeFi: Familiarize yourself with how protocols like Aave work, including lending, borrowing, and associated risks. Diversify and Manage Risk: Never put all your capital into a single strategy or platform. Large transfers can sometimes precede volatility. Look Beyond the Headlines: Always research the potential motives and broader market context behind such large transactions. The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, and understanding the flow of capital, especially from significant players, is a key component of informed decision-making. This massive USDT transfer from HTX to Aave is more than just a large number; it’s a testament to the dynamic interplay between centralized and decentralized finance. It highlights the strategic use of stablecoins for yield generation, collateralization, and liquidity provision within the ever-expanding DeFi ecosystem. While the exact motives of the whale remain private, this event undeniably showcases the scale and sophistication of capital movements in today’s crypto landscape, urging investors to remain vigilant and well-informed about these crucial market shifts. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is USDT and why is this transfer significant? USDT (Tether) is the largest stablecoin, pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. This 930 million USDT transfer is significant because of its immense size, representing a major movement of capital by a single entity (a “whale”) between a centralized exchange (HTX) and a decentralized lending protocol (Aave). 2. What is the difference between HTX and Aave? HTX is a centralized cryptocurrency exchange where users trade and store assets with the exchange acting as a custodian. Aave is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets without intermediaries, operating via smart contracts. 3. Why would someone move such a large amount of USDT to Aave? Common reasons include earning interest through lending, using the USDT as collateral to borrow other cryptocurrencies, providing liquidity to the Aave protocol, or executing a large-scale portfolio rebalancing strategy within DeFi. 4. Does this USDT transfer affect the price of Tether? Generally, a large USDT transfer does not directly affect Tether’s price (its peg to the US dollar) because USDT is designed to maintain a 1:1 peg. However, it can indicate increased activity or demand for stablecoins within the DeFi ecosystem. 5. How can I track similar large crypto transactions? Services like Whale Alert (which reported this transaction) specialize in tracking and reporting significant cryptocurrency movements on various blockchains. Many crypto news outlets also report on these whale activities. 6. What are the potential risks of engaging with DeFi protocols like Aave? While DeFi offers opportunities, risks include smart contract vulnerabilities, impermanent loss in liquidity pools, liquidation risks for borrowed assets, and general market volatility. Always conduct thorough research and understand the risks before participating. Did you find this analysis of the massive USDT transfer insightful?

Industry representatives claim this was not a simple error but an attempt to suppress evidence. According to a report published by the SEC Office of Comptroller, Gensler's official mobile phone stopped syncing with agency systems on July 6, 2023. Then, under a new automatic policy implemented by the agency in August 2023, all data on devices that were not used for 45 days was deleted. The report stated that the messages in question were initially recoverable, but due to the IT team accidentally performing a factory reset, all records between October 18, 2022, and September 6, 2023, were irreversibly deleted. Related News: Details of Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin's Wealth Emerged - Here Are His ETH and Other Assets The period covered by the deleted messages coincides with the critical period when FTX went bankrupt in November 2022 and its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, was found guilty in November 2023. This situation raised suspicions of “obstruction of evidence” within the industry. Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal issued a scathing statement, saying, “This is not an 'error.'

Market analysts believe that if this steady investment flow continues, BTC moving above $125K is the next realistic target. River’s latest “Business Bitcoin Adoption in 2025” study indicates that institutional Bitcoin acquisition has pushed corporate reserves from 510K BTC to 1.3 million BTC spanning January 2024 through August 2025, while publicly traded companies owning Bitcoin expanded from 39 to 158 entities in this period. 22% Net Income Allocation – Businesses Go All-In on Bitcoin Strategy Currently, businesses now control more than 6% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, representing a twenty-one-fold expansion since January 2020. Bitcoin Treasury Companies drive much of this growth in business adoption, accounting for 76% of all business purchases since January 2024 and 60% of publicly reported business holdings. Source: River These stock-listed entities focus on amassing substantial Bitcoin reserves while providing shareholders who are unable to purchase Bitcoin directly with equity-based exposure to its price movements. Michael Saylor introduced the Bitcoin treasury model when MicroStrategy (currently Strategy) executed its inaugural $250 million Bitcoin acquisition in August 2020. Strategy’s Bitcoin portfolio now exceeds $70 billion in value. This success story has inspired the launch of over 50 comparable Bitcoin treasury enterprises. Prior to 2024, corporate Bitcoin adoption remained confined to select private sector niches. Mining operations were initial adopters, with crypto firms and occasional unconventional participants like Tesla from different sectors following suit. This model transformed entirely throughout 2024. River’s research indicates Bitcoin now delivers value across business categories and company sizes, spanning real estate, software development, consulting services, healthcare, logistics, consumer goods, media companies, and automotive sectors. River’s findings show numerous businesses allocating well beyond a theoretical 1% to Bitcoin holdings. Current corporate allocations average 22% of net income toward Bitcoin investments, based on July 2025 survey data , while the median allocation reaches 10%. Source: River Among these companies, 63.6% treat Bitcoin as a permanent investment vehicle, continuously accumulating positions without immediate selling or portfolio rebalancing intentions. BTC Above $125K Within Reach as Volatility Drops to Gold Levels Bitcoin’s climb above $125K now seems increasingly attainable. Previous adoption barriers, such as government “ban” fears or corporate ownership restrictions, have mostly vanished. Multiple sovereign nations now maintain official Bitcoin investments, and March 2025 saw the United States launch its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve program. BINANCE FOUNDER CZ SAYS MANY COUNTRIES ARE BUYING #BITCOIN FOR THEIR RESERVES “COUNTRIES ARE FORCED TO BUY BTC” pic.twitter.com/DxYIHFoG9N — Vivek Sen (@Vivek4real_) July 5, 2025 Bitcoin previously lacked sufficient liquidity for major institutional adoption. This constraint no longer exists. But now Bitcoin currently ranks among global assets with the highest liquidity and operates continuously, contrasting with traditional treasury instruments. Recent years have also witnessed stance reversals from prominent figures, including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink, and President Trump, regarding Bitcoin. Analyst Zynweb3 observes that Bitcoin historically reaches lows at the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement, occurring in Q3 2024 and Q2 2025, with potential repetition ahead. $BTC usually bottoms at 0.382 Fibonacci level. This happened in Q3 2024, Q2 2025 and will probably happen again. For anyone wondering how low we can go, 0.382 Fibonacci level is currently around $100K. So the worst case scenario is a 10% drop before a 50% rally above $150,000. pic.twitter.com/gdeLIe4RRF — ZYN (@Zynweb3) September 7, 2025 Current market weakness has confined Bitcoin within the $113K-$107K range, suggesting possible further decline toward the 0.382 Fibonacci level near $100K. Nevertheless, Bitcoin maintains long-term bullish prospects, with typical 10% corrections often preceding 50% advances that could drive Bitcoin past $125K toward $150K during Q4. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: $114K Resistance Break Could Trigger BTC Above $125K Breakout Technically, the Bitcoin 4-hour chart shows the price has bounced strongly from the correction zone around $108,000, forming a bullish engulfing structure that signals renewed buying momentum. The current move suggests a push toward immediate resistance near $114,000, which will be the first test for bulls to confirm strength. If Bitcoin manages to break and sustain above this level, the chart projects an extended move toward key resistance at $120,000, marking the upper boundary of the current bullish structure. However, failure to clear $114,000 would risk another pullback, potentially retesting the correction zone.

On the one hand, institutions are reinventing the foundations of Ethereum by investing in it on a massive scale, laying the groundwork to be adopted in the long term. Retail traders and crypto whales, on the other hand, are seeking opportunities early in the cycle that might result in disproportionate returns on small amounts of money invested. Another step on the way of Ethereum to institutional finance this week saw Ethereum-focused startup Etherealize raise a $40 million Series. A round of funding by leading investors. However, even as the news solidifies Ethereum as viable, traders are looking at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi lending platform that many reckon will yield higher returns compared to anything that established networks can offer. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is the clear center of decentralized finance, and its network has an endless number of applications and protocols. Any institutional buying into Ethereum-based initiatives makes it more authoritative, and the latest one is the $40 million raise by Etherealize. Etherealize, led by large participants such as Paradigm and Electric Capital, seeks to establish infrastructure to bridge institutions in Wall Street with the blockchain provided by Ethereum. The startup focuses on tokenizing of traditional assets, privacy-preserving settlements, and settlements of instruments such as tokenized bonds. Put another way, it is building a bridge between the old financial system and the open, programmable infrastructure of Ethereum. Such an impetus comes after public firms have already been hugging the line on ETH. This week alone, corporations have reportedly added more than 1.2 billion dollars worth of Ethereum to their balance sheets, proving that interest among institutions is by no means decelerating. The Etherealize raise further supports the perception that Ethereum is no longer a mere retail speculation platform, but a contender in the future of finance. Nevertheless, to a great number of retail investors and traders, Ethereum is already too large and mature, and the days of 100x returns are mostly past. It is there that the emphasis is placed on new projects that have lower-cost tokens and higher upside potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) As Ethereum attracts institutional capital, traders excited to invest in high-growth opportunities are considering Mutuum Finance (MUTM). This is a decentralized lending protocol that is being developed on the Ethereum DeFi base but in a manner that focuses on flexibility, scalability as well as early availability. Mutuum Finance is in its Phase 6 presale and has a token price of $0.035. The project has already raised over 15.4 million and has created a community of over 16,100 holders despite being in its early stages. The presale would gradually raise the price of the token by 15-20% at each subsequent stage, and those who made early commitments would be rewarded as the project approaches its launch at $0.06. The investors who acquired tokens in Phase 1 at $0.01 are already enjoying 250% returns at the current price of $0.035, and by the time MUTM reaches its launching price, which will place it as an official corporation, those early investors will be enjoying 600% returns. This development shows how the presale at Mutuum Finance is designed not only to raise capital but also to provide a tangible reason to adopt the product early and keep it over the long term. Another reason Investors are watching MUTM There are a number of reasons why analysts and traders are paying attention to MUTM: Dual Lending Markets — Mutuum Finance provides Peer-to-Contract (P2C) as well as Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. In P2C, participants upload assets such as ETH, BNB, or USDT into liquidity pools and get a mtToken which yields interest and can be staked to earn more MUTM. With the P2P model, the borrowers are linked directly to the lenders and they have the option of variable rates that fluctuate with the liquidity conditions or stable rates that provide predictable prices. Such a balance between flexibility and security makes the system appealing to a large number of users. Buy-and-Distribute Model – Part of the fees that the platform will receive will be spent on purchasing MUTM tokens on the market and reallocating them. This offers unrelenting buy-side pressure and directly links token value to platform usage, reminiscent of the sustainable tokenomics that have enabled DeFi leaders such as Aave and Compound to rise. Stablecoin Development — Mutuum Finance is working on an overcollateralized stablecoin as well, but one that uses a mint-and-burn mechanism. Stablecoins have already demonstrated the value of acting as liquidity anchors throughout the crypto ecosystem, and the inclusion of one in the protocol would greatly expand its use and demand of that token. The numbers make the case clear. At today’s presale price of $0.035, a $950 investment would secure around 27,140 MUTM tokens. By launching at $0.06, that same allocation would already be worth about $1,630, nearly doubling in value before trading even begins. But the real excitement lies in what happens after launch. When MUTM reaches a short-term target of $0.20, that $950 investment would grow to more than $5,400. With a medium-term projection of $0.85, the same allocation could climb to roughly $23,000. This trend is already reminiscent of the early tokens such as Aave, Solana, and even Ripple (XRP), which all returned life-changing multiples to those who saw it when the company was still new. From Ethereum’s Stability to DeFi’s Next Growth Story Ethereum is still solidifying itself as the basis of institutional adoption, as startups such as Etherealize raise tens of millions to create the tools Wall Street requires to run on-chain. The legitimacy of the space (in the long term) depends on this institutional validation. Simultaneously, though, retail traders and crypto whales are also stacking positions in projects such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which offers low costs and DeFi functionality, and a defined adoption roadmap. MUTM offers the upside where Ethereum offers the stability. The crypto story has always been about utility, timing and adoption by the greatest winners. XRP fixed global money transfer, Aave reinvented banking, Solana reinvented scalability. Each of the rewarded early believers walked in before the crowd. Most traders expect Mutuum Finance to be next in 2025, establishing the new era of DeFi lending protocols and providing the sort of growth Ethereum is no longer capable of producing.

The chief executive of Chainlink, a network specializing in authenticating real-world data for smart contracts, said he was impressed with how much the agency has shifted away from whether the U.S. should permit blockchain tokenization innovations into the financial system and instead is looking at how this can be conducted with maximum efficiency and market safety. ""While cryptocurrencies define the majority of our industry's value today, I personally feel very strongly that the real-world asset trend and digital-asset tokenization in the institutional world will grow to be the majority of the market cap in our industry,"" Nazarov told CoinDesk in an interview after his Friday meeting. He said Atkins ""has very clear ideas and goals with getting the traditional financial system operating correctly on-chain."" Nazarov, who also met with the White House's new crypto liaison, Patrick Witt, on Friday, said he's very hopeful ""based on the urgency and speed"" the SEC and the White House are demonstrating. He said he thinks blockchain infrastructure will manage to find a place within broker-dealer and transfer agent rules, allowing full-in tokenization ""maybe by the middle of next year."" The Chainlink co-founder said one central task is getting blockchains to fully meet the standards for a ""legally binding transfer"" of assets. ""That's a class of problems that's now getting worked through with us,"" he said, adding that Atkins understands it well and noted the chairman's recent address in which he announced his ""Project Crypto"" initiative . An SEC spokesman declined to comment on the meeting, though the agency has been building momentum with crypto-friendly statements, remarks and policy maneuvers. Just last week, the securities regulator issued a joint statement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to tell registered platforms that they're OK to pursue spot trading of certain crypto assets , issued a near-term agenda that is crowded with crypto initiatives and got together with the CFTC on Friday to tell reporters that the two markets regulators will now be working in lockstep to pave the way for crypto . Under Atkins' predecessor, Gary Gensler, the agency had resisted embarking on tailored digital assets regulation. Atkins says the existing securities laws and agency powers offer ample authority to start work on friendly policies to clarify how the government approaches crypto. Meanwhile, the Senate is working on a crypto market structure bill that would establish new laws for crypto and for its regulators. That effort saw some progress on Friday as a new, lengthier version of the Senate Banking Committee's earlier bill began circulating. Chainlink's network was also among the digital assets venues chosen by the U.S. Department of Commerce last week when, for the first time, the federal government issued major economic data — the gross domestic product report — via blockchain. That's set to be an ongoing trend for Commerce and other agencies, according to the officials behind the release. ""Our industry has a very unique kind of moment in time right now, that if it uses it well it can solidify its position in the U.S. and therefore the global economy,"" Nazarov said.

However, the crypto-linked investment products have had a nightmare start to the month of September. As seen with the sluggish price action of ETH, the cryptocurrency market seems to be witnessing a phase of investor uncertainty and indecisiveness. These struggles appear to be finally translating to the performance of the Ethereum ETFs, which just recorded their worst week in terms of capital inflows. Ethereum ETFs Register $446M Outflow To Close Week According to the latest market data , the US Ethereum ETF market posted a total net outflow of $787.74 million in the past week, its worst performance since launch. Contributing mostly to this significant figure were the withdrawals on Friday, September 5, which saw more than $446.7 million flow out of the exchange-traded funds. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (with the ticker ETHA) witnessed the most significant on the day, registering a total net outflow of $309.88. Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) followed in second place, seeing a total net withdrawal of $51.7 million to close out the week. Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) and Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH) recorded total daily net outflows of $37.7 million and $32.62 million, respectively. 21Shares Ethereum ETF (TETH) was the only other spot Ether fund that recorded any activity on Friday, posting a net outflow of $14.68 million. Friday marked the fifth consecutive day of outflows for the spot Ethereum ETFs , with no single positive inflow day so far in September. As earlier mentioned, the negative $450-million performance on Friday pushed the weekly record to nearly $790 million, the highest withdrawals ever recorded by Ethereum ETFs in a single week. Ethereum Price Struggles Below $4,500 Less than two weeks ago, the price of Ethereum set a new all-time high and was on the verge of breaking the $5,000 mark for the first time ever. However, the altcoin has since fallen under significant bearish pressure, struggling to break above $4,500. The performance of Ethereum ETFs over the past week has expectedly mirrored the altcoin’s sluggish price action . As of this writing, the Ethereum token is valued at around $4,276, reflecting an almost 1% decline in the past 24 hours.

On Friday, August 5, the flagship cryptocurrency suffered a mild correction following the release of weaker-than-expected employment data in the United States. While the Bitcoin price has struggled to break out of its current choppy state, its sustained hold above the psychological $110,000 level displays the current resolution of investors. The latest on-chain data suggests that the market might have absorbed excess selling pressure and could be regaining momentum. Is BTC Ready For A Sustained Move Higher? In a September 6 post on the X platform, pseudonymous crypto analyst Frank revealed a shift in the activity of a key group of Bitcoin investors over the past few weeks. According to the market quant, BTC’s short-term holders (STH) (with coin holdings less than 155 days old) are beginning to lock in some of their profits. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Nears Its Climax: Cycle Peak Indicates 95% Completion This on-chain observation is based on the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH-SOPR) metric, which assesses the profitability ratio of spent outputs (held for more than 1 hour but less than 155 days). This indicator provides insight into whether STHs are selling at a profit or at a loss. When the Bitcoin STH-SOPR metric has a value greater than 1, it implies that the short-term investors are selling at a profit. On the other hand, an STH-SOPR value less than 1 suggests that the short-term holders are capitulating and selling at a loss. Frank shared that the Bitcoin STH-SOPR metric has returned above the critical 1 threshold level for the first time in 20 days. This means that the short-term investors, who were busy selling at a loss the past three weeks, are now back realizing profits. Typically, when the STH-SOPR metric is below 1, it means that weak hands are exiting the market, enabling the diamond hands (long-term investors) to accumulate. Meanwhile, a return above the 1 threshold could mark the end of that distribution period, with a recovery rally typically on the horizon. However, the pertinent question remains whether the past 20 days were enough to shake out the weak hands for the next leg up. Frank noted that the market could want to inflict more pain on the short-term holder cohort before the next move higher. Hence, investors might want to exercise caution before making a decision, as the market seems to be at a critical juncture. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands around $110,200, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko, the market leader is up by nearly 2% in the last seven days.

Once the undisputed leader of meme coins, DOGE now faces divided sentiment among its holders. Some remain loyal to its cultural legacy, while others are quietly moving their capital into newer projects with bigger upside. At the front of that rotation is Layer Brett ($LBRETT), a viral Ethereum Layer 2 memecoin that analysts believe could follow in Pepe coin’s footsteps and deliver a 50x breakout in 2025. Dogecoin’s reputation keeps it alive No matter how the market shifts, Dogecoin will always have history on its side. It was the first meme coin to go mainstream, boosted by Elon Musk’s tweets and its quirky branding. DOGE’s community remains one of the most active in crypto, and its liquidity ensures it stays a top-10 coin by market cap. But here’s the problem: cultural relevance doesn’t always equal explosive growth. With a market cap already in the tens of billions, the upside for Dogecoin (DOGE)looks capped. Analysts see room for moderate price increases, but nothing close to the exponential multiples retail traders now expect from meme coin speculation. Traders chase volatility, not comfort Retail investors aren’t in the game for 20 percent moves. They want asymmetric bets where small positions can turn into massive returns. That is why attention is shifting away from older tokens like DOGE toward new entries that carry viral momentum. This isn’t about abandoning Dogecoin, but about recognizing that its growth trajectory now appeals more to conservative holders than to traders chasing the next big win. Enter Layer Brett: the meme coin built for 2025 This is where Layer Brett ($LBRETT) enters the story. It is not just another meme coin, it is a meme coin built on Ethereum Layer 2. That means instant transactions, pennies for gas fees, and scalability baked into its design. Add on top staking rewards nearing the thousands of percent, and it gives traders both a viral narrative and a financial incentive to hold. The presale has already pulled in thousands of participants, and online buzz is accelerating across Telegram and X. The parallels to Pepe coin’s early success in 2023 are hard to ignore. Why analysts are calling for 50x The 50x prediction for Layer Brett may sound ambitious, but analysts argue it is realistic. Meme coins thrive on speculation, and when the right token hits the market at the right time, capital floods in fast. Pepe coin did exactly that in 2023, turning small bets into fortunes. Brett is positioned to follow that path, except with stronger infrastructure and Ethereum Layer 2 backing it up. With Ethereum scaling adoption forecasted to reach over $10 trillion annually by 2027, Brett has more than just memes on its side. It has timing and technology that align perfectly with where the market is heading. Dogecoin vs. Brett: Different value for different players The split sentiment around Dogecoin highlights the choice investors face today. DOGE is the safe, established meme coin. It offers stability, deep liquidity, and cultural relevance. Layer Brett, on the other hand, is the high-risk, high-reward option with 50x potential. For retail traders who thrive on volatility and speculation, Brett is where the opportunity lies. Conclusion The Dogecoin community will keep the token alive, but its days as the explosive growth leader of meme coins may be over. Analysts believe the spotlight is shifting to Layer Brett ($LBRETT), the project capturing liquidity and attention ahead of 2025. DOGE built the foundation. Brett could deliver the breakout. Don’t miss your chance to join the next top meme coin and stake for potentially life-changing rewards.

For those deeply entrenched in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, the rise of a powerful, independent AI lab like Mistral AI signifies more than just technological advancement; it hints at a future where decentralized and open-source principles could redefine how we interact with artificial intelligence. This French startup is quickly becoming a beacon of European technological prowess, proving that the continent can foster world-class AI innovation. What is Mistral AI? Unveiling Europe’s Tech Prodigy Mistral AI , founded in 2023, has rapidly ascended to become one of France’s most promising tech startups, positioning itself as a formidable OpenAI competitor . With a bold mission to “put frontier AI in the hands of everyone,” Mistral AI differentiates itself by offering a mix of open-source and proprietary AI models , a philosophy that contrasts sharply with the typically closed approach of its biggest rivals. The company describes itself as “the world’s greenest and leading independent AI lab,” emphasizing sustainability alongside innovation. The company’s rapid growth and strategic importance are underscored by its valuation, which reportedly jumped from approximately $6 billion in June 2024 to a projected $14 billion in early 2025. This meteoric rise has even caught the attention of political leaders, with French president Emmanuel Macron publicly endorsing Le Chat , Mistral AI’s conversational assistant, as a preferred alternative to ChatGPT. This strong backing highlights the ambition for European AI to lead on the global stage, fostering homegrown talent and technology. Mistral AI’s Arsenal: A Deep Dive into its Advanced AI Models At the heart of Mistral AI ’s challenge to the status quo lies its impressive suite of AI models , designed for diverse applications and user needs. These models represent a significant investment in research and development, aiming to push the boundaries of what AI can achieve. The company’s commitment to innovation is evident in its continuous release of new and updated models, each tailored for specific tasks and performance requirements: Mistral Large 2: The company’s flagship large language model, replacing its predecessor, Mistral Large, and offering enhanced capabilities for complex reasoning and understanding.

Devstral: An AI model specifically engineered for coding, available under an Apache 2.0 license. This open-source approach allows for commercial use without restriction, fostering a collaborative development environment. In July 2025, Mistral AI introduced Devstral Medium and an upgrade to Devstral Small, emphasizing agentic coding capabilities in collaboration with All Hands AI. Devstral also powers Mistral Code, a leading coding assistant. Codestral: An earlier generative AI model for code, though its initial license restricted commercial applications. “Les Ministraux”: A family of highly optimized models designed for edge devices, enabling powerful AI capabilities directly on phones and other portable hardware. Mistral Saba: Focused specifically on the Arabic language, demonstrating Mistral AI’s commitment to linguistic diversity and regional markets. Mistral OCR: Introduced in March 2025, this optical character recognition API efficiently converts PDFs into text files, streamlining data ingestion for other AI models. These diverse offerings underscore Mistral AI ‘s ambition to cater to a broad spectrum of users, from developers and enterprises to everyday consumers, solidifying its position as a serious OpenAI competitor in the global AI landscape. Le Chat: The European AI Chatbot Challenging OpenAI Perhaps the most visible manifestation of Mistral AI ‘s ambition to compete directly with OpenAI is Le Chat , its conversational AI assistant. Positioned as a direct alternative to ChatGPT, Le Chat quickly gained traction upon its mobile release, reaching 1 million downloads within two weeks and even topping France’s iOS App Store for free downloads. This rapid adoption signals a strong appetite for a robust, user-friendly European AI chatbot. Le Chat has been continuously updated with advanced features to rival full-stack AI chatbots. In July 2025, it introduced a new “deep research” mode for comprehensive information gathering, native multilingual reasoning, and advanced image editing capabilities. The update also included “Projects,” allowing users to organize chats, documents, and ideas into focused workspaces. By September 2025, Le Chat further enhanced user experience with the introduction of “Memories,” enabling it to recall previous conversations and provide more personalized interactions. While many of Mistral AI ‘s offerings are free or include free tiers, Le Chat also features paid tiers, with its Pro plan priced at $14.99 a month, introduced in February 2025, providing advanced functionalities for power users. The Brains Behind the Brilliance: Mistral AI’s Founders and Vision The formidable ascent of Mistral AI is largely attributable to its visionary founders, who bring a wealth of experience from leading global tech companies. CEO Arthur Mensch previously honed his expertise at Google’s DeepMind, a powerhouse in AI research. CTO Timothée Lacroix and chief scientist officer Guillaume Lample are both former Meta staffers, contributing their deep knowledge of large-scale AI systems and foundational model development. This trio’s combined experience from major U.S. tech giants, coupled with their shared ambition, provides a strong foundation for Mistral AI to thrive as a leading OpenAI competitor . The company also benefits from a distinguished group of co-founding advisers, including Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve and Charles Gorintin from the health insurance startup Alan, as well as former digital minister Cédric O. While the involvement of Cédric O has sparked some controversy due to his prior governmental role, it also highlights the strong political and industry support for fostering a robust European AI ecosystem. Funding and Monetization: How Mistral AI is Powering its Growth Mistral AI ’s journey has been marked by extraordinary fundraising success, accumulating approximately €1 billion (around $1.04 billion) in capital to date by February 2025. This financial backing is crucial for an OpenAI competitor aiming to develop cutting-edge AI models and scale its operations globally. The funding rounds illustrate investor confidence in Mistral AI’s potential: Seed Round (June 2023): A record-breaking $112 million, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, valuing the then one-month-old startup at $260 million. Investors included Bpifrance, Eric Schmidt, Exor Ventures, and others. Series A (Six months later): Closed at €385 million ($415 million), pushing the valuation to a reported $2 billion. Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) led this round, with participation from Lightspeed, BNP Paribas, CMA-CGM, and Salesforce. Series A Extension (February 2024): Microsoft made a $16.3 million convertible investment as part of a strategic partnership, maintaining the Series A valuation. Later Round (June 2024): Raised €600 million (around $640 million) in a mix of equity and debt, led by General Catalyst, at a $6 billion valuation. Notable investors included Cisco, IBM, Nvidia, and Samsung Venture Investment Corporation. Current Developments: As of late 2024/early 2025, Mistral AI is reportedly finalizing a €2 billion investment, which would push its post-money valuation to an impressive $14 billion, signaling immense investor confidence in its future as a leader in European AI . On the monetization front, beyond Le Chat ’s paid tiers, Mistral AI primarily generates revenue through B2B channels. This includes usage-based pricing for its premier AI models via APIs, enterprise licensing agreements, and significant contributions from its growing portfolio of strategic partnerships. While revenue is reportedly still in the eight-digit range, the company’s valuation reflects its perceived long-term growth potential and strategic importance. Strategic Alliances: Expanding Mistral AI’s Global Footprint Mistral AI has been highly proactive in forging strategic partnerships, crucial for distributing its AI models , expanding its reach, and securing computational resources. These alliances are vital for any OpenAI competitor seeking to build a robust ecosystem and accelerate innovation. Key partnerships include: Microsoft (2024): A significant deal for distributing Mistral AI’s models through Microsoft’s Azure platform, accompanied by a €15 million investment. This partnership, while raising some EU criticism, was deemed too small for investigation by the U.K.’s CMA, yet it firmly places Mistral AI on a global distribution network. Agence France-Presse (AFP) (January 2025): A landmark deal allowing Le Chat to query AFP’s extensive text archive dating back to 1983, enhancing its knowledge base and research capabilities. Public Sector and Industry: Strategic partnerships with France’s army and job agency, Luxembourg, shipping giant CMA, German defense tech startup Helsing, IBM, Orange, and Stellantis, demonstrating broad applicability of its AI models across various sectors. AI Campus (May 2025): Participation in a joint venture with UAE-investment firm MGX, NVIDIA, and France’s state-owned investment bank Bpifrance to create an AI Campus in the Paris region, fostering collaborative innovation in European AI . Mistral Compute (June 2025): An initiative, hailed as ‘historic’ by President Macron, to launch a European platform dedicated to AI and powered by Nvidia processors, starting in 2026. This further cements Mistral AI’s role in building critical AI infrastructure. AI for Citizens (July 2025): A collaborative initiative aimed at helping states and public institutions harness AI strategically to transform public services, catalyze innovation, and ensure competitiveness for their people. These partnerships not only provide financial backing and distribution channels but also validate Mistral AI ‘s technology and vision, solidifying its role as a key player in the global AI race and a significant OpenAI competitor . Enterprise Innovations: Practical AI Solutions from Mistral AI Beyond foundational AI models and consumer-facing applications like Le Chat , Mistral AI is also heavily invested in developing enterprise-grade solutions designed to empower businesses. These innovations are critical for driving adoption and demonstrating the practical value of their technology. In May 2025, the company released the Mistral Agents API, designed to help enterprises utilize AI in more practical and impactful ways, as stated by its Head of Developer Relations, Sophia Yang. This API enables businesses to build sophisticated AI agents for various tasks, streamlining operations and fostering efficiency. Further enhancing its enterprise offerings, Mistral AI unveiled a revamped Connectors directory in September 2025. This directory showcases Le Chat’s integrations with approximately 20 enterprise tools, including popular platforms like Asana, Atlassian, Box, Google Drive, Notion, and Zapier, as well as email and calendar services. Future integrations with Databricks and Snowflake are also in the pipeline, demonstrating a clear focus on seamless integration into existing business workflows. Additionally, in June 2025, Mistral AI released Mistral Code, a vibe coding client designed to compete with established incumbents like Windsurf, Anysphere’s Cursor, and GitHub Copilot, providing developers with powerful, AI-assisted coding capabilities. These enterprise features are crucial for Mistral AI to secure its market share and distinguish itself as a comprehensive OpenAI competitor . Navigating the Future: Regulation and Mistral AI’s IPO Ambitions As a prominent player in the rapidly evolving AI landscape, Mistral AI is not immune to the discussions surrounding AI regulation. CEO Arthur Mensch was part of a group of European CEOs who signed an open letter in July 2025, advocating for a two-year delay before key obligations of the EU Artificial Intelligence Act came into force. This stance reflects a common industry concern about the potential for stifling innovation with overly prescriptive regulations, although the European Commission has maintained its original timeline for implementation. This engagement in policy discussions underscores Mistral AI’s influence and its commitment to shaping the future of European AI . Regarding its long-term trajectory, Mensch has been unequivocal about Mistral AI ‘s future, stating in January 2025 at the World Economic Forum in Davos that the company is “not for sale” and that an IPO is “the plan.” This strategic direction makes sense given the substantial capital raised; a public offering would provide the necessary liquidity and returns for its numerous investors, many of whom are seeking significant multiples on their investments. Furthermore, an IPO would help address sovereignty concerns, particularly for a prominent European AI champion, by maintaining its independence rather than being acquired by a foreign entity. While acquisition rumors persist, including recent speculation about Apple, scaling its revenue to levels that justify its soaring valuation will be key to definitively cementing its path toward an independent future. The journey of Mistral AI is one to watch closely as it continues to redefine the boundaries of AI innovation and competition. Mistral AI has rapidly established itself as a formidable force in the global AI arena, challenging the dominance of established players like OpenAI with its innovative AI models , open-source philosophy, and ambitious vision. From its rapid fundraising success and strategic partnerships to the development of groundbreaking tools like Le Chat and its enterprise solutions, Mistral AI embodies the potential of European AI to lead technological advancement. As it navigates regulatory landscapes and sets its sights on an IPO, Mistral AI’s journey is a compelling narrative of innovation, competition, and the relentless pursuit of putting frontier AI into everyone’s hands. Its impact will undoubtedly resonate across the tech world, influencing how we develop, deploy, and interact with artificial intelligence for years to come.

Launched in 2019, Libra was Meta’s bold bid to create a global digital currency backed by a basket of stable assets. The project promised to make payments as seamless as messaging, but it triggered immediate backlash from regulators concerned about financial sovereignty, systemic risk, and user privacy. By 2022, Libra — renamed Diem in a bid to reset its image — was shuttered and its assets sold off. Catalini, who served as Libra’s chief economist, used his Sept. 5 thread on X to revisit the project’s early compromises and explain why they matter now. He said the original open design, developed with Harvard economist Scott Kominers, was reduced to a short appendix after months of regulatory negotiations. The first major retreat, he wrote, was abandoning non-custodial wallets. Regulators insisted on a “clear perimeter,” meaning a responsible intermediary they could contact — and penalize — if problems arose. For supervisors used to intermediated finance, a world where users truly held their own money was unmanageable. “For them, killing self-custody wasn’t a choice, it was an obvious necessity,” he recalled. Catalini noted the irony: today, open networks are developing compliance tools native to blockchain that could have addressed these concerns more effectively than traditional frameworks. But back then, Libra was forced to strip away decentralization, a change he described as an early signal of where corporate-led projects were heading. His broader lesson was stark: “As long as there is a single throat to choke — or a committee of them — you can’t truly rewire the system. Worse, any network with an architect is living on borrowed time.” Arc and Tempo in the Spotlight Catalini placed Stripe’s Tempo and Circle’s Arc in that context. Both are new blockchains designed explicitly for payments, promoted as stablecoin-first infrastructure for enterprises and fintechs. Circle launched Arc on Aug. 12, presenting it as a Layer-1 network purpose-built for stablecoin finance. Unlike public chains that rely on volatile gas tokens, Arc uses USDC for fees, offering predictable, dollar-denominated costs. It integrates a built-in foreign exchange engine, promises sub-second finality, and includes opt-in privacy features. Circle said Arc will support cross-border payments, onchain credit systems, tokenized capital markets and programmable, automated payments. Just weeks later, Stripe and Paradigm unveiled Tempo on Sept. 4, describing it as a payments-first blockchain capable of handling over 100,000 transactions per second. The network is EVM-compatible, features a dedicated payments lane with support for memos and access lists, and allows users to pay both transactions and gas in any stablecoin. Stripe said early design partners include Visa, Deutsche Bank, Revolut, Nubank, Shopify, OpenAI, Anthropic and DoorDash. Both projects were marketed as steps toward mainstreaming stablecoin payments. But for Catalini, they raised a deeper concern. A Revolution or a Failed Coup? Catalini argued that corporate-led chains like Arc and Tempo risk simply rebuilding the old financial system with new players in charge. Instead of displacing card networks and banks, he warned, they could elevate fintech giants to the same position of dominance. “The throne will have new occupants, but it will be the same throne,” he wrote. He also predicted such networks would fracture geopolitically, with Western and Eastern blocs unlikely to share a single corporate-led infrastructure. The result, he said, would be competing financial empires rather than the borderless system crypto’s early advocates envisioned. Ultimately, Catalini described Stripe’s Tempo as a “referendum on the ghost of Libra.” If it thrives, he suggested, it may prove Libra failed because of timing, not design — and show that the dream of open, permissionless money has been overtaken by more pragmatic, centralized solutions.",Policy|Stablecoins|Stripe|Circle|Facebook|Regulation|News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|FIAT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-07 15:11:35

It is worth noting that Strategy has a “42/42” plan to raise $84 billion through equity and convertible notes by 2027. Thereafter, the fund will be directed to the purchase of more Bitcoin. It is an expansion of its earlier $42 billion “21/21” program. Strategy Snubbed From S&P 500 Inclusion Meanwhile, Strategy was recently snubbed from S&P 500 inclusion after several months of trying to get on the bloc. The situation was quite disappointing for some crypto enthusiasts and market participants who had expected the Bitcoin treasury company to make the cut. Saylor suggested that the company is not disturbed by the rejection. He claimed that all Strategy needed to join S&P 500 is merely formal recognition. The crypto boss slightly threw a jab at the index, citing that MSTR outperformed SPY, and even BTC. Instead of Strategy, Robinhood was added on the index to replace Caesars Entertainment.

In 2025, investors are watching three names that embody these elements: BullZilla , Pudgy Penguins, and XRP. Each project brings a unique combination of mechanics, branding, and community strength, making them standout candidates among the top cryptos to buy now. BullZilla pushes a presale model that rewards conviction and leverages Ethereum’s infrastructure. Pudgy Penguins expands beyond NFTs into tokens that capture retail and cultural interest. XRP taps into political identity while testing the limits of meme culture. Together, these coins highlight where narrative meets tokenomics in the current market cycle. BullZilla: Forged in Ethereum’s Blue Fire The BullZilla ($BZIL) presale is now in Stage 1-D. Already, more than 19.7 billion $BZIL tokens have been sold, raising over $183,000. At this stage, tokens are priced at $0.00002575, up from the initial presale start of $0.00000575. The progressive presale ensures that prices rise after every $100,000 milestone or every 48 hours, whichever comes first. This design rewards early conviction while ensuring constant momentum. BullZilla Token Summary Token Name: BullZilla Token Symbol: $BZIL Chain: Ethereum (ERC-20) Presale Model: Progressive price increase with each $100K raised or 48 hours passing without hitting that mark Launch Price: $0.00527141 Total Supply: 159,999,999,910 $BZIL Presale Allocation: 50% (80 billion $BZIL) BullZilla benefits from Ethereum’s established liquidity, security, and integration within the broader DeFi ecosystem. Ethereum provides the backbone for the project’s critical features, including staking, the Roar Burn Mechanism, and referral rewards. By being forged on Ethereum’s “blue fire,” BullZilla is built with the robustness of one of the most battle-tested blockchains. The tokenomics are carefully structured to reinforce scarcity and growth. Half of the supply fuels the presale, 20% is dedicated to staking, 20% supports the ecosystem treasury, and smaller allocations cover the burn pool and the team. These elements balance distribution while creating continuous deflationary pressure. Pudgy Penguins: Cultural IP Takes a Tokenized Form Pudgy Penguins began as one of the most recognizable NFT collections, but it has evolved into a brand with real-world traction. Its token price recently rose 4.72%, trading at $0.02930. This increase reflects both renewed interest in NFTs and the project’s broader expansion. Unlike many meme tokens, Pudgy Penguins leverages licensing, merchandise, and mainstream partnerships. Its ecosystem bridges on-chain culture with off-chain consumer markets, a strategy that strengthens resilience against volatility. By combining retail presence with token integration, Pudgy Penguins creates multiple layers of utility. Tokens can represent not just speculative value but also access to branded ecosystems. This approach positions Pudgy Penguins as more than a short-lived trend, making it one of the top cryptos to buy now for those who value cultural and economic crossover. XRP (Ripple): Bridging Traditional Finance and Blockchain XRP is the native cryptocurrency of the Ripple network, a digital payment protocol designed to facilitate fast, low-cost international money transfers. Created by Ripple Labs in 2012, XRP aims to bridge the gap between traditional banking systems and blockchain technology. Unlike many cryptocurrencies that operate on fully decentralized networks, Ripple works closely with financial institutions, positioning itself as a tool for enhancing the efficiency of cross-border payments. The XRP Ledger, on which XRP operates, uses a consensus protocol instead of traditional proof-of-work or proof-of-stake systems, enabling quicker transaction confirmation and lower energy consumption. XRP’s primary use case is as a bridge currency in Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution, which allows banks and payment providers to settle cross-border transactions instantly, without the need for pre-funded accounts in foreign currencies. This real-time settlement capability has attracted partnerships with financial institutions around the world. Despite facing legal challenges, notably the ongoing lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), XRP remains one of the most prominent cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Its focus on interoperability with traditional finance and speed of transactions sets it apart from other digital assets in the blockchain space. Conclusion Bull Zilla demonstrates how structured presales and Ethereum-backed mechanics can fuel a project from the start. Pudgy Penguins proves that cultural branding and NFT expansion can extend utility far beyond speculation. XRP highlights both the power and the risks of narrative-driven assets. Together, these coins represent the spectrum of the top cryptos to buy now, where presale engineering, cultural crossover, and political identity collide to define 2025’s crypto landscape.

51346989,https://timestabloid.com/?p=82190,1757258861,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP is the Neutral Liquidity Bank,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-is-the-neutral-liquidity-bank/,"Versan Aljarrah, co-founder of Black Swan Capitalist and a well-known supporter of XRP, has set out a framework that defines how he sees XRP functioning within global settlement structures. In a recent tweet, he stated , “In this new framework, XRP is the neutral liquidity bank, bridging fiat and digital assets across borders. Gold is the ultimate real-world store of value, and stablecoins support XRP by providing liquidity in settlement flows, driving demand and upward pressure on its price.” Aljarrah’s comments provide a clear division of responsibilities between digital assets, stablecoins, and gold in a proposed financial architecture. According to Aljarrah, XRP would serve as the intermediary settlement layer between fiat currencies and digital assets, operating as a neutral liquidity mechanism that is not tied to any single jurisdiction. The description highlights the ability of XRP to act as a bridge in international markets, ensuring seamless flows of value. This positioning, as he explained, makes XRP the “neutral liquidity bank” in global settlement arrangements. In this new framework, XRP is the neutral liquidity bank, bridging fiat and digital assets across borders. Gold is the ultimate real-world store of value, and stablecoins support XRP by providing liquidity in settlement flows, driving demand and upward pressure on its price. — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) September 5, 2025 Gold and Stablecoins in the Framework Aljarrah also emphasized the separate roles of gold and stablecoins. In his description, gold holds its place as the ultimate store of value, representing long-term security in contrast to the operational role of digital assets. He noted that gold functions outside short-term settlement needs, anchoring wealth and stability. Stablecoins, on the other hand, are placed in a supportive role. They are described as providing the liquidity necessary for efficient settlement flows, but not as the central mechanism of the system. Their purpose, as outlined by Aljarrah, is to support the functioning of XRP by making settlement corridors more liquid and therefore more efficient. Price Implications for XRP Aljarrah further suggested that the reliance on stablecoins to maintain settlement flows ultimately benefits XRP by increasing its usage in cross-border payment activity . According to him, this reliance places upward pressure on XRP’s price, as demand for the asset rises when it functions as the neutral liquidity layer. His statement connects operational settlement flows with market impact, drawing a direct line between practical adoption and price performance. The framework presented by Aljarrah separates the functions of three asset classes into distinct categories: gold as a store of value, stablecoins as short-term liquidity facilitators, and XRP as the neutral settlement bridge.

His assertion is that stablecoins, while important in providing operational liquidity, ultimately support XRP and contribute to increasing its demand. This, combined with gold’s role as a store of value, completes a model that he argues positions XRP as a neutral and central component in cross-border financial markets.

The platform recorded a trading volume of $111.8 billion, up 28.3% month-on-month, representing the second time this year it has surpassed the $100 billion mark. Uniswap Strikes Back According to the latest report shared by CoinGecko, this resurgence allowed Uniswap to recover from its June low, when its market share had fallen to 19.4%, overtaken by PancakeSwap amid the latter’s surge driven by the Binance Alpha 2.0 launch. The rewards program boosted PancakeSwap’s activity, which helped it achieve record daily trading volumes of around $5 billion and a peak market share of 64.5% in June. However, August told a different story as PancakeSwap’s trading volume plummeted to $92.0 billion. This was a sharp 44.7% decline from July, which reduced its market share to 29.5% and allowed Uniswap to retake the top spot. Aerodrome secured its position as the third-largest DEX in August while capturing 7.4% market share. It recorded almost $23 billion in trading volume, which marks a 28% month-on-month increase. The remaining top 10 decentralized exchanges collectively accounted for 27.3% of the market. Meanwhile, the DEX ecosystem continues to evolve rapidly, with newcomers like Hyperliquid making notable gains. Hyperliquid’s August volume surged 129.3% month-on-month to $21.4 billion, pushing its market share to 6.9% and elevating it to the fourth-largest DEX. In the process, it surpassed several Solana-based platforms. While still far behind Uniswap and PancakeSwap, Hyperliquid’s rise evidences the increasingly competitive nature of the DEX sector. UNI’s Volatile Trajectory Uniswap strengthened its market dominance, but the same can’t be said for its governance token, UNI, which experienced significant volatility over the past month, forming a local top above $12 in mid-August before suffering back-to-back corrections. The token showed strong upward momentum through August but has faced selling pressure in recent weeks, with the price consolidating in the $9-10 range through early September. Despite the turbulence, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan noted that UNI at $6 billion is modest by global standards, and compared it to Storebrand, which happens to be a mid-sized Norwegian insurance firm. He added that despite its DeFi prominence, its valuation remains relatively small in the broader financial landscape.

On the regulatory front, the SEC outlined a new 2025 framework and Polymarket gained CFTC approval to operate in the US. Let’s dig deeper. Bitcoin Metaplanet has expanded its Bitcoin reserves to 20,000 BTC worth over $2.15 billion, as a part of its aggressive treasury strategy and long-term crypto ambitions. Technology Japan Post Bank is preparing to introduce its digital deposit currency , DCJPY, by 2026 in a move that could reshape Japan’s financial landscape and accelerate the country’s adoption of blockchain technology. Business Billionaire and Tron founder Justin Sun has claimed that World Liberty Financial has frozen over $100 million in cryptocurrency purchased from the project. Michael Saylor’s company, Strategy (MSTR), has reportedly satisfied every requirement necessary for inclusion in the S&P 500 Index, potentially carrying nearly $70 billion in Bitcoin into the benchmark. Solana-based memecoin launchpad Pump.fun has introduced “ Project Ascend ,” a sweeping update designed to strengthen sustainability for token creators and attract long-term projects. Web3 Space and Time, the blockchain for verifiable data, has partnered with Indomobil Group, one of Indonesia’s largest companies, to launch an educational portal that enables students to verify their qualifications and pay for courses on-chain. Prediction market Myriad announced that it has surpassed $10M in USDC trading volume, further proving that prediction markets are fast becoming a cornerstone of DeFi, occupying a niche somewhere between trading and gaming. Regulation The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has unveiled its latest regulatory roadmap , introducing targeted measures to address the growing role of digital assets in financial markets. The Dutch central bank (DNB) has fined cryptocurrency exchange OKX $2.6 million for providing services in the Netherlands without the required registration, adding to mounting regulatory challenges for the exchange across multiple jurisdictions. Polymarket has secured regulatory clearance from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to resume operations in the United States, marking a major milestone for the blockchain-based prediction platform.

The flagship cryptocurrency fell to a low of $110,036 early today but recovered and moved to its current level of $110,575, marginally down over the past 24 hours. BTC faces a major hurdle around the $114,000 mark, which has become a major source of concern. Analysts believe it must cross this level for a push towards $120,000 to materialise. Marathon Digital Bitcoin Treasury Second-Largest Among Public Funds MARA Holdings Bitcoin (BTC) treasury is now valued at $6 billion. The firm holds 52,477 BTC , putting it behind only Michael Saylor’s Strategy in the Bitcoin treasury rankings. MARA produced just over 700 BTC in August at an average of 22.7 BTC per day. However, the flagship cryptocurrency’s price fell just over 5% in the same period, peaking around $124,000 and then dropping below $110,000. MARA CEO Fred Thiel stated, “Given the decline in Bitcoin price during the month, we took the opportunity to add to our treasury and currently hold over 52,000 BTC .” MARA added that its hashrate went up to 59.4 EH/s. Additionally, all miners at the firm’s Texas wind farm have been installed and connected. According to Thiel, the site is on track to become fully operational by the fourth quarter of 2025. Bitcoin (BTC) Unlikely To Reach Price Peak In Q4 A Bitcoin analyst has said that investors predicting BTC will reach its cycle-high price by the end of 2025 don’t understand the principles of statistics. The statement comes amid several predictions that Bitcoin could surge to new highs. The analyst stated in a post on X, “Anyone who thinks Bitcoin has to peak in Q4 of this year does not understand statistics or probability. The analyst argued that the halving cycle was irrelevant following the rise of Bitcoin treasury companies and growing inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. The halving is completely irrelevant at this point, and there is zero fundamental reason—other than a psychological, self-fulfilling prophecy—for the peak to occur in Q4 2025. From a statistical and probability standpoint, it is equivalent to flipping a coin and getting tails three times in a row, then betting all your money that the fourth flip MUST BE tails.” Meanwhile, traders are divided over whether BTC will peak by the end of 2025. According to Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg, BTC has a 40%-50% chance of crossing the $140,000-$150,000 mark. “I think there is a greater than 50% chance Bitcoin goes to the 140 to 150 range this year before we see another bear market next year.” However, he warned of a broader economic bear market, stating that the Federal Reserve should have cut interest rates at its last two meetings. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has steadied itself over the weekend after a week of substantial volatility. The flagship cryptocurrency surged to an intraday high of $113,390 on Friday as bulls attempted to retake control. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and fell to $110,670, ultimately registering a marginal decline. The price dropped 0.41% on Saturday but has recovered during the ongoing session, up 0.31% at $110,558. Analysts believe there is uncertainty in the market as investors evaluate their next move. Despite the uncertainty, BTC maintained its position above the key $110,000 level. This level is crucial in determining whether the flagship cryptocurrency can retain bullish momentum in the short term. Additionally, BTC has maintained its bullish edge despite lower-than-expected NFP numbers, indicating that broader market sentiment supports BTC . However, if BTC breaks below $110,000, it could lead to a deeper correction, potentially testing the $100,000 level. BTC registered a sharp drop on Sunday (August 24), falling to an intraday low of $110,635 before settling at $113,478. Bearish sentiment intensified on Monday as the price fell nearly 3% and settled at $110,127. BTC faced volatility on Tuesday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price rose 1.51% to $111,788. BTC was back in the red on Wednesday, dropping 0.48% and settling at $111,253. It recovered on Thursday, rising 1.19% to reach an intraday high of $113,480 before settling at $112,574. Bearish sentiment returned on Friday as BTC fell nearly 4%, losing the crucial $110,000 level and settling at $108,378. Source: TradingView Price action was mixed over the weekend as BTC rose 0.41% on Saturday before dropping 0.53% on Sunday to settle at $108,247. The flagship cryptocurrency started the current week in positive territory, rising 0.92% to reclaim $109,000 and settle at $109,240. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as the price rose nearly 2% to cross $111,000 and settle at $111,247. BTC continued pushing higher on Wednesday, rising 0.46% to $111,756, but lost momentum on Thursday, falling to an intraday low of $109,321 before settling at $110,720. The price surged to an intraday high of $113,390 on Friday. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and settled at $110,670, ultimately registering a marginal decline. Sellers retained control on Saturday as BTC registered a marginal decline and settled at $110,212. The current session sees the price up 0.30%, trading around $110,548.

51347842,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=801863,1757259615,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51347842.jpeg,Billionaires in Silicon Valley have spent over $5 billion trying to extend human life using AI and science,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/silicon-valley-immortality-ai-and-science/,"Silicon Valley has a new obsession, and it’s not crypto, or Mars. It’s living forever. Or at least pushing the human lifespan past 100, maybe even 150 or 200. Over the past 25 years, the ultrawealthy have dumped more than $5 billion into what they believe is the next frontier: longevity tech. They’re betting hard that AI, biotech, and cash can turn aging into just another bug in the code. Big names like Peter Thiel , Sam Altman, Yuri Milner, and Marc Andreessen are at the center of this. The Wall Street Journal reviewed data from PitchBook, public company filings, and statements and found these guys aren’t playing small. Peter alone has backed nearly a dozen longevity-focused firms. Some were funded through his venture capital firm, others through a nonprofit foundation he supports. The combined funding? Over $700 million. Billionaires move their money into anti-aging drugs, AI, and cell tech All that money isn’t going into one idea. It’s being scattered across startups that promise anything from cell rejuvenation to AI-driven drug discovery, and even health tracking wearables. And these rounds are getting bigger. Average fundraising rounds for these companies have jumped more than 20% over the last 10 years, now sitting close to $43 million per deal. NewLimit, founded by Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong, just pulled in $130 million in May. That round was backed by Peter and Vinod Khosla. Then there’s Altos, a giant in the space, which launched in 2022 and scored a $3 billion raise, more than any other company in the Journal’s list. Their goal? Use technology to reprogram cells and make them young again. Other companies are taking different angles. Insilico Medicine, which got backing from Peter Diamandis’s BOLD Capital, raised over $500 million to use artificial intelligence to find treatments for age-related diseases. BioAge Labs, run by Kristen Fortney, pulled in $559 million, with support from Khosla Ventures and Andreessen’s a16z. Fortney met her first batch of investors through Stanford and a Bay Area salon of longevity fanatics hosted by Betts-LaCroix. BioAge went public in 2024. Their first trial for an obesity drug was shut down later that year due to safety issues. They’ve since launched a second trial with a different compound. Fortney told the Journal, “A lot of people already make it past the age of 100 and they’re healthy. So why can’t that be achievable for all of us?” personal grief, biotech promises, and the hope of hacking aging For a lot of these billionaires, this isn’t about returns. It’s personal. Naveen Jain, for instance, lost his father to pancreatic cancer. That’s why he started Viome Life Sciences, which has raised $230 million to date. Viome sells health tests you can use at home and then gives you custom supplement and nutrition advice. Jain threw $30 million of his own cash into the company. Other backers include Marc Benioff and Khosla Ventures. “I want to make aging optional,” Jain told the Journal. Stéphane Bancel, Moderna’s CEO, got into the space after trying out a fasting-style diet built by longevity scientist Valter Longo. He later helped Longo raise $47 million for his company L-Nutra, which now sells fasting nutrition plans. Khosla’s firm has become one of the most active players in the entire longevity market. His investments cover multiple strategies, each focused on different pieces of the aging puzzle. On a podcast interview with Superteam, a crypto group, Khosla said, “At 70, someone should feel like a 40-year-old.” But what even counts as a longevity company? No one fully agrees. The Journal broke it down into three areas. First, companies trying to reprogram cells or reverse aging, think Altos, Retro Biosciences, Juvenescence, and more than 80 others. Together, they’ve pulled in about $5 billion, and Retro is now chasing another $1 billion. Second, there are the biotech firms hunting for drugs to treat age-related diseases. Nearly 60 companies fall into this category, including BioAge. They’ve also attracted close to $5 billion. Third, there’s the “right-now” market—products and services you can use today. These include wearables, vitamins, and cosmetics. This category alone has pulled in $2.6 billion from investors who want a piece of the growing health optimization trend.

Despite positive MACD momentum, these current outlook is creating new opportunities elsewhere as holders seek top ICO investors backing in next-generation PayFi solutions. The market rotation reveals sophisticated investor strategies prioritizing fundamental value over speculation, positioning breakthrough DeFi project opportunities like Remittix as the preferred alternative for investors seeking exponential returns through utility-driven blockchain applications. Cardano Faces Sentiment Collapse Despite Technical Lifelines ADA trades near $0.82 with bearish sentiment at five-month lows, yet whales continue defending $0.81–$0.83 support. Historically, this kind of divergence signals accumulation by larger players while impatient retail exits. With upcoming network upgrades and fading legal concerns, ADA could attempt a rebound toward $1.00, but the grind remains slow compared to faster-moving opportunities. Litecoin Holds Range but Lacks Conviction LTC trades at $111.18, under its 20-day average but still showing bullish MACD momentum. Analysts expect $131–$155 by October if resistance at $124.53 breaks, while failure to hold $105 risks slipping back to $100. Despite its bullish long-term structure, Litecoin remains locked in a grinding range, an uninspiring setup for investors chasing rapid gains. Remittix: The Early-Stage Crypto Investment You Can’t Afford To Miss Here’s where the rotation is happening. While ADA and LTC stall, Remittix (RTX) is exploding onto the scene as the PayFi disruptor solving the $19 trillion payments problem. Forgetting years for incremental upgrades, Remittix is about to unleash its Q3 2025 beta wallet with real-time FX across 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiats, plus direct crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries. This isn’t hype it’s traction: $24,2M raised with over 649M tokens sold at $0.1050 BitMart & LBank listings confirmed, more top exchanges inbound CertiK audit completed for bulletproof trust Deflationary tokenomics that make every burn a value boost Every day you hesitate, supply tightens. Every listing, every milestone, every burned token makes RTX scarcer and your potential upside bigger. Analysts are calling for 30x gains by January, but only if you’re in before the window slams shut. Miss this and you’ll watch others bank life-changing returns while you’re stuck with coins that barely move. $250,000 Giveaway Proves Demand Is Real If you doubt the momentum, look at the numbers: over 310,000 entries and 25,000+ holders already locked in before trading even goes live. This isn’t artificial hype, it’s grassroots adoption. The wallet launch on September 15th, 2025 is the spark that could send RTX soaring and by then, today’s entry prices will look like a gift. Bottom line: Cardano and Litecoin might limp higher, but they won’t deliver 30x by January. Remittix will.

Yakovenko's statement was seen as a response to some criticisms of blockchain transaction data. Yakovenko stated that Solana's performance is constantly improving thanks to its high transaction speed, revealing that 2.9 billion transactions were processed in August 2025 alone. He claimed this figure represents a significant difference compared to Ethereum (ETH), which has seen a total of 2.9 billion transactions since 2015. In other words, according to the founder, Solana has reached Ethereum's historical total transaction volume in just one month. Related News: Details of Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin's Wealth Emerged - Here Are His ETH and Other Assets According to data previously shared on Solana's official account, network applications generated $148 million in revenue in August. This represented a 92% year-over-year increase, the highest revenue among all blockchain networks. Furthermore, the number of active wallets doubled year-over-year to 83 million, while the number of newly issued tokens rose to 843,000. 357 of these tokens were valued at over $1 million. Yakovenko argued that this data demonstrates the scalability and growth potential of the Solana ecosystem. His statement was interpreted as a direct response to criticisms that Solana is “just a showpiece.” *This is not investment advice.

Now, weak U.S. jobs market data has increased the chances of not one, but at least two rate cuts in 2025. For the first time since April 2021, there are more unemployed people (7.24M) in the U.S. than available job openings (7.18M). According to the Kobeissi Letter, the U.S. has revised June’s job report for the second time, showing a loss of 13,000 jobs – the first negative month since July 2021. Meanwhile, August saw only 22,000 jobs added against an expected 75,000. This is why many banks have revised their earlier rate cut predictions and are now expecting a 50 to 75 bps cut before the end of the year. Read on to learn what banks are saying about rate cuts, what it could mean for the crypto markets, and the best cryptos to buy now to capitalize on this opportunity. Banks’ Rate Cut Prediction Bank of America had long stood by its prediction that there would be no rate cuts in 2025. However, in a major U-turn, the bank now expects two 25 bps cuts this year – the first in September and the next in December. Goldman Sachs has made an even bolder call, forecasting three 25 bps cuts in 2025 , followed by two more in March and June 2026. The firm now sees a terminal rate of 3-3.25% (down from its earlier 3.5-3.75% forecast). Similarly, Citigroup is also predicting three cuts this year. Meanwhile, CME Group data shows that 89% of market participants expect at least a 25 bps cut in September , while 11% are betting on a 50 bps cut. With rate cuts now looking almost certain, the crypto markets are buzzing again. Historically, interest rate cuts have been bullish for digital assets: borrowing becomes cheaper, risk-on sentiment increases, bond yields fall, the dollar weakens, and capital flows into crypto in search of higher returns. If you’re planning to build a crypto portfolio, there may not be a better time. Here are some altcoins worth considering to take full advantage of the upcoming rate cuts. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Turbocharging Bitcoin with Fast Speeds, Low Fees & Web3 Compatibility Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has the potential to crank up Bitcoin’s real-world application, making it more than just an investment vehicle. This new crypto project is building a Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin, one that integrates the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to deliver fast transaction speeds, low fees, and a full-blown Web3 environment directly on Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin’s main chain, which processes every transaction first-hand, $HYPER will act as a much-needed secondary fast lane. It’ll handle thousands of requests on the side before sending a summary of all those transactions to the primary chain. At the core of this Layer 2 is a decentralized, non-custodial canonical bridge. By locking your Layer 1 Bitcoin and minting an equivalent amount of tokens on Bitcoin Hyper’s Layer 2, the bridge enables seamless interaction with SVM-powered Web3 applications. These include DeFi trading apps, NFT marketplaces, lending and staking protocols, DAOs, and gaming dApps. Better yet, according to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction , the token could hit $0.32 by the end of 2025, representing a whopping 2,400% gain. Right now, 1 $HYPER is available for just $0.012875, and the project has in total raised over $14.33M from early investors. Here’s how to buy $HYPER . Visit Bitcoin Hyper’s and get yourself possibly one of the best altcoins in 2025. 2. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – Revolutionizing the $85B Online Content Industry SUBBD is the newest (and potentially most game-changing) crypto-powered online subscription platforms available today. It stands out as the first platform of its kind to integrate cutting-edge AI tools, including voice, video, image, and profile generators. The biggest benefit? Helping creators dramatically reduce their workload. By automating much of the content creation process, SUBBD leaves creators with more time to directly engage with their audiences. At the heart of it all is SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) , the platform’s native currency. For fans, buying $SUBBD means more than just paying for premium content, tipping creators, or sending personalized requests. It also unlocks a host of unique perks: Exclusive discounts on in-platform content and subscriptions Early access to beta features Voting rights on key platform decisions, such as creator onboarding and feature prioritization Even better, staking $SUBBD gets you a fixed 20% APY for the first year, along with access to creator livestreams, daily BTS drops, and exclusive content from SUBBD’s top talents. According to our $SUBBD price prediction , a $100 investment today could turn into $850 by the end of 2026 – an eye-popping 750% gain. Currently in presale, $SUBBD has already raised more than $1.1M, with each token priced at just $0.056375. Visit SUBBD Token to join a promising AI-driven crypto project. 3. MemeCore ($M) – Viral New Altcoin Changing the Meme Coin Space If you thought meme coins only existed for speculation and as an outlet for crypto degens’ deranged sense of humor and thrill, MemeCore ($M) is here to make you think again. It’s a unique new cryptocurrency project ushering in a never-before-seen paradigm, one where meme coins evolve into full-blown engines of culture, value, and community coordination. MemeCore introduces a novel Proof of Meme (PoM) consensus layer, designed to reward participants for both cultural contributions and on-chain activity. Thanks to MemeCore’s Meme 2.0 revolution, the token has been a rockstar on the exchanges. It’s up more than 196% in just the last seven days, currently trading around $1.90. Conclusion With speculation about a Federal Reserve rate cut in September dominating crypto chatter, several banking giants have now added more fuel to the fire by suggesting there could be multiple cuts by year-end. This is likely to send crypto to the moon – and you can make hay by adding low-cap, high-upside gems like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) , and MemeCore ($M) to your portfolio. That said, none of the above is financial advice. Crypto investments are highly risky. Invest only after doing your own research.

Before its dramatic rallies, holdings of XRP by early investors had multiplied by well over 100 times, turning modest investments into massive fortunes. Although XRP continues to remain among the largest market participants in the digital asset market today, its massive market capitalization renders such phenomenal growth nearly impossible. Because of this fact, investors are seeking the next utility-based, fairly inexpensive initiative that can replicate the original gains of XRP. One competitor that has already been attracting attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized lending protocol that started its presale in early 2025 and already shows impressive traction. The question many people are asking is; is MUTM the next token to drop below $1? XRP’s Growth Story To see why investors are now considering newer tokens such as MUTM, it is useful to discuss the history of XRP. The introduction of the XRP allowed Ripple Labs to place itself between blockchain technology and traditional finance, allowing cross-border transactions to be completed in seconds at very low costs. During the peak of the bull run in 2017, XRP shot up to over $3 and provided founders with unbelievable rewards. Once again in 2020-2021, XRP became especially sharp, even in the face of regulatory obstacles, which is a reminder that projects that are clearly useful do not die in a crisis and emerge in new cycles. Early entrants to its waves enjoyed massive returns that established XRP as one of the only tokens to provide 100x returns. However, we can jump to 2025, and because of its sheer size, XRP has no upside. Its market value is tens of billions, so multiples in the triple digits are likely quite exaggerated. Although XRP continues to be a powerful and well-established token, the market is moving towards newer entrants that have smaller valuations and greater opportunities to grow exponentially. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) We now come to Mutuum Finance. The project quietly launched presale at a starting price of only $0.01 per token at the start of 2025. It took only a few months to spread the word about the presale, and whales and individual investors fell into the trap of this relatively cheap and relatively practical design. MUTM is listed in Phase 6 at 0.035 with the official launch price being 0.06. Over 16,100 holders have already become part of the community and the project has already raised more than $15.4 million in that short span of time. This type of traction during the presale phase is uncommon, and it is a positive sign that there is more than hype to Mutuum Finance. There are several reasons investors have been accumulating MUTM before launch. The first is its tokenomics design, which incentivizes those who enter early by stepping up the price at every stage by a fixed percentage of about 15-20%. Phase 1 participants who began with a value of $0.01 are thus already making approximately 300% profits. Even those who invested in Phase 6 at $0.035 can make nearly 100% before the launch at $0.06. In second place, there is the roadmap which is useful at the very start. The token listing will be accompanied by the launch of Mutuum Finance, which will enable its users to lend and borrow funds on day one, unlike other projects in the presale, which do not launch their products. Such immediate functionality fosters trust, and offers concrete evidence that the project is not theoretical, but is being implemented. Lastly, Mutuum Finance has increased investor confidence through a CertiK audit, which rated the company at 95/100, and its bug bounty program of $50,000 to add additional security to its smart contracts. All these elements form a base of credibility that is mostly lacking in initial projects. What differentiates Mutuum Finance. Essentially, Mutuum Finance is a decentralized lending protocol, which was developed to improve the past designs like Compound and Aave. It is most significant because it created two lending markets: Users can deposit assets like USDT, BTC, or BNB in P2C pools and receive mtTokens. The tokens provide multiple layers of income as they acquire interest automatically and can be staked to receive additional MUTM rewards. Peer to peer (P2P) lending is the process of lenders and borrowers communicating. Borrowers are able to pick between stable borrow rates, which might guarantee predictable expenses, or variable borrow rates, which might increase and fall, contingent upon liquidity. Due to its flexibility, Mutuum Finance is able to serve both risk-averse and conservative participants. To this architecture is the buy-and-distribute model, in which a fraction of the protocol fees are spent on buying MUTM in the open market and re-selling it to the community. This connects token demand to platform action and creates stable purchasing action. Moreover, Mutuum Finance is building a mint and burn system on an overcollateralized stablecoin. Stablecoins play a vital role in the liquidity of DeFi, and the integration of one into the platform will act as a potent adoption and utilization force. Where It’s Headed Next With a view to the future, the roadmap of Mutuum Finance will see it grow both in the short term and long term. To reduce the expenses and increase the scalability Layer-2 integration will be established which will ensure the platform will be able to handle significant volumes of transactions without imposing fees on smaller users. There is a definite upward trend in prices as viewed by analysts: MUTM will nearly triple its stage when it launches at a price of $0.06. Over the short term, it is estimated that it will increase to approximately $0.25 – 0.35 with adoption. In the long-term, MUTM is expected to grow to $1.25 to $2.00 in 2026 due to integration of stablecoins, adoption of dual lending, and Layer-2 scaling. To give it context, an initial investment of $1,250 at the current price of $0.035 would purchase approximately 35,700 MUTM tokens. That would be about $2,150 at the official selling price of $0.06. Assuming the price of the token increases to about $0.35 in the first growth wave, its value would be nearly $12,500. That investment could be more than $62,000 in the long run when MUTM achieves its long-term target of $1.75. From XRP’s Legacy to MUTM’s Future The story of crypto’s biggest winners has always been tied to utility, adoption, and timing. Because it addressed a genuine issue and expanded before the market took notice, Ripple (XRP) gave early investors 100x returns. XRP is still strong today, but its upside is constrained by its size. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a novel narrative that blends early-stage affordability, genuine DeFi utility, and an adoption-oriented roadmap. It has the resources to draw in investors and meet long-term demand thanks to its dual lending markets, evolving stablecoin, audited security, and beta platform that launches at listing. The argument that MUTM could define the future while XRP defined the past is getting harder to ignore for those looking for the next breakout token under $1.

The commentary originates from remarks made by Robert Pehrson, Head of Products and Business Development at the financial services group SEB. Pehrson addressed developments at the Paris Fintech Forum when SWIFT gpi initiated a Proof of Concept with DLT platform R3. The initiative was designed to combine the benefits of gpi payments, including speed, ubiquity, and certainty, with distributed ledger technology (DLT). Pehrson stated that SWIFT’s established governance, regulatory framework, and extensive reach already position it as a strong infrastructure provider. According to him, making SWIFT’s infrastructure network more efficient through DLT could be a more practical step forward compared to building an entirely new system. He emphasized that for Ripple , the future may not be in operating separately, but rather in being integrated into larger existing systems, citing SWIFT as an example. RIPPLE’S FUTURE IS INTEGRATION INTO SWIFT Read closely. “…within SWIFT you already have the governance, the regulatory frame and the reach in the system. If you could make that infrastructure network more efficient using DLT, that's probably an easier way to move… pic.twitter.com/vipjGJRfAB — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 6, 2025 Ripple’s Potential Role Within Global Payment Systems The document further outlined a scenario where Ripple could extend value by facilitating real-time transactions not only for companies and banks within a single legal entity but also across additional parties. If Ripple were to integrate with SWIFT gpi under such conditions, the combined system could potentially enhance the efficiency and functionality of international payment processes. However, Pehrson indicated that while such integration could add value, it does not appear imminent. He acknowledged the practicality of Ripple’s technology but suggested that immediate adoption into the SWIFT framework may face challenges. Broader Implications for the Payments Landscape The commentary points to a broader industry recognition that the future of digital payments may rely less on standalone systems and more on the integration of new technologies within existing frameworks. SWIFT’s long-standing position as a global financial messaging network makes it a natural candidate for such integration. Meanwhile, Ripple’s distributed ledger solutions are powered to improve settlement efficiency and real-time processing. According to Tom Poppe, SWIFT’s product manager, significant progress has already been made in testing the application of new technologies. However, he noted that the long-term viability of DLT for mission-critical financial applications, such as cross-border payments, remains to be fully established. This underscores that while integration between Ripple and SWIFT may be conceptually appealing, concrete steps toward such a development would depend on further validation of technology and regulatory alignment. Documented Commentary on Ripple and SWIFT SMQKE summarized the significance of these remarks by noting that Ripple’s future could lie in integration with networks like SWIFT rather than attempting to replace them. He shared excerpts from the document where it was stated: “For Ripple, the future is for them to be integrated into some other network, like, for instance, with SWIFT.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Additionally, the document pointed out that Ripple’s ability to conduct real-time transactions across various entities could create value on top of SWIFT gpi. This documented perspective reinforces the view that Ripple’s role in the financial system may be shaped by collaboration and integration, rather than competition, with established infrastructures.

ADA’s ecosystem is still expanding and its community is as loyal as ever, but the slow pace of development has worn on investors. The foundation is strong, yet the lack of urgency leaves Cardano (ADA) struggling to excite traders chasing faster-moving opportunities. At the same time, capital is rotating into newer plays. Layer Brett ($LBRETT), an Ethereum Layer 2 memecoin, is now pulling in whales who see the potential for 40x returns this month. Why Cardano’s upside looks capped Cardano (ADA) built its identity on being methodical and research-driven. That gave it credibility early on, but the crypto market doesn’t reward slow movers. While Solana, Ethereum Layer 2s, and even meme-driven tokens are shipping updates and grabbing attention, Cardano still feels like it’s behind the curve. That’s why most Cardano price predictions for 2025 remain cautious. ADA may rise with the broader market, but analysts don’t see the explosive upside traders expect from newer, faster tokens. For many, ADA has shifted from being a high-growth bet to more of a slow-and-steady long-term hold. The new magnet for whale money This is why bigger investors are eyeing Layer Brett ($LBRETT). Still in presale, Brett has become one of the most talked-about tokens in trading circles. Whales see a combination they like: meme culture, Ethereum Layer 2 scalability, and massive staking rewards that could fuel exponential returns. Where Cardano feels like a long-term research project, Brett offers the high-risk, high-reward setup that can deliver results quickly. Why whales are rotating capital Whales aren’t moving blindly. They’re spotting clear advantages in Layer Brett: Ethereum Layer 2 infrastructure: instant transactions with minimal fees Meme-first energy: branding designed for viral speculation Early staking rewards: 895% available for first movers Perfect timing: launching just as traders are chasing new speculative plays Can Cardano keep up in 2025? To be clear, Cardano isn’t going away. Its ecosystem is still growing, with DeFi projects, emerging market partnerships, and steady staking returns keeping it relevant. But its appeal is different. ADA attracts long-term investors who value gradual compounding, not retail traders looking for a 20x or 40x return in a few months. Why analysts are calling 40x on Brett The 40x call for Layer Brett might sound bold, but analysts say it lines up with history. Meme tokens that hit at the right moment, with hype and infrastructure behind them — have shown they can multiply fast. Shiba Inu and Pepe coin already proved it. Brett could be next. With Ethereum Layer 2 adoption expected to surpass $10 trillion annually by 2027, Brett isn’t just running on meme energy. It’s tied to one of the biggest growth engines in crypto. Conclusion The latest Cardano price prediction points to a slow, steady climb in 2025. ADA will stay relevant, but its ceiling looks low compared to what speculative traders want. Layer Brett ($LBRETT), by contrast, is pulling in whales and retail investors alike with the promise of 40x upside if momentum continues. Cardano is for patience. Layer Brett is for speed. Right now, the market wants speed. Don’t miss your chance to join the next top meme coin and stake for potentially life-changing rewards.

With Indian stocks underperforming and global funds pulling back, the diplomatic handshake between the two leaders signaled something larger than symbolic goodwill. It came as part of a broader push that includes domestic tax cuts and central bank rate easing, offering new reasons for investors to reconsider their positions in India. According to Bloomberg, the meeting focused on border issues, restarting direct flights, and growing trade, three areas where any progress could directly affect market sentiment. As the U.S. under President Donald Trump continues to enforce 50% reciprocal tariffs on India, this new diplomatic tone with China is being read by market watchers as a possible shift in regional strategy. The combination of improved China relations and internal economic stimulus is being interpreted by bulls as enough to neutralize Trump’s aggressive trade stance. The year-to-date performance says a lot: the Nifty 50 has risen just 4.6%, while the MSCI Emerging Markets Index is up 19%. On top of that, global investors have pulled out $16 billion from Indian stocks this year alone. India may benefit more than China from this new alignment The imbalance in trade between the two countries remains massive. In the fiscal year ending March 2025, India exported $14.2 billion to China while importing $113.5 billion. That gap gives India more to gain if trade flows improve. Analysts say this could create opportunities in manufacturing, energy tech, and capital inflows, three areas where China has scale and India has demand. Jasmine Duan, senior investment strategist at RBC Wealth Management in Hong Kong, said, “Improved Sino-Indian relations may benefit the Indian stock market more significantly, as India is currently the one facing the 50% tariff hike . For Chinese stocks, the impact is likely to be indirect and marginal at best, making it difficult to drive a major market trend.” Some fund managers are skeptical that anything real will come from this. Kunjal Gala, who manages $2.3 billion at Federated Hermes in London, said, “It’s too early to tell which sectors or industries will benefit, as no concrete policies have been announced.” Gala warned that the effect on markets might be temporary unless actual trade reforms are put in place. Still, others are paying attention to the broader shift. Pramod Gubbi, co-founder at Marcellus Investment Managers in Mumbai, said , “The decline in allocation to India in EM portfolios we have seen in recent months could be arrested or potentially reversed.” He believes the effects of the tariffs may “get offset by this boost to Indian economic growth and eventual earnings recovery.” Tax cuts and rate easing fuel more investor interest Alongside the foreign policy reset, domestic economic support is also playing a role. Sanjay Malhotra, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, confirmed that the central bank remains in a rate-cutting cycle. Since February, the RBI has lowered the benchmark rate by 100 basis points to stimulate sectors hit by tariffs and slowing demand. In another action designed to support consumption, a panel of state and federal finance ministers approved cuts to goods and services tax on nearly 400 product categories. These items make up about 16% of India’s consumer-price basket. Following the announcement, shares in consumer-facing firms and carmakers moved higher. Anna Wu, a cross-asset strategist at VanEck Associates in Sydney, tied the two developments together. “The warming of China-India ties can be a positive factor, while the tax cuts are also a structural tailwind for Indian equities,” she said. Wu pointed out that India could benefit from forming a new economic axis with China and Russia in the face of Trump’s aggressive tariffs . “The China-Russia-India block is in formation now amid historic tariffs, and could help India to increase its resilience against US tariff aggression,” she said.

Paxos Issues Stablecoins on Stellar Network It is worth noting that Paxos has a track record of issuing stablecoins for other top companies like Binance, PayPal, Kraken, Robinhood, and OKX. In November 2024, it brought its full suite of stablecoins to the Stellar (XLM) ecosystem. Charles Casparella, CEO and co-founder of Paxos, noted that he is quite enthusiastic about the ecosystem Paxos was drawn to the Stellar network due to its proven track record in scalability and accessibility. In addition, this was a partnership that could boost financial inclusion in emerging markets by providing stable digital currencies to underserved regions. Currently, Paxos has achieved a cumulative issuance volume of $160 billion across seven tokenized assets. Fix the GENIUS Act to Favor the Banking Industry In a related stablecoin discussion, the newly launched GENIUS Act is already becoming controversial for America’s banking sector and leading crypto advocate groups. This Act, which was signed into law by President Donald Trump in July, was designed to create a legal framework for stablecoins, encourage competition, and expand financial access. However, some entities believe that there is still a lot to be fixed in the law. One of such is the contest between banks and innovators over the future of money. The concerned parties believe that the law does not fully block stablecoin issuers from offering interest-like returns. They argue that at this rate, the gap could lead exchanges and affiliates to turn stablecoins into investment products. This may eventually create risks normally tied to bank deposits and credit.

Top Analyst Answers,https://timestabloid.com/will-today-be-that-day-for-xrp-top-analyst-answers/,"Crypto analyst Cryptoinsightuk recently shared a chart suggesting XRP may be approaching a pivotal moment. In his post, he asked, “Will today be that day, XRP?” accompanied by a daily chart that outlines the asset’s current positioning. The chart highlights the token’s struggle to break out of a downward trend while holding above a major support level, forming a descending triangle . His post reflects the community’s growing interest in whether XRP’s momentum can shift after weeks of pressure. Will today be that day, $XRP pic.twitter.com/NoR1vkEwTJ — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) September 7, 2025 XRP’s Recent Performance XRP has experienced a steady decline since it reached its all-time high in mid-July . This gradual decline accelerated in late August, with a series of downturns that pushed the asset below the psychological $3 support. Although this decline was not a total collapse, it marked a significant pullback from earlier highs, confirming a consolidation phase. In early September, the digital asset found some stability as prices hovered between $2.80 and $2.90. This range has become a testing ground for bulls and bears, with neither side yet able to establish dominance. The Chart Structure The chart shared by Cryptoinsightuk shows XRP trading below a descending resistance line, created by a series of lower highs stretching across August and early September . Despite repeated attempts, XRP has been unable to break through this line, keeping the broader trend negative. However, support has held above $2.72, a level marked on the chart as a critical floor. The relative strength index (RSI) also sits in the mid-40s, suggesting that XRP is neither oversold nor overbought, leaving room for momentum to swing in either direction. Where’s XRP Going Next? The current setup presents a pivotal scenario. A breakout above the descending resistance line near $2.9 could signal the start of a reversal, allowing XRP to retest the $3.1 to $3.2 range. This would represent the first meaningful challenge to the downtrend since late July. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The asset retested the $2.9 level earlier today but was rejected. It is currently trading at $2.89, up 3.38% over the past 24 hours, and gearing up for another breakout attempt. Analysts and traders are closely watching for confirmation of direction. As Cryptoinsightuk implied, the market is waiting to see if today could be the turning point and the end of the consolidation phase .

Moolenaar was sent to U.S. agencies during key China trade talks,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/fake-email-trump-china-trade-talks-began/,"Right before trade talks between the U.S. and China kicked off in Sweden last July, a fake email shook things up in D.C. Staff working on the House committee dealing with U.S. competition with China started getting weird questions. The confusion started after law firms, lobby groups, and U.S. agencies got an email that looked like it came from Rep. John Moolenaar. It asked for ideas on sanctions that lawmakers might use against Beijing. The problem is, Moolenaar never sent it. The email was totally bogus. But it landed at a tense moment, right as the Trump team was gearing up for another round of dead-end negotiations with China. According to the Journal, staffers couldn’t figure out who was behind the fake message, but the timing made everyone nervous. Someone clearly wanted to throw sand in the gears just as the U.S. and China tried, yet again, to fix their mess. Li Chenggang visits but dodges top U.S. officials While the fake Moolenaar email was bouncing around Washington, China was doing its own quiet thing. Li Chenggang, a top official under Vice Premier He Lifeng, flew into D.C. at the end of August. But his trip wasn’t set up by the White House. It wasn’t even cleared with top-level folks. He didn’t meet Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent or Trade Rep. Jamieson Greer. Instead, he met with lower-ranking people at the Treasury, Commerce Department, and USTR. “The meetings were not productive,” one person close to the talks said. Li stuck to China’s usual script, cut the tariffs, and lift export bans on U.S. tech. But he didn’t offer anything new. The visit didn’t push negotiations forward. It showed that Xi Jinping was sticking to a playbook: stay in the room, keep the optics good, but give up nothing. Xi’s message was clear. China wants to look like the adult in the room without actually giving up anything. That same week, Xi was seen with leaders from India, Russia, North Korea, and others. The optics? A big show of global friendship that stood in sharp contrast to Trump’s “America First” playbook. Trade war stuck over soybeans, fentanyl, and tariffs Inside the talks, the same fights dragged on. China demanded that the U.S. remove its tariffs. Beijing wanted the ban lifted on American tech exports. Li repeated those points during his D.C. visit but didn’t back them up with real offers. The fentanyl fight also got worse. Washington asked China to stop the flow of chemicals used in the drug’s production. But according to people involved, Beijing said no. They want the U.S. to first remove the 20% tariffs on China’s goods , which were slapped on because of China’s alleged role in the fentanyl trade. And Agriculture was another war zone. Trump had told China to buy more American soybeans, but so far, Beijing hadn’t moved. U.S. officials claimed that China had been shrinking its orders for the past 18 months. They pulled meat-processing certificates, turned to other countries for grain, and stocked up early to avoid buying during the U.S. harvest season. With the harvest just weeks away, American farmers were on edge. No big soybean orders had come in. Everyone feared China would skip U.S. crops completely. Back on August 22, China’s ambassador to the U.S., Xie Feng, let it rip at a soybean industry event. He said America’s protectionism was “casting a shadow over China-U.S. agricultural cooperation.” That line landed hard. It wasn’t just about soybeans. It was about the whole trade mess. Yet despite all the shouting, the two countries agreed on one small thing; they would keep current tariffs in place through early November. That meant no new penalties, no new relief. They also agreed to relax export controls on a few specific products, like rare-earth magnets from China and select U.S. tech items. Then came a TV moment. Treasury Secretary Bessent told Fox News, “We’re very happy” with where things stood. “I think right now the status quo is working pretty well,” he added, referring to tariffs on China.

The latest sign of the US government’s pro-crypto stance is the Senate’s new bill, the Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2025 . Most notably, the bill introduces a crucial provision clarifying that tokenized stocks and similar assets will remain classified as securities. Keep reading to learn why this clarification is a win for crypto, how it simplifies things for blockchain businesses, and what the best altcoins to buy to make the most from the momentum this regulatory shift is set to create. Why the Senate’s 2025 Bill Could Supercharge the Crypto Market The Senate’s latest bill is crucial because it ensures that companies involved in tokenization can continue operating within familiar frameworks, including broker-dealer systems, clearing mechanisms, and trading platforms. Even better, the bill also lays out clear guidelines on when digital assets will fall under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) versus the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis reinforced the urgency, saying, ‘We want this on the president’s desk before the end of the year,’ showing that the Senate isn’t just committed to pro-crypto changes but also to rolling them out quickly for maximum impact. Combined with the prospect of multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025 , there may not be a better time to load up your portfolio with explode-worthy altcoins like the following. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – New Telegram-Based Trading Bot Helping Retail Meme Coin Traders Snorter Token ($SNORT) powers a new Telegram trading bot built to restore parity in the meme coin trading space. Right now, deep-pocketed investors with advanced tools and algorithms scoop up most of the liquidity in newly listed tokens, effectively shutting out retail traders from those early meme coin pumps. Snorter Bot’s automatic execution changes that. It lets you place buy/sell orders in advance and then executes them the moment liquidity becomes available – something nearly impossible to do manually. This gives you the chance to ride the earliest (and often biggest) price jumps in new meme coins . On top of that, the bot is loaded with robust safeguards against common on-chain threats, including rug pulls, honeypots, front-running, and sandwich attacks. Why buy $SNORT , Snorter Bot’s native cryptocurrency? A potential 807% ROI by year-end, according to our $SNORT price prediction No daily sniping limits Advanced analytics Generous staking rewards, currently yielding 123% Reduced trading fees: just 0.85% vs. 1.5% charged to non-holders Interested? Join the $SNORT presale, which has already pulled in over $3.77M from early investors. And each token is currently priced at just $0.1037. Check out Snorter Token’s presale page to snort your way to profitable trades. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Dogecoin-Themed Meme Coin with Aggressive Marketing Plans Maxi Doge ($MAXI) might not have an other-worldly staking mechanism or any underlying utility, but its raw, laser-focused mission to overshadow Dogecoin has crypto degens hooked. Simply put, Maxi is Dogecoin’s distant cousin who, thanks to Doge’s pomp and show as the best meme coin ever, grew up in the shadows. This left Maxi licking his paws in frustration. That’s why Maxi harbors an undying hatred for Dogecoin. The million-dollar question, however, is whether $MAXI is capable of being the next 1000x crypto . The answer? A resounding yes. With over 40% of its total token supply reserved for marketing (think PR campaigns, influencer partnerships, and social media blitzes), $MAXI has locked in a solid plan to go viral. Additionally, it won’t stop at DEX and CEX listings – $MAXI is also eyeing a futures platform launch. This could make it even more popular among high-risk, high-reward traders, who will be able to take leveraged positions and chase potentially life-changing gains. Join the tribe by buying $MAXI while it’s still in presale at just $0.000256. The project has already amassed $1.9M in funding within just a few weeks. Join the presale and go with this unhinged Maxi Doge in his journey to take down Dogecoin. 3. Comedian ($BAN) – Viral Meme Coin Based on Controversial Artwork Comedian ($BAN) ’s 130%+ rise over the past month is already impressive, but its additional 22% gain this past week is particularly noteworthy, as it comes right after a major breakout. The breakout in question was a run-up out of a descending triangle pattern – the same formation that pushed the token into a nearly 90% drawdown back in February-April this year. According to textbook technical analysis, by measuring the width of the triangle and projecting it from the breakout, $BAN could be on its way to $1.419360 – an eye-popping 1,000% gain from current price levels. For context, Comedian is based on the controversial artwork featuring a banana taped to a wall. This so-called piece of ‘modern’ art that has sparked endless online debate about whether it represents brilliance or just lazy absurdity. Wrapping Up With the US government showing no signs of slowing down its pro-crypto stance, the stage is set for the crypto market to rise by leaps and bounds in the coming weeks. If you wish to make the most of this golden opportunity, consider loading up on low-priced, high-potential tokens like Snorter Token ($SNORT) , Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , and Comedian ($BAN).

Has the Altcoin Bull Run Begun?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/whats-the-latest-on-the-altcoin-season-index-has-the-altcoin-bull-run-begun/,"In the cryptocurrency market, attention has turned to altcoins again. According to current data, the Altcoin Season Index has risen to 53/100, indicating that an altcoin-heavy period may have begun in the market. This level is considered an indicator of a shift from Bitcoin season to altcoin season. The index is calculated by comparing the performance of the top 100 altcoins against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. If more than 75% of these altcoins outperform Bitcoin, the market is defined as “Altcoin Season.” Historical data on the index was as follows: Yesterday: 52 Last Week: 58 Last Month: 36 Annual Peak: 87 (Altcoin Season – December 4, 2024) Annual Bottom: 12 (Bitcoin Season – April 26, 2025) Related News: Details of Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin's Wealth Emerged - Here Are His ETH and Other Assets The performance chart of the last 90 days clearly demonstrates the rise of altcoins. Altcoins like M (2576.38%), OKB (279.51%), and PENGU (180.28%) showed remarkable gains. Major projects like Ethereum (68.68%), Solana (30.09%), and XRP (22.70%) also showed positive performance, supporting the altcoin rally. Bitcoin, on the other hand, only gained 3.64% during the same period. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: What’s the Latest on the Altcoin Season Index?

Analysts say such a huge reduction points to large outflows from institutional investors, but others have gone further by alleging manipulation. However, pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan has poured cold water on these claims. Rumors Of Coinbase Manipulation Swirl On X US-based exchange Coinbase recently reduced its stash from more than 780 million XRP to just under 200 million in a matter of weeks. This translates to a 69% reduction in the exchange’s holdings since the second quarter of 2025, including a 57% plunge over the last month alone. The scale of the drawdown has also shifted Coinbase’s ranking among exchange holders of XRP, sliding it from the fifth largest to barely in the top 10. Related Reading: MemeCore Explodes 3,800% For ATH — But Is A Collapse Around The Corner? An account on the social media platform X, known as Stern Drew, suggested that Coinbase’s sell-offs go with a deliberate strategy to suppress XRP’s price. In a detailed thread, the commentator claimed that nearly 40% of the outflows were routed through OTC desks tied to New York institutions and that the timing of the sales coincided with XRP price dips in August. According to the thread, more than 70% of the volume was unloaded during low-liquidity trading hours, while fragmented routing across wallets masked the scale of the sales. The thread even suggested that some of the XRP ended up with BlackRock-linked custodial wallets, a move that further points to theories about institutional involvement. Bill Morgan Pushes Back On Manipulation Claims Bill Morgan was quick to reject the idea that Coinbase is actively manipulating XRP’s price. In his view, the theory overlooks the fact that XRP has exhibited the same behavior throughout its history, including during the long stretch when Coinbase delisted the asset and had no apparent influence on its market activity. Coinbase suspended XRP trading in January 2021, but it wasn’t until July 2023 that the cryptocurrency started trading again on the US-based exchange. “One heck of a theory about Coinbase being against XRP,” he said, before noting that the token’s movements today are consistent with its established trends. The suggestion of manipulation by Coinbase fails to hold up, as XRP’s price action appears more reflective of broader crypto market movement than any deliberate suppression by the exchange. XRP has been trading within a well-defined range between $2.8 and $2.9 in the past seven days. Although it lost the $3 support level as August came to a close, XRP has managed to hold above $2.8 since then, and this level has so far cushioned it from deeper losses.

A decisive break above that barrier could shift momentum back in favor of the bulls. Until then, XRP’s price is likely to continue consolidating between $3.10 and $2.8. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.82.

Rowe Price to push private assets into retirement accounts",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/goldman-t-rowe-wall-street-retirement-cash/,"Goldman Sachs is putting down up to $1 billion for a 3.5% stake in asset manager T. Rowe Price, the firm confirmed Thursday, according to Yahoo Finance. The goal is to flood the retirement market with access to private assets (stuff like real estate, infrastructure, credit, and private equity) things that were once only offered to institutional investors. Now the plan is to make them available to everyday Americans, especially those saving for retirement. The partnership wants to build a system that lets these alternative assets flow directly into the hands of retirees, account sponsors, and financial advisers. Goldman CEO David Solomon said this collaboration “represent[s] our conviction in a shared legacy of success delivering results for investors.” He also said that with Goldman’s “decades of leadership innovating across public and private markets” and T. Rowe’s “expertise in active investing,” clients can expect better access to new ways of saving for retirement and building wealth. T. Rowe Price saw its stock jump by as much as 9% on Friday after the announcement. Goldman shares also ticked up, but by a smaller margin. T. Rowe CEO Rob Sharps said : “As a leader in retirement, we have a proven track record of using our expertise to drive solutions that help our clients confidently prepare for, save for, and live in retirement.” Goldman and T. Rowe prep co-branded portfolios Part of the joint plan includes launching target-date funds that mix public stocks, bonds, and private assets. These hybrid funds are set to roll out by the middle of next year. This would bring private investments straight into retirement portfolios in a way that hasn’t really existed before. The two companies also want to launch co-branded portfolios and offer financial advice, targeting both mass affluent and high-net-worth investors. Meanwhile, just this Thursday, Citigroup said its wealth unit would begin working with BlackRock under a new agreement. That deal will give BlackRock control over $80 billion in Citi’s wealth client assets. Over time, those funds will also include private market strategies. Citi said the rollout would begin in the fourth quarter. This wave of Wall Street-private asset pairings comes after President Trump signed an executive order last month. The order directs the Securities and Exchange Commission to let cryptocurrencies and other alternative assets into 401(k)s and retirement accounts. That’s opened the door for big players like Goldman to go all-in on pushing these products through. Before this, private assets were largely out of reach. These investments are harder to sell, come with more fees, and usually require long lockups. They were built for institutional investors, not school teachers, engineers, or small business owners. But the potential for profit has outweighed the challenge. With the rule changes in place, asset managers are rushing in. Apollo Global Management, Partners Group, and KKR have each partnered with more traditional asset managers too. These include State Street, BlackRock, and Capital Group. The goal across the board is clear: pull retail money into alternative investments while the iron is hot. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Reports show that from September 1 to September 6, companies announced fresh allocations of nearly 9,800 BTC — roughly 1 billion at current prices — pushing the corporate total past the seven-figure mark. All-In On Bitcoin Three new corporate treasuries appeared during the week. A Dutch firm opened with 1,000 BTC after raising about 147 million, according to crypto analyst @btcNLNico. China-listed CIMG Inc started with 500 BTC, while US-based Hyperscale Data put in an initial 3.6 BTC via an early program. Those new entries together accounted for about 1,503 BTC — small in headline size but important for the expanding roster of corporate holders. Alongside those fresh entries, a broad set of firms added smaller but meaningful amounts. Mining and infrastructure companies chipped in: Cipher Mining bought 195 BTC, CleanSpark added 124 BTC, and Convano and Cango took 155 BTC and 150 BTC, respectively. Week 36 – #Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Updates Sep 1 – Sep 6 saw 47 announcements – ~9.8k BTC – 3 new treasuries launched with 1,503.6 BTC– 6 future treasuries announcements, millions worth– 24 companies added 8,339.26 BTC– 6 plans to buy more BTC, $136.7m worth-… pic.twitter.com/V9VInvIJ2U — NLNico (@btcNLNico) September 6, 2025 Big Treasury Names, Big Appetite These purchases were part of a larger pattern — 24 companies lifted holdings by about 8,339 BTC over the week. Spread across many names, these smaller allocations added real momentum to the dataset and highlighted wider participation beyond the marquee buyers. Big treasury names kept buying, too. Michael Saylor’s Strategy made sizable buys that keep its total north of 636,500 BTC. Miner Marathon Digital added 1,838 BTC during the week, while Metaplanet purchased 1,009 BTC, pushing its stash past 20,000 BTC. American Bitcoin increased its holdings by 502 BTC as part of a steady build. Those single-company moves made a substantial dent in the weekly total and underscored that both miners and non-miners are taking sizable positions. Corporate activity was not limited to spot purchases. Several firms unveiled large purchase plans and funding approvals. Metaplanet secured an expansion approval that could involve as much as ¥555 billion (about $3.8 billion). S-Science raised its buying limit to ¥9.6 billion (roughly $65.3 million). The Smarter Web Company agreed a subscription worth about £24 million (around $32.4 million). A Growing Base Meanwhile, Hyperscale Data plans to buy 20 million in Bitcoin through an ATM program and Convano pledged ¥2.5 billion ($17 million). Other notable moves include Sora Ventures launching a 1 billion Bitcoin treasury fund, American Bitcoin preparing to list on Nasdaq as ABTC, and DDC Enterprise working with Gemini on treasury allocations. Institutional flow also showed up in broader markets. BlackRock’s recent 290 million Bitcoin purchase was singled out among institutional moves, reflecting growing mainstream interest in building crypto exposure at scale. The week’s story is both concentration and diffusion: a handful of massive treasuries keep growing, but dozens of smaller buys and new entrants are widening the base. Together they pushed corporate Bitcoin holdings over the 1 million BTC mark — a milestone that shows companies are increasingly treating Bitcoin as part of corporate finance playbooks.

This isn’t just another flavor-of-the-month token; Layer Brett’s presale has already rocketed past $2.8 million, showing immense early momentum as it prepares to fuse viral meme culture with real Layer 2 utility. Analysts are whispering that $LBRETT could deliver 100x gains, positioning it as a potent challenger to established players like Solana in the upcoming bull run. Layer Brett – The future Why are savvy investors, who typically ride the waves of giants like Solana (SOL), suddenly eyeing this fresh face? It boils down to potential and purpose. While Solana boasts impressive speed, its enormous market cap, currently over $109 billion, means exponential gains are harder to come by. Layer Brett, however, offers a disruptive blend: the undeniable energy of a meme coin combined with the high-speed, low-cost advantages of an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. Its innovative staking mechanism alone promises an eye-popping 895% APY for early participants, a reward structure designed to lure in serious long-term holders. Imagine the gains compared to the incremental movements of Solana now. What is Layer Brett? Layer Brett isn’t merely a character; it’s a revolution. Born from the internet’s favorite frog meme, this project transcends its origins on Base by establishing its own dedicated Layer 2 blockchain on Ethereum. This means it offers a true escape from the slow, expensive transactions that plague many meme coins, and even some Layer 1 chains. It’s a community-first, tech-backed meme token , promising a future of scalability, lightning-fast transactions, and genuinely low gas fees. What is Solana? Solana burst onto the scene as a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain, often called an “Ethereum killer” due to its incredible transaction speeds and low costs. It rapidly built a thriving ecosystem of dApps, NFTs, and DeFi protocols. SOL has captured a notable portion of the market, attracting substantial institutional interest and a dedicated user base. It’s a powerhouse, no doubt, but one that has also faced challenges like network congestion in the past. SOL price prediction Solana has had a great run. It’s currently trading around $202-$204, with a market cap exceeding $109 billion. Despite its all-time high of $293.31 in late 2021, the path for massive parabolic growth, like SOL’s early days, is restricted by its sheer size. SOL continues to demonstrate strong recovery and ecosystem expansion but its established position means future gains might be steady but less explosive. Institutional backing keeps Solana relevant, yet the chase for life-changing returns often points to lower-cap alternatives. Layer Brett price prediction Here’s where the excitement brews. With its presale gaining rapid traction, Layer Brett is positioned as the next 100x altcoin. Compared to SOL’s gargantuan market cap, Layer Brett’s early stage allows for astronomical growth potential. The combination of a strong community, real Layer 2 utility, and the incredibly high staking rewards makes it a top gainer crypto candidate for 2025. Plus, the project is even running a $1 million giveaway, sweetening the deal for early adopters looking for the best crypto to invest in now. Conclusion The signs are clear: Smart money, even from the pockets of SOL holders, is diversifying into innovative low cap crypto gems. Don’t miss your chance to secure your $LBRETT tokens for $0.0055 and stake them for that incredible 895% APY. Become part of a movement that analysts believe will redefine the meme coin landscape in the crypto bull run of 2025.

Although Bitcoin and Ethereum are the largest assets, XRP plays a significant role, and its appeal and adoption are rapidly growing. Amid this backdrop, xrpl_Adam (@xrpl_adam), a prolific founder and XRP enthusiast, has shared some indisputable facts about XRP to fight misinformation from detractors and inform the broader crypto community about XRP’s potential. indisputable $XRP facts 1. XRP has been used for remittances and cross border payments for YEARS and will continue to do so. 2. XRP is a lot more than just what Ripple is doing. see RWA/equity/asset tokenization, defi, NFTs, ect. hundreds or even thousands of projects… — xrpl_Adam (@xrpl_adam) September 4, 2025 Beyond Cross-Border Payments The use of XRP for remittances and international payments has been established for years. According to xrpl_Adam, XRP “has been used for remittances and cross-border payments for YEARS and will continue to do so.” This foundation has provided XRP with utility that distinguishes it from many tokens. At the same time, XRP is no longer defined solely by payment rails. Developers have expanded their applications into areas such as decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens, real-world asset (RWA) tokenization , and equity markets. The scale of projects leveraging XRPL is notable, with hundreds, and potentially thousands, building solutions on top of the network or directly implementing XRP. Stablecoin Growth and Liquidity One of the most striking developments in the XRPL ecosystem has been the rise of RLUSD, a stablecoin that xrpl_Adam notes is “rapidly closing in on 1 billion market cap and a top 100 token.” The token’s growth positions it as a significant source of liquidity for decentralized finance on XRPL. According to xrpl_Adam, stablecoins will “eat banks alive” if these institutions fail to adopt the technology. Meanwhile, Ripple plans to make RLUSD one of the top stablecoins by the end of 2025 . XRP’s role as a bridge currency in the ecosystem perfectly positions it to benefit from this growth. Institutional Interest and Regulatory Pathways Institutional adoption has also begun to shape XRP’s trajectory. xrpl_Adam stated that “publicly traded companies are buying XRP to hold on their balance sheets,” a claim that aligns with the broader trend of corporations allocating to digital assets. He also emphasized the existence of multiple spot XRP ETF applications awaiting SEC approval . While this approval is not guaranteed, the long list of applications shows growing institutional demand for diversified exposure to digital assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum.

It has consistently maintained a position in the top ten cryptocurrencies longer than any asset other than Bitcoin. Its wide holder base and long-standing market presence reinforce the view that XRP continues to occupy a critical role in the digital economy.

51351904,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=801641,1757266200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51351904.jpeg,"Ethereum Dominated Smart Contracts, Aave Defined DeFi Lending, Now Analysts Say Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Next in Line",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ethereum-dominated-smart-contracts-aave-defined-defi-lending-now-analysts-say-mutuum-finance-mutm-is-next-in-line/,"Projects that come at the right time with the right idea have always defined the crypto industry. Ethereum changed blockchain with the introduction of smart contracts. Aave introduced a new era of yield creation and experimentation in DeFi by enabling the decentralized lending process to become accessible. They both became staples of their time, and those who jump early made enormous fortunes. According to analysts, the focus has changed to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is a project that is more affordable but includes highly sophisticated DeFi mechanics. Mutuum Finance is taking the lead in the next round, just like Ethereum and Aave set the terms of the previous levels of crypto. First Era: Ethereum, The Smart Contract Revolution In 2015, Ethereum introduced the concept of making blockchain a programmable ecosystem as opposed to a payments-only network. With the implementation of smart contracts, Ethereum made it possible to build decentralized applications (dApps), tokenized assets, and later on an entire industry such as DeFi and NFTs. Such a breakthrough made Ethereum the foundation of the Web3, with thousands of projects being built on its base. It had an important technological price story. At the beginning ETH was sold at only a couple of dollars, but in 2021 it was approaching over $4,000. People who had seen the potential of Ethereum early on were left with a life-changing fortune. However, nowadays with ETH having a market cap in the hundreds of billions, parabolic growth is much less probable. Ethereum is on the list of blue-chip crypto, but its size and maturity restrict its upward potential relative to smaller, newer projects. Second Era: Aave, The Lending Pioneer Provided the foundation was Ethereum, Aave was one of the first to create some of its most significant applications: decentralized lending. Founded in 2017 as ETHLend and later renamed Aave in 2020, Aave introduced new features of pooled lending, flash loans, and adaptable interest rates to the world of DeFi. It paved the way to anyone getting yield on any idle crypto or borrow without middlemen, becoming one of the iconic projects of the 202021 DeFi boom. AAVE token holders experienced unbelievable returns as the protocol emerged and its price went up to less than 1 dollar to over 600 dollars at the peak. However, as with Ethereum, the huge market cap of Aave today precludes explosive upside. It is still a reliable protocol, but its expansion narrative has changed to one where it is multiplied at a slow rate instead of at a steady rate. New protocols featuring new mechanics are more appealing to investors with high-reward plays. Third Era: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the projects analysts think could be the next phase of DeFi. And unlike most presales, where functionality is not available until the token listing, Mutuum Finance will release its beta platform with its token listing, making lending and borrowing possible immediately. This short-term utility, in addition to distinguishing it among most early-stage tokens, enhances its likelihood of being floated on high-end stock markets, where working products are given preference over those in development. This visibility will help MUTM to speed up adoption, bring in institutional buyers, and build greater purchasing momentum during this critical post-launch period. Mutuum Finance was established on the basis of providing a two-tiered lending market framework that will ensure maximum flexibility among users. In Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools, participants deposit assets such as ETH, BNB or USDT and earn mtTokens that earn interest and can be staked to earn further MUTM rewards. Borrowers and lenders in the Peer-to-peer (P2P) market directly make contact with each other, either through variable interest rates that increase or decrease with the liquidity demand, or through predictable repayment costs based on constant rates. This is flexible and will allow the Mutuum Finance to attract conservative players and risk-takers. To its innovation it has added a buy-and-distribute mechanism. Part of platform charges is spent on buying MUTM tokens in the open market and reselling them, resulting in a persistent pressure on the buy side that directly relates the value of the token to the use of the platform. Gains for Early Participants In Phase 1, Mutuum Finance started its presale at the beginning of 2025 at 0.01. The token is currently in Phase 6 and has a price of $0.035 and has raised more than 15.4 million dollars and has over 16,100 holders onboard. Its initial issue price is pegged at $0.06, providing the existing investors with close to 100% upside by the day of listing, and those who entered during Phase 1 will have nearly 600% gains at the time of launch. To put it in perspective, a $1,000 investment at a current price of 0.035 would purchase approximately 28,600 tokens. That $1,000 investment would be worth approximately $1,700 at the time of launch, which is a $0.06 price. That initial investment might even increase to more than $7,000 when the token hits $0.25 after launch. The allocation would be over $28,000 with medium-term estimates of approximately $1.00 and over $70,000 with long-term estimates of 2.50 to 3.00 by the year 2030. This kind of path is reminiscent of the early years of Aave and Solana, both of which leveraged small investments into big fortunes. Why Analysts See MUTM as Next in Line The roadmap of the project also highlights that the goal of Mutuum Finance is long-term, sustainable development. Beta platform available at launch will provide utility on day one, whereas in the future Layer-2 will reduce fees and increase transaction speeds, making the protocol more scalable and affordable to a broader audience. Simultaneously, Mutuum Finance is developing an overcollateralized stablecoin which uses a mint-and-burn mechanism. This stablecoin has the potential to become a liquidity anchor in the ecosystem, which will lead to acceptance and MUTM token demand. To ensure the security of these mechanisms, the protocol will be based on Chainlink oracles with fallback mechanisms in place, which will provide accurate and reliable collateral values even in a volatile market. Combined, these characteristics reinforce the emphasis on scalability and liquidity, which are critical to long-term adoption at Mutuum Finance. Ethereum and Aave Characterized the Last Year, MUTM Could Characterize the Next. The utility, timing, and adoption have always been the key factors behind the story of crypto biggest winners. Smart contracts were introduced by Ethereum. Aave defined decentralized lending during the DeFi boom. Both rewarded early believers with extraordinary returns. But their size today means the days of 100x growth are behind them. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), on the other hand, is still in its infancy, combining affordable entry with powerful mechanics designed for adoption. Its dual lending markets, buy-and-distribute model, stablecoin plans, and launch-ready beta platform put it in a strong position to attract attention as the next breakout DeFi protocol. For analysts and investors alike, the message is becoming clear: Ethereum shaped the foundation, Aave built the lending era, and now Mutuum Finance could be next in line to carry DeFi into its future.

Both remain popular among the community, but investors are now questioning whether meme coins can make headway as newer projects come along with solutions to the real world. That focus shift has created space for alternatives like Remittix (RTX) , a PayFi initiative building pressure with its presale expansion and imminent beta wallet launch of Q3 2025. Shiba Inu And Pepe Coin Trading Figures Shiba Inu value is at $0.00001238, 1.13% up in the past day. Its market capitalization is at $7.3 billion with support from a $166.15 million trading volume, rising 9.18%. Pepe coin is at $0.059743, 1.63% higher in 24 hours. It possesses a $4.09 billion market capitalization and a $416.39 million trading volume, upward 2.28% per day. Despite these success stories, there is controversy regarding whether meme coins like Pepe coin or Shiba Inu Coin will be able to compete with low cap crypto gems and upcoming crypto projects oriented toward real-world application. Owners are now comparing traditional meme holdings with exposure to crypto staking, cross-chain DeFi capabilities, and low gas fee crypto transactions. Presale Growth And Exchange Listings For Remittix Remittix has sold over 645 million tokens, generating more than $23.8 million during its presale at $0.1030 per token. This establishes RTX as a likely winner of best crypto presale for 2025 and a name on most watchlists for the next big altcoin. As funding milestones were reached, listings on exchanges followed. With $20 million raised, Remittix reached its first listing on BitMart. Within a few weeks of surpassing $22 million, it provided a second centralized exchange partner, LBank, further expanding access and liquidity. These CEX announcements show how Remittix is distinguishing itself from a typical new crypto token launch. Beta Wallet Launch Set For Q3 2025 Among the most eagerly anticipated updates is the Remittix beta wallet coming this quarter. The wallet will serve as a bridge between traditional finance and crypto by enabling direct money transfers from digital assets to bank accounts in 30+ countries. At launch, it will support more than 40 cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat currencies, with real-time FX conversion built in. This focus on crypto with actual usage distinguishes Remittix from meme-coin tokens like Shiba Inu Coin and Pepe coin. It also places RTX among investors seeking the best DeFi projects of 2025 and best crypto under $1. What’s Driving Remittix’s Growing Momentum: • $23.8 million + raised, 645 million + tokens sold• Listings verified on LBank and BitMart• Q3 2025 release of beta wallet• Community giveaway of $250,000 underway Remittix DeFi initiative aims at solving global payment problems by offering a low gas fee cryptocurrency solution for freelancers, businesses, and remitters. By merging decentralized exchange features with centralized exchange access, RTX aims to be more than just another early-stage crypto investment.

Whale activity has added fuel, with a reactivated dormant whale moving 50,000 SOL and another whale transferring 3.6 million SOL worth $751 million to private wallets. Meanwhile, a new altcoin has emerged and is said to be poised to change the game in crypto payments. It has already begun to unveil its CEX listings, with BitMart and LBank announced so far. Solana Price Momentum Backed By Whales The technical setup shows Solana maintaining bullish footing while network upgrades boost adoption. Momentum traders are eyeing higher resistance levels as DeFi and NFT use cases on Solana expand. Still, with whales dominating moves, short-term volatility remains a factor. Forecasts suggest Solana could stretch toward $227 in September but faces downside risk if $200 support breaks. Source: TradingView While Solana continues to strengthen, investors seeking asymmetric upside are increasingly rotating into emerging PayFi plays. The comparison reflects a search for not just large-cap stability but the next 100x crypto with real-world applications. Remittix Is Leading the Pack as the Best Project of 2025 Remittix is the PayFi upstart making headlines, with whales and institutions accumulating ahead of its wallet beta reveal. The wallet, launching in Q3 2025, will enable crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries with FX conversion and sub-1% fees. At a token price of $0.103, Remittix has already raised over $23.8 million and sold more than 645 million tokens, securing listings on BitMart and LBank. Key points positioning Remittix as the dark horse of 2025 include: ● Utility First: Solves $19 trillion remittance inefficiencies with instant settlements● Trust Signals: CertiK audit and locked liquidity● Growth Catalysts: Beta wallet launch in September and further CEX listings● Community Backing: Rapid adoption with Ethereum whales leading the charge This Could Be the Project That Changes Everything Solana whales are showing conviction in the network’s stability, but many are also diversifying into Remittix for higher upside. Unlike meme tokens or niche DeFi experiments, Remittixcombines global payment rails with institutional-grade trust. The shift underlines why Remittix is the best crypto to buy right now and all signs point to Remittix becoming a common market fancy.

Old Const alleges that Bitmain Technologies Georgia Limited, a US affiliate of the company, terminated their hosting contract without an appropriate reason. It claims that Bitmain fabricated breaches of their agreement to terminate the partnership. In the lawsuit filings, Old Const wrote that Bitmain “fabricated purported breaches in order to terminate the agreement immediately.” The notice of termination, issued on August 22, is described by Old Const as a material and anticipatory breach of the parties’ contracts. Old Const seeks injunction against Bitmain Old Const signed a Hosting Services Agreement (HSA) with Bitmain in November 2024 to provide data center hosting for Bitmain’s HASH Super Computing Servers. The lawsuit also references additional agreements , including a Collaboration Agreement, a Sales Agreement, and an OnRack Sales & Purchase Agreement. All of which include clauses requiring disputes to be resolved in Texas courts or through arbitration in Houston. Old Const alleges that Bitmain went beyond simply ending the partnership and actually threatened to seek a court order, known as a “writ of replevin,” to seize its mining equipment. According to the complaint, Bitmain wants to obtain the order from a court outside of Texas. Since the HSA contract clearly requires that all legal disputes be handled in Texas, Old Const states that this move would violate the terms of their contract. The lawsuit filings say, “Despite the mandatory forum selection provisions, Bitmain has threatened to seek a writ of replevin or possession from a court outside of Texas, in violation of the HSA and the other agreements’ exclusive forum selection clauses.” To stop Bitmain from bypassing the agreed dispute process, Old Const is asking the court to issue a Temporary Restraining Order and an injunction. This would block Bitmain from obtaining any seizure order outside Texas. The hosting provider stresses that without an injunction, Bitmain could attempt to take away the essential mining equipment that Old Const depends on to continue operating. In addition, Old Const is also asking the court to confirm that the parts of the contract about handling disputes in Texas and through arbitration are valid. It wants the court to force Bitmain into arbitration for issues that don’t need urgent court orders. On top of that, Old Const is seeking money to cover its losses, plus extra costs caused by Bitmain’s actions, and it wants Bitmain to pay its legal fees. This is not the first time Bitmain has had a dispute with a hosting provider. Last year, Bitmain took JWKJ Technologies to court. It said the hosting provider broke their contract by failing to keep miners running 95% of the time. Bitmain also accused JWKJ of redirecting power for its own profit. When Bitmain tried to recover its equipment, JWKJ declined. The mining rigs maker accused JWKJ of illegally holding $15 million worth of mining equipment. Bitmain was founded by Chinese-born Singaporean billionaire Jihan Wu. In June, Cryptopolitan reported that Bitmain, along with other mining companies Canaan and MicroBT, is planning to build their mining rigs in the US to avoid Trump’s reciprocal tariffs. Last month, Bitmain sold 16,290 ASIC miners to the American Bitcoin Corp. for a staggering $314 million. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Against that backdrop, Remittix draws serious attention with a bold 50x ambition, energized by a $250,000 giveaway and a Q3 wallet beta launch scheduled for September 15. That pairing of meme coin pressure and PayFi promise frames a stark contrast. As markets digest Dogecoin’s downside risk and look for viable growth, Remittix’s monetization and whale interest are emerging as a compelling alternative for capital allocation. Dogecoin Faces Pressure Toward $0.15 As Momentum Fades Dogecoin is currently trading around $0.21 to $0.22, yet analysts warn that a drop below $0.15 is possible in September due to the continuing bearish trajectory. Further technical pressure comes from descending channels and fading whale activity, which could tilt Dogecoin’s outlook toward deeper pullbacks. Forecasts from earlier this year also flag that failing to hold support near $0.16 to $0.17 might tilt DOGE toward $0.15 or even lower. This technical fragility suggests Dogecoin’s meme-driven momentum may be waning, leaving investors to question its next move without fresh catalysts. Remittix Has Clarity and Monetization That Dogecoin Lacks While Dogecoin grapples with its plateau, Remittix offers a structured path forward focused on monetization, adoption, and a clear 50x narrative. Where Dogecoin relies on sentiment cycles and meme power, Remittix harnesses active incentives and product milestones to attract capital. Remittix has sold over 645 million tokens, trades at $0.103, and has raised in excess of $23.8 million in funding. Its trajectory includes a BitMart listing after passing $20 million, followed by an LBANK listing post $22 million, and preparations underway for a third exchange. That structured rollout contrasts with Dogecoin’s meme roots and gives Remittix a sharper appeal for those eyeing 50x potential. Here are five reasons Remittix draws investors where Dogecoin’s appeal now falters: ● Send crypto directly to bank accounts in 30+ countries● Deflationary tokenomics designed for long-term growth● Wallet beta launches this quarter with multi-currency support● Backed by working infrastructure, not vaporware● Mass market appeal beyond just the crypto crowd These features reinforce Remittix’s positioning as a monetized PayFi project, not a joke token, making it a timing advantage play that diverges sharply from Dogecoin. Dogecoin Slides as Remittix Offers Tangible Upside Dogecoin’s technical setup points to a deeper downside, with a likely dip below $0.15 on the horizon. In contrast, Remittix stands ready with a wallet launch on September 15 and a 50x growth story backed by strong fundraising and infrastructure. Where Dogecoin leans on nostalgia and sentiment, Remittix delivers real execution, market access, and monetisation. With capital flowing toward clarity and utility, Remittix may emerge as the dominant narrative over Dogecoin’s fading hype.

Many ADA holders feel frustrated as the token fails to break out of its tight range. Development work continues, but momentum is weak. Traders looking for faster gains are moving capital into projects with clearer near-term adoption paths. That shift is bringing Remittix (RTX) into view. Cardano Price Outlook Cardano trades near $0.83. Support rests at $0.80, resistance at $0.90. Analysts say ADA must clear $0.95 to retest $1. Lacking fresh adoption news or partnership updates, the token risks slipping back toward $0.80. The narrow range has trimmed momentum and lowered trader interest. Trading volume has fallen since earlier in the year, with both retail and institutional activity reduced. Long-term holders stay patiently on the roadmap progress. Short-term sentiment remains weak. Traders seeking higher gains are moving capital elsewhere. Remittix Gains Investor Focus While ADA moves sideways, Remittix has been making strides that excite both early adopters and new investors. Remittix has raised over $23.8 million in its presale, selling more than 645 million tokens. This level of demand shows clear investor confidence in the project’s direction. Unlike many tokens that pause after fundraising, RTX has moved fast by securing a live listing on BitMart and confirming an upcoming listing on LBank. These steps give investors liquidity and exposure through established exchanges. The real driver of interest is Remittix’s upcoming PayFi wallet, set for beta release in Q3 2025. This product is designed to support 40+ digital assets and enable crypto-to-fiat transfers across more than 30 countries. For freelancers and businesses, Remittix enables near-instant settlement, cutting down the delays and costs seen in traditional payment systems. This direct utility shows that the project is centered on real-world adoption instead of short-term speculation. Key Highlights of Remittix: ● Over $23.8M raised with over 645M tokens sold● Listed on BitMart, with LBank confirmed● Wallet beta in Q3 2025 for global PayFi use● Completed Certik audit with deflationary model● $250,000 community giveaway to expand reach Conclusion Cardano has slowed and continues to face resistance, leaving traders with little near-term upside. Its roadmap remains in progress, but the lack of momentum has reduced market interest. Remittix, on the other hand, is executing at speed. With over $23.8 million raised, confirmed exchange listings, and a PayFi wallet set to power real-world crypto-to-fiat payments, RTX is gaining investor trust. It offers utility, growth potential, and stronger momentum than ADA, which is why many rank it as the best crypto opportunity today.

While Dogecoin’s community-driven rallies remain influential, analysts warn that its upside may be capped without deeper utility. At the same time, a new PayFi altcoin, Remittix (RTX) , is gaining traction, with experts suggesting it could deliver the kind of life-changing gains DOGE once promised. Experts Debate Dogecoin Price Prediction Scenarios Dogecoin is once again showing why it remains one of the most talked-about meme coins. DOGE Price today sits at $0.216, slightly higher on the day, with buyers defending the critical $0.21 support zone. Analysts say this area has repeatedly been a launchpad for bullish moves, making it a key level to watch in the latest Dogecoin news. Chart watchers point to a developing cup-and-handle pattern, a bullish formation that could propel DOGE Price Prediction targets to $0.30 in the short term. Longer-term outlooks go even further, with some analysts eyeing a run toward $1 if momentum accelerates. Such a move would reestablish Dogecoin as a frontrunner in the meme coin market. Despite a recent 900 million DOGE transfer to Binance, strong buying interest quickly stabilized Dogecoin Price, signaling that retail and institutional players remain engaged. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows neutral momentum, giving DOGE room to climb, while holding above the 200-day SMA confirms structural strength. September is shaping up to be a decisive month. If bulls can push Dogecoin Price Prediction levels past $0.24, it opens the door to $0.30 and beyond. While experts debate whether DOGE can eventually rally toward $1, investors are also eyeing new altcoins like Remittix, which some suggest could deliver life-changing gains with its PayFi use case. Utility Driven Demand Sets Remittix Apart From DOGE Remittix is carving a place for itself in crypto by solving a problem that meme coins like Dogecoin have never addressed. Instead of relying on social hype, the PayFi project is tackling the inefficiencies of international transfers. By converting crypto directly into fiat for deposit in any global bank account, it removes the long delays and costly fees that plague traditional systems. That real-world use case is why traders are flocking in. So far, the numbers speak for themselves. More than $24,2 million has been raised, with over 649 million tokens sold at a current price of $0.1050. Early investors have already seen gains of nearly 380% compared to the opening price of $0.015. Unlike Dogecoin News cycles that swing on community memes, Remittix is drawing interest from utility-driven buyers, including large DOGE holders searching for tokens with stronger growth potential. Over $24,9 million raised with heavy investor interest More than 649 million tokens sold to date Early supporters gained 380% since the presale began Major DOGE wallets participated in the Remittix token sale This demand underscores why analysts predict RTX could deliver 15x growth after listings begin in April. As DOGE fights to defend the $0.20 level, Remittix is emerging as the stronger play for those chasing life-changing gains in 2025.

In a Sunday post on X, Ardoino confirmed that the company “didn’t sell any Bitcoin” and reiterated its strategy of allocating profits into assets such as Bitcoin, gold, and land. The comments addressed speculation by YouTuber Clive Thompson, who cited Tether’s Q1 and Q2 2025 attestation data from BDO. Thompson suggested a reduction in Tether’s BTC holdings from 92,650 in Q1 to 83,274 in Q2 indicated a sell-off. However, Samson Mow, CEO of Jan3, clarified that the apparent decline was due to Tether transferring 19,800 BTC to a separate initiative called Twenty One Capital (XXI). This transfer included 14,000 BTC in June and another 5,800 BTC in July, meaning Tether’s net Bitcoin holdings actually increased when accounted for. In early June, Tether moved more than 37,000 BTC, valued at around $3.9 billion, to support XXI, a Bitcoin-native financial platform led by Strike CEO Jack Mallers. “Tether would have had 4,624 BTC more than at the end of Q1 if the transfer is accounted for,” Mow explained. Ardoino emphasized that the Bitcoin was moved, not sold, adding, “While the world continues to get darker, Tether will continue to invest part of its profits into safe assets.” Tether, which issues the USDT stablecoin, now holds over 100,521 BTC, valued at approximately $11.17 billion according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. El Salvador Diversifies into Gold Tether’s Bitcoin rumors coincided with El Salvador announcing its first gold acquisition since 1990. The Central American nation added 13,999 troy ounces of gold, worth $50 million, to its foreign reserves as part of a diversification strategy to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar. Previously, El Salvador built a $700 million Bitcoin reserve, holding 6,292 BTC, but a July IMF report indicated no new Bitcoin purchases since February. Ardoino’s statements aimed to reassure investors that Tether continues to hold and strategically allocate its cryptocurrency assets rather than liquidate them for other investments. This clarification comes amid ongoing scrutiny of stablecoin issuers’ holdings and their role in the broader crypto ecosystem. Tether’s approach reflects a mix of traditional and digital assets, balancing Bitcoin, gold, and real estate to manage risk and maintain liquidity.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|USDT|FIAT|BTG,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-09-07 17:59:35

Here's Why",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/09/best-altcoins-to-buy-now-according-to-chatgpt-are-litecoin-remittix-bonk-heres-why,"The emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) has provided a new way for crypto analysts to provide accurate market analysis and forecast price movements, a valuable skill in peak periods such as the ongoing bull market. After prompting ChatGPT, one of the most popular generative AI machines in the world, analysts have discovered that Litecoin, Bonk, and Remittix may be the best altcoins to buy right now. Litecoin and Bonk are both popular and renowned altcoins, although in different crypto categories. Remittix , on the other hand, is an upcoming PayFi project that has recently caught the attention of spectators within the industry due to its unique position at the intersection of traditional and blockchain-based payments. ChatGPT Lists Litecoin and Bonk As the Best Altcoins To Buy In the Ongoing Bull Market As with other technology verticals, AI has now found a use case in the crypto and blockchain space as a prediction engine. When prompted about what cryptocurrencies were the best altcoins to buy amid the ongoing bull market, the machine provided two unlikely names: Litecoin and Bonk. As far as market veterans go, Litecoin is up there as one of the most renowned and popular cryptocurrencies on the market. It has a decent circulating supply and has been tapped in the past as a payment vehicle for everyday purchases. If ChatGPT is right, the token could make a huge comeback in the market, generating massive returns for token holders. Bonk, on the other hand, is one of the top meme coins that have failed to meet expectations in the ongoing bull market due to what analysts have dubbed “meme coin fatigue”, as investors have preferred to explore other crypto categories like payments this time around. Remittix Crosses Latest Milestone As Token Generation Event Draws Closer Remittix , the upcoming PayFi project that has caught the eye of crypto spectators recently, has crossed a new milestone in its ongoing presale, surging past the $24 million mark. With this achievement, the project could be nearing its long-awaited token generation event. Several centralized exchanges have already announced that they will list the token when it launches, including BitMart and LBank. Remittix has gained a massive following in the crypto industry thanks to its unique position at the intersection of traditional and blockchain-powered payment solutions. The project is set to feature innovative and eye-catching features and services, such as: ● Direct crypto-to-bank transfers in over 30 countries worldwide● 20% referral rewards for onboarding new users ● Support for 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies Discover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their project here: Website: https://remittix.io/ Socials: https://linktr.ee/remittix $250,000 Giveaway: https://gleam.io/competitions/nz84L-250000-remittix-giveaway Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

AVAX exhibited wild price swings this year. This record came as the crypto market valuation peaked. It later reversed, shedding some of the profits later in the year. While the Avalanche ecosystem has been making strides, the AVAX price has left investors particularly questioning its trajectory. Will AVAX go up? Is AVAX a good investment? Let’s explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction from 2025 to 2031.

Its trading volume, however, dropped (-2.07%), showing less trader conviction in the market trend. AVAX/USD 1-day chart analysis AVAXUSD chart by TradingView Last month, AVAX attempted a recovery, which saw it rise from a low of $19.09 to a high of $27.38. It faced strong resistance at its 30-day macro supply zone ($27.00-$27.38), a level that triggered 3 rejections since March 2025. AVAX attempted again this month and managed to reach $25, outpacing the wider crypto market. The William Alligator trendlines show that its volatility has dropped. The histograms (-0.00) show positive momentum. AVAX/USD 4-hour chart analysis AVAXUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart highlights AVAX’s run with strong support at $22.25.

Technical analysis suggests that Avalanche is bullish. It should move upwards over the short term. Recent news Filecoin Foundation and Avalanche have partnered to launch a new cross-chain data bridge. The bridge will allow developers to build on Avalanche’s C-Chain to store data on Filecoin’s decentralized network. Why is AVAX up? AVAX is up after correcting from July’s low. AVAX value could be attributed to the general market sentiment and technical overextension. Will AVAX reach $50? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX crossed the $50 mark in 2027. Will AVAX reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX will reach $100 in 2028, with a maximum price of $106.00 for the year. Can Avalanche reach $1,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $1,000 mark before 2031. At that market capitalization, it could be more valuable than Ethereum. Can Avalanche reach $10,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $10,000 mark before 2031. How much will Avalanche be worth in 2025? As the second half of 2025 unfolds, we anticipate it will trade between $19.06 and $33.36, with an average price of $29.46. Does Avalanche have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, AVAX will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or negative regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is Avalanche a good crypto to buy? Chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is recovering and currently gearing up for a closer move to $27 despite the overall bearish momentum.

Avalanche historic price sentiment Avalanche price history by CoinGecko In July 2020, Avalanche completed its public sale, raising $42 million in less than $4.5 hours. The tokens were distributed after the mainnet launch in September. On Dec 31, 2020, it fell to an all-time low of $2.788. In September 2021, the Ava Labs Foundation received a $230 million investment from Polychain and Three Arrows Capital Group by purchasing the AVAX cryptocurrency. In November 2021, following an agreement with Deloitte to improve US disaster relief funding, AVAX moved to the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. At that time, AVAX moved to its all-time high at $146.22. In Aug 2022, a whistleblower, ‘crypto leaks’, published a report accusing Ava Labs of secret deals with a law firm to destabilize its competitors. Ava Labs CEO Emin Gün Sirer denied any involvement in a shady deal with the Roche Freedman law firm. In 2023, AVAX maintained a bullish trend from January to May, after which bears took control of the market. It resumed the positive momentum in October, rising to $49.96 In 2024, it crossed the $60 mark in March. The rise coincided with a record high in AVAX inscriptions, with over 100 million ASC-20 minted since their introduction in June 2023. The uptrend reversed in April 2024; by July, it had fallen to $24.40. In August, it was at $21, and in September and October, it was at $27. It turned bullish in November 2024, rising from as low as $23 to as high as $55 in December. It later corrected and traded at $42 into 2025. The drop continued into January; by June, it had fallen below $20.

The move surprised many traders as volumes surged across exchanges within minutes. The sudden rise occurred after weeks of muted performance, suggesting a combination of macroeconomic anticipation and direct market orderflow contributed to the sharp upturn. Rate Cut Expectations Driving Sentiment Much of the current optimism centers on the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting scheduled for September 17 . Market participants are pricing in with near certainty that the Fed will reduce interest rates. Current data shows a probability of over 99% that a 25-basis-point cut will occur, with some speculation that a 50-basis-point reduction could be considered. A rate cut would ease financial conditions, lower the cost of capital, and likely weaken the dollar, all of which historically create a favorable environment for digital assets such as XRP. Institutional and retail traders from across the financial world have positioned themselves in advance of this decision, showing the degree to which the market has aligned around this policy outcome. The strength of this consensus has spilled over into crypto markets, where XRP has been among the more responsive tokens. Orderflow Adds to Momentum Dom (@traderview2), an analyst specializing in orderflow and market microstructure, also highlighted the magnitude of today’s move with detailed charts. He reported that XRP experienced “+10M XRP net buy pressure in 15 minutes,” a surge that lifted spot prices across major exchanges in unison. The speed of the accumulation, alongside the backdrop of rate-cut anticipation, created conditions for the price to push through the $2.85 range and challenge $2.90 once again. The chart he shared showed a rapid rise in cumulative volume delta, confirming that aggressive buyers dominated the order book. This activity added a short-term catalyst on top of the broader macro narrative, showing how technical flows and fundamental expectations converged to produce the breakout. $XRP just decided to send on this Sunday morning Any news? +10M $XRP net buy pressure in 15 minutes pic.twitter.com/4etRddPZUs — Dom (@traderview2) September 7, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Outlook for September 17 The Federal Reserve’s decision is critical to XRP’s momentum. A confirmed 25-basis-point cut would validate current market pricing and could provide continued support for XRP, potentially repeating its performance following rate cuts of September 2024 . The breakout from the consolidation phase shows that the market is ready for the Fed’s decision. If it were to surprise the market with a larger cut, the effect could amplify, potentially driving XRP toward new heights.

The exchange has increased its reserves significantly this year, signaling strong market confidence in both its platform and in digital dollar assets. This expansion at Binance reflects a broader trend across the sector, as stablecoin liquidity on centralized exchanges has reached a record $68 billion. The milestone underscores the growing importance of stablecoins in facilitating trades and hedging strategies. It also highlights their role in supporting broader market activity within the crypto ecosystem. Binance Leads in Stablecoin Reserves According to a CryptoQuant report , Binance holds the largest portion of stablecoin reserves, totaling $44.2 billion in USDT and USDC combined. The on-chain aggregator noted that USDT dominates at $37.1 billion. USDC has grown from $3 billion at the start of 2025 to $7.1 billion today. Overall, Binance’s total stablecoin holdings have increased 48% so far this year, reflecting strong inflows and active user engagement. Other major exchanges hold smaller but still notable amounts. OKX maintains $9.0 billion in stablecoins, Bybit holds $4.2 billion, and Coinbase $2.6 billion. While their balances have remained mostly flat this year, these exchanges collectively account for 24% of total exchange-based stablecoin reserves. Their holdings span multiple blockchain networks, including Ethereum and TRON. Notably, recent growth in stablecoin reserves has been most pronounced on Binance and OKX. Over the past month, Binance added $2.2 billion, while OKX increased its holdings by $800 million. Analysts suggest these inflows reflect investor confidence and the strategic use of stablecoins to manage liquidity during periods of market volatility. This trend also highlights the central role these exchanges play in the market. Why Do Exchanges Hold So Many Stablecoins? High stablecoin reserves give exchanges the flexibility to facilitate large trades without affecting prices and enable rapid movement of capital for traders and institutions. They also act as a barometer of market sentiment, with rising balances indicating growing market readiness and hedging activity. This concentration of stablecoins on major exchanges, particularly Binance , highlights how central these platforms have become in the crypto ecosystem. With $68 billion now held across top exchanges, stablecoins play an increasingly critical role in liquidity management, trading, and risk mitigation.

According to a report by CEX.io, stablecoin transaction volumes for last month also significantly outranked last year’s total. This suggests that the crypto niche has seen a significant rebound within the last one year. Stablecoin Transfer Volume Outranked Previous Record In August, transactions under $250, also known as retail-sized transfers, pulled in more than $5.84 billion. This is the highest value that has ever been recorded, per Visa and Allium which were cited in the report. There are still about four months left for this year to end and 2025 is already the busiest period for stablecoins, particularly for transfer volume at the level of the consumer. It is clear that stablecoins have found more use cases in day-to-day financial activities, which cuts across cross-border remittances to micro transactions. 2,600 Consumer Shares Take on Stablecoins CEX.io analysts shared data from a survey that was conducted recently with respondents from Nigeria, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Indonesia. All of these respondents shared their different reasons for adopting stablecoins and their future expectations for the crypto asset tied to fiat currency. A major percent of the 2,600 consumers claimed that they turned to stablecoins to evade high banking fees and slow transfers. About 70% of the survey respondents said they have used stablecoins more frequently this year compared to the previous year. More than three-quarters of consumers are anticipating a continuous rise in the usage of stablecoins. China and Europe: For or Against Stablecoins? Regions like China are working on issuing their stablecoin to facilitate international payments . In a conference, China’s state-owned energy company, PetroChina, hinted at this plan, citing that it would be instrumental to simplifying and modifying cross-border transactions. There is also the possibility that it will reduce dependence on traditional banks. Despite the growing stablecoin adoption, some jurisdictions still have concerns about the asset class. President of the European Central Bank (ECB) Christine Lagarde recently warned about the liquidity risks that stablecoin assets could pose. She pointed to the gap in the availability of quick and strong regulations, citing that these digital assets might destabilize financial markets across the European Union (EU). Currently, there is the GENIUS Act and the MiCA regulation , which could impact positively on the stablecoin ecosystem.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Price Predictions Point to Explosive Upside Potential,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/next-big-crypto-after-solana-and-aave-mutuum-finance-mutm-price-predictions-point-to-explosive-upside-potential/,"Each market cycle generates breakout tokens, the defining feature of whole cryptocurrency eras, and a way to give early adopters an exponential payout. Previously, such names as Solana (SOL) and Aave (AAVE) were hardly recognized but soon became multibillion-dollar giants. Their achievements have evolved into case studies of how adoption, utility and timing interact to produce revolutionary outcomes. The same question is being raised by investors however the tokens are growing older and their growth is slow because of the massive market caps: what comes next? What is the next protocol that integrates innovation, scalability, and utility in a manner that will be able to grab the market and generate the same level of upside that Solana and Aave did? Due to that search, analysts and traders are currently examining fresh projects that blend price with practical tasks; these undertakings can be the next center of focus of decentralized financing. Solana & Aave Solana (SOL) is one of the primary, low-cost, high-speed blockchain players. SOL is at a price of approximately $207, an increase of approximately 65 percent annually, but still a long way off its all-time high of $293 reached in January 2025. In 2021-2022, SOL early holders were rewarded handsomely, 50-100x returns were frequent. But that type of upside is incredibly remote with Solana having a market capitalization of more than $110 billion. Aave (AAVE), the pioneer in DeFi lending, is a good example of the same trend. AAVE is now trading at an all-time low of around $308, which is over 50 percent lower than the high but it continues to make a big difference in the lending business. Those who jumped in at the very beginning made a lot of money in its breakout, however, the growth ceiling has since reduced drastically. The key conclusion is that, although they still hold significance as DeFi assets, their size is now a limiting factor to upside. Consequently, attention is being given as of now to new initiatives that have a strong foundation and a higher probability of making profit. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi protocol in its infancy, is designed around two lending markets: peer-to-contract (P2C) pools that issue interest-paying mtTokens and peer-to-peer (P2P) borrowing with variable or fixed rate instruments. So far, the presale has already raised more than $15.4 million, and more than 16,100 holders participated. The token is inexpensive and has a lot of upside potential, at only $0.035. Even the initial investors are likely to receive returns of nearly 100 percent because the official launch price is pegged at $0.06. Analysts are estimating the value of the token to rise to $0.25 when the beta platform is launched. It may easily hit $2 by 2026 with a sustained adoption. Scaling and Beta Launch Built In Adoption One of the interesting points about the roadmap of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the plan to release the beta platform at the same time as the token. This means that users can immediately create lending and borrowing money. Most tokens typically roll out the token and begin to deliver real value many months or years down the line. MUTM beta rollout, on the contrary, demonstrates usability immediately and this is what builds trust, attracts liquidity, and ensures that the protocol is not merely a theory. Another major milestone in the roadmap of Mutuum Finance is the planned integration with a scaling solution based on Layer-2. On top of the Ethereum core network, Layer-2 systems such as Arbitrum, Optimism, or zkSync are available that incur significantly lower transaction costs and faster confirmation times without compromising security. This scalability is especially important to lending and borrowing protocols since slow or expensive transactions deter users and decrease liquidity. Moving key operations to Layer-2, Mutuum Finance will ensure that users are able to provide, borrow, and sell assets on a timely and cost-effective basis. Consequently, institutional players that require efficiency at scale and sensitive retail participants who are sensitive to gas charges are increasingly interested in the protocol. With Layer-2 integration, which is also fast and cheap, MUTM can scale across chains and potentially tap into liquidity in other ecosystems. Mutuum Finance is unique because it plans to start with live beta and later add Layer-2 scalability. To realize long-term growth and adoption, it tells users and investors that the project is designed to be scaled. Mutuum Finance can be the next DeFi Leader. Lending protocols need safe price feeds. Mutuum Finance is a Chainlink oracle-based framework, fallback-supported, and optionally time-weighted DEX, to provide safe liquidation and fair collateral valuation. In addition to being highly committed to security, MUTM has demonstrated this commitment by establishing a bug bounty program and conducting a CertiK audit. The most successful stories of crypto – Solana, Aave, and Compound, had one thing in common: they fulfilled essential requirements with utility, found their usage, and compensated the early founders who invested at the time when the network was just starting to develop. Mutuum Finance, though being much earlier in its development, is also premised on a similar framework. The MUTM enables long-term momentum and utility with its two lending markets, integrated stablecoin design, beta platform launch, embedded token demand generated by buy-back mechanisms, and security structure. It provides a unique mix of cost-effectiveness, innovation and adoption opportunities to investors who wish to make their next big move. Mutuum Finance would become the defining de-fi token of the next cycle, unlike SOL and AAVE, which exist and cannot grow as much. MUTM currently has all the ingredients to be a pillar of the next wave of decentralized finance due to its strategic implementation and increasing traction.

With on-chain accumulation skyrocketing and leading financial institutions raising forecasts, ETH continues to stand out. Speculative tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE is also gaining momentum for risk-forward investors looking for narrative-driven alternatives. Institutions Fuel Bullish Outlook Toward $7,500 Standard Chartered hiked its year-end price target on Ethereum to $7,500, from $4,000, on increasing institutional interest and increasing treasury activity. The bank anticipates supply to flee as ETFs and corporate holdings continue to grow. Indeed, since June, treasuries and ETFs have bought almost 5% of available ETH, creating what the bank calls a “feedback loop” to drive prices higher. On-chain data reinforces this narrative. Eth ETFs saw a record of $4 billion in net inflows in Q2 2025 – the first time they overtook bitcoin ETFs. Standard Chartered isn’t the only voice making such a prediction: Wallet Investor and InvestingHaven both see year-end numbers in the $7,000-to-$7,500 range at this point. On-Chain Accumulation and Staking Strengthen Fundamentals Institutional investors continue stacking ETH. In August, roughly 1.5 million ETH–valued at $8 billion–were acquired, marking a historic accumulation run. This followed a 9.3% growth in megawhale holdings since late 2024, combined with $515 million in large transfers. Meanwhile, staking yields ranging from 4.5 to 5.2% are attracting further lockups, reinforced by regulatory clarity around stablecoins. Core macro tailwinds and DeFi expansion underpin a structural narrative that supports elevated price levels. Technical Signals Align with the $7,500 Scenario Technical analysis also supports an upside case. ETH, near $4,730, has a bull flag set up with having strong ETF support and a tight supply, all of which will keep the breakout very strong. The dip correction around $4,150 has been seen as a healthy-looking pause, rather than a trend reversal. Based on historical trends, a breakout is likely to take ETH toward $6,000 and $7,500 if accumulation remains the same. Pullbacks are a buying opportunity on the bigger bull cycle, according to Standard Chartered. MAGACOIN FINANCE Draws Speculative Buzz Despite its institutionally sanctioned support and fundamentals, Ethereum-style narrative-driven tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are still evolving in certain respects. Previous play involved seeking the upside of the ad support & community enthusiasm it would create. MAGACOIN FINANCE is an active BTC- and YFI-backed alternative to pegged value for the speculator community. Conclusion Ethereum’s path to $7,500 before 2022. A combination of institutional inflows, staking yields, network development, and technical setup is leading speculators and analysts to draw a road map to $7,500 for Ethereum (ETH) before 2022 starts. With universal accumulation and ETF demand, Ethereum is positioned in a highly favored place for further upside.

According to Peterson, historical data suggests that September 8 was one of the worst days for Bitcoin. The analyst stated, “Bitcoin has an average 53% chance of rising on any given day, with a typical gain of around 0.10%. However, the situation is different on September 8th. That day closed down 72% of the time, with an average loss of 1.30%. This makes September 8th the seventh worst day of the year.” Related News: What's the Latest on the Altcoin Season Index? Has the Altcoin Bull Run Begun? Peterson also argued that September 8th is a key indicator not only for daily performance but also for the entire month of September. He noted that historical data shows that a positive close on September 8th means there's a 75% chance Bitcoin will close the month higher, while a negative close means there's a 90% chance the month will end lower. Experts remind investors that these statistics can offer clues in understanding short-term market direction, but they should not be considered investment advice alone. *This is not investment advice.

Here are the critical levels to watch out for over the next few weeks. Where Are The Next Support Levels For BTC? On Saturday, September 6, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez took to the social media platform X to offer on-chain insights into the current layout of the Bitcoin price. This price evaluation, which revolves around the BTC UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) metric, shows the next support levels for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Treasury Purchases Down Amid Record Holdings – What Does This Mean? The capacity for a price level to act as an on-chain support or resistance zone usually depends on the number of investors who have their cost basis at the given level. An investor’s cost basis refers to the actual price at which they purchased a cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, in this case). The relevant indicator here—UTXO Realized Price Distribution—tracks the amount of a particular cryptocurrency that was acquired at a specific price level. Typically, price levels below the current spot value with substantial buying activity are often considered as major support zones. Meanwhile, levels above the current price with significant investor cost bases usually act as major resistance areas. As shown in the chart above, $108,250, $104,250, and $97,050 are the next crucial support levels for the Bitcoin price. Data from Glassnode shows that nearly 432,000 coins were bought in the $108,250 zone, while roughly 401,000 coins were purchased around the $104,250 region. Meanwhile, 404,000 BTC were acquired around the $97,054 area. The rationale behind this is that investors with a cost basis around these price levels are likely to double down on their positions and purchase more coins. This increased buying activity will, hence, provide a cushion for the Bitcoin price to stay afloat and potentially bounce back. It’s worth mentioning that the next major resistance level for the Bitcoin price based on the URPD metric is around $116,963. Several investors (550,000 coins) around this level are likely to close their positions when the price returns to its cost basis, thereby putting downward pressure on the BTC price. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $110,628, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the premier cryptocurrency is up by more than 1% in the past seven days.

However, recent trends in real-world asset tokenization have introduced a new perspective that shifts the focus on XRP from banking corridors to property markets. In a recent video shared on the social media platform X, crypto commentator Armando Pantoja argued that real estate could become the catalyst for XRP’s next major rally, even suggesting the XRP price could climb to $79 as blockchain adoption reshapes the housing sector. Real Estate On The Blockchain Tokenization of real-world assets on blockchain goes as far back as the 2021 bull market, but this trend is now really starting to take root due to institutional investors flocking into the industry in recent months. In his video, Pantoja highlighted several real-world examples to illustrate how blockchain is transforming the property market. For instance, in New Jersey, more than 370,000 property records are being moved onto the blockchain. This is a sign that government agencies are beginning to embrace this new technology. He also pointed to BlackRock’s efforts to tokenize $10 trillion in assets, calling it infrastructure rather than a passing Web3 trend. Interestingly, the momentum is not limited to institutional players. An example of this is a case from Texas where a $235,000 home was fractionalized into tokens and sold to 38 investors, raising $246,000 in the process. Many of the participants had never used crypto before, yet they were able to set up digital wallets, buy in, and now receive weekly rent payments in USDC. XRP’s Role In Tokenizing Real Estate Asset Market Real estate is the largest asset class in the world, valued at trillions of dollars. According to Statista, the real estate market worldwide is expected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion by 2025. However, its infrastructure has long been plagued by inefficiency, high costs, and paperwork-heavy processes. Pantoja noted how XRP could play an important role in bringing liquidity and global accessibility to the sector. A prime example of this is in Dubai, where title deeds are already being recorded on the XRP Ledger. This offers a glimpse of how blockchain could make property ownership as easy to trade as stocks. According to Pantoja, this shift is more than just technological hype. By 2030, real estate tokenization is projected to reach $16 trillion, and Ripple’s position as a trusted partner for regulators, banks, and governments may allow XRP to become the bridge asset that underpins this transformation. If real estate markets begin to migrate to blockchain at scale, the demand for XRP as a settlement layer could rise dramatically, and we might see the XRP price rise to $79 and easily into $100 and beyond.

The framework he presents illustrates a progression from bank-level settlement to the tokenization of global assets, suggesting that XRP’s value is best understood not as speculative hype but as a direct function of liquidity demand. Global Liquidity and Market Scale The financial system today processes volumes that far surpass those of the current cryptocurrency sector. The Bank for International Settlements reports that daily foreign-exchange turnover reached $7.5 trillion in 2022, underlining the scale of liquidity moving between jurisdictions. Equity markets are valued at more than $120 trillion globally, while fixed-income markets also measure in the tens of trillions. Against this backdrop, the prospect of XRP intermediating even a marginal share of these flows provides context for the valuations suggested in Pumpius’ model. HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED? What’s the true price potential of XRP if adoption goes all the way? From banks to central banks, from corporations to capital markets and beyond into genomic identity. Here’s the ladder pic.twitter.com/TDWECRNRtB — Pumpius (@pumpius) September 6, 2025 Regulatory and Institutional Readiness Institutional integration is contingent upon regulatory clarity and infrastructure that meets compliance standards. Ripple has moved to position itself within this framework by launching RLUSD, a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin introduced in December 2024 for enterprise settlement and liquidity operations. The resolution of Ripple vs. the SEC case cleared the regulatory uncertainty that has beclouded XRP in the past few years. These dynamics are critical, as regulatory certainty would dictate whether banks and corporates can adopt XRP at scale. Examining the Adoption Scenarios Pumpius outlines a continuum of adoption scenarios. If Ripple were to secure a U.S. banking license enabling custody, stablecoins, treasuries, and tokenized assets, XRP could realistically move toward $50 per token. Expansion into corporate treasuries and multinational supplier networks could elevate flows to the trillions annually, pushing XRP plausibly to $100. In the banking sphere, correspondent flows of $6.6 trillion daily mean that routing even 5 percent through XRPL would create unprecedented liquidity demands, supporting a valuation of $1,000 or higher. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Central bank integration, with CBDCs using XRP as a neutral bridge for 10 percent of the global FX market, would represent roughly $750 billion daily, a scale that could propel valuations toward $10,000 and beyond. Further out, the tokenization of more than $100 trillion in securities could justify prices around $100,000. A genomic identity protocol anchored on XRPL, addressing the vast KYC and verification market, could logically push valuations to $1,000,000 per token. Full tokenization of humanity, including global real estate worth $300 trillion and derivatives exceeding $1 quadrillion, could reprice XRP toward $10,000,000. At the furthest edge, a “cosmic settlement layer” facilitating interplanetary trade envisions XRP reaching an extraordinary $1,000,000,000 per unit. Function Over Hype The unifying principle across these scenarios is that XRP’s potential valuation is directly proportional to the scale of liquidity it intermediates. Unlike purely speculative assets, its design as a bridge for value transmission means that demand is derived from function. This framework highlights the importance of institutional adoption, regulatory certainty, and technological integration as the decisive factors that will determine whether XRP achieves such outcomes. Final Thoughts Pumpius’ projections are ambitious, ranging from plausible near-term integration in banking and corporate finance to futuristic visions of planetary and interplanetary settlement. Yet the central message is pragmatic: XRP’s long-term value will be set not by short-term trading sentiment but by the extent to which it becomes embedded in the core infrastructure of global finance.

An Official Statement Has Been Released,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/are-the-claims-that-tether-sold-bitcoin-and-bought-gold-true-an-official-statement-has-been-released/,"Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino stated in a statement on social media platform X that the company did not sell any Bitcoin and that the news that it converted its BTC assets into gold did not reflect the truth. Ardoino argued that some Bitcoin assets were allocated to Tether’s XXI initiative, but that the company would otherwise continue to invest its profits in safe assets, namely Bitcoin, gold, and land investments. The allegations in question came to light after analyst Clive Thompson reviewed Tether's audit reports. Thompson claimed the company's BTC holdings were declining, suggesting a shift to gold. However, analyst Samson Mow clarified the situation by stating that this interpretation was based on incomplete data. According to the data shared by Mow, the company's assets are: First Quarter 2025 (as of March 31): 92,650 BTC Second Quarter 2025 (as of June 30): 83,274 BTC However, during this period, Tether allocated a total of 19,800 BTC for the XXI initiative. Mow stated that when evaluated with this data, the company actually increased its net BTC assets: At the end of the second quarter, Tether had a 4,624 BTC surplus compared to the first quarter. Including the July transfer, there's a net increase of at least 10,424 BTC. It seems everyone is looking for negative news for Bitcoin, but the company looks mega-bullish on all indicators. Paolo Ardoino confirmed this statement, saying, “As Samson stated, Tether simply transferred some of its assets to XXI. While the world becomes increasingly darker, we will continue to invest our profits in safe assets like Bitcoin, gold, and land. Tether is a safe company.” *This is not investment advice.

On CBS’ Face the Nation , Kevin said flat out, “The question is, has the current central bank been as independent as we would like, as transparent as we would like? And I think there’s some dispute about that.” This guy is the Director of the National Economic Council and one of Trump’s longest-serving economic advisers. And he’s telling you that the Fed is drifting into dangerous waters. He’s backing calls for a full, nonpartisan review of the Fed’s current role in regulation, monetary policy, and even research. And yeah, he fully agrees with the Wall Street Journal piece by Treasury Secretary Bessent that accused the central bank of serious “mission creep.” Kevin questions labor data and inflation expectations Before he even got to the Fed, Kevin slammed the current jobs data as unreliable garbage. “They had the biggest revisions in 50 years over the summer,” he said, pointing to the 22,000 new jobs reported for August. But that’s just the payroll survey. The household survey for the same month showed 288,000. “They should have the same answer,” Kevin said. “What’s wrong with the data is that people aren’t filling out the forms and sending in the surveys.” He said the way jobs data is collected is outdated and misleading. “We’ve got to modernize the way we do the labor data,” he argued. He mentioned private firms like Homebase, which reported 150,000 jobs in August, again showing a major disconnect. And it’s not just the jobs numbers. Kevin said he’s skeptical of all the labor-related data right now. Asked if he believes the models and revisions, he said, “No. The point is when there’s dissonance in data that you have to sort of watch how it all works out.” While second-quarter GDP was revised up to 3.3%, and the Atlanta Fed projects 3% for Q3, manufacturing jobs are still down. Kevin asked: “How is it that industrial production is at an all-time high while manufacturing employment is down?” He blamed flawed surveys and added that last year’s benchmark revision changed over a million jobs. He also responded to concerns about inflation. “It was in the high threes when President Trump took office,” he said. “The average over the last six months is 1.9.” Futures markets show that the Fed is expected to cut interest rates three times this year, which, according to him, means the Fed believes inflation is under control. Kevin warns against politicized data and fed overreach Asked about President Trump firing the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief, Kevin said there are “patterns in the data that look like political bias,” but they could be unintentional. “We need to get a new set of eyes in there to make sure that things are more transparent, that we modernize the surveys,” he said. When asked if he trusted the numbers, he said clearly: “I think the BLS numbers need to really be improved.” He talked about immigration too. “Private sector employment is up by about half a million this year,” he said. Unemployment claims are also telling. “About 80% of the claims for unemployment over the last few months have come from blue states,” he said. Cities like Portland and Chicago are seeing people leave, and it’s showing up in the data. When Brennan brought up polling showing that 70% of Americans want the Fed to operate independently from Trump, Kevin didn’t hesitate. “If I were in that survey, I would say 100% that Fed monetary policy needs to be fully independent of political influence,” he said. “Including from President Trump.” He said letting politicians run central banks is a recipe for disaster. “What tends to happen is that it’s a recipe for inflation and misery for consumers.” That line right there? That’s the entire case for an independent Fed. Brennan kept pressing. Did he have a plan to fix the Fed? “I don’t have a plan to overhaul the Fed right now,” he said. “I’m just happy to do my job.” But he admitted he talks to the president “about everything from golf to decorating the Oval Office to monetary policy.” And when asked if he’d implement Bessent’s proposed vision for the Fed, Kevin replied, “Yes, I agree with this article.” Kevin didn’t deny being interested in the chair role, but he didn’t confirm it either. “It’s a hypothetical that we’ll see.” But with Trump hinting about putting him in charge, and with Kevin already laying out what’s broken, this looks less like a hypothetical and more like a preview.

While XRP remains a stalwart of cross-border payments controversy, controversies regarding X increasingly put the limelight on Remittix (RTX) as a competing project. Dubbed by some as ""XRP 2.0,"" Remittix (RTX) is gaining momentum through its presale success, confirmed exchange listings, and upcoming beta wallet launch. XRP Price Reaction And Market Sentiment XRP is currently priced at $0.059614, with a daily decline of 0.4%. Its market capitalization stands at $4.04 billion, and the trading volume has hit $527.46 million, an improvement of 43.92% over the last 24 hours. These data show how volatility continues to be the talk of the town for XRP Price, and traders are watching out for indicators of a break. Concurrently, the Remittix comparison came about due to RTX focusing on solving related global payment issues. Unlike low cap crypto gems or meme-based speculative coins, Remittix combines liquidity and utility by revealing early CEX listings and preparing for its Q3 2025 beta wallet launch. Remittix Presale Milestones And CEX Listings Remittix is priced at $0.1030 per token and has raised more than $24 million in its presale, selling over 647 million tokens to date. This makes it one of the leading crypto presale 2025 candidates that are gaining traction as the best development-stage crypto investment opportunity. The presale made two major centralized exchange milestones accessible. At $20 million raised, Remittix had its initial listing on BitMart. Before reaching $22 million, the project achieved a second listing on LBank, both bringing liquidity and global exposure. Beta Wallet Launch Driving Real-World Adoption Perhaps most significant news for Remittix is the release of its beta wallet in Q3 2025. It is a mobile-centric wallet that will support over 40 cryptos and 30 fiat currencies, and support direct pay-outs into bank accounts in over 30 countries. This focus on linking decentralized finance to real life is why some investors have now started calling RTX ""XRP 2.0."" Focusing on cross-border remittances and business payments, Remittix DeFi turns into a crypto that solves real world problems and one of the best DeFi projects 2025 to watch out for.

Data indicates that the ETF recorded net outflows of $312.5 million. The only positive session came on September 4, when $148.8 million flowed into the fund. This gain was immediately offset by three consecutive redemption days, including $151.4 million on September 3, $309.9 million on September 5, and smaller drawdowns on other days, resulting in a deeply negative week. Ethereum ETF net inflows. Source: Coinglass The outflows come as U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs, which saw strong inflows in August, are now under broad pressure. By contrast, Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock’s IBIT, recorded net inflows, suggesting institutions are rotating toward the more established asset. While large redemptions from spot ETFs signal waning institutional demand, retail and offshore buyers have helped cushion ETH from steeper losses. Even so, the second-largest cryptocurrency is now testing the $4,000 support. ETH price analysis At press time, Ethereum ( ETH ) was trading at $4,281, up 0.11% over the past 24 hours but down 4% on the week. ETH seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold On the technical front, analysis by Ali Martinez highlighted that ETH is approaching a decisive level near $4,260, which has repeatedly acted as a key pivot in recent sessions. Failure to hold this threshold could trigger a sharper decline toward the $4,000 psychological mark. ETH price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Notably, ETH has struggled to build momentum above the $4,380 and $4,500 resistance zone, with repeated rejections underscoring persistent selling pressure. On the downside, $4,260 remains the critical barrier between relative stability and a deeper retracement. With volatility elevated and upcoming macro events set to influence risk assets, Ethereum’s reaction around the $4,260 level will likely determine its next major directional move.

Ethereum (ETH) is eyeing a run to $5500 this September, while Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is pushing through its presale with projections of up to 12100% gains from its launch. Together, they represent two very different stories playing out side by side. One is an established giant breaking resistance; the other is a meme coin with real infrastructure promising big returns for early believers. Ethereum Price Today and the Road to $5500 Ethereum is trading at around $4360 after a steady climb in August. On the technical side, its RSI sits around 60, which suggests healthy buying pressure. The moving average convergence divergence also remains positive, another hint that momentum is pointing up rather than down. Analysts point to $4676 as the next breakout trigger. A close above that number could open the path to $5200 and eventually $5500 in September. Even long-term bulls like Tom Lee of Fundstrat have predicted ETH could reach $5500 by September, citing steady institutional inflows and renewed attention on DeFi and stablecoin adoption. On-chain activity supports the bullish case as well. Ethereum has seen daily transaction volumes climbing toward $14 billion. Its network value to transaction ratio is sitting far below historical averages, which hints that ETH may still be undervalued compared to the amount of activity on the chain. Why Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Is Different From Other Meme Coins While Ethereum leads the DeFi story, Little Pepe is becoming the surprising breakout star of meme coins. The project is not another quick cash grab but is built on its own Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 network designed specifically for meme tokens. That means near instant trades, lower fees, and protections against sniping bots that usually give whales the advantage during launches. The presale is currently in Stage 12, priced at $0.0021. Earlier stages sold out quickly, with Stage 1 starting at $0.001. That means early investors are already sitting on gains of 110% even before the token officially lists. So far, the presale has raised over $22 million and is now over 95% filled in the current stage. The final listing price is $0.003, giving buyers at Stage 12 a built-in upside of about 42%. Unlike many meme coins, Little Pepe has already been audited by CertiK and is now visible on CoinMarketCap . The team has committed zero tax on trades, making it attractive for whales and everyday investors. Adding its $ 777,000 community giveaway campaign, the project demonstrates its ability to maintain momentum. Technical Analysis and Bullish Outlook for LILPEPE From a technical perspective, the presale structure alone creates upward pressure. Each stage raises the token price slightly, meaning buyers are later stepping in at a higher floor. With 19 stages total, the progression from $0.001 to $0.003 builds a natural appreciation for anyone who gets in early. Analysts have compared LILPEPE to early-stage Shiba Inu and Dogecoin runs but note that its infrastructure gives it an advantage that those projects lacked. Projections vary widely, but some expect potential gains of 3300% within the first 90 days of launch if liquidity from major exchange listings lines up. Others point to long-term returns of 12100% if its Layer 2 ecosystem develops as promised. Conclusion Ethereum looks set for a powerful September. If the charts hold up, $5500 is a realistic near-term target that could put ETH back into the spotlight as one of the strongest assets of the year. But while ETH offers steady growth, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is shaping up to be the bold play of 2025. Its presale has already shown strength, and its infrastructure provides real reasons to take it seriously. For those watching the market closely, the story is clear. ETH could deliver stability, while Little Pepe may deliver the kind of exponential upside that crypto investors dream of. With gains projected as high as 12100%, this presale is a rare chance to get in early before the big exchanges. For anyone exploring the next big opportunity in crypto this year, keeping an eye on Ethereum’s breakout and participating in the Little Pepe presale may be smart.

Ethereum is setting its sights on a remarkable value of $5500 by September, whereas the emerging meme coin, Little Pepe (LILPEPE), is making waves with its ambitious presale targets. The Surge of Ethereum: Predictions for September Ethereum, currently valued at approximately $4360, is on a promising trajectory. Strong technical indicators such as a Relative Strength Index (RSI) around 60 and a positive moving average convergence divergence suggest that Ethereum might not only reach but possibly exceed the $5500 mark next month. Backed by analysis from industry experts and increasing on-chain activities, Ethereum's journey to $5500 appears more plausible than ever. See Ethereum's current price . Introducing Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Not Your Ordinary Meme Coin While Ethereum advances in the mainstream crypto market, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is making a name for itself among meme coins. Structured on a dedicated Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 network, Little Pepe offers rapid transactions and lower fees, distinguishing itself from typical meme projects. The coin has already progressed impressively through its presale stages, signaling robust investor interest and market potential. Little Pepe's unique selling points have been substantiated by an audit from CertiK, enhancing its credibility in the market. As it marches through its presale, the project has successfully raised significant capital, appealing to both major investors and casual crypto enthusiasts alike. For a deeper dive into Little Pepe's development and potential, visit their official site . Future Prospects and Technical Analysis The technical setup for Little Pepe suggests a bullish outlook with the presale stages strategically increasing in price and generating greater investor interest. Comparisons to early-stage Shiba Inu and Dogecoin highlight its potential, with some analysts projecting astronomical gains. The robust infrastructure and strategic market positioning bode well for its future valuation. Read more about the presale success . Conclusion The crypto market remains a landscape of immense opportunities and dynamic changes. Ethereum's pursuit of $5500 seems aligned with its ongoing developments and market sentiment, while Little Pepe could be the surprise dark horse, potentially offering exponential returns to early investors. Both tokens demonstrate significant potential, making them key assets to watch in the coming months.

Withdrawals from wallets and exchanges that had been dormant for a long time have entered the radar of investors. First, a wallet that had been inactive for 2 years withdrew 10.36 million DOGE (worth $2.25 million) from Binance. In another major move, a whale removed 2,329 ETH ($10.01 million) from Binance. This whale was also found to be holding 5,552 ETH, 3.11 million USDT, and 2.81 million USDe in a liquidity pool on Uniswap V4, and 32 million USDe on Pendle V2. Related News: Solana (SOL) Founder Makes Statement About Ethereum: “What They've Been Able to Do Since 2015, We...” A whale withdrew 2 million SPX (worth $2.26 million) from Kraken nine hours ago. This wallet currently holds 9.09 million SPX (worth $10.27 million) and is making a $5.86 million profit. Meanwhile, the Ethereum ecosystem also witnessed some historic movements. The 0x0F08 wallet, affiliated with the Ethereum Foundation, moved 4,000 ETH ($17.13 million) to a new address after nine years. This wallet had acquired 97,500 ETH (~$91,000) from the Ethereum Foundation 10 years ago at around $0.93 and later deposited it to Kraken at $4.65. *This is not investment advice.

Questions regarding whether Solana, Cardano or newer altcoins can transform $1,000 into $20,000 by January are now common on crypto news. Though older names continue to be favored, new projects such as Remittix (RTX) are offering something different — real-world solutions and consistent presale momentum. Solana and Cardano Market Performance Solana is still among the most active blockchains in the market, but recent data shows some mixed signals. It now trades at $202.35, down 0.88% on the day. Yet, trading volume remains strong at $7.3 billion, a sharp 43.62% increase. This shows that Solana still has high liquidity and remains in the limelight regardless of short-term price action. Cardano has shown a slightly different trend. The token is trading at $0.8246, with a 0.81% daily gain. Its $29.47 billion market cap makes ADA one of the largest altcoins, but its $1.21 billion trading volume, up 50.66%, suggests rekindled market interest. In spite of this, there are questions regarding whether Cardano can sustain momentum in such a competitive field. Hyu Why Solana, Cardano Investors Are Looking at Remittix For many, the choice is no longer merely among older tokens like Solana, Cardano or Ethereum. Investors are also looking for early phase crypto investment opportunities that promise both scalability and utility. Remittix is set in this bracket as a low gas fee crypto project focused on global payments. Priced at $0.1030 per token , Remittix has already raised more than $24 million in presale funds, with 647 million+ tokens being sold. That momentum is placing RTX among the best crypto presale 2025 projects currently live, with traders taking an interest as they liken it to both low cap cryptocurrency hidden gems and larger blockchain networks. Beta Wallet Launch & Exchange Plans One of the key highlights for Remittix is the Q3 2025 beta wallet launch. The wallet is intended to simplify cross-border transactions with real-time FX conversion, crypto-to-bank transfers, and multi-asset support. This makes it valuable to freelancers, businesses, and everyday users — not just speculative traders. Alongside the wallet, the team revealed listings on centralized exchanges LBank and BitMart. Not yet active, these partnerships represent an enormous leap towards worldwide liquidity. For people wondering how to buy crypto early, these announcements form the basis for wider adoption. Why Remittix Is Gaining Attention $24Million+ raised with 647Million+ tokens sold Priced at $0.1030 per token Beta wallet release confirmed for Q3 2025 BitMart and LBank listings announced $250,000 giveaway for early users This development views RTX as more than just another new crypto token launch. It's part of a broader trend where Solana, Cardano and other altcoin investors are diversifying into crypto with real-world utility. The Bigger Picture for 2025 Remittix is unlocking a trillion-dollar payments market by bridging the gap between DeFi project innovation and real-world needs. Prioritizing accessibility and speed, it is building steam as one of the crypto projects of the future with longevity. The Remittix DeFi project shows how utility-based tokens can stand on their own alongside older ecosystems like Solana, Cardano, and XRP. For investors searching for the next big altcoin 2025, Remittix is becoming a top crypto under $1 with a clear use case. The presale hype, wallet release, and exchange partnerships suggest that it can be one of the best long-term crypto investment stories this year.

As we approach 2024, the spotlight is on established players like Solana and Cardano, as well as emerging ones such as Remittix. Established cryptocurrencies like Solana and Cardano have shown varying market performances. Solana, a blockchain known for its speed and efficiency, has experienced mixed signals in recent trading sessions. Despite a minor dip in price, it maintains a robust trading volume, indicating sustained interest from the market. On the other hand, Cardano has been appreciated for its scientific approach to blockchain technology and decentralized applications. Its market cap remains substantial, suggesting a stable presence in the digital asset space. Emerging Opportunities with Remittix A new entrant capturing the attention of investors is Remittix (RTX) , which promises robust solutions in global payments, characterized by low transaction fees and high scalability. With over $24 million raised in its presale and more than 647 million tokens already sold, RTX is positioning itself as a formidable contender in the crypto space. The excitement around Remittix is not just about its current presale success. The project's roadmap includes a beta wallet launch in the third quarter of 2025, which aims to facilitate easier and more affordable cross-border transactions. This development is part of a broader strategy to list on major exchanges like LBank and BitMart, enhancing liquidity and accessibility for global investors. Real-World Utility: A Key Differentiator The potential of cryptocurrencies extends beyond mere speculative trading. Projects like Remittix are focusing on real-world applications, such as streamlining payments for freelancers and international businesses through innovative financial technology. This practical utility could be the key to sustaining long-term value, setting it apart from many traditional digital assets. Investors interested in early-stage opportunities with substantial growth potential are now closely watching Remittix. The project's detailed roadmap and the upcoming wallet functionality are particularly appealing to those looking to diversify their digital asset portfolios beyond the more familiar names of Solana and Cardano.

These narratives influenced the movement of several assets, including bitcoin (BTC), alts, and meme coins. According to a tweet by Santiment, the trending stories center on the United States revenue policy, institutional bitcoin purchases, and a possible Federal Reserve rate cut this month. The market is also buzzing with information on the Solana-based creator coins and tokenized Pokémon cards ecosystems. The Gainzy Creator Coin Saga The biggest stir came from GNZYSTRM, the creator coin linked to influencer Gainzy. An accidental large-scale sell order briefly sent the token into freefall, wiping out hours of steady gains. The panic, however, quickly gave way to opportunism as whales scooped up discounted tokens, fueling a sharp rebound. Meanwhile, Solana’s NFT ecosystem is buzzing with the rise of tokenized Pokémon cards. Several startups report surging trading volumes as collectors embrace these digital renditions of a beloved franchise. The growth underscores how nostalgia, intellectual property, and blockchain liquidity are blending to create new categories of digital collectibles. The surge in World Liberty Financial ( WLFI ) reflects both concentrated whale activity and political endorsements, yet market strategists emphasize that its risk profile is exceptionally high. In addition, Trollcoin distinguished itself with an exclusive deal to use the iconic Trollface meme, thereby gaining intellectual property legitimacy that many of its peers lack. Furthermore, Pepenode closed a successful presale while debuting a “mine-to-earn” model that adds fresh utility to a space often criticized for lacking substance. Trump Floats Tariffs as Income Tax Alternative The broader policy backdrop added fuel to the day’s market mood. In the United States, President Donald Trump floated the idea of replacing the federal income tax with tariffs. This radical proposal could reshape revenue policy if pursued. He has urged the Supreme Court to uphold his tariff agenda amid ongoing challenges . On the institutional side, BlackRock disclosed a sale of roughly $152.7 million in ETH while increasing its BTC holdings by nearly $290 million. The move suggests large asset managers are tilting toward bitcoin as a digital hedge, particularly with markets betting on an imminent Federal Reserve rate cut. Macro data is also driving speculation. For the first time since 2021, the number of U.S. job openings has fallen below the number of unemployed workers. Rising layoffs and slowing hiring add pressure on the Fed to ease policy, even as inflation remains sticky. Investors are increasingly convinced that a rate cut in September is inevitable, raising the stakes for volatility when the upcoming employment data is released.
