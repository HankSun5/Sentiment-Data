51305025,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=800872,1757192100,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51305025.jpeg,Here’s Why Many Solana Supporters Are Now Diversifying Their Portfolios With High-Potential Altcoins Like Remittix,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/heres-why-many-solana-supporters-are-now-diversifying-their-portfolios-with-high-potential-altcoins-like-remittix/,"Solana’s recent strength has drawn attention, yet many holders are growing restless and seeking fresh opportunities. Remittix is capturing interest with its bold promise reinforced by a $250,000 giveaway and a Q3 wallet beta launch scheduled for September 15. That move signals a departure from mainstream Solana performance to sharper, utility-driven altcoins. As Solana maintains momentum, more of its community is pivoting to Remittix for a higher growth narrative and stronger monetization path. Solana Holds Strength but Faces Strategic Fatigue With ongoing upgrades and growing adoption, Solana continues to be a standout. The price of SOL is currently sitting at $206, having recovered from the $190 level, thanks to rising activity across DeFi platforms and NFTs. Despite this, the path to a breakout above $215 remains uncertain, raising concern over stagnation for traders craving acceleration. Smart money appears to be diversifying into assets with higher implied upside potential. This growing discomfort among Solana holders reflects a broader trend: loyalty to technical robustness, yes, but also a hunger for clearer monetization and unleashing speculative gains sooner rather than later. Remittix Stands Out Where Solana Momentum Taps Out Remittix has emerged as an alluring pivot for former Solana supporters chasing sharper returns. Solana’s upgrades and ETF outlook offer stability, yet Remittix introduces a focused PayFi utility, immediate product events and a defined growth trajectory. That contrast, with Solana delivering incremental upgrades and Remittix promising fast-moving infrastructure, makes Remittix compelling. Remittix has sold over 645 million tokens, is priced at $0.1030 and has raised upwards of $24 million. It earned its BitMart exchange listing after surpassing $20 million in funding and followed with LBANK at $22 million raised. Now, its third centralized exchange listing is in progress. That sequence offers clarity and rollout pace that Solana’s deeper ecosystem updates have not matched. Here are five reasons why Remittix draws capital that might otherwise stay with SOL: Send crypto directly to bank accounts in 30+ countries Wallet beta launches this quarter with multi-currency support Audited by CertiK, built with trust and transparency Deflationary tokenomics designed for long-term growth Time-sensitive entry point before listings and parabolic growth These traits underline Remittix’s focus, tangible PayFi utility, vetted security, institutional-friendly tokenomics and a launch schedule that beckons faster upside. It is not just another altcoin; it is structured for adoption, not speculation. Strategic Diversification Between SOL and Remittix Solana continues to command respect for its ecosystem, performance, and institutional appeal. Yet, a growing subsection of its holders is exploring alternatives like Remittix , drawn by its roadmap, incentives and monetisation clarity. For Solana supporters seeking sharper returns without sacrificing credibility, Remittix offers an impactful option.

From presale milestones and whale moves to ETF updates and new integrations, the strongest names are rising to the top. While some coins are consolidating near support zones, others are preparing for bigger rallies fueled by major developments. These trends define what makes the top crypto coins worth tracking this year. BlockDAG, XRP, ADA, and TRX are four names commanding attention. Each brings unique progress, from record presale numbers to growing adoption, regulatory clarity, and ecosystem expansion. Here’s why they are considered among the top crypto coins shaping the current cycle. 1. BlockDAG Secures the Lead BlockDAG has cemented itself as one of the standout stories of 2025 through the scale of its presale and the speed of its adoption. Currently in Batch 30 at $0.03, the project has already raised nearly $400 million and sold more than 25.9 billion coins. Those who joined in Batch 1 at just $0.001 are now sitting on gains of about 2,900%. In the final run-up to its BDAG Deployment Event in Singapore, BlockDAG has set the presale price at $0.0013. The confirmed $0.05 launch means holders at this stage are positioned for gains as high as 38x. The growth isn’t confined to presale numbers alone. More than 3 million people are actively mining BDAG through the X1 mobile app, making it one of the most widely adopted mining tools. At the same time, the X10 hardware miners are shipping across global markets, ensuring the ecosystem expands through both digital and physical channels. Large-scale commitments add another layer of strength. Two whale entries have each crossed $4.4 million and $4.3 million, heating up competition on the leaderboard and reinforcing confidence in the project’s scale. Upcoming milestones, including a September 4 AMA and a major sponsorship reveal, are expected to keep attention firmly on BlockDAG . By merging fundraising success, wide adoption, and strong whale activity, BlockDAG has firmly secured its position as a leading name among the top crypto coins for 2025. 2. XRP Targets Higher Levels XRP is trading around $2.98 after a brief pullback, holding support at $2.89 and facing resistance near $3.08–$3.20. Analysts note a bull-flag setup that could trigger an upward breakout if resistance is cleared. Futures activity on CME has surged past $1 billion in open interest, marking the fastest growth rate for a crypto contract. Clarity from Ripple’s resolved SEC case, where XRP was confirmed not to be a security, has restored confidence across global markets. Demand in South Korea has been particularly strong, with XRP trading at ₩3.25 locally. Forecasts vary, with some calling for $4 short term and long-term outlooks pointing toward $27. With rising futures activity and regional demand, XRP is cementing its place as one of the top crypto coins to watch. 3. ADA Builds Toward ETF Catalyst Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.87, posting a small gain despite overall market consolidation. The SEC delayed its decision on the Grayscale spot Cardano ETF to October 26, 2025, which is seen as a potential game-changer for ADA’s future flows. On-chain, Cardano continues to expand, with more than 2,006 projects in development and over 1.33 million delegated wallets. Whale accumulation has also increased, with 150 million ADA purchased recently, supporting a market cap of about $32 billion. Analysts are tracking a possible breakout toward $1.20 in the near term, with longer-term projections ranging from $2 to $4.83. Key events like the Cardano Summit in Berlin this November and the launch of the Techstars + Cardano Founder Catalyst pre-accelerator in October could further strengthen its outlook. With this combination of growth and anticipation, ADA remains among the top crypto coins in 2025. 4. TRX Expands Through Stablecoin Activity TRON (TRX) is trading near $0.347, moving within a daily range of $0.3446–$0.3514. Technical signals show consolidation, with the possibility of retesting $0.330 if resistance isn’t reclaimed. A recovery above $0.345, however, could push the coin toward $0.370 or higher. Despite the chart challenges, TRX has maintained an eight-week winning streak supported by strong whale engagement and dominant stablecoin settlements. Recent data highlights TRON’s momentum: the network processed $23.5 billion in daily USDT transfers compared to Ethereum’s $20 billion. MetaMask integration has also been introduced, reducing reliance on third-party bridges and expanding access. TRON has further strengthened its security with the launch of the Beacon Network alongside TRM Labs. A governance proposal to cut transaction fees is under review, signaling continued focus on adoption. If momentum holds, forecasts suggest TRX could climb toward $0.45–$0.50, securing its role as one of the top crypto coins for 2025. Final Thoughts BlockDAG, XRP, ADA, and TRX each bring a different advantage to the table. BlockDAG is setting records with nearly $400 million raised, over 25.9 billion coins sold, and millions of active miners. XRP is leveraging legal clarity and futures activity to strengthen its global presence. ADA is anchored by developer growth and the prospect of an ETF decision, while TRX is expanding its lead in stablecoin settlements and ecosystem upgrades. Together, these names highlight what defines the top crypto coins in 2025. Whether through presale momentum, regulatory clarity, technical adoption, or payment dominance, each demonstrates how multiple paths can create lasting influence in the months ahead.

According to the announcement, this comes as the platform prepares to return to the United States. Polymarket is Bent on Setting New Records Shayne Coplan, the CEO of Polymarket, noted that the platform has also received important support from regulators. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) decided not to take action on certain reporting and recordkeeping rules for event contracts. This decision followed a formal request from QCX, a group that supports clear regulations in decentralized finance (DeFi). It is also worth noting that the CFTC’s no-action letter is important for the platform as it re-enters the U.S. market, which it had left due to regulatory issues. Last month, Polymarket users created 13,800 new markets, beating the previous record of 11,800 set in July. The rise in market creation indicates a greater demand for decentralized forecasting tools and real-money betting on real-world outcomes. Polymarket Set to Hit $1 Billion Valuation In June, the leading decentralized prediction market platform nearly raised $200 million in new funding . As reported by TheCoinRise, the investment brought the company’s total value to $1 billion, marking a major milestone in its growth. Notably, the new funding round comes when the prediction market platforms started regaining attention. Last year’s U.S. presidential election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris brought a lot of excitement to Polymarket . Reportedly, millions of users placed bets on who would win. This new $200 million deal adds to Polymarket’s earlier funding rounds. Recall that last year, the platform also considered raising $50 million and was working on launching its own token , which users could use to settle their bets on the platform. With this deal, it means Polymarket has raised far more than one of its main competitors, Kalshi. Furthermore, Polymarket’s total funding would place it in a much stronger financial position within the prediction market space. Polymarket Strives Abroad After U.S. Regulatory Setback Polymarket enables users to predict events, ranging from politics and sports to economics and global news. The platform runs on blockchain technology, meaning all trades are secure, transparent, and peer-to-peer. However, Polymarket has had some trouble with U.S. regulators . In 2022, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission fined the company $1.4 million, forcing Polymarket to shut down some of its services in the United States. Now, most of its trading volume comes from users outside the country. Meanwhile, Thailand’s cybercrime investigation bureau is also looking to ban Polymarket , citing online gambling concerns.

While ETH holdings make up the majority of his wealth, Buterin's portfolio is also supplemented by various altcoins and crypto venture investments. Buterin's known wallets hold approximately 240,000 ETH, making his wealth heavily dependent on the price of Ethereum. With the price of ETH rising above $3,000 in 2021, 2024, and 2025, Buterin re-entered the billionaire list. However, due to fluctuations in the price of ETH, his wealth has occasionally dipped below $1 billion, but has since recovered. Among his assets outside of ETH, he stands out for his investments in projects like AAVE V3 WETH, MOODENG, and WHITE tokens, as well as StarkNet. Buterin's memecoin holdings consist of tokens gifted by developers. He also acquired half of the Shiba Inu (SHIB) supply from the developer in 2020, which at one point led to his fortune reaching $20 billion. Buterin has burned or donated most of these tokens. Buterin's wealth was shaped by his share of Ethereum's founding. A 16.5% stake was distributed to the founders during the 2014 ETH presale. Buterin's share of this share has helped him grow his crypto holdings. As the only founder to remain active in the project since Ethereum's official launch in 2015, he has played a critical role in the network's development.

While his stake in companies like StarkWare remains unclear, his contributions to leading projects in the industry are contributing to his net worth. As of today, Vitalik Buterin is the largest individual ETH holder on Ethereum. Wallets holding larger amounts of ETH are primarily controlled by exchanges and institutional funds. Buterin entered the crypto world in 2011 and paved the way for decentralized applications with the Ethereum Whitepaper he published in 2013. Ethereum's transition to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system in 2022 also took place under his leadership. *This is not investment advice.

This isn’t just another memecoin; it’s an Ethereum Layer 2 solution that has already blown past $1.8 million in its presale. Analysts are whispering about 70x gains by 2025. Could this be the next big crypto to truly shake things up, offering genuine utility where many meme tokens just offer hype? Layer Brett is the best-looking crypto for the future Forget the struggles that some significant cap altcoins, like SOL and PI, face. Layer Brett offers something genuinely different. We’re talking about lightning-fast transactions, often clocked at 10,000 TPS, with gas fees that drop to an almost unbelievable $0.0001. That kind of performance is a game-changer. For those weary of high Ethereum gas fees or the congestion seen on other chains, this Layer 2 blockchain is an absolute breath of fresh air. It’s also offering a mind-boggling 917% APY on staking. No wonder investors are flocking to this best crypto presale. Layer Brett is a next-generation memecoin, yes, but one fused with real blockchain utility, built directly on Ethereum’s Layer 2. Picture the vibrant energy of meme culture meeting the serious power of scalability. It’s Brett, but evolved, escaping the limitations of its original Base chain. This project aims to disrupt the entire meme token landscape. The magic happens through its Layer 2 architecture, which allows Layer Brett to process activity off-chain while still drawing on Ethereum’s rock-solid security. This means transactions are nearly instantaneous and incredibly inexpensive. Users can jump in, buy, and stake $LBRETT in mere seconds using ETH, USDT, or BNB through MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Plus, those early staking rewards? They are amplified due to the lower operating costs that this efficient Layer 2 crypto provides. It’s a sweet deal for early birds seeking a top-performing crypto. Solana price and Pi Network price prediction general SOL (Solana) burst onto the scene, promising speed and low transaction costs, aiming to rival Ethereum. It’s a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain, hosting a vast array of DeFi and NFT projects. Pi Network, on the other hand, is a more enigmatic project. It attempts to allow everyday users to “mine” cryptocurrency on their phones, though its mainnet launch and practical utility remain topics of intense debate and speculation. The Solana price has experienced its share of volatility, while the Pi Network continues to expand its community. While the Solana price has shown resilience, it, like many altcoins, faces market headwinds and occasionally experiences trading volume dips. The Pi Network price prediction remains theoretical, mainly due to its unlaunched mainnet and limited practical application. Both SOL and PI are established in their own ways, but they don’t offer the fresh, hyper-incentivized opportunity Layer Brett presents. Investors often seek out new crypto coins with explosive growth potential when larger projects consolidate. Layer Brett is the future With its unique blend of meme power and robust Ethereum Layer 2 technology, Layer Brett is positioned for truly significant growth. The current presale price, coupled with that jaw-dropping 917% APY staking, suggests immense upside. $LBRETT could easily be a next 100x altcoin, even a next 100x meme coin, during the upcoming crypto bull run in 2025. It has a much smaller market cap than SOL or PI, creating a wider runway for astronomical gains. This is why it’s considered the best long-term crypto by many discerning investors right now. Get ready to connect your wallet, buy $LBRETT, and stake for those eye-watering rewards. This is the best crypto to buy now, and it won’t be in presale forever.

However, the premier cryptocurrency’s progress hit a stumbling block following the release of weaker-than-expected United States payrolls data on Friday, September 5. Despite the bearish pressure triggered by the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) release, the price of Bitcoin managed to stay above the psychological $110,000 level. Interestingly, the latest analysis suggests that the latest job data could guide the Bitcoin price to a new high. Macro Shift To Kickstart Next BTC Price Rally? In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, market analysis firm XWIN Research Japan explained how weak labor data in the US could see the Bitcoin price embark on its next bullish wave. According to the analytics firm, history shows a paradox despite rising unemployment often linked to weak performances by risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Nears Its Climax: Cycle Peak Indicates 95% Completion XWIN mentioned that on-chain stablecoin data offers insight into how this “macro story” could unfold, especially in relation to the cryptocurrency market. The crypto trading firm then highlighted two “distinct waves of activity” that establish the connection between unemployment and crypto market positioning. In the first wave (between late 2024 and early 2025), investors expected the Federal Reserve (Fed) to cut interest rates as the labor market weakness first emerged. Capital flowed into exchanges with the surge in stablecoin reserves from $30 billion to $50 billion, showing the investors’ preparedness for a macroeconomic shift. The second wave (from mid-2025 to present) has seen unemployment rising again. Similarly, stablecoin exchange reserves recently hit $58.5 billion, while depositing addresses have frequently surpassed 30,000 BTC, with highs near 40,000 BTC. “This isn’t just accumulation—it reflects broader participation, from whales to retail, mobilizing funds in anticipation of easier policy,” XWIN added. According to XWIN, the thinking is that the rising unemployment in the United States could be linked to stronger expectations of Fed rate cuts. With more capital stored in stablecoins on exchanges, ready to buy more coins, the weak jobs data could be the foundation for a fresh rally for Bitcoin. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $110,780, reflecting no significant changes in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the market leader is up by almost 3% in the last seven days.

Imagine a world where AI doesn’t just generate text or images, but resurrects lost cinematic masterpieces, challenging our very understanding of authorship and intellectual property. This isn’t a scene from a sci-fi film; it’s the audacious reality unfolding with Fable, an Amazon-backed AI startup, and its controversial plan to digitally reconstruct Orson Welles’ ‘The Magnificent Ambersons’. For anyone tracking the intersection of technology and creative industries, especially within the crypto and digital asset space, this development raises profound questions about ownership, authenticity, and the very soul of art in the age of advanced AI filmmaking . What is Fable AI and Its Ambitious Vision? On the surface, Fable AI presents itself as a pioneering force, often dubbed the ‘Netflix of AI.’ This ambitious startup, which recently secured significant funding from the Amazon Alexa Fund , aims to democratize content creation through artificial intelligence. Their core platform empowers users to craft their own animated stories using intuitive AI prompts, effectively putting a virtual animation studio at their fingertips. While currently focusing on its own intellectual property, Fable has openly expressed aspirations to extend these capabilities to established Hollywood IP, a move that has already seen it used to generate unauthorized ‘South Park’ episodes. The company’s latest innovation is a powerful new Generative AI model designed to produce long, complex narratives. This is where the story takes an intriguing turn, moving from cartoon creation to the ambitious task of cinematic resurrection. Fable’s technological prowess lies in its ability to understand and extend storylines, generate characters, and even simulate visual styles, making it a formidable player in the emerging field of AI-driven content creation. The Audacious Plan: Resurrecting Orson Welles’ ‘The Magnificent Ambersons’ The specific project causing a stir involves filmmaker Brian Rose, who has already dedicated five years to digitally reconstructing the lost 43 minutes of Orson Welles ‘ 1942 classic, ‘The Magnificent Ambersons.’ Rose now plans to leverage Fable’s advanced AI model over the next two years to complete this digital resurrection. But why ‘Ambersons’? For many, it might seem like an obscure choice, overshadowed by Welles’ more famous work, ‘Citizen Kane.’ However, among cinephiles, ‘The Magnificent Ambersons’ holds a special, tragic place as a lost masterpiece, severely truncated and altered by the studio after Welles was removed from the project. The film’s reputation as a ‘what could have been’ fuels the fascination. It’s a testament to Welles’ genius, even in its compromised form, and the destruction of his original vision remains a poignant moment in film history. Rose, in his statement, lamented the loss of a ‘four-minute-long, unbroken moving camera shot whose loss is a tragedy,’ with only 50 seconds remaining in the studio-recut version. This sense of profound loss is presumably what drew Fable and Rose to this particular project, seeing it as an ultimate test of AI filmmaking ‘s potential. Ethical Minefield: The Orson Welles Estate and Intellectual Property in Generative AI Herein lies the project’s most significant controversy: Fable has not obtained the rights to ‘The Magnificent Ambersons,’ nor has it consulted with the estate of Orson Welles . This omission has drawn sharp criticism from David Reeder, who manages the estate for Welles’ daughter, Beatrice. Reeder vehemently described the project as an ‘attempt to generate publicity on the back of Welles’ creative genius,’ asserting that it would amount to nothing more than ‘a purely mechanical exercise without any of the uniquely innovative thinking [of] a creative force like Welles.’ The estate’s reaction highlights a critical dilemma in the age of Generative AI : the clash between technological capability and artistic rights. While Reeder expressed less anger over the idea of recreation itself, he was deeply offended by the lack of ‘even the courtesy of a heads up.’ Interestingly, the estate itself has ’embraced AI technology to create a voice model intended to be used for VO work with brands,’ indicating a pragmatic openness to AI when handled respectfully and with proper authorization. This distinction is crucial: the estate acknowledges AI’s potential but insists on ethical engagement and proper compensation. The situation with Fable and the Welles estate underscores the urgent need for clear guidelines and legal frameworks governing the use of AI in creative endeavors, particularly concerning existing intellectual property. Without such frameworks, the line between innovation and infringement becomes dangerously blurred, setting a precedent that could destabilize entire creative industries. AI Filmmaking: A Double-Edged Sword for Creativity The Fable project forces us to confront the profound implications of AI filmmaking . On one hand, the technology offers tantalizing possibilities: Reviving Lost Works: The potential to reconstruct films, music, or literature lost to time or censorship. Democratizing Creation: Lowering barriers for aspiring filmmakers and artists to create complex narratives. New Storytelling Forms: Enabling interactive or dynamically generated content that adapts to viewers. However, the challenges and ethical quandaries are equally significant: Authenticity vs. Recreation: Can an AI truly recreate an artist’s vision, or does it merely produce a convincing imitation? The author of the original article aptly notes, ‘this is a tragedy that AI cannot undo.’ Artistic Intent: Without the original creator’s guidance, how can AI accurately interpret and extend their artistic intent? Intellectual Property: The Fable case exemplifies the legal quagmire when AI operates without proper rights, raising questions of ownership and fair use. The ‘Frankenstein’ Effect: As the original piece points out, using AI to swap faces onto new actors creates ‘Frankensteined replicas,’ which might lack the soul of the original performances. Historically, filmmakers have attempted to ‘fix’ or finish Welles’ movies, but these efforts typically involved using footage he himself had shot. Fable’s approach, described as a hybrid of AI and traditional filmmaking (reshooting scenes with contemporary actors and then face-swapping), goes a step further, entering entirely new territory. It’s a fascinating technical demonstration, but as Reeder suggests, it risks being ‘a purely mechanical exercise’ divorced from the human genius that defined Welles’ work. Beyond Hollywood: Generative AI’s Impact on Digital Assets and Events like Bitcoin World Disrupt 2025 The debate surrounding Fable AI extends far beyond the confines of Hollywood, resonating deeply within the broader tech and digital asset communities. The innovations in Generative AI are not just about film; they are reshaping how we perceive digital ownership, content creation, and even the value of unique artistic expressions. Events like Bitcoin World Disrupt 2025 serve as crucial platforms where such cutting-edge developments are dissected and discussed by industry heavyweights. Imagine the insights from leaders at Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, and Elad Gil, all slated to speak at Disrupt 2025. Their discussions will undoubtedly touch upon how AI is transforming media, investment, and the very fabric of startup growth. For those immersed in cryptocurrency and blockchain, the Fable scenario offers a preview of challenges related to provenance and intellectual property that Web3 technologies aim to address. How will NFTs and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) play a role in authenticating and compensating creators for AI-generated or AI-assisted works in the future? The 20th anniversary of Bitcoin World Disrupt promises to be a melting pot of ideas, where the future of tech, including AI’s role in creative industries and its intersection with digital assets, will be sharply defined. Learning from these top voices is crucial for anyone looking to sharpen their edge in this rapidly evolving landscape. Don’t miss the opportunity to gain insights into how technologies like Generative AI are shaping not just entertainment, but the entire digital economy. The Future of Storytelling: Who Owns the Narrative? Ultimately, Fable’s ambitious project with Orson Welles ‘ ‘The Magnificent Ambersons’ is more than just a tech demo; it’s a litmus test for the future of creative industries. It forces us to ask fundamental questions about the nature of art, the rights of creators, and the role of technology. While filmmaker Brian Rose seems genuinely motivated by a desire to honor Welles’ vision, the path chosen – without rights or estate consultation – undermines that very intention. The promise of AI filmmaking is immense, offering unprecedented tools for creativity and preservation. However, its ethical implementation will define its true legacy. If AI is to truly serve art, it must do so with respect for authorship, intellectual property, and the human element that imbues art with its profound meaning. Otherwise, we risk creating technically perfect but emotionally hollow imitations, forever chasing a ghost that technology, for all its power, cannot truly bring back.

DOGE Hovers Around $0.21 as Smart Investors Choose This Under-$0.035 DeFi Crypto,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/why-is-dogecoin-down-today-doge-hovers-around-0-21-as-smart-investors-choose-this-under-0-035-defi-crypto/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently falling, trading close to $0.21. This comes as the overall crypto market is uncertain and investors are unsure about where DOGE might go next. Because of this, investors are shifting their interest towards upcoming protocols in DeFi such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , an up-and-coming player valued at $0.035. MUTM is in the sixth presale level and missing an entry here will mean paying 14.28% more when phase 7 comes along. Over $15.45 million has been raised so far and the project has already registered over 16,100 investors. As liquidity flows and risk-on capital seek utility-oriented applications, the focus is quietly shifting off the better-known names such as Dogecoin and onto emerging DeFi coins, possibly paving the way to a new phase of decentralized finance development. Dogecoin Liquefies as Wider Market Swings Play out Dogecoin price has slipped over the last week, now just above $0.20. DOGE has seen mild price swings over the last 24h. This recent dip is part of a broader change in market sentiment and is influenced by technical factors such as resistance levels and low activity from large investors. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance is getting a lot of attention in this changing market. Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance is allowing investors to buy in cheap while the project is still in its early stage. It is currently priced at $0.035, but will go higher to $0.04 in an upcoming phase 7 of token sale. There is also a very high interest in investment and the amount of funds raised has surpassed $15.45 million and the number of individuals holding tokens has surpassed over 16,100. This makes MUTM one of the most qualified within the market of DeFi. $50,000 Bug Bounty Program As the presale progresses, MUTM has launched a new initiative where, users of the project can share in a $50,000 USDT pool for identifying bugs within the platform. The $50k reward will cover four different weak areas. These include: critical, major, minor, and low. The initiative is already live and anyone can participate. Dual-Lending, Bending The dual-lending frame of the project is a hybrid of the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. Since P2C is actively studying the market environment to pay interest, one can borrow at a reasonable rate and guarantee that the investors can be paid interest through smart contracts. P2P offers direct lending and borrowing without an intermediary and is highly decentralized, a feature particularly useful to risky assets such as meme coins. Infrastructure and Price Discovery The project relies on Chainlink to obtain the correct price in the market and ties it to the price of USD and tokens such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Other tools such as fallback oracles, aggregated feeds and in-chain metrics can assist in offering reliable and timely prices to manage collateral and undertake liquidations. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has grown into a key player this cycle. Expert analysis show DOGE could soon slip below $0.20 as bears take control. Buying MUTM today means getting into the project at the lowest price it will ever be, while waiting until the next phase, means buying in over 14% higher. The project has already collected more than $15.45M and received 16,100+ investors, which indicates a good movement. MUTM is utility-oriented with a $100K giveaway, a $50K CertiK bug bounty, and powerful oracle-driven price discovery. Stage 6 price is currently lower than it will be after the additional presale.

In 2025, fund managers are increasingly applying that same label to cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, Cardano (ADA), and Chainlink (LINK) are now frequently described as “digital blue chips,” reflecting their maturity, utility, and resilience across multiple cycles. Analysts argue that this recognition is a sign of how far crypto has come, moving from speculative fringe to mainstream allocation. Alongside these established assets, discussions also touch on cultural-driven plays with unusual credibility, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE , which is drawing early interest as a high-beta complement to the blue chip core. Bitcoin: the foundation of digital finance Bitcoin remains the most secure, recognized, and widely adopted cryptocurrency. With ETF inflows surpassing $20 billion in 2025 and adoption growing among sovereign wealth funds, its role as “digital gold” is cemented. Its scarcity and decentralization make it the anchor of every institutional crypto portfolio. While its multiples may be smaller than in early cycles, its reliability and recognition make it the quintessential blue chip. ADA: governance and sustainability Cardano has emerged as a long-term project with an emphasis on research and governance. Its Voltaire upgrade is introducing on-chain voting and treasury management, giving ADA holders direct influence over the network’s future. This governance-first approach appeals to institutions looking for projects that can withstand regulatory scrutiny. Cardano’s steady growth and commitment to sustainability strengthen its claim as a digital blue chip alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. LINK: the oracle powerhouse Chainlink’s role as the leading decentralized oracle network makes it indispensable for DeFi and beyond. By connecting blockchains to real-world data, LINK powers smart contracts in finance, insurance, and supply chains. With institutional partnerships expanding and more networks integrating its services, Chainlink has cemented its reputation as critical infrastructure. Fund managers now see LINK as one of the safest bets among altcoins, given its unique and defensible use case. Fund managers are quick to point out that portfolios often balance stability with growth. While Bitcoin, ADA, and LINK represent the “blue chip” core, analysts highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the most aggressive high-beta plays of 2025 . Passed audits from CertiK and HashEx add a level of credibility rare in cultural-driven tokens. Combined with its deflationary tokenomics and surging community growth , forecasts call for up to 55x upside before major listings . The PATRIOT50X bonus code has also amplified demand, giving early adopters a 50% boost in allocations. Analysts argue this mix of credibility and hype makes MAGACOIN FINANCE a perfect complement to digital blue chips: while the core provides resilience, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers asymmetric upside that can transform portfolio returns. Why fund managers mix core and growth In traditional investing, blue chips anchor portfolios, while growth stocks provide potential for higher returns. The same principle is increasingly applied to crypto. Bitcoin, ADA, and LINK deliver security and trust, while projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE bring innovation and volatility. Fund managers stress that the combination allows them to manage risk while staying positioned for exponential growth if emerging narratives explode. Conclusion Bitcoin, ADA, and LINK have earned their reputations as digital blue chips, cementing their place in institutional portfolios. Yet, even the most conservative managers recognize the need for higher-beta assets. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its rare mix of audits, scarcity, and cultural firepower, is being framed as that complement – the growth play to balance the blue chip core. For investors, combining both strategies could define success in the next market cycle.

51307126,https://timestabloid.com/?p=82110,1757196044,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Bitcoin to $135K, Dogecoin to $1 and MAGACOIN FINANCE Set to Explode",https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-to-135k-dogecoin-to-1-and-magacoin-finance-set/,"Bitcoin’s one-year chart shows a steady grind higher, reclaiming the $110k area and keeping bulls in control. With ETF demand absorbing new supply and miners selling less post-halving, traders are mapping the next major target at $135k . If spot ETF inflows remain positive and macro data stays friendly, that level becomes a reasonable stretch before the cycle cools. Dogecoin, meanwhile, is holding a broad range near the $0.20 zone while liquidity improves. The community’s long-standing $1 goal is back in conversation as on-chain activity rises and derivatives funding normalizes. Historically, DOGE’s biggest moves have arrived late in bull phases, which is why some traders are preparing for a momentum push if Bitcoin breaks into new highs again. As capital looks for higher multiples beyond large caps, attention is turning to smaller, earlier-stage plays that could deliver outsized returns. That’s where a growing number of retail traders and some crypto funds say they’re hunting for asymmetric upside. Bitcoin’s Route to $135k For BTC, the setup is simple: steady ETF inflows, thinning exchange balances, and resilient risk appetite. A weekly close above the recent local high would open room toward the mid-$120k area; from there, momentum and positive funding could carry price into the $135k magnet. Key risks are a hot inflation print or risk-off equities, either of which could stall the move and force a retest toward the low-$100k band. Can Dogecoin Really Reach $1? DOGE tends to run when retail participation spikes. If Bitcoin refreshes all-time highs, liquidity usually spills into high-beta names. A clean break above $0.30 would strengthen the argument for a stair-step advance toward $0.50 and, in a euphoric tape, a shot at $1. The bear case remains a failure to clear resistance with volumes fading, which would keep the range intact. The MAGACOIN FINANCE angle Early-stage capital is also chasing what they see as the cycle’s next breakout. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been drawing that crowd with a mix of scarcity and utility: limited early allocations, simple tokenomics, and a roadmap built around expanding real-world use. Community growth has accelerated, and multiple rounds have filled fast. The combined pitch is clear: early access is limited , the community is swelling, and upside projections from supporters point to potential 45x-style returns if adoption keeps building. In plain terms, some investors believe a small stake today could scale meaningfully if the project lands its next milestones. What Could Keep BTC and DOGE Moving Macro remains the biggest tailwind – cooling inflation and easier liquidity keep risk assets bid. On the crypto side, product expansion matters: more brokerages adding ETFs, new payments integrations, and healthy derivatives structure (no overheated funding) all help. Watch for sustained ETF net inflows, rising stablecoin supplies, and higher spot volumes; that trio has preceded most major legs up this cycle. Bottom Line Bitcoin has a credible path toward $135k if inflows stay firm, and Dogecoin’s $1 dream lives on whenever liquidity rotates to high-beta. At the same time, investors chasing bigger multiples are scanning earlier-stage opportunities in the middle of the market – where MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a talking point thanks to its fast-filling rounds, expanding community, and limited early access with high-upside potential .

This new contender, a next-generation Layer 2 crypto, isn’t just riding the wave of meme coin madness; it’s building a whole new one. With its presale already smashing past $2.8 million and early stakers eyeing a mind-boggling 917% APY, could Layer Brett be the low-cap crypto gem poised for a 5x surge this very weekend? Layer Brett offers genuine blockchain utility Let’s be real for a moment. Most meme coins, from the omnipresent Shiba Inu to the wildly popular Pepe, or even the original Brett, are purely driven by community hype and little else. They’re fun, absolutely, but they rarely offer genuine blockchain utility. Layer Brett changes the game. This isn’t just another trending cryptocurrency; it’s a Layer 2 blockchain solution, bringing real speed and ultra-low gas fees to the Ethereum ecosystem. Unlike Bonk or Dogecoin, which rely primarily on cultural relevance, Layer Brett is about substance. It offers a tangible escape from the slow, expensive confines of Ethereum Layer 1, providing a robust platform where meme energy meets cutting-edge technology. Layer Brett is a pioneering Layer 2 memecoin built right on Ethereum, designed to fuse viral meme culture with actual blockchain utility. Think about it: a meme coin that actually does something. It’s a community-first project, leveraging the power of memes while delivering real-world blockchain scalability. Layer Brett’s unique features boost long-term potential Near-instantaneous transactions, gas fees cut down to mere pennies (compared to the $10-$20 fees often seen on Ethereum Layer 1), and a significantly smoother experience. It is powered by the safest smart contract blockchain that is known, and it is swift, inexpensive, and scalable beyond imagination. Users can access those high-yield Layer 2-powered rewards within just a few seconds by purchasing and staking $LBRETT with either ETH, USDT, or BNB using MetaMask or Trust Wallet and tapping into such high-yield rewards. In addition, Layer Brett intends to be fully interoperable and bridged out of the restrictions inherent in projects such as the original Brett. Conventional meme coins, including Shiba Inu, Pepe, Dogecoin, and Bonk, are usually the result of an internet joke or viral phenomenon. Their value is primarily a result of speculation and hype within the community, rather than technological innovation or utility. Their explosive growth potential is inviting, but their long-term sustainability is often unpredictable without a clearly established development plan or an appealing business case. The original Brett token on Base, for example, gained traction but lacked the utility that Layer Brett now brings. Layer Brett is a powerful contender for the next big crypto in the upcoming 2025 crypto bull run The crypto market is notoriously volatile. While the Ethereum price prediction can pump spectacularly, bearish pressure remains. Shiba Inu and Pepe have both seen incredible surges, followed by corrections. These assets, though popular, often lack the fundamental utility that provides a strong floor during bearish cycles. With 917% APY staking rewards, a $1 million giveaway planned, and a capped supply of 10 billion tokens, $LBRETT is engineered for explosive gains. This isn’t just another meme token; it’s the best crypto presale, offering a unique blend of fun and functionality that makes it a powerful contender for the next big crypto in the upcoming 2025 crypto bull run and could outperform all Ethereum price prediction models. Layer Brett is still in its presale stages, offering early-entry pricing, but not for long. Don’t miss the opportunity to get in early on the most scalable meme project to ever launch on Ethereum. Brett has broken free, building his own future.

The hourly price chart confirms that bears are making efforts to prevent the Manta price from an immediate surge. However, if the Manta price successfully breaks above $0.204, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.218. MANTAUSD Price Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Manta’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.1869, resulting in a correction to $0.1789. Is MANTA a good investment? Manta’s rapid rise in DeFi TVL charts and alignment with Ethereum ‘s scaling roadmap via technologies like Manta Pacific suggest $MANTA’s potential. Grants support its ecosystem growth, and it leads in ZK technology adoption, promising for blockchain ‘s future. However, regulatory concerns over transaction privacy could affect its long-term viability, potentially impacting ZK protocols like $MANTA. Overall, Manta is a good investment if you want a profitable return in the long term. Why is the Manta price down today? Manta price triggered minor selling pressure after sellers strongly defended $0.2 level. This plunged the price below immediate Fib levels. Will Manta price recover? If bulls hold the price above $0.2, we might see further recovery toward immediate resistance channels. Will Manta price reach $10? In recent months, the Manta network expanded its offerings and established multiple partnerships. If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $10 mark. Will Manta reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment, the MNT price might take several years to reach the $100 milestone. We expect the Manta price to achieve $100 by 2060. Will Manta reach $1000? $1000 is a distant dream for Manta price. However, if everything remains in favor of the altcoin market, we might even see the MNT price hitting $1K. Is Manta a good long-term investment? Investors are bullish on Manta, which has gained significant attention in recent months. If developers continue to build robust utilities for Manta and the roadmap fulfills user demand, it can be a good long-term investment option.

Bitcoin seems to have hit a stable level with institutional investors intervening at key levels. At the same time, altcoins such as Polkadot (DOT) and Cronos (CRO) are emerging as breakout leaders . Analysts are also citing MAGACOIN FINANCE as a retail favorite that is FOMO triggered while marking it as one of the top altcoins to buy in 2025 . Bitcoin Price Prediction: $150K Still in Play Notably, Bitcoin price has been trading sideways between support at $108,000 and resistance at $123,000. Usually, as soon as BTC dips down to $108K, buyers act and form a support for a new upward move. On the other side, the $123K level has been serving as a ceiling which is capping the market for the moment. This price action usually occurs before a larger breakout. According to Fibonacci analysis, the next level is at $135,000 and it can be extended to $150,000 in case momentum is maintained. A daily close above $123K would confirm the bullish setup, and drop below $108K would trigger a pullback near $100K. Despite the short-term sentiment, the long-term outlook is still bullish. Institutional investors have continued to accumulate and the repeated support at $108K indicates hands that are firmly invested in holding higher levels. On the social media front, some of the big predictions are going around again, with some calling for Bitcoin to reach $1 million, including on Twitter from Andrew Tate. While those more extreme predictions catch people’s eye, most analysts are sticking to a more realistic projection of $150K as the peak of the current cycle. Polkadot (DOT): Strong Trading Range Coming Polkadot is one of the best altcoins that are catching up on the coattails of Bitcoin. Analysts estimate DOT will trade between $4.01 and $13.90 this year. With its focus on interoperability and strong developer activity, it has the potential to make bigger moves if altseason gains momentum. Meanwhile, DOT is expanding its ecosystem with the introduction of parachains, setting the stage for further adoption. With the current price still below $10, it is considered a potential gem for investors currently exploring mid-cap altcoin opportunities with greater upside potential. Cronos (CRO): Growth, Exchange Supported Cronos, the native token of Crypto.com, is another altcoin analysts see as a breakout contender. Price projections for 2025 vary widely from $0.072 to $0.76. On the other hand, more conservative models, such as DigitalCoinPrice, expect CRO to trade closer to $0.18 next year. CRO’s key features include its exchange-driven ecosystem, staking integration, and payment integrations. As the exchange activity intensifies during bull cycles, tokens such as CRO tend to experience liquidity and user adoption boosts. At its present price range, it is considered one of the more affordable altcoins with good recovery potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Best Altcoins to Buy and FOMO Play Alongside Bitcoin, DOT and CRO, MAGACOIN FINANCE is swiftly making a name for itself as one of the top altcoins to buy in 2025. One of the reasons behind its popularity is its emphasis on trust – MAGACOIN FINANCE has undergone two audits by HashEx and CertiK, confirming that its Ethereum-based smart contract is secure and transparent. On top of that, its development team is KYC-verified, providing a degree of confidence to investors not seen in many early-stage projects. Retail FOMO has been further fuelled by the fast-moving presale and security first approach. Analysts say this combination of meme energy and verified safety makes it a standout among the smaller-cap altcoins as a high-upside candidate for the next altseason. Final Take As long as the $108K support remains intact, Bitcoin’s trajectory towards $150,000 could be within reach. DOT and CRO are also making it to the list of breakout altcoins, with forecasts indicating steady growth and strong upside potential in 2025. For those investors who prefer early-stage opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE brings another flavor – retail energy, audited security, and rapid growth. As FOMO grows, analysts say it’s one of the most exciting small-cap plays to watch alongside the market’s established breakout leaders.

Back then, ETH surged from under $10 to nearly $1,400 in just over a year. Today, conditions are aligning for another explosive rally, with price projections placing ETH as high as $12,000 before the cycle ends. The catalysts include ETF speculation, institutional adoption of tokenized assets, and Ethereum’s dominant position in decentralized finance. These factors are giving investors a sense of déjà vu, as ETH appears poised to repeat its history of exponential growth. Alongside ETH’s outlook, smaller tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are capturing early-stage investor attention with ROI projections that echo the earliest days of Ethereum itself. Ethereum’s Growing Institutional Base Ethereum is now firmly on the radar of institutions. From JPMorgan to BlackRock, major financial players are exploring Ethereum for settlement, tokenization, and DeFi products. If Ethereum ETFs gain approval in the coming months, analysts believe it could unlock billions in inflows, propelling ETH’s price closer to $10,000 in a relatively short time. Tokenization and DeFi as Growth Engines The rise of tokenized treasuries, corporate bonds, and real estate is strengthening Ethereum’s role as the go-to blockchain for institutional finance. Combined with its established dominance in DeFi protocols, this dual engine of growth sets the stage for ETH’s valuation to surge beyond $12,000 during peak cycle momentum. Second-Chance Opportunity While Ethereum’s long-term story is undeniable, smaller-cap projects are stealing headlines for their short-term ROI potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been compared to early Ethereum for its disruptive potential. For investors who missed Bitcoin and Ethereum early — this is the second chance. With scalability-focused tokenomics and exchange listings expected soon, forecasts suggest MAGACOIN FINANCE could become one of the standout winners of 2025. ETH Price Scenarios Bullish case: ETH hits $12,000 as ETFs are approved and tokenization demand accelerates. Base case: ETH trades between $5,000–$7,000, sustained by steady institutional flows. Bearish case: ETH stalls below $4,500 if regulatory hurdles delay ETF approvals. Conclusion Ethereum’s setup in 2025 mirrors the conditions that fueled its legendary 2017 run, giving analysts confidence in bold price targets. While ETH’s climb toward $12,000 remains a best-case scenario, the foundations for major growth are already in place. For those seeking exponential returns, presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE offer a high-risk, high-reward complement to large-cap holdings. Together, they highlight the dual opportunity of stability and speculation in the current crypto cycle.

Unfortunately, this rollercoaster continues to produce two dangerous tendencies in traders: Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) and panic selling. Both can turn winning portfolios into costly mistakes. While the broader market is showing signs of slowing momentum, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE have managed to keep investor attention strong, raising $13 million in record time during its presale phase. The Trap of FOMO FOMO occurs when investors overwhelm themselves into a project simply because it’s pumping. For example, the token might have rallied 50% in one day or the influencer might have hyped a moonshot, encouraging traders to rush into the token at inflated levels. But most of the time, these late entries occur just before a correction, which leaves buyers stuck on top of the market. Why Panic Selling Hurts On the other side, panic selling is when prices go down and investors try to leave, at a loss, as quickly as possible. While a 20% drop or higher from a portfolio can and often does take place within just a few hours, the natural volatility of crypto can often turn into a polar night rather than the actual end of the world. Those that sell at the bottom miss out on the rebound that eventually happens. The Altcoin That Proves the Bull Market is not Dead Amid this backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a project that stands defiantly against the fear-driven mindset of the broader market. Its $13 million presale success in record time highlights how strong tokenomics and a growing community can create confidence even when other assets struggle. Now many analysts compare its early days to those of several altcoins that went on to skyrocket, leading those who got involved early on to potentially reap life-changing gains. Helpful Crypto Tips on Staying Calm To avoid getting excessively bullish or bearish, traders can embrace behaviors that impose discipline and remove emotional triggers: Have a proper plan : Decide your entering and exit points before buying. Dollar cost averaging (DCA): Invest systematically over time and smooth out volatility. Do Your Own Research: Only consider investments you understand and believe in. Automate decisions: Reduce emotion by utilizing stop-loss and take-profit features. Zoom out: The longer-term trend can be seen by looking at weekly or yearly charts. Step away from noise: Minimize exposure to hype-driven social media Invest sensibly: Only put in more than you can afford to lose. Final Thoughts Crypto success is rarely a matter of timing every move perfectly. It is a game of patience, tactics, and holding your emotions in check. By not succumbing to FOMO or panic selling, investors can remain confident while riding through the volatility. And as seen with the success of the MAGACOIN FINANCE presale, there are opportunities available for those who remain disciplined and focus on projects with strong fundamentals.

BTC Treasury Companies: Interesting 1:4 Ratio Pops Up,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-vs-btc-treasury-companies-interesting-14-ratio-pops-up/,"Bitcoin has held up strongly compared to the companies that have adopted it as part of their treasury strategy, but the gap between the digital asset and these firms is becoming more pronounced. Over the last 10 weeks, stocks of Bitcoin Treasury Companies (BTCTCs) have fallen sharply, shedding between 50% and 80% of their value. This divergence shows an unusual pattern, effectively creating a “1:4 ratio” in cycle behavior. Related Reading: MemeCore Explodes 3,800% For ATH — But Is A Collapse Around The Corner? 12 Mini-Bear Markets In 18 Months Bitcoin’s price action in the past 18 months has mostly been in a bullish cycle on the macro end, with the leading cryptocurrency creating new price highs upon new price highs within this period. This has caused an increase in many companies adopting a Bitcoin treasury strategy in their balance books, also known as Bitcoin Treasury Companies (BTCTCs). However, according to data from crypto commentator Mark Moss, the stock prices of companies with a Bitcoin strategy have diverged from Bitcoin, shedding between 50% and 80% of their stock value over the last ten weeks. This divergence, Moss noted, shows an unusual 1:4 cycle ratio where corporate Bitcoin holders undergo four mini-cycles for every one Bitcoin market cycle. The Japanese firm MetaPlanet is the prime case study for this occurrence. Over the last 18 months, its stock ($MTPLF) has gone through 12 distinct drawdowns, ranging from sharp single-day plunges to prolonged declines stretching over months. On average, these downturns erased 32.4% of value and lasted about 20 days. The shortest correction was a brutal one-day slide of 22.2% in April 2024, while the longest and deepest crash lasted 119 days from July to November 2024, wiping out 78.6%. The chart below, of MetaPlanet’s stock, shows repeated selloff cycles that appear far more compressed and extreme than Bitcoin’s price corrections in the past 18 months or so. MetaPlanet Stock Price: Mark Moss on X Correlation With Bitcoin? Interestingly, only 41.7% of MetaPlanet’s drawdowns have directly lined up with Bitcoin’s corrections. Out of the 12 mini-bear markets identified, just 5 occurred in sync with BTC’s declines. The majority (7 out of 12) were unrelated to Bitcoin and were instead caused by company-specific factors. According to Moss, these factors include warrant exercises, fundraising activities, and compression of the Bitcoin premium that MetaPlanet trades at compared to its BTC holdings. The two most severe drawdowns, however, did overlap with Bitcoin volatility. The -78.6% collapse in late 2024 and a -54.4% drawdown both coincided with periods when Bitcoin itself was undergoing corrections. These overlapping events suggest that while BTC volatility sometimes adds to the drawdown, MetaPlanet’s stock selloffs tend to extend beyond Bitcoin downturns. Essentially, what this means is that instead of BTC 4-year cycles, BTCTCs are now more like 4 cycles in 1 year. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is in a correction phase and is struggling to hold above the $110,000 support level. Popular BTCTC stocks are also struggling with downtrends alongside Bitcoin. Strategy’s stock is down 37.1% from its 52-week high, while MetaPlanet is down 58.6%. Others, like The Smarter Web Company PLC (-83.6%) and The Blockchain Group (-70.7%), are at greater losses.

In 2025, investors are looking for the top new meme coins to invest in this year, projects that blend cultural relevance with innovative mechanics. Among them, BullZilla’s presale stands out with its Mutation Mechanism, Bonk carries the banner for Solana’s community-driven surge, and Binance Coin shows how a token can evolve beyond utility into a powerhouse of momentum. Each of these represents a piece of the puzzle when it comes to identifying the top new meme coins to invest in this year, offering growth potential that appeals to students, analysts, and blockchain developers alike. For anyone evaluating strategies in this market, BullZilla , Bonk, and Binance Coin showcase why they’re among the top new meme coins to invest in this year. BullZilla Presale’s Mutation Mechanism Fuels Explosive Momentum BullZilla ($BZIL) is in its 1st stage, known as “The Project Trinity Boom,” currently in Phase 4. Its price sits at $0.00002575, with over $183,000 raised and more than 620 token holders already onboard. Early adopters have seen remarkable results, with ROI reaching 20,371.49% from Stage 1D to the listing price of $0.0052. Even the earliest joiners enjoyed 34.95% gains before Stage 1D, proving how quickly value can compound. At the heart of Bull Zilla is the Mutation Mechanism, which sets this project apart. Half of the total supply, 80 billion tokens, has been allocated to presale. The Progressive Price Engine automatically increases token cost every time $100,000 is raised or every 48 hours without that milestone being met. This time- and funding-driven model guarantees constant movement, rewarding those who act early while sustaining momentum across the presale timeline. Layered onto this is the Roar Burn Mechanism. Each milestone in BullZilla’s journey triggers a live burn of tokens from the Burn Pool Reserve. Every burn decreases supply, and each Roar Surge announcement amplifies the project’s progress across the community. Scarcity grows with every stage, supporting higher value over time. Bonk’s Buzz: Solana’s Meme Culture Engine Roars Back Bonk continues to dominate conversations as the leading meme coin on the Solana blockchain. With its roots tied to community culture, Bonk has grown into a utility token that integrates across Solana’s DeFi and NFT spaces. Its strength lies in its symbolism. Bonk embodies Solana’s resurgence, representing a community-driven comeback that goes beyond speculation. The coin’s ongoing burns and liquidity integrations have made it more than just a meme, it’s a cultural cornerstone with actual on-chain relevance. Market momentum shows resilience. Bonk’s short-term patterns point to steady consolidation with potential for breakout. Its role in Solana’s broader adoption strategy ensures that it remains deeply embedded in the ecosystem. Investors and developers alike are watching Bonk closely, not only for potential returns but also for its cultural importance in shaping Solana’s narrative. For financial students and analysts, Bonk demonstrates how meme coins can evolve into community assets that drive utility while retaining their viral appeal. Binance Coin’s Momentum: Utility Meets Technical Green Light Binance Coin (BNB) is not new, but its trajectory proves why it belongs in the list of top new meme coins to invest in this year. What started as a token for trading discounts has grown into a pillar of the Binance ecosystem, driving smart contract applications, staking, and cross-platform utility. BNB’s momentum in 2025 is powered by strong technical structures. Its support levels have held firm, with bullish patterns forming on charts that hint at breakouts toward new highs. Traders are eyeing resistance zones around $900, with potential paths extending into four-digit territory as adoption deepens. Beyond speculation, BNB holds undeniable utility. It underpins transaction activity, fuels decentralized applications, and serves as a governance tool across Binance’s network. That combination of tangible use cases and strong investor trust has turned BNB into a hybrid of meme culture momentum and institutional-grade utility. For blockchain developers and financial analysts, BNB exemplifies how utility and technical momentum can align to create a coin with both speculative and structural growth potential. Conclusion: A Trio That Defines Meme Coin Evolution BullZilla, Bonk, and Binance Coin embody the evolution of meme coins in 2025. BullZilla’s Mutation Mechanism and Roar Burn create a presale model that engineers scarcity and momentum. Bonk anchors Solana’s cultural revival while offering meaningful integration in DeFi and NFTs. Binance Coin proves that what begins as a meme-driven token can transform into a utility-backed force with technical momentum. These three projects together highlight the top new meme coins to invest in this year, showing how innovation, culture, and utility can converge. For investors evaluating strategies, this trio demonstrates why BullZilla, Bonk, and Binance Coin deserve a place on the shortlist of the top new meme coins to invest in this year. By combining presale design, community energy, and ecosystem strength, they illustrate why they stand tall as the top new meme coins to invest in this year.

51310537,https://timestabloid.com/?p=82112,1757201416,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP to $22? How Central Bank Investment Could Skyrocket XRP Price,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-to-22-how-central-bank-investment-could-skyrocket-xrp-price/,"A recent analysis examines the possible implications for XRP if the ten largest central banks worldwide were to allocate a share of their combined $13 trillion in foreign exchange reserves to the digital asset. The findings suggest that even limited exposure at this level could significantly influence XRP’s valuation, though such an outcome remains hypothetical. As of report time, XRP trades around $2.80 and maintains a circulating supply of roughly 59.4 billion tokens. This gives the asset a market capitalization close to $172 billion, placing it among the highest-valued cryptocurrencies. While this level is substantial, central bank participation would represent a scale of adoption that could redefine XRP’s market dynamics. Potential Outcomes Based on Reserve Allocations If the largest central banks, including those in the United States, China, Japan, Switzerland, India, and Russia, allocated 1% of their reserves to XRP, the purchase would equal about $130 billion. Under straightforward market cap arithmetic, this would raise XRP’s valuation to over $302 billion, translating to a token price near $5.09. Increasing the allocation to 3% (approximately $390 billion) would place the price around $9.47 per token, while a 5% commitment ($650 billion) could lift the market cap above $822 billion, with XRP trading near $13.84. Extended Case at 10% Reserves In a more aggressive scenario, where central banks committed 10% of reserves, approximately $1.3 trillion, XRP’s market cap would surpass $1.47 trillion. At that point, each token could be valued at roughly $22.58. This represents nearly an eightfold increase from current levels. It is important to emphasize, however, that these projections rely on direct arithmetic conversions between inflows and market capitalization. In practice, large-scale institutional purchases of this magnitude could produce a multiplier effect , with market reactions driving prices well beyond the calculated figures. Even comparatively smaller allocations, such as a $1 billion purchase by a single government, would likely generate disproportionate impacts on market sentiment and trading activity. Likelihood of Central Bank Participation While the numbers illustrate potential price effects, the probability of such adoption remains low. Governments and central banks have primarily concentrated on Bitcoin when discussing digital reserves. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 For example, the U.S. government has passed legislation governing stablecoins and has considered establishing a national cryptocurrency reserve, though its primary focus remains Bitcoin. Elsewhere, China and Russia have shown interest in using cryptocurrencies primarily as instruments to support their local currencies, with stablecoins and Bitcoin receiving most of the attention. Currently, ten countries collectively hold over 517,000 BTC, valued at more than $56 billion. This underscores the continuing dominance of Bitcoin in institutional strategies. By contrast, alternative assets such as XRP, Ethereum, and Cardano remain largely outside the scope of official government holdings. The analysis highlights that central bank allocations, even at minimal levels, could theoretically push XRP’s valuation to unprecedented levels. Nonetheless, the practical likelihood of such an outcome is uncertain. At present, Bitcoin continues to be the digital asset most favored by governments, leaving XRP and other altcoins in a speculative position regarding large-scale institutional adoption.

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000430. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000699 and an average trading price of $0.000673 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The recent launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1?

The key support to hold is $0.0000861, while the main barrier above is $0.0000915. On the 4-hour chart, the price is stuck in a tight range with low volume and moving averages flattening. FLOKI on the daily timeframe As of September 6, 2025, FLOKI continues to grind sideways near $0.000089 with little conviction, holding above local support at $0.0000861 but capped by resistance at $0.0000915 and higher at $0.0000946. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The 21-day SMA at $0.0000970 is sloping down, reinforcing broader bearish pressure, while MACD remains deep in negative territory with no crossover signal yet. The structure shows lower highs and mixed candles, suggesting indecision after the late-August drop. A daily close below $0.0000861 risks fresh downside continuation, while reclaiming $0.0000915–$0.0000946 would be the first step toward neutralizing the downtrend. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe On the shorter timeframe, FLOKI bounced modestly to $0.0000896 but remains squeezed between $0.0000880 and $0.0000900. The Alligator indicator shows its lines converging and flattening, reflecting stalled momentum and a potential volatility squeeze. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Volume has faded notably since yesterday’s surge, underscoring weak follow-through. Until price decisively breaks above $0.0000905 resistance (blue Alligator line) or loses $0.0000880, the chop continues.

Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~11x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need up to $95 billion market cap to hit $0.01, over 110x its current value.

Because of its reputation on social media and its focus on community, Dogecoin is still one of the most well-known tokens in the digital space. However, as the market has matured, investors are now looking for initiatives that have long-term utility and concrete value. This has created space for utility-based tokens like Remittix (RTX) , a presale project that is picking up steam with a payments-first approach. Dogecoin Price Prediction and Market Trends Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.2168, up 0.78% over the previous day. Its trading volume has decreased by a significant 11.48% to $1.54 billion. These numbers obviously demonstrate that despite Dogecoin’s robust liquidity and market presence, trading activity is susceptible to the volatility typical of assets based on memes. Dogecoin Price Prediction is more of a market sentiment than technological development, so it is narrow in outlook compared to new crypto projects. This realization has led the majority of investors to diversify into low cap crypto gems and best crypto presale 2025 potential. Tokens with utility and adoption focus are now considered the next big altcoin 2025 and they are taking a different direction from speculative meme coins. Remittix Builds Momentum Ahead of Q3 Wallet Launch One of those projects that are gaining attention is Remittix (RTX), which is currently valued at $0.1030 per token. The project has already raised more than $24 million in its presale, with more than 645 million tokens sold. Unlike Dogecoin, which is based on community culture, Remittix comes across as a crypto with real-world utility, attempting to solve inefficiencies in cross-border remittances. The Remittix DeFi initiative facilitates the transfer of crypto directly to legacy bank accounts in over 30 nations, bridging digital and fiat worlds. With its beta wallet launch set for Q3, the initiative has already made public impending listings on BitMart and LBank, its push to centralized exchanges and broader liquidity. Why Remittix Is Gathering Momentum Global Reach: Direct crypto-to-bank transfers in a number of regions Utility-First: Focusing on real payments, not speculation Strong Presale: Raised over $24M with fast-growing adoption Wallet Beta Q3: Mobile-first solution for everyday use The Bigger Picture The shift in interest from meme tokens to crypto solving real-world problems reflects general investor sentiment. While Dogecoin is still in the limelight, whether it belongs in long-term portfolios is debatable. Compared to this, projects like Remittix answer to the demands of low gas fee crypto, cross-chain DeFi projects and crypto with passive income potential through scalable adoption. With a growing player base, secured exchange listings and a $250,000 giveaway ongoing, Remittix continues to build momentum. For those tracking the Dogecoin Price Prediction, the advent of projects such as RTX illustrates how the market is shifting toward utility-based innovation rather than hype-based pumps.

XRP seems stuck in a narrow trading range, while community sentiment is surprisingly drifting toward a new name, Remittix (RTX) . Many investors now see more upside in this utility-driven altcoin than in traditional picks. XRP Price Today: Stuck Below $3 XRP is trading around $2.81, stuck between resistance at $3.00–$3.10 and support around $2.70–$2.80. Technical indicators offer a mixed picture. The MACD suggests a bullish crossover in the near future, while the RSI shows increased buying pressure. For XRP to hit $3.70 or higher, a clear break over $3.10 would be required. If it fails to hold above $2.80, a decline toward $2.50 or below might be exposed. Future developments in regulations may also have an impact. While unfavorable decisions or market resistance may result in sideways or bearish pressure, a positive outcome or the approval of an ETF may provide bullish momentum. Why Remittix Is Becoming the Focal Point Despite XRP’s foundational strengths, enthusiasm is leaning toward Remittix (RTX) , a fresh PayFi altcoin with real-world use. It’s not just hype. Here’s what’s catching attention: Raised over $24 million in its presale by selling more than 645 million tokens at $0.1030 each The upcoming Q3 beta wallet launch supports instant crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries, enabling real-time Confirmed listings on BitMart and LBank, enhancing liquidity and access A deflationary token model, CertiK audit and a $250,000 community giveaway, raising visibility and trust Analysts call Remittix (RTX) “XRP 2.0”, fading back the meme narrative and spotlighting real usability. It’s being beaten down the hype path, not because of symbolic appeal, but due to tangible adoption potential in a $19 trillion global payments market. XRP vs Remittix: A Side-by-Side Look XRP trades on legacy trust, funded infrastructure and institutional connections, but momentum feels capped until the next big catalyst surfaces. Remittix stands out with a user-first design, funding traction, global usability and fast-rising investor heat. Remittix is gaining support from community members who once championed Ripple but now see greater upside in a project that solves current pain points. That’s a rare shift in the crypto world. The Takeaway for Investors Analysing today’s XRP price prediction paints a picture of cautious optimism but limited upside unless charts break cleanly above $3.10. Meanwhile, Remittix offers a more aggressive upside story grounded in real financial utility, not just chart patterns. Consider a mix to balance stability and growth: XRP could serve as your foundation. At the same time, a calculated position in Remittix offers a calculated bet on rapid adoption and utility-led expansion.

Recently, a crypto expert has added fuel to the discussion, unveiling a detailed step-by-step approach he believes could turn XRP into a million-dollar opportunity for investors. The $1 Million XRP Wealth Strategy Austin Hilton, a crypto investor and expert, has outlined his approach to building generational wealth with XRP in a video post on X social media. Rather than chasing speculative short-term gains , Hilton emphasized a strategy built on three strong pillars: patience, consistency, and discipline. Hilton revealed that he has been steadily accumulating XRP for years, treating it similarly to his diversified approach in traditional markets like stocks and bonds. Rather than placing all his capital in one asset, he considers XRP a part of his portfolio alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. His first step toward reaching $1 million with XRP is to hold the token until it delivers a 30x return or more—a move he projects could eventually push it toward the $80 to $90 price range. For him, time is the most important ingredient, whether it takes one year or several. The second part of his strategy is continuous buying, even during bearish periods . Hilton emphasized that many investors tend to panic during downturns, but he sees red days as opportunities to accumulate more XRP at discounted prices. He noted that the cryptocurrency’s present $2.8 – $2.85 trading range is a bargain relative to his long-term price expectations. Lastly, Hilton stressed the importance of removing emotions from investing. In his view, panic selling destroys potential long-term gains. He explained that sharp market declines do not shake his resolve, underscoring his confidence in XRP’s future outlook . The crypto expert has also clarified that the principles behind his $1 million XRP strategy are equally effective when applied across other digital assets like BTC and ETH. XRP Price Analysis: Key Levels To Watch Market expert Egrag Crypto has shared the near-term hurdles the XRP price must clear to break past its current consolidation range. His latest analysis revealed that XRP recently slipped to $2.77 , putting bullish momentum under pressure. The analyst noted that reclaiming the $2.85 on a 4-hour close is critical for establishing stability and reaching higher targets. If XRP can hold above this threshold, the next price milestones are expected at $2.9 and $2.95, with a potential breakout target of $3.13. Achieving these levels could open the door for XRP to challenge mid-range resistances at $3.45 and $3.65. Still, Egrag Crypto cautions that the risk of a pullback remains . His chart shows that a failure to close above $2.85 repeatedly could trigger a retreat to $2.65 or lower, reviving bearish momentum . The $2.75 level has emerged as a critical support zone, acting as the last line of defense before deeper corrections.",XRP|Austin Hilton|bitcoin|Egrag Crypto|Ethereum|ripple|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-07 00:00:01

Both remain respected assets, but 2025 is proving that digital assets may offer stronger long-term performance. Real estate markets are under pressure from rising borrowing costs, while gold, despite its stability, struggles to generate meaningful returns. Cryptocurrencies, by contrast, combine scarcity, utility, and growth potential. Analysts argue that holding the right coins over the next decade could deliver gains that far exceed traditional havens. While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate this conversation, a third contender — MAGACOIN FINANCE — is emerging as a high-risk, high-reward opportunity drawing investor curiosity. Bitcoin: digital gold with exponential reach Bitcoin is the natural comparison to gold. Both are scarce, but Bitcoin is more portable, divisible, and borderless. Its 21 million hard cap ensures that supply cannot be manipulated, making it an attractive hedge against inflation. In 2025, Bitcoin ETFs brought in over $20 billion in inflows, further cementing its credibility among institutions. Analysts believe that while Bitcoin may no longer deliver 100x returns, its growth potential still far outpaces gold. For long-term holders, Bitcoin is the anchor asset for building generational wealth. Ethereum: infrastructure for the new economy Ethereum extends beyond being a store of value. It is the foundation for decentralized finance, NFTs, and Web3 applications. The approval of ETH ETFs in 2025 added legitimacy, attracting pension funds and large asset managers. Meanwhile, Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum and zkSync are scaling Ethereum to mainstream levels. With its deflationary mechanism burning millions of ETH, scarcity is tightening. Analysts argue Ethereum’s dual role as both infrastructure and investment asset makes it uniquely positioned to outperform real estate, which faces liquidity and regulatory hurdles. While Bitcoin and Ethereum provide stability and infrastructure, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting attention as the high-beta complement capable of delivering exponential returns . Analysts suggest it could achieve a staggering 7,800% ROI , drawing parallels to SHIB’s early mania phase. What sets it apart is legitimacy: MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the few presales to pass both CertiK and HashEx audits , giving it credibility absent in most meme-inspired tokens. The PATRIOT50X bonus code has amplified demand, with thousands redeeming it to boost allocations by 50%. Rapid presale sellouts signal tightening supply, and forecasts of 35x growth at launch are fueling urgency. For investors used to the steady pace of gold or real estate, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the other side of the spectrum — asymmetric risk that could become life-changing reward if momentum holds. The case against traditional assets Real estate has historically been a reliable wealth builder, but current conditions are eroding its appeal. Rising interest rates, stagnant wages, and oversupply in certain markets are dampening returns. Gold remains a hedge, but it is limited by its inability to generate yield or scale. Compared to crypto’s innovation cycles and global reach, both appear sluggish. Analysts suggest that while traditional assets still belong in portfolios, their growth ceiling is increasingly obvious. Building a balanced allocation For long-term investors, balance is key. Bitcoin provides scarcity-driven security, Ethereum delivers infrastructure and scalability, and MAGACOIN FINANCE introduces cultural-driven asymmetric upside. Together, they cover the spectrum from stability to explosive potential. Analysts note that portfolios structured this way not only outperform traditional havens but also remain adaptable to market shifts. Conclusion Real estate and gold will always have their place as conservative stores of value, but the future of wealth creation is shifting. Bitcoin and Ethereum are positioned to outperform through scarcity and utility , while MAGACOIN FINANCE adds the element of exponential growth that traditional assets cannot match. For long-term holders, the next decade may prove that the best safe havens are not physical, but digital.

Tokens like Cardano (ADA) and Pepe (PEPE) have shown both powerful rallies and steep corrections over the past year, leaving investors eager for fresh opportunities. While these assets continue to trade with significant volatility, analysts are now pointing to a new contender gaining serious traction – MAGACOIN FINANCE. Seen as a project capable of redefining the crypto landscape, it is attracting both retail and institutional attention with its ambitious roadmap and rapidly growing community. ADA and PEPE Price Performance Cardano began late 2024 trading at just $0.33 before spiking above $1.20 in early 2025, fueled by renewed optimism around staking and Layer-2 developments. However, the coin struggled to maintain momentum, slipping back toward the $0.80 level as network growth slowed. For many, ADA remains a long-term play, but its price action suggests investor patience is being tested. Pepe, on the other hand, has experienced a rollercoaster year of extreme volatility. After surging on meme hype and community-driven demand, the token saw dramatic peaks and troughs before stabilizing around $0.000009. For short-term traders, PEPE’s swings offered opportunity, but for long-term investors, the unpredictability has become a concern. The Rise of MAGACOIN FINANCE In contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been turning heads with explosive presale growth and a unique strategy that goes beyond hype. Unlike meme tokens that rely heavily on trends, MAGACOIN has built its foundation on great tokenomics, utility-focused expansion, and a clear long-term vision . Experts believe this combination could allow it to capture the same type of early-mover advantage once seen in the early days of other legendary coins. What’s fueling the buzz? Early investors are eyeing potential gains as high as 40x from presale prices , thanks to soaring demand and limited early allocations. The project has already raised millions in record time, signaling that market confidence is strong. With utility-driven milestones ahead, MAGACOIN is positioning itself as one of the few emerging altcoins capable of redefining the market narrative in 2025. Looking Ahead for ADA and PEPE Both Cardano and Pepe will continue to have a role in the market. ADA’s future depends largely on whether its ecosystem upgrades can deliver sustained adoption, while Pepe’s fate remains tied to whether its community can keep momentum alive. Yet the spotlight has clearly shifted toward newer, high-growth projects that offer stronger upside potential. Conclusion The crypto market thrives on innovation, and investors are constantly searching for the next breakout. While ADA and PEPE have delivered exciting runs, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as the project many believe could deliver the next wave of massive returns. With analysts forecasting up to 40x gains , the project’s rise highlights just how fast the crypto landscape can be redefined.

51312205,https://thecoinrise.com/traders-choose-blockdags-4500-developers-2900-upside-over-doges-30-climb-aave-370-battle/,1757203221,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/51312205.jpeg,"Traders Choose BlockDAG’s 4,500 Developers & 2,900% Upside Over DOGE’s 30% Climb & AAVE $370 Battle",https://thecoinrise.com/traders-choose-blockdags-4500-developers-2900-upside-over-doges-30-climb-aave-370-battle/,"Crypto markets are heating up once more, but not every signal carries the same weight. Dogecoin is forming a symmetrical triangle that could trigger a 30% breakout if retail traders push it beyond resistance. AAVE is also drawing attention as it challenges the $370 mark, supported by a record $71B locked in DeFi, though the risk of rejection still lingers. Both stories show potential, yet they remain tied to confirmation before any decisive move. Traders are watching, waiting for the right signal to validate the next direction. Breaking from this pattern is BlockDAG (BDAG) . With 4,500 developers onboard and more than 300 decentralized applications in progress, it is not waiting for post-launch momentum. Instead, it is building adoption in advance, creating a foundation that sets it apart as the best-performing crypto analysis candidate in today’s market. What’s more, ahead of its upcoming Singapore Deployment Event, BDAG is available at a special rate of $0.0013, setting up a potential 38x return once it hits $0.05. Dogecoin’s Chart Signals Potential 30% Upside Dogecoin has regained attention after dropping from $0.24 to $0.21 and then rebounding above its earlier levels. This movement came alongside broader market shifts following recent Federal Reserve remarks, making DOGE one of the most-watched altcoins in the short term. Analysts note that a symmetrical triangle is forming on the 4-hour chart, often seen as a continuation pattern. If the price can break convincingly above the upper trendline, projections point to a move toward $0.30, nearly a 30% increase from current levels. Confirmation will be key, with traders watching for multiple candle closes above resistance. Given Dogecoin’s liquidity and retail-driven nature, such breakouts carry follow-through. Aave Approaches Critical $370 Breakout Aave is drawing attention as it nears the $370 resistance level, a threshold not held since the end of last year. The token recovered steadily from lows near $190 earlier in the year, reflecting improved structure and growing confidence. Now, the focus is on whether Aave can clear this ceiling to spark a larger upward rally. Supporting this momentum are strong fundamentals. The protocol’s total value locked has reached an all-time high of $71.15 billion, while borrowing costs remain attractive compared to traditional banking. Together, these factors suggest a favorable setup, though a failure to sustain above $370 could lead to a pullback that traders are watching closely. 4,500 Developers and Nearly $400M Raised Put BlockDAG Ahead of the Curve BlockDAG is rewriting the script on adoption in crypto. Where most projects launch first and then struggle to attract builders, BlockDAG has already secured more than 4,500 developers before its network even goes live. Over 300 decentralized applications are in progress, a clear sign that creators are committing resources and time to a system they see as part of the future. This kind of developer-led traction is rare and often signals the foundation for lasting growth. The team’s execution has matched this momentum with precision. Tools like the Explorer, IDE, and Smart Contracts Wizard are not promises but working frameworks that developers can already use. By delivering infrastructure early, BlockDAG is giving builders everything they need to test, refine, and deploy applications ahead of launch. This approach mirrors the disciplined rollouts of Silicon Valley, setting it apart from typical early-stage crypto ventures. For participants, the presale numbers confirm the story. With nearly $400 million raised and 25.9 billion coins sold, BlockDAG is not just capturing attention; it is converting that attention into capital at scale. To celebrate its next big chapter, BlockDAG has reduced its presale price to $0.0013 in advance of the Singapore Deployment Event. With launch already set at $0.05, this celebratory cut creates a 38x ROI opportunity for those who enter during this final phase. Early adopters have already seen a 2,900% return since batch 1, underscoring why timing matters. With 3 million miners active on the X1 App and a developer community that is already building, BlockDAG is entering the market with both momentum and infrastructure. History shows that when developers lead, price action follows, and BlockDAG appears positioned right on that threshold. Looking Forward Through the lens of market analysis, Dogecoin offers a retail-driven trade that relies on sentiment, while AAVE represents DeFi’s resilience with its test at $370. Both hold potential, but their outcomes remain tied to short-term confirmation. BlockDAG, however, shows traction that can be measured. With nearly $400M raised, 25.9 billion coins sold, and a community of 3 million miners, its foundation is already in place. Early buyers have gained 2,900% since batch 1, and at $0.0013, the path to further upside points to 38x. This makes BlockDAG the top trending crypto to watch in 2025.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-this-may-be-your-last-opportunity-to-buy-xrp/,"XRP has remained under pressure for several weeks, with prices stabilizing around $2.80. Despite this consolidation, some analysts argue that the current market may represent one of the final opportunities to acquire the asset at relatively low levels before an anticipated rebound. Vandell Aljarrah, co-founder of Black Swan Capitalist, recently stated that September could mark the final period in which investors are able to purchase XRP and other major digital assets at discounted prices. His comments have added to the ongoing debate about whether XRP is preparing for its next upward phase. This may be your last month to buy digital assets such as XRP and others at these low valuations. — Vandell | Black Swan Capitalist (@vandell33) September 5, 2025 Market Context The bearish tone surrounding XRP has largely mirrored broader market conditions. Bitcoin, the market leader, has fallen sharply from its August record of $124,457 and now trades near $110,800, reflecting an 11% decline. The shift occurred immediately after Bitcoin’s peak, placing downward pressure on most cryptocurrencies, including XRP. Over the past month, XRP fell as low as $2.69 before recovering slightly, resulting in a 6.2% monthly decline. Analysts argue that the prolonged sideways trend in both Bitcoin and altcoins is reaching an inflection point, with expectations of renewed momentum emerging across the sector. Analysts’ Views on XRP’s Outlook Several market commentators besides Aljarrah have provided bullish outlooks for XRP, each highlighting different technical indicators. Ripple Van Winkle, a crypto analyst, observed that XRP has declined by about 25% since reaching $3.65 in July. He noted that accumulation by large investors could signal a market bottom. According to his analysis, $2.70 serves as strong support, while breaking resistance at $2.90 could open the path toward $3.70, with potential for an extended move toward $5. Similarly, analyst Dark Defender has argued that XRP recently completed a corrective phase, positioning it to enter the next bullish cycle. Using Elliott Wave theory, he projected a possible rise to $4.39, contingent on XRP maintaining support at $2.85. This level also corresponds with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement, reinforcing its importance as a price floor. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another analyst, EGRAG, pointed to broader technical signals in favor of XRP’s longer-term strength. He emphasized three factors: resilience on the monthly chart, stability above the $1.99 Fibonacci level, and sustained price action above the 21-day exponential moving average. Based on these metrics, he suggested a near-term target of $3.90 and outlined long-term projections reaching as high as $46, which would mark gains of over 1,500% if realized. Diverging Market Reactions While analysts present increasingly bullish scenarios, market participants remain divided. Some investors responding to Aljarrah’s remarks questioned the likelihood of an imminent surge, noting that similar warnings about “last chances” to purchase XRP at low levels have been issued repeatedly without significant price appreciation. Others, however, share the view that XRP’s extended consolidation may be setting the stage for a broader upward trend. The discussion around XRP highlights growing expectations of a breakout after weeks of stagnation. Analysts point to technical support, whale accumulation, and broader market cycles as evidence of potential upside. Nevertheless, skepticism persists among traders who caution that further corrections cannot be ruled out. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Here’s what you need to do,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/buying-gold-for-the-first-time/,"Gold is exploding right now. New buyers are piling in, old names are breaking records, and global fear is doing what it always does, pushing people to chase this metal like it’s the last life raft in a sinking market. And if you’re thinking about grabbing a piece of the action for the first time ever, then you’re late, but luckily, not too late. You just need to know what the heck is going on, and for that, we got you. You see, investors are worried about war, inflation, central bank politics, and rate decisions that never seem clear. The result has been a stampede into gold, with the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index smashing through its all-time high for the first time since the 2011 euro debt crisis and the U.S. credit downgrade. This time, it’s the wars in the Middle East, Russia-Ukraine, and yes, Donald Trump trying to kick Lisa Cook out of the Fed, that’s stirred the pot. Nobody knows what interest rates are doing anymore. Gold mining stocks break records But hey, miners are on fire. Big names like Newmont Corp., Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd., Wheaton Precious Metals Corp., and Barrick Mining Corp. have all jumped more than 80% this year. Newmont’s earnings more than doubled in 2024. Analysts say it’ll go up another 50% this year. That’s after two full years of weak numbers. It’s now trading at the highest price in over three years. “Newmont is my top pick,” said Martin Pradier of Veritas Investment Research. “Return on equity is almost twice as high as last year.” He’s not the only one paying attention. Agnico Eagle also made his list, mostly because of their assets in Canada and “strong execution.” Agnico’s U.S.-listed stock soared over 90% this year, hitting record highs. Its earnings are also expected to grow, despite a drop in gold output. Barrick had some trouble in Mali and took a $1 billion net charge in Q2, but the stock still climbed 80% year-to-date. Behind all that? Simple. Spot gold is near $3,600 per ounce. That’s a 35% gain just this year. And when gold gets hot, miners follow. Some, like Blair duQuesnay, a financial planner and advisor at Ritholtz Wealth Management, are pointing to investor sentiment: “Gold has been trending higher and getting a lot of attention.” She says it’s the go-to when things fall apart. And it is. Always has been. Sameer Samana at Wells Fargo Investment Institute agrees. He calls gold a classic safety play in “bad economic times.” According to research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, gold does well in low-rate environments and periods of chaos. That box is checked. Multiple times. Wells Fargo’s latest strategy report says global central banks are buying more gold too. Add geopolitical stress to that, and the demand picture just keeps getting stronger. Investors choose ETFs over physical gold Now, if you’re serious about buying gold, there are two main ways to do it. You either buy the real thing, bars or coins, or you buy financial products that track the price. Most experts say skip the coins. Why? Because physical gold is expensive to store, and even more expensive to sell. You lose money on transaction fees, and keeping it safe is a problem. “It’s much more inefficient to own physical gold,” said duQuesnay. She’s not wrong. Once you’ve dealt with the logistics, you’ll wish you’d bought an ETF. That’s why most investors stick with ETFs. The biggest ones are SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU). They move with the price of gold, they’re cheap, and they’re easy to trade. “Gold ETFs are going to be the most liquid, tax efficient and low-cost way to invest,” duQuesnay added. But not everyone agrees on how much to hold. Most financial advisors don’t go above 3% of the full portfolio. Some, like duQuesnay herself, don’t use gold at all. “It’s a trendy asset. Are we in the third inning or the ninth inning of this rally?” she said. It’s a fair question. Meanwhile, Andrew Musgraves from VanEck warned about past cycles. “In past gold rallies of 2010, 2011, for example, they kind of blew out their budgets and were penalized by the market for that,” he said. This time, miners have kept their spending in check. They’re protecting margins and turning those high prices into real profit. So far, it’s working. But this isn’t a sure thing. Nothing in commodities ever is. But if you’re looking to get in, now you know how the game is being played.

The crypto market leader now trades near the $111,000 price level and stands 10.46% away from its all-time high. Meanwhile, recent data from blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant has highlighted an intriguing trend in the accumulating activity of Bitcoin treasuries. Related Reading: Old Bitcoin Supply Unlocks: 7,626 BTC Aged 3–5 Years Moves Onchain Bitcoin Treasury Holdings Hit 840K In 2025 In a weekly report posted on September 5, CryptoQuant reports that Bitcoin treasury holdings by public and private companies have reached a new record of 840,000 BTC in 2025, representing the overwhelming institutional interest seen in the present market cycle. However, beneath this headline milestone lies a stark, cautious shift in market dynamics. Notably, monthly purchases have slowed dramatically, raising questions about the sustainability of corporate demand for Bitcoin. Through combined efforts with bitcointreasuries.net.data, CryptoQuant has discovered that Strategy, being the most aggressive institutional accumulator of Bitcoin, has sharply reduced its buying pace by 97% over the last 12 months. Notably, after acquiring an all-time high of 134,000 BTC in November 2024, the Saylor-led company’s purchases dropped to just 3,700 BTC in August 2025. While other Bitcoin treasuries have stepped in more cautiously, adding 14,800 BTC in August compared to Strategy’s relatively small 3,700 BTC buy, their volumes remain far below the peaks seen earlier in 2025. Notably, these other companies had produced a temporary surge in early 2025, recording a 66,000 BTC all-time high purchase in January, which has clearly faded following their August reports. Notably, all this data indicates that while total holdings are at record levels, the flow of new institutional money appears to be drying up. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mining Turns To Clean Energy Alternatives — Here’s Why Bitcoin Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $110,942, up by 0.48% over the past 24 hours. Daily trading volume has also increased by 4.56% to $61.05 billion, indicating steady market activity. However, the cryptocurrency faces headwinds, with a 3.76% monthly loss underscoring its fragile momentum. The next key resistance level sits near $113,700, a zone that has already proven difficult to break on two separate occasions over the past month. Meanwhile, with Bitcoin price direction largely uncertain, CryptoQuant’s report suggests corporate treasuries appear hesitant to allocate further capital at scale, preferring smaller, more conservative purchases. This behavior signals that while the narrative of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset persists, incremental demand growth is slowing. In addition, it raises significant concerns about the potential behavior of these treasury companies during the much-anticipated crypto winter.

Recent news/opinion on Livepeer Livepeer recently achieved a milestone with the network’s participation percentage rising past the 50% mark. The achievement decreases the inflation and also strengthens the network’s economics . 📊 Livepeer’s participation rate has crossed 50.4%! Why it matters: once above 50%, protocol inflation begins to taper, strengthening token economics while keeping incentives aligned.

Analysts Say It’s Plausible With ETF Acceleration,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-to-200k-in-supercycle-analysts-say-its-plausible-with-etf-acceleration/,"Bitcoin’s historic rise to over $100,000 has already marked 2025 as one of the most bullish years in crypto history. Yet some analysts are going even further, suggesting that a supercycle could push BTC as high as $200,000 before this cycle is over. The reasoning lies in accelerating ETF inflows, institutional adoption, and a tightening supply dynamic that mirrors the most explosive periods of Bitcoin’s history. Institutional adoption has been the clearest driver of momentum. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted billions in inflows, transforming BTC from a speculative asset into a recognized store of value for both retail and institutions. But as Bitcoin consolidates near new highs, analysts argue that the biggest returns may come from altcoins — with emerging plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE drawing attention for their ability to replicate early-stage Bitcoin-like gains. ETF Flows Could Push BTC Higher ETFs have become a game-changer for Bitcoin. According to industry data, daily inflows have reached levels equivalent to several months of new supply issuance, creating significant upward pressure on price. If this pace continues, analysts believe $150,000 could be achieved by year-end, with $200,000 possible if altcoin rotation doesn’t dilute capital inflows too early. Supply Dynamics After the Halving Bitcoin’s most recent halving has reduced new issuance to just over 450 BTC per day. Combined with ETF demand, this supply squeeze creates a perfect storm for upward momentum. Analysts note similarities to the post-2020 halving, when Bitcoin tripled in just months after institutional demand surged. Altcoin With Supercycle Potential While Bitcoin dominates headlines, many investors are looking for outsized returns in the altcoin space. Market models project MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver a 45x ROI before the next macro bull rally expansion. Backed by transparent audits, sustainable tokenomics, and expected top-tier exchange listings, it has already attracted thousands of early investors. For those chasing a “second chance” after missing Bitcoin’s early run, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a presale of choice. Can Altcoins Outpace Bitcoin? Historically, once Bitcoin establishes new highs, capital rotates into altcoins. Ethereum, Solana, and XRP are often among the first beneficiaries. Analysts predict that this rotation could begin in late Q4, potentially fueling the start of a full-scale altcoin season where 10x to 50x returns are possible. Conclusion Bitcoin’s path to $200,000 remains speculative but far from impossible. ETF inflows, the halving supply squeeze, and institutional demand all point toward a continued supercycle. Yet for those aiming to maximize returns, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE provide higher multiples at higher risk. Together, they represent the dual opportunity of stability and speculation that defines this cycle.

51313741,https://timestabloid.com/?p=82125,1757206833,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Top Cryptos With Real-World Use Cases Driving Adoption,https://timestabloid.com/top-cryptos-with-real-world-use-cases-driving-adoption/,"In a world where hype and speculation typically fill headlines, a new wave of cryptocurrencies is making a difference for something far more significant: real utility . Unlike the meme coins that rise and fall overnight, these networks are solving real-world problems and building systems that have long-term value. They are transforming the future of global finance, technology, and infrastructure. Investors who recognize the need for use cases are beginning to focus on the longer term. While newer projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE have made headlines with their ambitious vision and growth potential, the cryptos with real-world applications are laying the foundations for what many see as the backbones of digital economies. Ethereum (ETH) – Fueling Decentralized Finance Applications Ethereum is the home of smart contracts, which have given rise to decentralized applications in finance, gaming, and more. From DeFi lending platforms to multi-million NFTs, Ethereum continues to be the undisputed champion of blockchain innovation. Its ecosystem also is being adopted by enterprises for applications in payments and supply chains. XRP – Redesigning Cross-Border Payments XRP is designed to be fast and efficient for money transfers around the world. By making settlement almost instant and low cost, it has become the preferred solution for financial institutions. For those sending remittances out of the country, XRP is quite a bit cheaper than outdated systems like SWIFT and sends them a lot faster. Emerging Player With Strong Momentum While these established projects grab the headlines, investors are increasingly keeping their eyes on MAGACOIN FINANCE. Its fast-growing community and utility-driven roadmap set it apart as a great breakout opportunity. With solid tokenomics and a clear vision, analysts think it can emulate the early breakout periods of today’s largest networks. Early investors are already eyeing life-changing returns as access becomes more limited. Solana (SOL) – Scaling for High-Performance Applications Renowned for its capability of handling tens of thousands of transactions per second, Solana has emerged as the platform of choice for projects demanding speed and scalability. From decentralized exchanges to gaming to powering decentralized wireless networks, Solana is demonstrating the ability of blockchain to support operational infrastructure at scale. Chainlink (LINK) – Real World Data On-Chain So, blockchains don’t have access to external data themselves. Chainlink addresses this with secured, tamper-proof feeds that bridge smart contracts to off-chain data such as price, weather, and even sports results. This paves the way for advanced financial products, insurance solutions and hybrid smart contracts that span the digital and physical realms. Cardano (ADA) – Research and inclusion in action Through a rigorous approach built on the tenets of peer-review and peer-assessment, Cardano is a truly secure and long-standing platform. Its applications range from supply-chain tracing, decentralized identity systems, to financial services for enabling the unbanked in emerging markets. Conclusion The next phase of crypto won’t be characterized by speculation, but by projects that have some tangible value. Ethereum, XRP, Solana, Chainlink, and Cardano are already revolutionizing industries through blockchain. At the same time, new players like MAGACOIN FINANCE are emerging with the potential to capture massive value as adoption grows. “In a rapidly changing digital economy, the combination of proven use cases and emerging high growth opportunities is arguably the smartest investment play for forward-looking investors.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has gone viral, quickly spreading throughout the trading circles and social networks of the market. MUTM accelerating presale has 16,100 investors. MUTM is cutting disruptive narrative at a time when ETH is fighting to regain an upward curve. This new coin has the potential to re-model the existing market. Ethereum Hold Steady Following an Unsuccessful Breakout Ethereum (ETH) is now trading at a price of $4,308.85 with recent price fluctuating between $4,269.20 and $4,430.67. Following another unsuccessful effort to overcome key resistance near the levels of $4,500-$4,800, ETH is in a consolidation process. Analysts say that such support level around $4300-$4400 might be the key to maintaining the picture. Other new tokens are also beginning to rise in parallel with the performance of Ethereum, such as Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale 6 Mutuum Finance is at Stage 6 presale and tokens are being bought at $0.035 each. Phase seven will add 14.29 percent to the price. Over 16,100 investors have already joined the presale and have contributed more than $15.45 million in capital. This degree of interest indicates that people believe in the long-term vision of the project and its integration into the DeFi market. Development of a Vaulted and Stable Platform The project will be powered by a USD-pegged stablecoin that is already being developed on ETH chain. This long-term overcollateralized non-algorithmic stablecoin is supposed to be stable and secure in the long-term and resistant to the same volatility risk as algorithmic stablecoins that may lose their peg to volatile markets. A Long-Term Outlook for DeFi Mutuum’s openness and efficiency have given the users the ability to easily switch between traditional direct peer-to-peer modalities and on-the-fly. The new vision of decentralized finance is stable and of institutional quality to meet the non-homogeneity of the organizational and individual needs. These are not uniform in the market and can be extended according to the needs of the clients. Control of Stability and Security Mutuum Finance is also requesting and paying off white hackers to stress-test the site. Those who find weaknesses in the code base will get a reward pool of $50,000 USDT. The severity should have four levels, which are critical, major, minor, and low. In its bid to align itself with the security element, community development and extended growth, the platform is even running a $100,000 giveaway in which 10 investors will win a reward of $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The goal of the team is to not just build a strong ecosystem but to attract attention to it too. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly spreading around as Ethereum (ETH) experiences one more failed breakout. Stage 6 presale tokens cost $0.035 with Stage 7 increasing by 14.29% to $0.04. The confidence in the market is strong as more than 16,100 investors have contributed over $15.45M. The platform is also introducing an overcollateralised USD-pegged stablecoin, two-tier lending system and a robust security infrastructure including a $50K bug bounty and a $100K giveaway. As ETH consolidates around $4,308, Mutuum Finance is a DeFi coin that has a strong upside potential as it continues to rise rapidly. Get your Stage 6 tokens prior to the next price rise.

Presently, the company is exploring the option of staking a portion of its Ethereum on the Linea network. What Staking Ethereum Means For SharpLink SharpLink Gaming (NASDAQ: SBET), one of the largest Ethereum treasury firms, is taking a step into the future of decentralized finance, with plans to stake a portion of its massive $3.6 billion ETH treasury on the Linea layer-2 network.

By choosing to explore staking on Linea, the company is signaling a strong belief in ETH scaling solutions, which comes as Linea prepares for its official mainnet launch on September 10. The company has also joined the Linea Consortium, which oversees the distribution of 75% of the LINEA token supply . This strategic alliance helps SharpLink advance its own financial goals and also positions it as a key partner in the long-term development and governance of the Linea network. In an X post , SharpLink Gaming makes a clear statement that the company is fully compliant with Nasdaq rules and does not require further shareholder approvals to execute its At-the-Market (ATM) program for funding Ethereum purchases. SharpLink’s core strategy remains focused on raising capital only when it is accretive for shareholders, which adds to the value of the company’s stock. Recent media reports have suggested that some Digital Asset Trust (DAT) companies may need shareholder approval before issuing new shares to fund crypto acquisitions. However, these reports likely reference newer DATs that may face challenges meeting Nasdaq requirements or are under increased regulatory scrutiny. SharpLink maintains a rigorous commitment to compliance and transparency, ensuring all its transactions are conducted in accordance with Nasdaq rules and industry best practices. Institutional Inflows Fuel Ethereum Momentum The Ethereum narrative has shifted from a speculative play to a deeply convictional institutional bet. Amid this shift, CryptoBusy has revealed that Ethereum has seen a massive price surge of nearly 200% since April, driven by a confluence of powerful on-chain and institutional forces. According to recent data, Whales have added 5.54 million ETH to their holdings, reinforcing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential. Institutional bets are intensifying, with BitMine $65 million ETH purchase, and other major players increasing their exposure. Meanwhile, $151 million of ETH has moved into Aave, showing robust demand within the DeFi ecosystem. ETF inflows reached $3.87 billion in August alone, further strengthening ETH’s performance. These combined forces are building a solid structural floor under Ethereum, reinforcing market conviction and positioning ETH as a top-tier cyclical leader.",Ethereum|At-the-Market|ATM|BitMine|CryptoBusy|DAT|DeFi|Digital Asset Trust|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Joseph Chalom|Linea Consortium|Sharplink Gaming,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-07 01:30:18

Homeowners, stock traders, governments; no one’s getting out of this untouched. What started as a slow change in borrowing costs has now turned into what analysts at Deutsche Bank are calling a “slow-moving vicious circle.” They’re not wrong. Governments, from the U.S. to the U.K., France, and Japan, are all struggling with rising interest payments on massive deficits. When investors start doubting whether these countries can handle their debt, they demand more compensation to lend. That pushes bond yields even higher, which makes those debts worse. Rinse and repeat. Yields spike and home loans feel the hit By midweek, the 30-year U.S. Treasury jumped past 5%, the highest since July. In Japan, their 30-year bond hit a new record. The U.K.’s 30-year spiked to its highest level in 27 years. Even though yields eased slightly on Thursday and Friday, they’re still way above pre-2020 levels. The bigger issue? These high borrowing costs are sticking around. “Cooler heads will prevail, and markets will function as they should,” said Jonathan Mondillo, global head of fixed income at Aberdeen. But let’s not pretend this volatility is normal. Yields move in the opposite direction of bond prices, and this kind of price action means markets are nervous. Really nervous. Mortgage rates are feeling the heat. The 30-year Treasury yield directly impacts the 30-year mortgage, still the most popular home loan in the U.S. When that yield spikes, monthly payments go up fast. “That’s concerning,” said W1M Fund Manager James Carter. He pointed to rising long-term yields and said, flat out, “this is not going to help mortgage holders.” Yes, Trump’s pressure might lead to short-term rate cuts, and weaker job data already has Fed officials preparing for that. Carter called that “counterintuitive” and warned it could backfire. But Carter said the long end of the bond curve is reacting badly: “The long end of the curve is just going to panic… this is not what the White House typically does… those yields are likely if anything to keep moving higher.” Stocks slip, corporates tighten, and investors get nervous As we mentioned, higher government bond yields are punching stocks in the gut too. Normally, when markets get shaky, investors run to bonds. But that safe-haven status is cracking. This year, White House decisions on tariffs and erratic policymaking have made bonds part of the problem, not the solution. Kate Marshall, senior investment analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said rising yields pressure stock valuations. “As yields climb, reflecting higher yields from typically safer assets like bonds and cash and increasing the cost of capital, stock valuations tend to come under pressure,” she explained. And yeah, we’ve seen it: both U.K. and U.S. equities dropped recently. But it’s messy. Marshall pointed out that the correlation isn’t always perfect. Sometimes, stocks and bond yields rise together. Depends on what’s driving it. But in today’s environment, with inflation still high and rate policy still unpredictable, this dance between stocks and bonds is just adding more confusion. There’s one corner of the market that’s found a strange upside: corporate bonds. Viktor Hjort, head of credit and equity derivatives at BNP Paribas, said high yields help the corporate bond space in some ways. “It attracts demand… it reduces supply… it incentivizes corporates to be pretty disciplined about their balance sheets,” he said. Basically, borrowing gets more expensive, so companies think twice before adding more debt. Kallum Pickering, chief economist at Peel Hunt, said, “Just because we don’t have a crisis in the bond market doesn’t mean these interest rates are not having economic consequences.” According to him, high yields “constrain policy choices,” “crowd out private investment,” and leave markets wondering “every six months whether we’re going to suffer a bout of financial instability.” That’s not exactly a great setup for business expansion. Pickering even floated the idea that a new round of austerity (yes, government spending cuts) might be what it takes to break the cycle. “You would give markets confidence, you would bring down these bond yields, and the private sector would just breathe a sigh of relief,” he said.

In 2028, the DOT price can reach a maximum of $17.74 and a minimum of $15.05. The price of Polkadot is predicted to reach a maximum value of $53.47 in 2031. Polkadot (DOT) has shown impressive growth and resilience in a volatile cryptocurrency market, supported by its strong multichain protocol architecture and investor confidence. A major contributor to this success is the Sinai Upgrade on its Acala Network, enhancing functionality and security. With over 32 million transactions validated in October 2024 by the Polkadot Relay Chain, the network demonstrates significant activity and utility. A notable increase in unique wallets further signals growing user adoption and engagement, strengthening Polkadot’s position as a leading blockchain platform. Will DOT reach new heights soon? Let’s get into the Polkadot price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Polkadot Token DOT Price $3.80 Market Cap $6.14B Trading Volume $261.36M Circulating Supply 1.61B DOT All-time High $55.00 Nov 4, 2021 All-time Low $2.69 Aug 19, 2020 24-hour High $3.89 24-hour Low $3.79 Polkadot price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 3.31% 50-Day SMA $ 3.95 14-Day RSI 47.66 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 48(Neutral) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $ 4.12 Polkadot price analysis: DOT daily outlook and technical breakdown For range-bound movement, DOT is trading between $3.79 support and $3.88 resistance, showing consolidation with no clear trend. Strong resistance at $3.88, repeated failures to break above $3.88 confirm it as a strong resistance level limiting upside moves. Weakening Support at $3.79. Frequent tests of $3.79 raise the risk of a breakdown if selling pressure increases. Polkadot (DOT) on September 6, 2025, is currently trading at $3.80, showing a 0.27% increase over the last 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap data. The cryptocurrency experienced intraday movement within a tight range, establishing a support level at $3.79 and encountering resistance at $3.88. This price action highlights a cautious market environment, where bulls and bears are struggling to establish dominance. Polkadot 1-day timeframe analysis: DOT consolidation persists under key resistance On the 1-day chart, Polkadot is showing signs of prolonged consolidation. The price briefly surged toward the $3.88 resistance level but failed to break through, resulting in a pullback that tested the lower support boundary at $3.79. This price corridor has held firm over recent sessions, indicating a lack of directional bias in the market. POL/USDT Chart: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits near the neutral 50 line, signaling the absence of strong momentum in either direction. Meanwhile, the price remains tightly aligned with the 20-day EMA, further validating the asset’s range-bound nature. If DOT closes above $3.88, it could trigger a breakout rally toward the $4.00 mark. However, a daily close below $3.79 would indicate renewed bearish control and may lead to further downside. Polkadot 4-hour timeframe: DOT bearish pressure building below resistance The 4-hour chart shows repeated failures to break past the $3.88 resistance, with each bullish attempt resulting in a lower high. This pattern suggests weakening buyer strength and increasing downside pressure. The price remains confined within the same horizontal range observed on the daily chart, but with more frequent volatility spikes. The RSI on the 4-hour chart is slightly below neutral, pointing toward mild bearish momentum. A cluster of candles testing $3.79 support with long lower wicks implies that buyers are still active, but repeated tests raise the probability of a breakdown. If volume picks up on a move below $3.79, DOT could accelerate downward quickly. Conversely, a clean 4-hour close above $3.88 is required to invalidate this bearish setup and initiate a bullish reversal. Polkadot technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $ 3.82 SELL SMA 5 $ 3.85 SELL SMA 10 $ 3.88 SELL SMA 21 $ 3.91 SELL SMA 50 $ 3.95 SELL SMA 100 $ 3.86 SELL SMA 200 $ 4.12 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $ 3.79 BUY EMA 5 $ 3.81 SELL EMA 10 $ 3.85 SELL EMA 21 $ 3.89 SELL EMA 50 $ 3.91 SELL EMA 100 $ 3.98 SELL EMA 200 $ 4.30 SELL What can you expect next for Polkadot (DOT)? Polkadot (DOT) remains in a tight consolidation zone, trading between $3.79 support and $3.88 resistance, with no clear directional trend in play. Given this narrow range, the next move will likely be defined by a breakout or breakdown from this zone. If DOT breaks above $3.88 on strong momentum, it could trigger a short-term rally toward the $4.00 psychological level, attracting fresh buyers and potentially setting up a trend reversal. On the other hand, if the $3.79 support fails, especially after repeated tests, downside acceleration is likely, pushing the price into a new lower range and possibly extending bearish control. Is Polkadot a good investment? Polkadot (DOT) has strong long-term potential due to its focus on blockchain interoperability and unique multi-chain architecture. It remains a key project in the Web3 space. However, in the short term, price action is weak and range-bound between $3.79 and $3.88, showing no clear trend. At this stage, it may appeal more to long-term holders than short-term traders. Why is Polkadot Down today? Polkadot (DOT) is experiencing downward pressure primarily due to its repeated failure to break above the $3.88 resistance, which has capped any upward momentum. The asset has been range-bound, and with each attempt to rise being rejected, market sentiment has weakened, leading to mild selling pressure. Additionally, frequent retests of the $3.79 support level are raising concerns among traders, suggesting a potential breakdown. This uncertainty contributes to cautious behavior among buyers, and without a clear breakout, short-term sellers continue to dominate. DOT’s current weakness is technical in nature, rather than driven by fundamental news. Recent news Grayscale has updated its S-1 registration filings with the SEC for two proposed cryptocurrency ETFs—one for Cardano (ADA) to trade on NYSE Arca under the ticker GADA and another for Polkadot (DOT) to trade on Nasdaq under the ticker DOT. Both funds would hold the underlying assets directly, track CoinDesk pricing indices, and use Coinbase Custody, mirroring the firm’s existing Bitcoin and Ethereum products. The filings update earlier 19b-4 applications from February 2025, though SEC approval remains pending, with the Cardano ETF decision now delayed to October 26. 🚨Polkadot ETF Update: Grayscale filed S-1 registration statements with the SEC to launch @Polkadot (DOT).

In the 20th century, it was blue-chip stocks and real estate. Today, digital assets are joining that list. Cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals and adoption curves are increasingly viewed as vehicles capable of delivering multi-decade value. Ethereum and Solana lead this conversation, but analysts say smaller, early-stage tokens priced at fractions of a cent could hold the key to truly transformative returns. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE , currently valued at just $0.0004 , is emerging as one of the most talked-about presale opportunities. Solana: scalability and adoption Solana has staged a remarkable comeback since its early technical challenges. With transaction throughput exceeding 65,000 per second, it has become the go-to chain for NFTs, gaming, and high-frequency DeFi. Institutional partnerships and upgrades like Firedancer are making it more robust. Analysts argue that Solana’s scalability and adoption curve position it as one of the strongest long-term plays in the Layer 1 space. For investors, its combination of speed, efficiency, and cultural traction makes it a cornerstone for wealth-building strategies. Ethereum: the infrastructure cornerstone Ethereum is the backbone of Web3. It powers decentralized finance, NFTs, and an expanding ecosystem of applications. Institutional interest surged after ETH ETFs gained approval in 2025, bringing billions in inflows. Ethereum’s deflationary model, strengthened by EIP-1559, has removed millions of ETH from circulation, tightening supply. For those seeking generational wealth, Ethereum provides both credibility and utility, functioning as both infrastructure and a long-term asset. MAGACOIN FINANCE: the $0. 0004 opportunity While Ethereum and Solana anchor the conversation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the wild card attracting attention for its generational wealth potential. Currently priced at just $0.0004 in presale, analysts say its upside could be extraordinary. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the few presales to pass both CertiK and HashEx audits , giving it rare legitimacy among meme-inspired tokens. Forecasts project 35x growth at launch and even 10,000% ROI over the cycle , echoing the early mania around SHIBA INU. The PATRIOT50X bonus code has accelerated demand, with early buyers stacking allocations at record speed. Social media chatter shows Telegram and X communities buzzing with FOMO. Analysts emphasize that while Ethereum and Solana provide stability and scalability, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the asymmetric upside that could turn modest investments into generational wealth. Why balance matters Generational wealth is built not only on explosive growth but also on sustainability. That’s why combining blue-chip infrastructure like Ethereum with high-throughput challengers like Solana, and complementing them with speculative yet credible presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE – creates a balanced approach. It’s the same principle that guided portfolios in previous cycles: anchor with reliability, amplify with asymmetry. Risks and rewards The risks are real. Ethereum faces constant competition, Solana must maintain uptime and trust, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is still early in its lifecycle. Yet, the potential rewards far outweigh the risks for investors who size positions carefully. Analysts stress that even small allocations to emerging tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE can dramatically change long-term outcomes if forecasts prove accurate. Conclusion Ethereum and Solana are strong long-term assets, providing infrastructure and adoption at scale. But for those seeking the asymmetric opportunity that defines generational wealth, MAGACOIN FINANCE at $0.0004 offers a rare entry point . Combining stability with speculative upside may be the formula that shapes portfolios not just for years, but for decades.

51315997,https://timestabloid.com/?p=82130,1757210417,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Trump-Linked Token Disappoints, but MAGACOIN FINANCE Gets the Spotlight",https://timestabloid.com/trump-linked-token-disappoints-but-magacoin-finance-gets/,"After a roaring start that briefly pushed its valuation near $10 billion, WLFI – the flagship token of World Liberty Financial tied to the Trump family – has stumbled hard. Prices have retreated more than 30% from recent highs, raising doubts about its staying power. Meanwhile, a different project, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is quietly turning heads after raising $13 million in record time , making it one of the fastest-growing presales in the current market. WLFI’s Price Struggles WLFI’s slide has forced developers to float a buyback-and-burn program, designed to stabilize the token’s economy. Under this proposal, fees generated from liquidity pools managed by the protocol on Ethereum, BSC, and Solana would be used to purchase WLFI from the market, with the tokens permanently destroyed. The team has hinted that future revenue streams could also support the initiative , though details remain vague. Stablecoin Expansion Despite the rocky trading, WLFI’s broader ecosystem is expanding. Its USD1 stablecoin, recently deployed on Solana, has quickly added nearly half a billion dollars in value, lifting its total market cap to $2.67 billion . Supporters see this as a foundation for long-term adoption, even as the core WLFI token struggles to find a stable floor. At press time, WLFI trades near $0.236, after briefly dipping to $0.2095 earlier in the week. Spotlight on MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE, by contrast, has been riding a wave of momentum. Its presale has drawn thousands of early investors, drawn to its expanding ecosystem and ambitious roadmap. Analysts note that the project’s combination of strong tokenomics and community growth is reminiscent of the early stages of breakout tokens that later delivered life-changing returns . With demand already outpacing supply, some speculate that early backers of MAGACOIN FINANCE could be sitting on gains of 50x or more once it lands on major exchanges. Trump Family’s Role Meanwhile, WLFI’s derivatives market shows resilience. Open interest remains near $920 million, a sign that traders still see opportunity despite price weakness. The financial impact on the Trump family has also been significant: the Wall Street Journal estimated that WLFI’s launch instantly lifted their fortune by $5 billion , surpassing much of their traditional real estate holdings. Donald Trump himself holds only an honorary role, but his sons are actively engaged in the project. Outlook for WLFI and Investor Focus Whether the buyback-and-burn plan will restore WLFI’s momentum is an open question. For now, the market seems cautious, waiting to see if the team can deliver sustainable growth beyond headline hype. Investors looking for new opportunities are diversifying into projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where strong community backing and early-stage positioning suggest far more room for upside. Conclusion WLFI may yet recover if its tokenomics overhaul succeeds, but the disappointment of its initial slide has shifted investor focus elsewhere. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rapid $13 million raise highlights where smart money is moving, with many betting it could become one of the standout winners of the next bull cycle.

For the first time, the Ethereum exchange balance has turned negative, meaning more tokens are being withdrawn from trading platforms than deposited. This structural shift in supply dynamics has analysts labeling it a key bullish signal for the market’s next rally. Ethereum Exchange Balance = Negative Crypto market expert Cas Abbe shared a new report showing that Ethereum’s exchange flux has slipped into the negative territory for the first time on record. He suggests that the latest development could be bullish for ETH, as it signals reduced selling pressure and growing investor confidence. Related Reading: MemeCore Explodes 3,800% For ATH — But Is A Collapse Around The Corner? Historically, the exchange balance metric has served as one of the clearest indicators of investor behavior. When balances rise, it typically signals mounting selling pressure, as traders move coins for liquidation purposes. Conversely, when they fall, it indicates that coins are being withdrawn into private wallets, which are less likely to be sold. The analyst’s chart illustrates a sharp and accelerating drop in Ethereum’s exchange balances over the past few years, culminating in this historic low. Billions worth of ETH have been removed from centralized platforms, coinciding with the asset’s advance toward a target above $5,500. This indicates a clear reduction in liquid supply during already heightened demand. According to Abbe, the importance of this decline cannot be overstated. He noted that market tops in crypto generally occur after inflows spike back into these centralized platforms, not when balances are draining to new lows. In other words, Ethereum may not be positioned for a sell-off but for accumulation. As selling pressure subsides, long-term holders exert greater control over supply, creating conditions for potentially strong upward price momentum. If history is any guide, Abbe suggests that the shrinking exchange balance could set the stage for Ethereum’s next leg up. Analyst Sets $7,000 As ETH’s Next Target While Ethereum’s exchange supply hits uncharted lows, technical analysts like Crypto Goos are increasingly bullish on its price. The market expert announced in a post on X that ETH has officially broken out of a long-term wedge pattern, which has constrained price action since 2021. The accompanying chart illustrates ETH finally piercing through resistance after years of sideways trading. Crypto Goos points to the breakout level around $3,600, and with Ethereum now trading significantly above it, the move appears confirmed. Related Reading: XRP Poised For Amazon-Like Boom? Analyst Predicts $200 Rally Although Ethereum has experienced a number of price swings in the past few weeks, Crypto Goos remains confident that it can reach a new all-time high soon. The analyst’s projection from the wedge breakout targets the $7,000 region, representing a potential upside of about 62% from current price levels above $4,300. Should momentum persist, the cryptocurrency could extend even beyond the $7,000 milestone.

Avalanche is moving sideways, trapped between support and resistance, while Hyperliquid is consolidating after record-breaking activity. But BlockDAG(BDAG) has chosen a different path, by blending community incentives, global visibility, and top-tier security to fuel momentum. Its 25% referral bonus, head turning entry price of $0.0013 until October 1, and a security-first strategy are placing BDAG firmly in the conversation as the best crypto to buy right now. By contrast, Avalanche (AVAX) continues to oscillate without strong direction, leaving traders frustrated with its lack of breakout potential. Hyperliquid (HYPE), despite impressive growth in trading volume, is still caught between bullish enthusiasm and cautious consolidation. Against this backdrop, BlockDAG’s ability to align rewards with adoption and prove credibility ahead of launch has given it an edge that few competitors can match. Avalanche Technicals Reveal Ongoing Hesitation Avalanche (AVAX) remains locked in a neutral pattern, with price hovering near $23. For months, it has bounced between $16 as support and $26 as resistance, unable to make a decisive move. Multiple rejections at $26 highlight waning momentum, while doji candles on lower timeframes show market indecision. The technical picture reinforces the hesitation. AVAX is sitting slightly above the 21-day SMA, providing near-term support. However, if sellers push the token below $21, a drop back to $20 or even $16 could quickly follow. On the other hand, a successful break above $26 could ignite a run toward $36. This drawn-out sideways movement explains why AVAX has struggled to generate fresh excitement. Despite strong fundamentals and developer activity, its chart structure points to neutrality in the near term. Traders searching for conviction are increasingly shifting attention toward projects like BlockDAG, which are pairing adoption with narrative strength. HYPE Sees Massive Trading Volume but Faces Uncertainty Hyperliquid’s HYPE token has emerged as one of DeFi’s most active platforms, hitting an all-time high of $29 billion in daily trading volume. Over the past year, it has processed $1.57 trillion in trades, while Q2 2025 revenues exceeded $300 million. July alone recorded $319 billion in volume, a 47% rise from the previous month, with $7.7 million in daily fees fueling consistent HYPE buybacks. This growth has been supported by whale activity, including a $21 million USDC long position opened at $45, pushing its market cap above $10 billion. Institutional adoption is also increasing, as HYLQ Strategy Corp. now holds 30,000 HYPE tokens as part of its treasury, mimicking MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin playbook. Analysts forecast mid-term targets of $75–$100, but uncertainty lingers. While HYPE has strong fundamentals, its consolidation suggests the market is waiting for a clear catalyst. For now, it remains a leader in decentralized perpetuals, though momentum is less explosive than earlier in the year. BlockDAG’s Referral Bonus, Limited Time Entry Price, & Security Advantage BlockDAG is capturing momentum at a time when many projects are struggling to excite investors. Its 25% referral bonus has become one of the strongest adoption tools in the presale space. Referrers earn BDAG coins for every introduction, while referred buyers receive an additional 5% bonus, creating a two-sided incentive system that drives viral growth. Unlike short-lived campaigns that disappear after a few weeks, BlockDAG’s referral program is structured for transparency and longevity, ensuring that adoption continues to build as the project nears launch. Visibility has been another catalyst. At its upcoming BlockDAG Deployment Event in Singapore, the project is stepping into the spotlight with more than just promises. It will showcase Dashboard V4, upgraded mining solutions, and the X1 app that already has over 3 million users worldwide. In preparation for this milestone, BlockDAG also shifted its presale to a flat $0.0013, a move designed to reward loyalty and prevent last-minute speculation. Together, these steps highlight that BlockDAG is not just running a presale but demonstrating a working ecosystem. Security further strengthens confidence. Independent audits by CertiK and Halborn confirmed that vulnerabilities were addressed, while multi-signature protections and a parallel Proof-of-Work structure safeguard funds. In an environment where many projects collapse under hacks or rug pulls, this emphasis on safety makes BlockDAG stand apart. With almost $400 million raised, 25.9 billion coins sold, and a limited time entry price of $0.0013, BlockDAG is building adoption, visibility, and trust all at once. For buyers searching for the best crypto to buy, it represents a rare mix of opportunity and reassurance before its $0.05 launch. Final Takeaway Avalanche’s indecision has kept traders waiting, and Hyperliquid’s consolidation shows that even rapid growth can lose momentum. BlockDAG, however, is delivering a layered strategy that builds real conviction. Its 25% referral bonus continues to expand community scale, limited time price shift to $0.0013 elevated its presence on the global stage, and its audited security practices provide confidence in a market where trust is rare. This mix of adoption, visibility, and protection makes BlockDAG more than a speculative presale. It positions BDAG as a project with staying power. For those comparing options, the difference is clear: while AVAX hesitates and HYPE consolidates, BlockDAG is creating traction that investors can measure today. In the search for the best crypto to buy, BlockDAG is not only in the race, it is leading it.

Delegates from the alliance confirmed they’ve agreed in principle to increase production next month. The plan is to add about 137,000 barrels per day, starting in October, as part of a larger strategy to take back lost market share. The group, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, has already pushed forward an earlier phase of production hikes, and now they’re going ahead with the next one. This is part of a bigger plan to bring back the 1.66 million barrels a day of cuts that were meant to stay in place until the end of 2026. That timeline has now been thrown out the window. If they stick to the pace of 137,000 barrels a month, the full rollback could be done in a year. But it won’t be that clean. Some countries don’t have the spare capacity. Others are being told to sit out the increase to make up for earlier overproduction. So the real number is going to come in lower than advertised. Saudi Arabia and Russia push through the pivot The shift marks a full-blown strategy reversal by OPEC and its partners. The cartel used to fight tooth and nail to protect prices. Now? They’re chasing market share, no matter how crowded it gets. Just months ago, OPEC+ shocked the market by restarting 2.2 million barrels per day of halted supply, a full year ahead of schedule. That decision blindsided traders who had been expecting a long freeze due to surplus risks. So far, the gamble hasn’t broken the market. Yes, crude prices have fallen 12% this year. But the overall market has held up better than most expected. That’s giving Saudi Arabia more confidence to roll out even more barrels. And there’s more than oil at play. Donald Trump, back in the headlines, has been demanding lower prices as part of his inflation-fighting playbook. A supply flood serves his agenda. He’s also been using oil prices to put pressure on Russia over its war in Ukraine. The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, is scheduled to visit Washington in November. So, yeah, timing is deliberate. There’s still a gap between headlines and barrels. The group says one thing, but on-the-ground output depends on each country’s capabilities. Some producers, especially the smaller ones, just can’t keep up. A few have already exceeded their past quotas and are being told to hold back. For the rest, it’s go-time. Traders watch OPEC while Asia hosts oil’s biggest party Sunday’s meeting sent another message too: no one really knows what OPEC is going to do until it happens. At the start of the week, Bloomberg polled crude traders and analysts. The majority believed that OPEC+ would hold steady this month. Then, out of nowhere, rumors began swirling that an increase might be on the table, and those rumors became fact fast. Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, has got a track record of shocking the market just to keep traders off balance. This weekend was another classic example. Now, the group’s next move is going to dominate APPEC, the Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference, kicking off this week in Singapore. It’s Asia’s biggest oil gathering, and this year’s mood is already edgy. The International Energy Agency is forecasting a record oil glut in 2026, and concerns about oversupply are expected to dominate the discussions. Of course, there are a few things that could support oil prices short-term. Cold winters drive heating demand. Lower interest rates could make commodities more attractive again. But the main story is still the looming glut. That’s the only thing anyone in Singapore is talking about. The conference begins informally with a wave of private parties. TotalEnergies SE is hosting one at a hotel overlooking Marina Bay, but most guests are expected to be glued to their phones for updates on the OPEC+ decision. The gossip, as always, will flow faster at cocktail events than on stage. Top oil firms are rolling out the red carpet. Saudi Aramco, PetroChina, Equinor, BP, and Vitol are all throwing parties.

World Liberty Financial price prediction for 2025 expects the price of WLFI to surge toward $0.41. By 2031, we expect the World Liberty Financial price to record a maximum price of $1.4. Donald Trump has embraced the title of the “crypto president”, a label that has fueled massive speculation across the crypto industry. After Trump’s 2024 election victory, the price of Bitcoin surged, a move many analysts and traders called a bullish signal for the broader cryptocurrency market. Building on this momentum, Trump introduced his own branded tokens—most notably the $TRUMP token and $MELANIA memecoin—cementing his direct involvement in the world of digital assets. Whether Trump’s push into crypto is driven by policy goals or personal profit, one message is clear: he intends to make cryptocurrency part of both his political strategy and financial portfolio. However, Trump’s personal involvement in crypto tokens raises critical ethical questions. If a sitting or future U.S. president profits directly from token sales, DeFi projects, or blockchain ventures, it risks blurring the line between public duty and private gain. One project drawing major attention is World Liberty Financial after major listings, a Trump-backed decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. This article explores what World Liberty Financial is, and what Trump’s embrace of crypto could mean for the future of Bitcoin, memecoins, and U.S. crypto policy. Consequently, numerous analysts eagerly anticipate the future valuation of its native cryptocurrency, WLFI. This raises the question: Can WLFI price reach $1? This forecast for World Liberty Financial’s price examines factors such as ecosystem trends, adoption rates, underlying technology, and technical analysis to project the WLFI price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency World Liberty Financial Ticker Symbol WLFI Rank 27 Current Price $0.2135 Price change 24H +20% Market cap $5.26 Billion Circulating supply 24.66 Billion WLFI Trading volume 24h $1.21B (+2.1%) All-time high $0.46, September 1, 2025 All-time low $0.1632, September 4, 2025 WLFI price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.21 Price Prediction $ 0.158027 (-24.98%) Fear & Greed Index 51 (Neutral) Sentiment Bullish Volatility NA Green Days 0/3 (0%) 50-Day SMA NA 200-Day SMA NA 14-Day RSI NA World Liberty Financial technical analysis: WLFI price faces bullish pressure above $0.21 WLFI price analysis shows a surge toward $0.21 Resistance for WLFI is present at $0.2359 Support for WLFI/USD is present at $0.1927 The WLFI price analysis for 7 September confirms that WLFI faces increasing volatility as it surges above $0.21. Currently, the bulls are aiming for a recovery above $0.22. WLFI price chart prediction: World Liberty Financial faces buying pressure above $0.21 WLFI price is facing a surge as buyers push the price above $0.21. WLFI price is aiming for a hold above the immediate Fib channels. The 24-hour volume surged toward $258 million, showing increased interest in trading activity. The price is trading at $0.214, surging over 20% in the last 24 hours. WLFIUSDT chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line shows no value as the token has just launched. However, on the 4-hour chart, the trend line hovers above the midline at level 53, suggesting buying demand. WLFI/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for a hold above EMA trend lines The 4-hour WLFI price chart suggests WLFI continues to experience bullish activity around EMA lines, creating a positive sentiment on the price chart. As the price continues to face resistance near the Fib level, bears prepare for a domination by holding the price below the EMA20 trend line. WLFIUSDT chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a negative region at 0.41, hinting that sellers are trying to build pressure near support levels and boost a downward correction. The MACD trend line is yet to give an accurate signal on the 4-hour price chart.

The hourly price chart confirms that bears are making efforts to prevent the WLFI price from an immediate surge. However, if WLFI’s price successfully breaks above $0.2359, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.2878. WLFIUSDT chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, WLFI’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.1927, resulting in a correction to $0.1637. WLFI crypto news World Liberty Financial, the Trump-backed crypto project, froze Justin Sun’s wallet after he sent $9 million in WLFI tokens to his HTX exchange. Sun pushed back, saying he would buy $10M of ALTS and another $10M of WLFI, even though he already holds a $75M stake as one of the project’s biggest investors. The clash comes as WLFI has dropped 40% since launch, sparking rumors that insiders and early backers are selling off their tokens. Is WLFI a good investment? Trading $WLFI will be very risky. Since it’s a new and highly hyped token with only a small amount available at launch, the price could change quickly and unpredictably. Liquidity will be thin, so even one big trade might move the market. It’s normal for tokens like this to surge at launch and then drop as early buyers cash out. I predicted big things for this project. I feel they ran into a problem on launch by partnering with a toxic individual (not confirmed) but with him out of the picture I’m long. When it didn’t immediately shoot up a few crybabies tweeted at me. Keep in mind everybody bought… https://t.co/YmOzuWLlhE — Tristan Tate (@TateTheTalisman) September 6, 2025 However, considering its background and ongoing trading volume, WLFI can turn out to be a good investment option in the long-term. Why is the WLFI price up today? During its recent decline toward $0.16, WLFI price gained significant buying demand and a strong surge in its trading volume. This resulted in a push above $0.2 level. What is the WLFI price prediction for 2025? By 2025, analysts predict that World Liberty Financial (WLFI) will start the year at $0.15, with an average trading price of $0.37, and could climb as high as $0.41. Will WLFI price touch $1? Yes, WLFI price might touch the $1 milestone by the end of 2030. However, the token might attain this level much earlier, depending on the future market sentiment and buying demand. Will WLFI Price Reach $10? If everything remains good and WLFI gains recognition, its price might surpass $10 by 2040. Is WLFI a good long-term investment? As World Liberty Financial aims to expand its offerings, it might gain a significant position in the altcoin market. Hence, WLFI can be a good long-term investment option. The WLFI long term price outlook is looking strong due to its strong political support. WLFI price prediction September 2025 Analysts expect a steady surge in crypto market prices in September month. We expect WLFI to record a minimum price of $0.15 and a maximum price of $0.3, with an average of $0.2 in September.

According to their predictions, this would be significantly higher than the previous year, marking a strong and acceptable jump for World Liberty Financial. WLFI Prediction for 2028 By 2028, forecasts suggest WLFI will open at $0.7, trade at an average of $0.8, and could move up to $0.81.

If granted, such a move would mark a turning point for Ripple’s token, pushing it into the same institutional spotlight as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Analysts suggest an ETF could trigger an explosive rally, with XRP potentially delivering 1000% gains this cycle. But XRP may not be the only winner. Historically, the approval of institutional investment vehicles creates ripple effects across the market, lifting both major altcoins and emerging tokens. Investors are already asking which altcoins could follow XRP’s trajectory — and which presales, like MAGACOIN FINANCE, could mirror early-cycle moonshots. What an XRP ETF Could Mean An XRP ETF would unlock new levels of institutional participation, giving hedge funds and asset managers easy exposure. Analysts believe this could drive XRP’s price from its current levels into the $5–$8 range , with more bullish estimates calling for $10+ during peak altcoin season. Altcoins Positioned to Ride the Wave Avalanche (AVAX): Strong in real-world asset tokenization, AVAX could surge if institutional demand spills into smart contract platforms. Projections place AVAX at $200–$250 in a bullish scenario. Cardano (ADA): Known for its academic rigor and governance model, ADA could rally to $3–$4 as capital rotates into established altcoins. Polygon (MATIC): With enterprise partnerships and zkEVM scaling, MATIC may reach $4–$5 in tandem with Ethereum’s growth. Presale Opportunity With Massive Upside While XRP dominates ETF speculation, analysts eye a 12,000% upside for MAGACOIN FINANCE before late-stage euphoria drives the market. This presale has gained traction thanks to its audited framework, transparent tokenomics, and expected listings on leading exchanges. Thousands of investors have already participated, many securing bonus allocations that could magnify returns. For those seeking altcoin opportunities that mirror early Shiba Inu or Dogecoin entries, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as a breakout candidate. Could an XRP ETF Spark Altseason? If an XRP ETF gains approval, analysts believe it could mark the true kickoff of altseason. Just as Bitcoin ETFs legitimized BTC in the eyes of institutions, an XRP ETF would highlight altcoins as serious investment assets. This domino effect could trigger massive flows into the broader market, rewarding both established players and new projects. Conclusion The XRP ETF buzz is more than just hype — it’s a potential catalyst for a full-scale altcoin rally. While XRP itself could deliver 1000% gains, projects like Avalanche, Cardano, Polygon, and presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE are positioned to benefit from the surge of institutional and retail demand. For investors looking to maximize returns in 2025, this may be the moment to act before the next wave of adoption hits.

51318279,575775,1757214031,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51318279.jpeg,$6B In Bitcoin: Marathon Digital Treasury Now 2nd-Largest Among Public Firms,https://bitcoinist.com/6b-in-bitcoin-marathon-digital-treasury-now-2nd-largest-among-public-firms/,"According to a press release , MARA Holdings, Inc. now reports holdings valued at close to $6 billion , totaling 52,477 BTC. That level puts the miner among the largest public corporate Bitcoin holders, trailing only Michael Saylor’s Strategy in the public treasury rankings. Mining Output And Treasury Growth MARA produced a little over 700 BTC in August, and it kept an average pace of 22.7 BTC mined per day for the month. Bitcoin’s price fell about 5% during the period; prices peaked near $124,400 mid-month before slipping toward $107,000. Based on reports, the company chose to add to its treasury rather than sell, buying the dip and increasing its Bitcoin reserve to the current level. “Given the decline in Bitcoin price during the month, we took the opportunity to add to our treasury and currently hold over 52,000 BTC,” CEO Fred Thiel said. Hashrate Gains And Site Progress The firm said its energized hashrate edged up to 59.4 EH/s. All miners at MARA’s Texas wind farm are installed and connected, and the company says that site is on track to be fully operational by the fourth quarter of 2025. Production momentum carried into the summer: block wins rose by 27% in July after recovery at the Ellendale site, lifting monthly output from 591 BTC in June to 692 BTC in July, before the 705 BTC recorded in August. Position Among Public Holders Reports have disclosed that MARA ranks second among public companies by Bitcoin holdings, with Michael Saylor’s Strategy still in the lead, holding about 636,505 BTC following a disclosed additional purchase worth $449 million. Other firms listed near the top include Twenty One with 43,514 BTC, Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company with 30,020 BTC, and Bullish with 24,000 BTC. Meanwhile, shareholders have seen a total return of 700% over the past five years. That long-term gain contrasts with more muted recent returns, as Bitcoin’s swings and high operating costs have weighed on performance. Expansion Moves And Europe Push MARA is also moving beyond mining. The company announced plans to buy a 64% stake in Exaion, a unit of French energy company EDF, with an option to boost ownership to one-third by 2027. The stated goal is to pair MARA’s infrastructure with AI-driven edge solutions to lower costs and serve Europe’s growing AI needs. MARA is building its place as one of the biggest Bitcoin holders. With 52,477 BTC worth almost $6 billion, the company has secured a leading spot among public firms.

Traders are asking the big question: when will the next altcoin hype cycle begin? While Bitcoin often sets the tone, altcoins tend to explode with momentum once liquidity starts flowing deeper into the market. Investors who position themselves early often capture the steepest gains. Ethereum – The Engine of DeFi and Beyond Ethereum remains the backbone of decentralized finance and smart contracts. With scaling solutions rolling out across its ecosystem, transaction costs are falling while adoption rises. Analysts argue that Ethereum’s move toward staking-based yields and its role as collateral in tokenized asset markets could push ETH toward new highs in the next cycle. Long-term investors see today’s levels as attractive for accumulation. XRP – Institutional Adoption on the Horizon XRP has been fighting legal battles for years, but the narrative is changing. The possibility of spot ETFs and its growing use in cross-border settlement systems have brought it back to the spotlight. Should Ripple secure regulatory clarity and deeper institutional partnerships, XRP could finally unlock the upside that supporters have been waiting for since the last cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE – The Breakout Contender While legacy players like ETH, XRP, and LINK anchor many portfolios, some investors look for projects at an earlier stage with greater upside potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE has already raised $13 million in its presale at record speed , proving the level of community interest. Its expanding ecosystem and investor-first tokenomics have some speculating about returns as high as 70x once major listings arrive . Unlike many presale tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE has focused on building both hype and utility, creating a blend that reminds analysts of projects that went on to define previous bull markets. Chainlink – The Bridge Between Worlds Chainlink has quietly become one of the most critical players in the blockchain space. Its oracle network secures trillions in value by linking smart contracts to real-world data. With new products like CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol), LINK is setting itself up as a key infrastructure layer for multi-chain DeFi. Analysts expect this kind of utility to shine once speculation gives way to adoption-driven growth. Altcoin Hype Cycle Timing The big question is not whether altcoins will rally, but when. Historically, once Bitcoin establishes new highs and stabilizes, liquidity spills into altcoins. The combination of new institutional capital, ETF approvals, and global adoption trends could make 2025 the year altcoins steal the show. For investors, the strategy is clear: identify the strongest narratives, accumulate before the hype, and hold through volatility. Conclusion Ethereum, XRP, and Chainlink each provide unique strengths, but MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a high-risk, high-reward option that could deliver staggering multiples. As the altcoin hype cycle draws closer, these four assets stand out as must-watch picks for forward-thinking portfolios.

According to the analysis, more bullish candles are needed to sustain momentum and push the price toward the $120,000 resistance, especially as the market contends with ongoing fundamental pressures. Fundamentals Support Bitcoin Despite Weak NFP Print Cryptowzrd highlighted that the daily candle of Bitcoin closed indecisively, signaling uncertainty as the market evaluates its next move. Despite this indecision, BTC remains above the crucial $110,500 level, which continues to serve as a strong support zone. This level remains critical in determining whether bullish momentum can be sustained in the short term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Battles Key Support: Can September’s Dip Set The Stage For A Q4 Rally? The analyst noted that Bitcoin has maintained its bullish edge even in the face of a lower-than-expected NFP print, triggered by fundamental commentary. This development suggests that broader market sentiment is still supportive of BTC, and technical strength is being reinforced by macroeconomic factors. From a weekly perspective, traditional markets have closed on a bullish note, adding further support to Bitcoin’s potential upside. However, a series of consecutive bullish daily candles is needed to solidify confidence in a rally toward the $120,000 resistance level. Without this confirmation, the market could remain in a holding pattern, leaving room for volatility and short-term swings. On the downside, he cautioned that if Bitcoin breaks below the $110,500 level by mid-week, it could open the door for a deeper correction, potentially testing the $100,000 support zone. Such a move would shift market dynamics, increasing selling pressure and creating strategic opportunities for traders to position for short-term downside plays. Over the weekend, Cryptowzrd will be closely monitoring lower-time frame charts to identify actionable scalp opportunities while ensuring that the current position above $110,500 remains secure. Intraday Volatility Driven By NFP And Market Fundamentals Concluding his analysis, the analyst highlighted that the intraday chart of BTC has been volatile, influenced by recent fundamental commentary and the lower-than-expected NFP print. This volatility reflects the market’s uncertainty, as traders weigh both technical and macroeconomic factors.

Such a breakout signals that buyers are regaining control of the market. On the other hand, a drop below $110,400 could open the door for additional downside. For now, the analyst plans to wait patiently for the market to form a more mature trade setup before taking the next actionable position.

But the 2020s are proving that digital assets may challenge, or even replace – those traditional models. With inflationary pressures, aging financial systems, and a surge of blockchain innovation, analysts argue that the next decade could belong to crypto. Five coins in particular stand out as candidates to redefine investment strategies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Chainlink, and a rising cultural-driven token, MAGACOIN FINANCE . Bitcoin: the ultimate store of value Bitcoin has already secured its role as digital gold. Its 21 million cap and growing ETF inflows make it one of the strongest hedges against monetary debasement. Institutional adoption has deepened, with sovereign wealth funds and pension managers now including Bitcoin in their allocations. Over the next decade, analysts predict Bitcoin will shift from speculative asset to permanent fixture in global reserves. Ethereum: programmable money and infrastructure Ethereum is more than a currency, it is programmable money and infrastructure. Billions of dollars in DeFi, NFTs, and tokenized real-world assets flow through its ecosystem. With Layer 2 scaling solutions driving efficiency and ETFs boosting institutional access, Ethereum is poised to underpin much of the Web3 economy for the next decade. Its deflationary mechanism adds a scarcity layer, creating a blend of utility and store-of-value dynamics. Solana: the speed advantage Solana’s story is one of resilience. Once criticized for outages, it is now powering some of the fastest-growing sectors in crypto: NFTs, gaming, and high-frequency DeFi. With upgrades like Firedancer improving stability and transaction throughput above 65,000 per second, Solana could dominate consumer-facing blockchain applications. Its trajectory resembles the early days of tech giants, where efficiency and adoption built unstoppable momentum. Chainlink: the oracle backbone Chainlink plays a quieter but equally critical role. Its decentralized oracle network connects smart contracts to real-world data, powering insurance, payments, and global finance. Institutional partnerships continue to grow, and Chainlink’s cross-chain interoperability could make it indispensable in tokenized markets. Analysts argue that without LINK, the blockchain economy would struggle to connect to real-world systems. MAGACOIN FINANCE: a cultural challenger with legitimacy While Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Chainlink represent infrastructure and value, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rising as a cultural-driven challenger capable of replacing speculative segments of traditional investing . With both CertiK and HashEx audits completed , it is one of the few presales that pairs meme energy with structural trust. Analysts forecast up to 35x growth potential , with some even suggesting 10,000% ROI over the cycle . Social media momentum has exploded, fueled by the PATRIOT50X bonus code , which lets early buyers expand allocations by 50%. Retail enthusiasm mirrors SHIB’s early mania, but MAGACOIN FINANCE distinguishes itself with audit-backed legitimacy. For those who see the next decade as a blend of utility and culture, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as the kind of high-beta play that could rival traditional speculative assets like penny stocks, but on a global, digital scale. Why crypto could replace traditional investments Traditional assets face structural headwinds. Real estate is constrained by rising rates and demographic shifts. Gold protects value but offers little growth. Equities remain central, but they are tied to cyclical economies and limited by slower innovation cycles. Crypto, by contrast, is borderless, programmable, and scalable. By combining scarcity, utility, and narrative-driven upside, these five coins represent the diversity of opportunity that traditional investments lack. Conclusion The next decade may see a gradual shift from physical to digital wealth stores. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Chainlink bring infrastructure, security, and adoption, while MAGACOIN FINANCE introduces cultural-driven asymmetry that traditional markets cannot match. For investors preparing for the future, this blend of reliability and exponential potential may define portfolios that truly replace old paradigms of wealth building.

With analysts already eyeing the next bull run, many investors are asking which coins could leave Bitcoin in the dust. Here are ten altcoins that could deliver outsized returns when momentum shifts. XRP – Regulatory Clarity and Payment Rail Ambitions Ripple’s native token has long promised to disrupt global payments. With lawsuits largely behind it and ETF conversations heating up, XRP may finally get its breakout moment. The key will be adoption by financial institutions, where Ripple already has a strong foothold. Cardano – Governance and Long-Term Vision Cardano stands apart with its scientific approach and emphasis on governance. As new dApps and sidechains launch, ADA could benefit from its reputation as a secure, research-driven network. If altcoin season favors long-term fundamentals, Cardano is well positioned. Solana – Speed and Ecosystem Growth After surviving past network troubles, Solana has rebuilt confidence with faster block times and new institutional partnerships. Its role in DeFi, gaming, and NFTs makes SOL a clear candidate for outperformance if volumes surge again. Binance Coin – Exchange Powerhouse BNB remains the lifeblood of the Binance ecosystem, giving it unmatched utility in trading, staking, and DeFi products. While regulation remains a risk, the size of Binance’s user base ensures BNB stays relevant in every cycle. Litecoin – The Veteran Contender LTC is one of the oldest cryptocurrencies still standing. Its halvings and solid brand recognition keep it in investor portfolios. While less flashy than others, it often tracks Bitcoin rallies with sharper moves, making it a reliable bull-run companion. MAGACOIN FINANCE – The Rising Star One new project among the giants has drawn a lot of interest. With thousands of early investors already on board, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale has soared past $13 million. Its aggressive roadmap and meticulously planned tokenomics, which seek to reward holders and reduce supply shocks, are what make it unique . According to some analysts, MAGACOIN FINANCE could provide early buyers with a life-altering 12,500% return on investment , emulating the kind of exponential gains previously observed with breakout tokens. As hype builds, it’s becoming one of the most closely watched launches of the year. Polkadot – Interoperability in Action DOT’s mission is to connect blockchains into one cohesive ecosystem. With parachains expanding and adoption growing, Polkadot is likely to play a central role in Web3 infrastructure, giving DOT strong upside potential. Avalanche – Scaling for Institutions AVAX has gained attention for its ability to handle high-throughput applications. With partnerships in finance and enterprise use cases, Avalanche could attract institutional flows in the next bull cycle. Sui – The New Generation Platform As a newer Layer-1, Sui is focusing on performance and developer incentives. Its growth in user-friendly applications positions it as a serious challenger for the next wave of blockchain adoption. Conclusion Bitcoin may set the pace, but these 10 altcoins have the potential to sprint ahead when altcoin season ignites. From established players like XRP, ADA, and Solana, to fast risers like Sui and MAGACOIN FINANCE, the field is packed with opportunity. Investors who diversify smartly could be rewarded when the market tide turns.

51322848,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/2025-analysts-reiterate-250k-btc-with-post-halving-momentum/,1757220018,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51322848.jpeg,Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025: Analysts Reiterate $250K BTC With Post-Halving Momentum,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/2025-analysts-reiterate-250k-btc-with-post-halving-momentum/,"The direction of Bitcoin in 2025 remains one of the most inherently controversial topics in international finance. Analysts are becoming increasingly confident in a narrative that the leader cryptocurrency could reach $250,000 by the end of next year — spurred by supply constraints post-halving, whale accumulation, and steady inflows from institutional investors. The Role of the Halving in Bitcoin’s 2025 Outlook Everything comes down to the Bitcoin halving And this is definitely a part of all of the price prediction models out there. Taking place about once every four years, it lowers the block reward to miners, slowing the rate at which new BTC is being added to the system. This supply shock has historically been the trigger for huge bull markets. The 2024 halving is already beginning to shift the balance of supply and demand. As new coins are trickling in less, there will be more buying pressure from retail and institutions to satisfy, which will move the price upwards, and increase the market’s overall liquidity even less than it is already. Analysts say the stage is set for Bitcoin to surge to $250K by 2025. Institutional Demand and Whale Accumulation The institutional adoption of Bitcoin has been gaining pace. Bitcoin Spot ETFs listed in major financial markets have introduced access to pension funds, asset managers and retail traders without directly owning the asset. Now these products are beginning to attract billions of dollars, offering continual, regular demand for BTC. Meanwhile, blockchain data indicates that whales have held $3 billion worth of Bitcoin in recent months. Historically, large holders have acted as a leading indicator of long-term price trends and have both soaked up supply during periods of weakness and driven further rallies. This confluence of institutional incentives with whale buying further compounds $250K price target. Technical Analysis: Charting the Path to $250K It is beginning to appear as if Bitcoin’s chart is a reflection of the previous halving-driven cycles. Analysts note some crucial price points that may decide how quickly the next bullish rally starts. The first signal is the $100,000 mark, which now serves as the psychological barrier for both short-term traders and long-term holders. If it can break this level with conviction, the first resistance area is around $120,000 and potentially $150,000. These prices may well spark profit-taking waves, but they may also serve as a springboard towards deeper price discovery. Looking downside, analysts note $80,000 as a key support level, a point where buyers continue to buy each dip, preserving the base and favoring a new breakout to the upside. Technical momentum indicators, including RSI and MACD, indicate that there is still space for Bitcoin to heat up before reaching overbought levels, which has emboldened bulls and paved the way for the ongoing rally. If Bitcoin clears $150,000 convincingly, historical fractals suggest that a parabolic move toward $200,000–$250,000 could unfold rapidly. Analysts note that such acceleration often happens in the latter stages of post-halving cycles when fear of missing out drives retail participation to new highs. Comparing Bitcoin’s Cycle to Other Leading Cryptos Bitcoin’s role as the leading digital asset makes it the benchmark against which other cryptocurrencies are measured. Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana are all projected to see growth in 2025, but analysts argue Bitcoin’s post-halving mechanics give it the clearest path to explosive upside. Whereas altcoins often depend on adoption narratives, Bitcoin is increasingly being treated as a form of digital gold. This narrative is resonating with both retail investors and institutional allocators, reinforcing its position as the cornerstone of the crypto market. Rising Interest in Alternative Tokens Like MAGACOIN FINANCE While Bitcoin dominates headlines, new entrants are also gaining attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE, for example, has been compared to early-stage ADA and SOL for its rapid growth and cultural relevance. Its recent milestone of crossing $13.5 million in valuation underscores how investors are diversifying beyond the top two cryptos in search of high-upside opportunities. This trend reflects a broader dynamic where capital flows not only into Bitcoin as a store of value but also into smaller tokens that may deliver higher multiples during the cycle. Conclusion The 2025 Bitcoin outlook is pretty good, with analysts reaffirming a $250,000 price target which is based on the halving effect, whales accumulation and institutional investments. Technical analysis shows $100K, $120K and $150K as key levels for supporting a “supercycle” up to $250K, providing investors with a clear roadmap to watch for this cycle. For individuals seeking alternative opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a rising star in the cryptocurrency landscape, offering potential upside speculation, much like the world’s leading cryptocurrency has demonstrated.

Among the emerging names, MAGACOIN FINANCE has drawn significant attention after hitting a $13.5 million valuation. Analysts are beginning to compare its trajectory to the early growth stages of Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL), both of which transformed from speculative plays into established giants in the crypto ecosystem. With narratives aligning around adoption potential and strong community engagement, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be one of the top rising stars for investors seeking the next big opportunity in digital assets. MAGACOIN FINANCE Crosses $13.5M and Gains Market Traction MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rise to $13.5 million comes at a time when altcoin markets are experiencing renewed interest. As investors rotate capital into fresh opportunities, tokens with thematic appeal and cultural resonance are seeing inflows that traditional assets cannot match. The token has carved out a unique identity with branding that appeals to a wide audience. This is translating into community growth and broader recognition across crypto forums. While still relatively small compared to multibillion-dollar market cap projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE is demonstrating the kind of early-stage momentum that marked the breakout phases of ADA and SOL. Comparing MAGACOIN FINANCE to Cardano and Solana Analysts have not been shy in drawing parallels between MAGACOIN FINANCE and early-stage Cardano or Solana. Cardano, for instance, spent years building its governance and research-driven ecosystem before breaking through resistance to deliver massive returns. Solana followed a different path, leveraging scalability and transaction speed to dominate NFT and DeFi markets. MAGACOIN FINANCE sits at the crossroads of narrative and utility. While it has not yet achieved the level of technological innovation of Solana, nor the research depth of Cardano, it benefits from a growing cultural movement that is helping it capture investor imagination. Analysts note that cultural adoption often plays as strong a role as technical utility in driving early speculative cycles. Technical Analysis and Growth Potential From a charting perspective, MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing early breakout behavior. The token has established strong support near recent lows and is beginning to test higher ranges on increased volume. If momentum holds, a move beyond short-term resistance could quickly accelerate gains toward the next psychological levels. Momentum indicators such as RSI suggest that while the token is not yet overbought, it is gaining strength. Traders point to the possibility of 2× to 3× upside in the near term if the current trajectory continues. Longer term, the comparisons to ADA and SOL imply even higher ceilings if adoption and liquidity continue to grow. Analyst Commentary and Investor Sentiment Market watchers are increasingly vocal about MAGACOIN FINANCE’s potential. Some analysts describe it as a “cultural token with breakout potential,” while others argue it could become a speculative favorite for traders seeking low-cap opportunities in 2025. Community sentiment is also fueling momentum. As retail investors rally behind the token, liquidity is gradually deepening. This is creating conditions where institutional players could eventually take interest, just as they did with Solana and Cardano in earlier stages. MAGACOIN FINANCE in the 2025 Altcoin Landscape The altcoin market in 2025 is evolving around a mix of utility-driven projects and narrative tokens. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out because it straddles both worlds. Its growing community and thematic branding give it visibility, while its development roadmap provides a foundation for future growth. For investors weighing exposure to emerging tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as more than just a short-term play. If it continues building on its momentum, it could transition from a niche cultural project into a recognized altcoin competitor. Conclusion MAGACOIN FINANCE’s $13.5 million success story signals a shift where investors are starting to take note. With references to Cardano and Solana when they were beginning, the project is becoming a potential project to keep a close eye on in 2025. The pieces of a strong narrative are piling up beneath the surface, with technical setups, community adoption and cultural relevance all aligning. For those interested in the best crypto opportunities this year, MAGACOIN FINANCE joins established favourites like ADA and SOL in the spotlight. Its expansion might just be getting started.

In a sea of over 10,000 coins, the challenge is separating short-lived hype from those building real adoption. This cycle has already introduced a new contender that’s stealing attention: BlockDAG . With a presale price locked at $0.0013 and nearly $400 million raised, BlockDAG is setting records before it even launches. Alongside it, established networks like SUI, HBAR, and VeChain are shaping their own paths through utility, partnerships, and adoption milestones. Together, they form a critical snapshot of where the smart money is flowing. Below, we break down why BlockDAG is leading the charge, and how SUI, HBAR, and VeChain compare in today’s volatile but opportunity-rich market. BlockDAG BlockDAG has quickly become one of the strongest contenders for the best crypto right now, rewriting presale history with staggering adoption. The Deployment Event price is locked at $0.0013, giving investors what may be their final golden entry before an explosive listing. The numbers tell the story: more than $400 million raised, 312,000 holders onboarded, and 25.8 billion coins sold across batches. The grassroots traction is unmatched, with the X1 mobile miner app surpassing 3 million users worldwide. Industrial adoption is accelerating too, as 19,000 ASIC miners have shipped across 130 countries, a feat few presale tokens have ever achieved. At its core, BlockDAG runs on a DAG + Proof-of-Work hybrid architecture, achieving speeds of 10 blocks per second with ambitions to exceed 100. This gives it the scalability of Solana, the resilience of Bitcoin, and the flexibility of Ethereum. Whales are noticing: massive buys of $4.4M and $3.6M signal institutional-scale confidence. With a confirmed listing price of $0.05 and forecasts eyeing $1, early investors stand to capture an astonishing 76,815% ROI . For anyone weighing the best crypto right now , BlockDAG’s combination of adoption, funding, and technological advantage makes it the standout pick of this cycle. SUI SUI is consolidating in a tight trading range near $3.35, drawing attention for its potential breakout. Analysts view the $3.15–$3.20 support zone as critical holding this level could unlock a rally toward $3.90. Technical charts show SUI forming a wedge pattern, a classic precursor to sharp price moves. On-chain data is equally supportive, with token burns and gradual supply contraction improving scarcity. Despite wider market caution, investor faith in SUI remains strong due to its fast-growing developer ecosystem. Traders are closely watching volatility, as global sentiment could amplify momentum either way. If the bullish case plays out, SUI could reward patient buyers, solidifying its place among contenders for the best crypto right now in the short-to-medium term. HBAR Hedera’s HBAR is navigating a tricky phase, currently trading near $0.2206 after weeks of selling pressure. Yet its fundamentals remain robust, highlighted by the launch of TransAct , a tool enabling enterprises to use Hedera’s distributed ledger without needing HBAR directly. This simplifies adoption for businesses and strengthens Hedera’s enterprise-focused narrative. Despite this, technicals flash bearish warnings, with downside risks toward $0.20 if momentum stalls. Long-term believers highlight Hedera’s consistent enterprise partnerships and institutional appeal, positioning it as a blockchain for corporate-scale solutions. While not the flashiest pick, HBAR holds its ground as a pragmatic option within the best crypto right now conversation, especially for investors betting on real-world use cases over speculative hype. VeChain VeChain (VET) continues to build relevance through supply chain innovation, though its price action remains modest around $0.02386. Analysts point to mixed signals: a potential decline toward $0.01820 if bearish momentum continues, but also the possibility of a bullish breakout past $0.02725. A double-bottom near $0.020 provides some optimism for reversal, with upside targets stretching as high as $0.0575. Longer-term projections suggest average prices around $0.0544 by 2026, reflecting steady enterprise adoption. As VeChain expands its blockchain applications across logistics and retail, its fundamentals remain strong. While it may not have the explosive trajectory of BlockDAG, VeChain remains an important pick for diversification when considering the best crypto right now with enterprise-driven growth potential. Conclusion When evaluating the best crypto right now , the choice comes down to balancing near-term momentum with long-term scalability.

51286893,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=817367,1757221229,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/51286893.jpeg,Analyst Forecasts XRP To Stage Amazon-Like Rally To $200,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/analyst-forecasts-xrp-to-stage-amazon-like-rally-to-200/,"XRP has drawn plenty of comparisons over the past few months, but one analyst believes the best way to understand its future is to look at Amazon’s past. Nick Anderson, better known as BULLRUNNERS on the social media platform X, says XRP is going through the same kind of consolidation Amazon faced in 2010, and it still has the potential to rally to $200. The key difference, however, is the patience investors will need before this rally can happen. Related Reading: XRP Poised For Amazon-Like Boom? Analyst Predicts $200 Rally Amazon’s Breakout Holds The Clues For XRP XRP’s price action in the past seven days has been highlighted by a trading range between $2.8 and $2.9. The cryptocurrency now seems stuck within this range, but it has managed to hold above $2.8 for the meantime. Interestingly, Anderson likened this consolidation move to a similar retest of a previous high by the Amazon stock (AMZN) back in 2010. In his post, Anderson highlighted how Amazon stock spent roughly 3,800 days consolidating after the dot-com crash before finally breaking past its previous high and entering a meteoric run. However, before entering into this meteoric run, it consolidated for a few months in 2010 just after breaking above its previous high during the dot-com bubble. According to Anderson, XRP’s current structure is tracing out a massive cup and handle that mirrors this exact Amazon stock setup, with the cryptocurrency now using past highs as support in the same way Amazon did. Just as Amazon transformed once it cleared resistance, Anderson believes XRP could follow a similar breakout trajectory that could eventually push its price above $100, and possibly as high as $200. Short-Term Expectations Between $5 And $30 In his assessment, Anderson noted that this predicted rally to $200 might take many years to come to fruition. Comparing today’s price of around $2.80 to Amazon’s $5 launch point before its monumental rally, this would probably be the best time for XRP investors to accumulate for the long term. For younger investors, holding XRP for the next 10 to 15 years could prove transformative, with as little as 10,000 XRP amounting to $1 million in value if the cryptocurrency eventually climbs to $100. Despite his long-term forecast, Anderson is more cautious about what XRP might achieve this cycle. He stated that while a push to $100 in the near term would be “absolutely insane”, a more realistic target for this bull run could lie between $5 and $30. After that, he expects another correction to set in before the rally resumes sometime around the end of the decade.

Anderson also left room for a more explosive scenario, noting that XRP could deliver what he called a “giga rally” if liquidity rushes into the market faster than expected. This is based on the growing anticipation around the adoption of ISO 20022 by the US Federal Reserve. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.81.

It’s coming in the category of low-cap altcoins, having a sub-10-cent price, and is now worth over $2, pointing to past breakout roads. Within these shifts, mature narrative tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are being adopted by the average investor. ETF Buzz Adds Institutional Fuel to Solana’s Bull Case And there’s a real buzz among investors now with the rumors of the Solana ETF that’s coming. Firms like Bitwise, 21Shares, and Franklin Templeton are all putting out clean filings, an indication that there’s a lot of demand for regulatory sign-off. Historically, the approval has resulted in monster rallies – think Bitcoin – so if the approval to list Solana does actually happen, then so might the monster rally. That momentum comes even as on-chain activity has grown. Builders from DeFi and NFT have continued to fall in love with Solana for its fast transactions and low fees, and even applications in government—such as for publishing data—have been showing that the tech can be put to a wider range of uses. Technical Trigger Words: SOL Eyes $250 Breakout Chart-wise, Solana is developing a breakout setup. Price action now closed above some crucial level between $210 and $218. Technically speaking, if SOL holds that zone, the next target up is $250 with further upside going up toward $300 to $305. Momentum studies such as RSI stationed at 63–64 and a positive MACD architecture all support for upward continuation. These patterns are considered to indicate an alignment of institutional positioning to technical formations by analysts. Tiny Altcoin Makes Big Moves While SOL Targets $250 From the chart, Solana is a breakout setup in the making. The price action even closed above a certain significant level which is located between $210 and $218. If SOL stays in the zone, the next target up is $250, with extension upside up to $300 to $305. Momentum studies, RSI, at 63-64 and a MACD construct tracer below zero, all indicates for upwards continuation. Analysts have deemed chart patterns as reflection of institutions positioning alignment to a technical pattern. While SOL has $250 in its sights, another lower cost altcoin piques the interest. That token has already already accrued over $2 in value and more interestingly, comparisons to other strong-return plays like Solana’s own pump Here are some of the startups that have caught investors’ eye with their prospects for a home run. And while people froth at the mouth and get noisier, with the real world just starting to chip in, this low market cap token may be just one big speculative FOMO energy bet on a playing market that only now slowly turning into the next Bitcoin/ETF/BNB-fueled SOL narrative. Narrative Divergence: MAGACOIN FINANCE Enters the Frame Beyond established tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to surface as an alternative narrative play. Its thematic branding around cultural alignment has caught analyst attention—making it another speculative option for investors blending storyline exposure with traditional assets. Analyst Commentary “A close above $218 could be the green light for Solana to test the $250 zone,” says one market chartist, noting the bullish alignment. Another strategist highlighted ETF developments: “If Solana gains ETF clarity, it should attract a wave of institutional capital—even before retail jumps in.” Regarding the low-cap altcoin mention: “Tokens under $0.10 that already exceed $2 tend to show narrative breakout potential. They often mirror early momentum we saw in Solana years ago.” Conclusion The $250 price prediction for Solana has been given a new lease of life, ETF and network adoption, and strong technicals. The ETF hopes that network adoption and technical installations will be convincing enough. Now, breakout alts under $0.10 are already experiencing insane moves, and seem to be signaling some speculative parallel narratives. And for those who want yet more thematic options, MAGACOIN FINANCE provides a narrative path into the niche world of altcoins. You can learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE via the official website.

Analysts are naming Dogecoin a leading meme asset, XRP is on a bullish rally after the clarity provided by regulatory clarity, and an under-the-radar low-cap token below $0.10 is starting to generate buzz. for their own analyst executive chat MAGACOIN FINANCE has also entered the talk as a story-driven competitor. 1. Dogecoin (DOGE) — Meme Power Meets Liquidity It’s not totally clear what has sustained the meme train of dogecoin — now several cycles deep! Analysts say that DOGE has plenty of room to surprise. “DOGE’s liquidity and its community size make it one of the easiest meme coins to trade when sentiment shifts,” one market strategist said this week. “Going into Q4, those things matter more now than ever.” On social media, DOGE communities are abuzz once more, with hashtags popping up again in trending lists. Traders add that a clearance of the $0.25 resistance would open the door for follow-on buying. Meanwhile, Dogecoin continues to be near the top of the Q4 watchlist for those watching meme coins. 2. XRP — Regulatory Clarity and Institutional Momentum Ripple’s token has seen renewed energy since resolving much of its battle with the SEC. Analysts point to this legal progress as a turning point for market sentiment. “Investors are reassessing XRP not just as a speculative asset, but as a currency with ongoing institutional interest,” commented a research analyst from a major crypto desk. “That combination makes it stand out as we head through Q4.” Community channels also highlight increased whale transactions, suggesting larger players are accumulating XRP in anticipation of the next leg up. If institutional adoption of its cross-border payment features continues to scale, XRP could deliver further gains. Investors can follow live XRP updates here .0 3. Low-Cap Hidden Pick — Under-$0.10 Altcoin With Breakout Buzz There’s also a $0.10 crypto that analysts are saying is ready to surge as well. Its low valuation and early community momentum have given it extra visibility this quarter. “These under-the-radar tokens are high risk, but they also offer asymmetric rewards,” observed a crypto analyst in a recent Q4 outlook. “If the adoption or even speculation ramps, they can outperform in a short time. In online forums, early holders describe the project as having “a Solana-in-its-early-days vibe,” which explains why retail traders are circling back to it. This altcoin’s position as a budget-friendly bet makes it attractive for risk-tolerant investors looking beyond top caps. For more, you can see trending low-cap tokens here . 4. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Narrative Token Gains Attention Bullish market analysts also have one watchful eye on MAGACOIN FINANCE, as it continues to flourish in its capacity as a politically-themed, narrative-driven asset. It’s not yet the size of DOGE or XRP, but it is starting to pop up in analyst writes as a play on the other side of the coin. Among trader groups MAGACOIN FINANCE is marked as “one to watch” for anyone looking to get into cultural tokens. Narrative coins, observers say, tend to do well in cycles where attention is as much of a value driver as the fundamentals are. Conclusion As we move further into Q4, Dogecoin continues to be a formidable meme-driven asset, boasting both liquidity and social might. And here we note one more reason why XRP has chances for the upside — institutional demand and fewer regulatory burdens. Hidden under-$0.10 altcoin is marching up and attracting chatter as a breakout candidate, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is trending as a narrative-driven wildcard.

His post highlighted XRP’s trajectory from its early price movements near $0.05, its climb to $3.84, and the possibility of a future rise toward $227. The chart he shared spans over a decade of XRP price data. It plots monthly candles to emphasize long-term structural trends. The analysis was framed around the idea that while history does not replicate exactly, it can often “rhyme.” The chart identifies two clear consolidation phases, each forming a symmetrical triangle pattern . The first pattern, from the early years of XRP’s trading, concluded with an explosive move from pennies to over $3 in 2018. From $0.05 → $3.84 → NEXT $227? History doesn’t repeat, but it sure RHYMES… #XRP pic.twitter.com/6GR2lpDNHX — Amonyx (@amonbuy) September 4, 2025 Patterns Emerging from the Chart According to the chart, XRP has been trading within a second, much larger triangular formation since 2018. This pattern resembles the earlier consolidation period in both structure and duration. The highlighted breakout zones suggest that XRP may be preparing for a significant price expansion. The suggested target of $227 is presented as the next possible phase in this sequence. While no guarantees accompany such chart-based projections, the analysis emphasizes the cyclical nature of markets and the tendency for assets to revisit and extend prior patterns when long-term structures align. Notably, other analysts have shared the $227 target for XRP . By mapping the two consolidation zones side by side, the chart signals that XRP’s long period of sideways trading could be laying the groundwork for a substantial breakout. Extended compression within triangular patterns often precedes sharp directional moves, and in this case, the precedent points upward. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Assessing the Potential Target The projection of $227 stands out as highly ambitious, particularly when compared with XRP’s current price of $2.81. Reaching this triple-digit target would require a climb of 7,978%, and the analysis does not present it as a random figure. Instead, it is derived from the scaling of the earlier breakout relative to the size and timeframe of the present consolidation. XRP beats expectations in 2025, and despite recent underperformance , analysts and experts are convinced that the digital asset could see a major breakout this year.

His post included an image excerpt from the Review of Banking & Financial Law, Volume 36, which contained references to Ripple’s potential role in the global payments ecosystem. By presenting this document, SMQKE highlighted an important perspective on Ripple from Morgan Stanley, one of the world’s largest financial institutions. Even Morgan Stanley “considers Ripple to be a leading international payment alternative to SWIFT.” Yes, it’s documented. https://t.co/ZiU0osDC6D pic.twitter.com/brEUefFXon — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 6, 2025 What the Document Shows The image shared by SMQKE features a passage that outlines Ripple’s cost-saving advantages for banks and remittance providers. It notes that using Ripple, banks can reduce processing costs by up to 60% on certain payments. This efficiency directly benefits remittance recipients by making more funds available after fees. The excerpt goes further by pointing to Ripple’s distributed ledger technology as a possible alternative to the long-established SWIFT system for interbank transactions. Specifically, it references Morgan Stanley’s evaluation of Ripple, citing the firm’s position that adopting a Ripple-like system could “shorten settlement periods, speed up transactions and reduce the risk of fraud.” Importantly, the document also states, “Morgan Stanley considers Ripple to be a leading international payment alternative to Swift,” reinforcing the role XRP and Ripple can play in global finance. What This Means for Ripple and XRP This statement is significant because it reflects the perspective of a global financial powerhouse analyzing the impact of blockchain technology on traditional banking. It also shows XRP’s viability as a competitor in the international payments space . The efficiency gains outlined in the excerpt highlight the asset’s ability to streamline transactions, improve liquidity, and lower costs. These observations indirectly strengthen XRP’s adoption. The broader ecosystem supporting Ripple’s solutions relies on XRP to provide on-demand liquidity and enhance cross-border settlement processes. If Ripple’s technology serves as an alternative to SWIFT, XRP will play a central role in supporting the infrastructure, acting as a bridge currency for the payment system. SMQKE’s post sheds light on a documented perspective that elevates Ripple’s status beyond a niche blockchain solution. By referencing Morgan Stanley’s view of Ripple as a leading international payment alternative to SWIFT, the excerpt reinforces the seriousness with which Ripple’s model is taken in mainstream finance.

With technical resistance, ETF demand, and on-chain patterns in play, ETH’s path remains dynamic. Also in focus is MAGACOIN FINANCE, drawing attention as a thematic counterpoint for speculative-minded investors. Resistance at $4,450 Defines Next Move Ethereum price is holding ground above $4,411, with the $4,450 to $4,500 area acting as a hurdle. Analysts also note this as key technical pivot: a daily close above this level might spur a move to $4,593 and then $4,729, perhaps unlocking an implied target of $6,000. On-chain data does, however, reveal strong ETF demand and significant accumulation from whales when taken into consideration, which is consistent with a bullish structure. These forces imply that investor conviction is still awash even as spot prices are choppy for now. Technical Patterns Support Upside if Key Levels Clear The chart pattern suggests Ethereum may be developing a Wyckoff accumulation, a pattern that precedes an upside breakout when demand surpasses supply. In addition, medium-term Fibonacci analysis suggests upside targets around the $6,000-$6,750 price range, and a successful retest of the $4,400 support may increase the likelihood for continuation of gains. There would probably be good momentum to the upside for a clean break. Fundamental Backing from ETF Flows and Scarcity Trends Ethereum’s fundamentals back the technical narrative.

CryptoPotato reported the XRP Trust launch, which saw the light of day on September 5, 2024, and was immediately followed by an impressive price increase for the underlying asset. Yet, its valuation at the time of under $0.6 was nowhere near the heights of today at almost $2.8. The product had an impressive initial year as it enables investors to gain exposure to the token without having to worry about the challenges of buying, storing, and safekeeping it, as the website explains. The Trust tracks the XRP market price, but the fees and expenses are more modest. With 301,500 outstanding shares, the total assets under management have skyrocketed to almost $17 million, according to the site as of Friday’s closing. Grayscale’s XRP Trust Performance ETF Next? As with its BTC and ETH Trusts, Grayscale was quick to file with the US SEC to convert its XRP product into a fully regulated spot exchange-traded fund. This happened shortly after Donald J. Trump was inaugurated as the 47th US president, Gary Gensler stepped down as SEC Chair, and it became more than evident that there would be more favorable regulations for the cryptocurrency industry. Given its success in converting its Bitcoin and Ethereum Trusts into spot ETFs, the filing with the securities regulator is regarded as almost a guaranteed path for an XRP ETF. However, Grayscale has tons of competition in that field as the total number of such applications sitting on the SEC’s desk is 15. The odds for an approval by the end of the year on Polymarket have skyrocketed to 94% after dipping below 70% just a few weeks ago. Moreover, many experts believe that the actual chances are closer to 100%.

The company revealed that Maxwell Stein, BlackRock’s Director of Digital Assets, will feature as one of the event’s speakers. His inclusion quickly became one of the most discussed points about the conference, given the asset manager’s influence in traditional and digital finance. Stein is scheduled to appear alongside Rory Callagy of Moody’s Investors Services. According to Ripple’s published agenda, their session will explore the impact of tokenized financial assets on capital markets. While the program outlines the broad scope of his presentation, it does not specify whether Stein will address the possibility of a BlackRock-backed XRP exchange-traded product. This uncertainty has fueled anticipation among XRP supporters, many of whom are eager to learn more about BlackRock’s current position on digital assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. XRP Community Watches for ETF Clues BlackRock has long been a central player in the digital asset investment space, offering dedicated funds tied to Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, the firm has so far refrained from applying for an XRP-based ETF . Market watchers have frequently linked this decision to the prolonged legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Even though the lawsuit concluded last month , BlackRock has maintained that there are no immediate plans to launch an XRP fund. Stein’s appearance at Swell comes at a time when institutional interest in XRP is steadily growing. Several asset managers have already submitted filings for potential XRP ETFs , making BlackRock’s silence more notable. The presence of its Director of Digital Assets at Ripple’s flagship event has raised questions about whether the firm might reconsider its position in the near future. Ripple Reveals Full Conference Agenda Beyond BlackRock’s participation, Ripple also shared the full agenda for Swell 2025. The program confirms that the two-day conference will bring together executives from leading financial and technology organizations. Among the listed participants are Ripple Chairman Chris Larsen, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, Nasdaq Chair Adena Friedman, and OKX CIO Jason Lau. The event will open with a welcome reception on November 3, followed by the official start the next morning. Ripple President Monica Long will deliver the opening remarks and later join Adena Friedman for a fireside chat. Other sessions on the first day will cover topics such as stablecoins in cross-border payments and the evolving role of crypto ETFs. The day will end with a social gathering branded “Swellebration.” Day two will shift the focus toward broader issues facing the industry, including the global adoption of digital assets, the regulatory landscape in the United States, and strategies for addressing illicit activity in the sector. A keynote session and a fireside chat with Ripple’s chief executive will conclude the conference. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 BlackRock’s Role While Ripple has confirmed Stein’s role at the conference, it remains uncertain whether his remarks will signal any change in BlackRock’s approach to XRP. For now, the asset manager continues to concentrate on Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, its presence at Swell ensures heightened attention from investors who want to gauge how traditional finance leaders view the future of the digital asset market.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized lending protocol that is currently in presale is demonstrating both. MUTM is already one of the most discussed under-one-dollar DeFi projects with over 16,100 holders already involved and experts estimating it will produce 30x returns. Proof of Demand The most obvious manifestation of traction is in the numbers. Mutuum Finance has gradually increased in price since its earlier presale in early 2025 at only $0.01 per token, undergoing 6 stages to get to its present value of $0.035. The presale has accumulated over $15.4 million so far, which indicates that retail buyers and whale investors have a strong appetite. The newest inflows are six-figure buys by larger players, which is good news to the smaller investors who tend to use whales as a gauge of conviction. In the meantime, the next Phase 7 price increase of $0.04, almost 20% points higher than today, explains the rush to enter before prices rise further. History has shown that the largest multiples can be delivered by tokens priced less than 1 with real utility. Ripple (XRP), Aave (AAVE), and Solana (SOL) all began small and grew to household names. XRP provided 100x to early adopters, Aave shot to more than $600 in the 2021 DeFi boom and Solana soared to a few dollars and over $250 at its peak. However, what made them generate such disproportionate returns was not price, but time and adoption. First-movers knew that the tokens were resolving very real issues in blockchain infrastructure, and the affordability and demand created ideal circumstances to blow up. MUTM is now being positioned in a similar way. With a launch price set at just $0.06, it carries both affordability and an adoption-ready roadmap that could place it on the same growth trajectory as previous cycle leaders. Why MUTM Fits This Pattern Mutuum Finance is developing capabilities that will be adopted over the long-term. It is a dual lending market structure that integrates Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools, where users lend out assets and receive interest in the form of mtTokens, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, where borrowers are able to negotiate stable or variable rates. Such flexibility makes it more attractive to conservative and risk-takers. The other driver of adoption is its beta platform that will be launched alongside the listing of the token. This would imply that lending and borrowing will occur on day one, which is not a common feat in presale projects that normally take months to become operational. To go a notch higher, the Layer-2 integration is in the pipeline, which promises cheap-fast transactions and also makes the protocol scalable to mass adoption. This combined with the fact that MUTM has an advantage as a protocol that is prepared to compete in the current environment of DeFi, rather than a few years later. Built for Longevity In addition to short-term characteristics, MUTM is designed with the concept of sustainability. One of the biggest achievements will be the release of its overcollateralized stablecoin, with a mint-and-burn system like the established players but directly embedded in the protocol. Such a stablecoin will be a source of trustable liquidity, a vital part of a lending ecosystem. Another support layer is the buy-and-distribute model. Part of the protocol fees will be spent to buy MUTM on the open market and redistribute it to the community. This generates the continuity of purchasing pressure, and the price of the token is directly linked to the activity of the platform. Meanwhile, mtTokens (like mtUSDT) allow depositors to earn interest automatically and stake for additional rewards, creating multiple income streams for users and encouraging long-term participation. Security Layer Security has been and will always be the most significant aspect of DeFi, and Mutuum Finance has gone a long way to establish trust. The project has already passed a CertiK audit receiving a score of 95/100 one of the highest scores that a new protocol can receive. To cap it all, there has been the introduction of a $50,000 bug bounty program to motivate white-hat hackers to test the system to the limit and expose vulnerabilities before full implementation. Additional security measures that protect the platform include risk controls like overcollateralization, liquidation, and integrating oracles through Chainlink and fallback systems. Such precautions are taken to ensure that Mutuum Finance is ready to face the technical and market risks as it expands its adoption. Investment Case Study The possible upward potential is better understood in terms of percentage gains in stages. At the present price of $0.035, investors who make an entry will experience close to 100% growth at the time of launch, which is at 0.06. Phase 1 early investors at 0.01 are already sitting on returns of approximately 300% and have an option of enrolling 500-600% at launch. However the real multiples, says analysts, start after listing. Existing investors would make almost 1000% with short-time goals of about $0.4. On the long-term forecasts of $1.5-$2.00 in 2026, it would imply over 4,000% increase in the current levels. The explosive crypto growth formula has never been difficult: mix evidence of demand with actual utility, and long-term prospects. Ripple demonstrated it through 100x returns, Solana through its rocket-ship growth and Aave through its DeFi supremacy. Similar early signs are present now at Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Having more than 16,100 holders already invested, having raised over $15.4M, audited security and a roadmap that brings utility on day one, experts believe it has the ingredients to become a 30x token. To the ones seeking the next breakout under $1, the argument in favor of MUTM is gaining more and more weight each day.

WLFI froze Tron founder Justin Sun’s wallets after unusual transactions raised concerns of insider selling. Sun is pressing the project to unfreeze his allocated tokens. World Liberty Financial Drama Continues On launch day, the community allocation, initially expected to be 5%, only saw 4% of tokens actually go live, as not everyone utilized the designated lockbox. WeRate co-founder Quinten Francois explained that liquidity and marketing, initially reported as 1.6%, actually accounted for 2.8% of the supply. This brought the circulating supply effectively to 6.8%. Meanwhile, other allocations, such as the 10% ecosystem fund and 7.8% reserved for Alt5 Sigma, weren’t truly circulating. In fact, Francois said that they were simply unlocked but not subject to vesting schedules, which created an illusion of available supply that complicated price dynamics. Adding to the complexity, Justin Sun held 3% of WLFI’s total supply. Only 20% of his stake was technically unlocked at launch. He publicly promised not to sell, saying that he supported World Liberty Financial’s long-term goal. The token debuted at $0.20, with a $1 billion market cap, while trading volumes spiked into the billions, generating intense hype. Despite this, WLFI’s price steadily declined, and the on-chain price action appeared suspiciously mechanical rather than driven by genuine community selling. Francois suggested a likely scenario behind the volatility. Exchanges may have offloaded part of the 2.8% liquidity allocation, while Sun allegedly leveraged his connections with HTX, offering users 20% APY to deposit WLFI. This setup would allow him to quietly sell his personal holdings while making it seem as if tokens were being staked by users, and even backfill user withdrawals with his own stack if necessary. Reports indicate Sun moved early $9 million worth of WLFI tokens through HTX and Binance from his addresses, activity tracked by Nansen, Bubblemaps, and Arkham Intelligence. Ultimately, WLFI froze Sun’s wallet using the guardianSetBlacklistStatus function, following these suspicious transfers. The freeze fueled speculation that Sun used user deposits to liquidate his holdings, turning retail investors into exit liquidity. Sun’s Public Appeal A community member praised WLFI’s governance vote that froze Sun’s address, saying it at least temporarily blocks him from repeating prior patterns of alleged pumping and dumping tokens on retail investors. Meanwhile, Sun has publicly appealed to the World Liberty Financial team to restore access. He described the freezing of his tokens as “unreasonable” and stressed that, like other early investors, he “deserves the same rights.” In a bid to calm nerves and regain investor confidence, Sun also went into damage control mode and tweeted that he sees US-listed crypto stocks as “an undervalued opportunity.” He further pledged to personally buy another $10 million of WLFI.

The ETF’s construction focuses on 'pure-play' crypto firms and large-cap companies with significant crypto initiatives, balancing sector sensitivity and risk. Current macro indicators show a mixed but not unfavorable liquidity environment, while the digital asset factor regime strongly favors upward momentum. Given these conditions, I recommend a tactical buy approach—accumulating BITQ on pullbacks during this sustained UpBeta trend regime. Introduction In today's article, we will analyze the Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF ( BITQ ) , managed by the famous cryptographic asset firm Bitwise. This vehicle is an ETF that seeks to replicate the behavior of the Bitwise Crypto Innovators 30 Index, an index of 30 companies linked to the crypto economy. It is important to start here, since the proposed vehicle, does not buy cryptocurrencies, but buys shares of companies whose business depends heavily on the crypto ecosystem (miners, exchanges, custodians, infrastructure providers, asset managers, and also some large companies with relevant crypto initiatives). This means that its performance is closely linked to the health of the sector, to activity in crypto-asset markets, and, by extension, to the prices of assets such as bitcoin or ether, but it does so through quoted shares, with the operation and regulation of a traditional ETF. The fund’s own documentation underlines that it does not invest directly in crypto or derivatives; the exposure is indirect via corporates (“Crypto Innovators”). With this, the reader will wonder how the index decides which companies enter and with what weight in it. The methodology used by the management team divides the universe into two levels. Tier 1 (at least 80% of the index) groups so-called “pure-play,” which are companies that earn more than 75% of their revenues from the crypto market (for example, miners or trading and custody platforms) or that have more than 75% of their assets in bitcoin or ether. Tier 2 (up to 20%) includes large companies (capitalization ≥ $10 billion) with a significant and public initiative in the field of crypto – by business or by holding crypto-assets. In each quarterly review, the index selects the top 20 in Tier 1 and the top 10 in Tier 2. The weight of Tier 1 is set at 85% of the index and Tier 2 at 15%; within Tier 1 it is weighted by free float adjusted capitalization, and Tier 2 is weighted equally. That construction has practical consequences for the investor. On the one hand, it provides “clean” exposure to the heart of the ecosystem—the sector’s so-called “picks & shovels”—and avoids excessive dilutions toward generalist technologists. On the other hand, it introduces different sensitivities within the same ETF: miners depend on variables such as the price of bitcoin, the difficulty of mining, and the electric cost; exchanges/custodians live off activity (volume and new highs), in addition to prices; and companies that hold BTC/ETH on their balance sheets move largely with those assets. In recent data, the fund's own prospectus breaks down a relevant weight into segments such as Mining and Trading & Custody, illustrating those operating levers within the portfolio. Like any equities ETF, its NAV rises or falls depending on the shares it owns. In a bullish environment, the crypto industry usually benefits in three ways: better miners’ margins (high BTC price versus costs), higher commission income and new lines of business in exchanges/custodians when volume rises, and direct balance sheet appreciation with BTC/ETH in treasury holding companies. In contrast, in downturns or with regulatory repression, volumes fall, margins are compressed, and on-balance-sheet crypto holdings subtract. To this must be added the equity risk (dilutions, capital issues to finance mining capex, technological and cyclical risks, etc.). Analysis - Macro Fundamental In this section, we will analyze some macroeconomic indicators in detail to try to offer the reader an accurate perspective and a sound recommendation on the vehicle in question. For this analysis, the first metric we analyzed is the Node Analytica indicator called Liquidity Scanner. This metric summarizes, in terms of quarterly change, whether the US dollar financial system is injecting or withdrawing liquidity, and breaks it down into four broad channels: (1) Fed bank reserves (when they rise, it is usually gasoline for risky assets), (2) issuance of Treasury bills (“bills”) and (3) commercial paper (which tends to absorb cash from the money market), and (4) repo operations linked to stress episodes or technical adjustments. Visually, positive tranches indicate net supply and negative net drainage. For an ETF like the one discussed here, which does not buy crypto directly but rather companies whose business depends on the ecosystem’s pulse, this “water level” is crucial. Higher USD liquidity typically translates into a better risk appetite, more generous multiples, and more activity (volume) across platforms and custodians. Conversely, if liquidity were to contract, it would imply multiple compression, more expensive funding for capex-intensive miners, and often volume drops that weigh on commission income. Today, the graph suggests a more volatile and mixed regime than the big boost of 2020–2021. We can see tranches of supply associated with increases in reserves or episodes of repo, but also tranches of absorption when the Treasury pulls short issuance and the money market takes a large part of those dollars. This indicator could be used as a regime filter. When the indicator chains positive readings and accelerates (rising reserves and lower absorption per bills), beta crypto tends to expand, and the ETF tends to benefit via mining margins and brokerage fees. Node Analytica Second, we delve into a more specific metric of the digital asset sector, which is the analysis of factors of the same. This indicator shows us what factor is commanding right now in Bitcoin and, by extension, what kind of exposure tends to work best. When the purple block (“UpBeta”) dominates, the market is rewarding the upward directional beta, which means clean impulses, stretches where you buy risk and let the trend run. For an ETF like the one analyzed here, which brings together miners and intermediation platforms, that regime is especially favorable, because they are companies with operating leverage to the crypto cycle. If the price rises steadily, miners’ margin improves and exchange activity picks up, and both tend to widen the advance against an equivalent move by BTC itself. By contrast, when the frame shifts to Mean Reversion (turquoise) or there are flashes of breakout intermittently, the message is another: more noise, more comings and goings, and more risk of a high-beta ETF like BITQ “over-reacting” in short corrections. Today, the chart shows us a long stretch with UpBeta as the winning factor, chained since late spring and with few interruptions, while the price of BTC is trading at the top of the range of recent months. The investor’s reading is clear in this regard. The trend environment is still active, and as long as it remains, BITQ tends to perform well for the mix of cyclic miners and volume-linked businesses. In other words, this metric is not meant to guess the future, but to describe the regime you're sailing in, which, combined with the Liquidity Scanner in the first section, can help you distinguish when the tide is ticking (positive liquidity + UpBeta) and when it's prudent to deleverage or demand clearer confirmations. Node Analytica Conclusion As a conclusion and to finish this analysis, my recommendation right now is to buy tactically (staggered tickets and in reversals). The Factor Framework marks a sustained UpBeta regime, that is, the market is rewarding the upward trend, and that usually amplifies the profitability of our ETF for the operating leverage of miners and the rebound of activity in exchanges. At the same time, the Liquidity Scanner does not show as broad a tailwind as 2020–21, but neither does it show persistent drainage, rather a mixed pattern that allows for stretches of risk when it coincides with a favorable narrative.

Solana currently trades at $202.35, down a slim 0.88%. While the token continues to be in favor as one of the top Layer 1 networks, the spotlight is increasingly turning to Remittix (RTX). At a presale price of $0.1050 per token, the cross-border payments project has raised over $24,2 million and sold over 649 million tokens. As it builds up to its soon-to-be-launched wallet beta, many whales are setting up RTX as the best crypto to buy now. Solana Price Trends Amid Broader Market Activity Although the Solana Price dropped recently, its market cap of $109.56 billion reflects strong investor sentiment. The trading volume has also increased by 43.62% to $7.3 billion, reflecting ongoing liquidity. Solana remains one of the top choice blockchains for DeFi applications, NFT stores and low gas fee cryptocurrency transactions. But as investors monitor Solana, more and more are looking for the next altcoin 2025 big one. It is here that initiatives such as Remittix take top position, with practical everyday utility which is significantly more than speculation. How Remittix Is Positioning for Wider Adoption Remittix is a cross-chain DeFi platform solving a $19 trillion global payments problem. Its technology enables individuals to send cryptocurrencies directly to bank accounts in 30+ nations, linking decentralized finance with actual use. Unlike most crypto presales live now, RTX offers immediate use cases such as instant payments, low gas charges and real-time FX conversion. Global Utility: Fast transfers of crypto to fiat within minutes Wallet Launch: Q3 2025 beta launch Strong Momentum: Raised $24,2 Million+ and continues to grow Major Listings: BitMart and LBANK as initial centralized exchanges The project is leaving commitments behind and entering the phase of product delivery with its Remittix Wallet announcement. The wallet will offer users seamless borderless payments, crypto staking possibilities and enhanced security. Presale Success and Exchange Listings Remittix has quickly become one of the top-performing crypto under $1 with whales driving its bullish momentum. Presale recently crossed $20M, triggering the initial exchange listing on BitMart. Not long after, the project crossed $22M, announcing a second listing on LBANK. These centralized exchanges are crucial for expanding global reach, adding liquidity and exposure to RTX. And making it even more thrilling, Remittix launched a $250,000 Giveaway, incentivizing pioneers and encouraging community engagement. Such encouragement, combined with deflationary tokenomics, makes RTX a compelling option for early-stage cryptocurrency investment. Looking Ahead With over 649 million tokens traded and strong demand, Remittix is one of the leading DeFi projects 2025. With its utility, adoption and exchange pull, it’s a new altcoin to monitor this year.

While most larger-cap alts are sluggish during the weekend, some, such as M, WLFI, and OKB, have marked impressive gains. BTC Defends $110K The primary cryptocurrency had a volatile week that started on the wrong foot on Monday. It traded around $109,500 on Sunday, but the bears quickly took control and pushed it south to a multi-month low of $107,200 (on Bitstamp). It reacted well, initially, to this decline, but tested that level once again on Tuesday. The bulls finally reemerged at this point and didn’t allow another retracement. Just the opposite, BTC started to build momentum and pushed past $112,000 on Wednesday. It was stopped there at first, but the cryptocurrency went on the offensive once again on Friday when it surged beyond $113,400 after the latest US jobs report. However, that was another fakeout as the asset plummeted by over three grand almost immediately. Although the weekend has been calmer, BTC still slipped to $110,000 yesterday. So far, it has remained above that level as it even tested $111,000 minutes ago. Its market cap sits at $2.210 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is stagnant at 56.4%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView OKB Above $200 Most of the larger-cap alts have failed to post any big moves in the past day. ETH, SOL, TRX, and SUI are slightly in the red, while XRP, BNB, DOGE, ADA, LINK, and HYPE are with minor gains. CRO has declined the most from the larger caps, losing over 3% of value. In contrast, M continues with its massive run as of late. Another 20% surge has pushed MemeCore to almost $1.9. WLFI is also on the run, surging to $0.24 after a 29% daily pump. OKX’s native token has returned to over $200 after a 13% jump. The cumulative market cap of all crypto assets has added a few billion since yesterday and is up to $3.910 trillion on CG.

He recently shared a chart noting that the digital asset is trading within a descending triangle with a potential 25% breakout on the horizon. The observation comes at a time when XRP has been struggling to maintain upward momentum, reflecting a broader cooling period in the altcoin market. $XRP consolidates in a triangle ahead of a 25% price move! pic.twitter.com/zeuFQNkc5s — Ali (@ali_charts) September 6, 2025 Recent Market Performance In recent weeks, XRP has failed to reclaim the strong gains it posted in July. The price slipped back from its all-time high of $3.65 , weighed down by profit-taking and broader risk-off conditions in digital assets. By early September, the digital asset experienced another decline , finding support close to $2.7. XRP had settled near the $2.80 mark, but the decline has underlined the asset’s inability to sustain its mid-August rally, leaving traders cautious about the next directional move. Technical Structure on the Chart The chart Martinez shared provides a closer look at the current market setup. On the 12-hour timeframe, XRP is confined within a descending triangle pattern . The structure is defined by a series of lower highs meeting strong horizontal support in the $2.7 to $2.8 zone. Fibonacci retracement levels drawn from the recent price swings provide context, showing the asset’s price activity repeatedly rejecting the downward trendline. The combination of resistance along the descending trendline and support close to $2.7 highlights an increasingly compressed trading range. Market participants often view such formations as precursors to strong volatility, as consolidation phases tend to resolve with a decisive move once price breaks beyond established boundaries. The Projected Move According to Martinez’s assessment, XRP may be approaching the point of resolution. A breakout from this formation could trigger a move of approximately 25% from current levels. With the token trading at $2.8155 at the time of his post, such a projection implies a potential upside target close to $3.52. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If XRP were to reach this target, it would mark the first significant test of resistance above $3.4 since late July, an area that previously capped upward attempts. The asset may also turn that level to support, creating a base for another price surge. While the market has exhibited weakness in recent weeks, accumulation at lower levels suggests that buyers are still active. A breakout above the descending trendline would be required to confirm the anticipated 25% rally. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Ripple Officials and Experts Respond,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-coinbase-manipulating-the-xrp-price-ripple-officials-and-experts-respond/,"A recent controversy in the cryptocurrency world has centered on allegations that Coinbase manipulated XRP prices. The allegations were raised by XRP community activist Stern Drew using the on-chain analysis tool XRPScan. According to Drew's analysis, Coinbase's XRP holdings fell from around 970 million in June to between 260 and 300 million by the end of August. During the same period, the number of the exchange's XRP wallets also fell from 52 to 16. Drew claimed that Coinbase sold XRP during periods of low liquidity and distributed it across multiple wallets, coinciding with XRP's failure to break through the $1.20 resistance level at the time. He also claimed that these transactions were directed to over-the-counter (OTC) desks affiliated with traditional financial institutions, suggesting that the price suppression strategy may have been designed to create opportunities for institutional buying. Related News: Controversial Claim from Bloomberg Senior Analyst: ""Bitcoin Price Could Lose One Zero"" There is currently no official evidence to support these claims. Coinbase has not commented on the matter, and there are no investigations or sanctions in the works. Experts believe the decline in Coinbase's XRP holdings is largely due to liquidity management and portfolio adjustments. Similar trading patterns are also being observed on major exchanges and OTC desks. “We all know Coinbase doesn't like XRP, but the price movements were similar when it was delisted from Coinbase in the past. The actual price movements are tied to overall market trends,” said XRP advocate Bill Morgan. Ripple CTO David Schwartz also rejected allegations of market manipulation, arguing that the XRP price is determined by market uncertainties, regulatory issues, and macroeconomic trends. Claims that Coinbase is manipulating XRP prices are currently just speculation based on internal community analysis. *This is not investment advice.

USDH will be deployed on both HyperEVM and HyperCore. The company ensures global distribution compliance with the U.S. GENIUS Act, Europe’s MiCA, and regulatory frameworks across APAC, the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa. Paxos believes its global compliance coverage and connectivity to consumer banking will enable Hyperliquid to transition from an ecosystem for crypto natives to a financial platform for global users. Paxos plans to use USDH yield for HYPE buyback and redistribution Proposal submitted: USDH powered by Paxos USDH issued by Paxos would mean: ❏ Global issuance that is GENIUS compliant ❏ Revenue sharing that fuels HYPE, protocols and validators ❏ Regulatory clarity + global scale to match @HyperliquidX 's explosive growth Hyperliquid. pic.twitter.com/iKIFUOT0bQ — Paxos (@Paxos) September 6, 2025 Paxos said its mission has always been to scale access to on-chain finance by partnering with platforms while maintaining enterprise-grade security, technology, and compliance. According to the company, USDH has a revenue-sharing mechanism that supports HYPE, and the validators. It ensures compliance and scale to match Hyperliquid’s rapid growth. Hyperiquid was the first to introduce the concept of sharing exchange revenue with those who drive volume to its protocol. Paxos said its USDH will boost the initiative to allow those who contribute to the growth of the stablecoin to retain a share of the underlying revenue. The company plans to use 95% of the interest generated by its reserves backing USDH to repurchase HYPE and redistribute it back to ecosystem initiatives. Paxos plans to hold the highest quality reserves of T-Bills, Repos, and USDG, acknowledging that USDH will be required to be supported by U.S. market makers and exchanges. According to the report, revenue share will equal the USDH balances and volumes across partnering Hyperliquid platforms. The redistribution initiative aims to allocate the bought-back HYPE among protocols, validators, and users. Paxos argued that Hyperliquid’s next phase of growth requires the trust of institutions and consumer enterprises that want to interact on-chain. The firm hopes to use its global enterprise distribution to integrate Hyperliquid into the global financial system by expanding beyond crypto-native users towards major enterprises. “We believe Hyperliquid will be the foundational platform for global, decentralized finance. This is why Paxos is committed to making Hyperliquid the first priority with Paxos Labs, a new entity dedicated to accelerating stablecoin adoption within decentralized ecosystems.” – Bhau Kotecha , CoFounder of Paxos Labs. Kotecha revealed that Paxos Labs has acquired Molecular Labs in a bid to accelerate stablecoin adoption in the Hyperliquid ecosystem. Molecular Labs is the infrastructure provider behind LHYPE and WHLP, which have powered the Hyperliquid ecosystem since HyperEVM launched. Paxos said LHYPE will contribute to the Hyperliquid ecosystem since it utilizes Hyperlend, HypurrFi, Felix, and is deployed on Pendle, HypurrFi, and other decentralized exchanges (DEXs). WHLP aims to enable composability with Hyperliquid’s foundational yield source deployed on DEXs. The tokenization platform stated that the USDH stablecoin is purpose-built to drive global adoption and align incentives with builders and users on Hyperliquid. The blockchain company also plans to add support for HYPE as an asset within Paxo’s brokerage infrastructure. Hyperliquid seeks proposals from teams ready to launch USDH Hyperliquid said it’s launching its dollar-pegged asset in its network upgrade and is opening the process to competition among development teams to submit proposals. The firm said that after a validator quorum approves a candidate, the chosen team will still need to win a gas auction before deployment goes live. Omar Kanji, partner at Dragonfly, explained that Hyperliquid’s initiative could significantly impact existing stablecoin providers on the protocol. According to him, the initiative could disrupt Circle’s USDC, which is currently the main settlement stablecoin for derivatives trading on Hyperliquid. Kanji believes that a complete switch to USDH could generate an additional $220 million in annualized revenue for HYPE token holders, based on a 4% yield assumption. He also stated that the migration would cut into Circle’s revenues by the same amount. The tech executive also mentioned that the initiative would represent a 7% reduction in USDC’s outstanding supply, currently sitting at $5.5 billion on the platform.

Why USDC & USDT Dominate in 2025,https://bitzo.com/2025/09/betting-with-stablecoins-why-usdc-usdt-dominate-in-2025,"In 2025, stablecoins have become the backbone of online betting and crypto gambling platforms. While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain popular, their volatility makes them less practical for day-to-day wagers. Instead, two stablecoins—USDC (USD Coin) and USDT (Tether)—dominate the space, offering gamblers stability, speed, and accessibility. Stability Meets Speed For bettors, the biggest draw of USDC and USDT is price stability. Pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, both stablecoins remove the uncertainty of fluctuating token values. This means that a $100 bet today will still be worth $100 tomorrow—something that cannot be guaranteed with BTC or SOL. On top of that, transactions settle quickly, particularly on low-fee chains like Tron or Solana, allowing instant deposits and withdrawals on most platforms. Widespread Adoption Both coins are accepted almost universally across betting sites. USDT, thanks to its long-standing dominance in crypto trading, is integrated on virtually every exchange and payment rail. USDC, backed by Circle and increasingly used in regulated environments, has gained traction for users who prefer transparency and stronger compliance. Together, they cover both ends of the spectrum: USDT for sheer liquidity and USDC for trust in audits and oversight. The Network Effect Another reason for their dominance is network effect. Many betting platforms prefer stablecoins because they simplify accounting and reduce the risk of volatility-related losses. Players, in turn, flock to platforms that support stablecoins, creating a feedback loop of adoption. By 2025, it’s become rare to find a gambling site without USDC or USDT support. Why They Beat Other Options Alternatives like DAI, FRAX, or algorithmic stablecoins exist, but they haven’t achieved the same scale. Concerns about collateralization, liquidity, or regulatory pressure keep them in the niche category. For now, USDC and USDT hold the lion’s share, with unmatched liquidity, market trust, and utility. Dexsport: Multi-Chain Betting With Stablecoins and Beyond One of the best examples of how stablecoins power betting in 2025 is Dexsport.io , a crypto-native sportsbook and casino built for speed, privacy, and control.

The sportsbook side covers 100+ markets per football match, along with MMA, basketball, and esports such as CS2, Dota 2, and Valorant. Live streaming is available even without a deposit. For transparency, Dexsport operates a public live bet desk where all bets and outcomes are visible in real time.

Thanks to this multi-chain flexibility, players can fund and withdraw instantly in their preferred currency. The platform continuously adds content too, recently expanding its Bitcoin casino with 5,000+ games from providers like NetEnt, Pragmatic Play, and Evolution.

Boost Your Odds, Stack Your Rewards — Try Dexsport Platform Now Outlook for the Future Looking forward, the landscape could shift if new regulatory frameworks boost USDC further or if decentralized stablecoins gain credibility.

A truly significant Bitcoin price surge has captured global attention, with BTC remarkably climbing above the $111,000 mark. This thrilling development, confirmed by Bitcoin World market monitoring, shows Bitcoin trading robustly at $111,000 on the Binance USDT market. It signals a renewed wave of optimism and highlights the immense potential still held by the world’s leading digital asset. What’s Fueling This Astonishing Bitcoin Price Surge? This impressive rally isn’t happening in isolation; rather, it’s often the culmination of various interconnected factors. Understanding these elements helps us grasp the broader picture behind such significant movements in the crypto market. Growing Market Optimism: A prevailing positive sentiment frequently drives investor confidence. This leads to increased buying pressure as more individuals and entities seek to participate in the potential upside. Institutional Adoption: We are witnessing growing interest and adoption from large financial institutions and corporations. Their entry often injects substantial capital, providing significant momentum to the market. Macroeconomic Landscape: Global economic conditions, including concerns about inflation or traditional asset performance, can position Bitcoin as an attractive alternative or hedge. Investors look for safe havens, and sometimes, Bitcoin fits that role. Technological Progress: Continuous improvements and innovations within the Bitcoin network, alongside the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, enhance its utility and security, boosting its overall appeal to a wider audience. Each of these factors, individually or in combination, contributes to the powerful upward momentum seen in this current Bitcoin price surge . The Significance of BTC Reaching $111,000 Reaching such a high valuation is far more than just a numerical achievement; it represents a crucial psychological and technical milestone for Bitcoin. This particular Bitcoin price surge validates the asset’s inherent resilience and its rapidly growing acceptance within the mainstream financial world. Reinforced Market Confidence: This price point strengthens investor belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its potential as a store of wealth. Setting New Precedents: While not an all-time high, breaking significant psychological barriers like $111,000 often sets the stage for further gains, building positive sentiment for future price discovery. Increased Mainstream Visibility: Such substantial price movements invariably attract widespread media attention. This heightened visibility introduces Bitcoin to new audiences, potentially drawing in fresh capital and participants into the ecosystem. Ultimately, this milestone underscores Bitcoin’s increasing maturity and its undeniable presence as a significant global financial asset. Navigating the Volatility: Opportunities and Risks with a Bitcoin Price Surge While an exciting Bitcoin price surge offers considerable opportunities, it is absolutely essential to remember the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Prices can fluctuate rapidly, and what goes up can also come down. Potential for Substantial Gains: For investors who entered the market earlier or bought during previous dips, this surge can translate into significant unrealized or realized returns. Risk of Market Corrections: After any substantial rally, market corrections are a common and natural occurrence. Prices may retrace to find new, stronger support levels before attempting further upward movement. Importance of Risk Management: Savvy investors always prioritize sound risk management strategies. This includes diversifying portfolios, setting clear investment goals, and crucially, only investing capital that one can comfortably afford to lose. Understanding these dynamics is paramount for making informed and responsible decisions in such a fast-moving and often unpredictable market. What Does the Future Hold for Bitcoin After This Surge? The recent Bitcoin price surge naturally sparks widespread conversations and speculation about its future trajectory. While making precise price predictions is impossible due to market complexities, current trends and expert insights offer some valuable perspectives.

This could drive sustained demand. Technological Evolution: Ongoing technological advancements, such as improvements to the Lightning Network for faster and cheaper transactions, aim to enhance Bitcoin’s scalability and practical utility. Regulatory Landscape: Greater global regulatory clarity, when it materializes, could provide a more stable and predictable environment for Bitcoin’s growth, potentially attracting even more mainstream investment. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s long-term future will be shaped by a complex interplay of market forces, continuous technological evolution, and broader macroeconomic shifts. Its journey remains one of the most compelling stories in modern finance. The impressive Bitcoin price surge above $111,000 is a compelling reminder of cryptocurrency’s dynamic nature and its increasing relevance in the global financial landscape.

While broader conditions remain subdued, technical signals suggest that the current phase may not last much longer. Xoom (@Mr_Xoom), a crypto analyst active on X, drew attention to XRP’s technical setup by sharing a chart that places the token within a descending triangle . He stated that the market will soon stop its sideways movement and emphasized that the structure is nearing its conclusion. XRP & the whole market will NOT keep moving sideways. XRP's triangle seems to be closing into itself in the next 7-8 days (no I'm not saying moon in 7 days, I'm showing what the chart shows us) Usually, we see a break to either side before it closes into itself. pic.twitter.com/hDLoafg3uQ — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) September 6, 2025 XRP’s Descending Triangle According to him, “XRP’s triangle seems to be closing into itself in the next 7-8 days.” He clarified that this projection is not a price prediction but rather an illustration of what the chart shows. The chart he shared marks clear support levels around the $2.7 range, with lower levels drawn beneath as potential downside zones. XRP tested this support in early September after a notable decline caused it to fall below the $3 support level. A descending trendline formed in early August, shortly after the digital asset hit its all-time high in July , and it has capped XRP’s highs since then, pressing the price closer toward the apex of the triangle. This technical formation typically precedes movement in one direction, often before the structure fully converges. XRP Price Performance and Technical Analysis XRP’s recent price action has been defined by underperformance in late August and early September. Sellers have repeatedly tested the lower boundary of the triangle, bringing the price close to the highlighted support area. The token now trades around $2.8, holding just above the lower red support line marked on the chart. The descending trendline illustrates a sequence of lower highs, reflecting persistent selling pressure over the past month. Simultaneously, the support region beneath $2.8 has held on several occasions, preventing a decisive breakdown. This combination has narrowed the trading range, leaving XRP consolidating in increasingly tight territory. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Next Resistance Level The blue horizontal level just above $3 represents the resistance that XRP would need to overcome to regain its momentum. Until such a breakout or breakdown occurs, the triangle remains the dominant formation governing price behavior. As Xoom noted, it is common to see a move before the triangle closes entirely. The technical compression suggests that market participants are waiting for confirmation in either direction. A sustained breakout above the descending trendline could shift momentum toward the upside, while a move below the defined support would indicate renewed weakness.

But the latest numbers are making his concerns harder to ignore. America’s national debt has now climbed above $37 trillion , while household debt has reached a record $18.39 trillion. Credit card delinquencies are also rising, showing that everyday Americans are struggling to keep up with higher borrowing costs. MAKES ME SAD: In 2025 credit card debt is at all time highs. US debt is at all time highs. Unemployment is rising. 401 k’s are losing. Pensions are being stolen. USA may be heading for a GREATER DEPRESSION. I get sad because as I stated in an earlier X….Tweet….I warned… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) April 18, 2025 On top of that, the labor market, which has long been one of the strongest parts of the U.S. economy, is beginning to weaken. In August, the economy added just 22,000 new jobs, and unemployment rose to 4.3%, the highest level in four years. BREAKING: US NONFARM PAYROLLS ACTUAL 22K (FORECAST 75K, PREVIOUS 73K) $MACRO — FinancialJuice (@financialjuice) September 5, 2025 Meanwhile, inflation is proving stubborn, and the Federal Reserve is under pressure. If it cuts interest rates too slowly, growth could stall further. But if it cuts too aggressively, it could spark new problems of its own. Rising bankruptcies, falling consumer confidence, and slower growth are already feeding the sense of fragility. Against this backdrop, Kiyosaki’s warning feels more relevant than ever. And for many investors, Bitcoin’s built-in scarcity is once again drawing attention as a possible hedge against economic uncertainty. Bitcoin’s Scarcity Advantage Bitcoin’s structure offers what fiat currencies cannot: a fixed limit on supply. With a hard cap of 21 million coins, and more than 19.9 million already mined, the remaining issuance is shrinking. The next halving in 2028 will slow new supply even further, tightening availability at a time when traditional assets risk dilution. Unlike gold, Bitcoin is borderless, transparent, and instantly transferable, making it an increasingly attractive hedge during monetary uncertainty. If fears of recession deepen, its limited supply could amplify its role as a store of value. For many, the very risks Kiyosaki warns about may highlight why Bitcoin’s scarcity matters most. Bitcoin Short-Term Technical Outlook Bitcoin is consolidating near $110,800 inside an ascending triangle, a pattern that often signals upward continuation. Since late August, the chart has shown higher lows pressing against resistance at $113,400, reflecting steady accumulation. The 50-SMA at $110,209 is acting as a floor, while the 200-SMA at $112,543 serves as a pivot. Bitcoin 4-Hour Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum indicators lean constructive, with the RSI near 51 and candlestick activity, Doji and spinning tops, pointing to buyers absorbing pressure. A breakout above $113,400 with volume could open the door toward $115,400 and $117,150, confirming the bullish trajectory. If $110,000 fails, support sits lower at $108,450–$107,400, though the rising trendline suggests such pullbacks remain corrective rather than a trend reversal. For traders, a tactical long above $113,400, with stops under $110,200, offers a clear setup. Bitcoin Long-Term Forecast: Higher Zones Ahead Bitcoin’s broader trend remains firmly bullish, anchored by its rising channel on the weekly chart. Price is consolidating above $110,000, with immediate resistance at $124,750 and a critical test at $134,500. Clearing this zone would likely open the way toward Fibonacci targets near $171,000, with $231,000 as the next long-term milestone. Bitcoin Weekly Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The 50-week SMA at $95,928 provides strong dynamic support, while the 200-week SMA around $42,869 marks the ultimate structural floor. The RSI at 62 signals healthy momentum without being overbought, leaving space for continued expansion. Candlestick action shows no signs of major reversals, reinforcing buyer control. For long-term investors, dips toward $100,000–$104,000 may provide accumulation opportunities rather than risks. With issuance slowing and demand rising, Bitcoin’s scarcity-driven appeal strengthens the case for six-figure levels in the next cycle.

Do Kwon took his pleas to the nation’s high court and subsequently saw his claims dismissed by the judge in charge of proceedings. According to reports, the sum represents half of the $28.4 million needed to purchase the Orchard Road penthouse. The former Terraform Labs boss had set his sights on the Sculptural Admore unit, which was valued at S$38.8 million, five months before the unfortunate collapse of his digital assets TerraUSD and Luna in 2022. According to court documents, Do Kwon had chosen his preferred 7,600 square foot duplex with four bedrooms on the 19th floor of the development, one of three penthouses in the development. Singapore court strikes out Do Kwon’s bid to recover penthouse deposit Do Kwon, originally from South Korea, had paid about S$19.4 million, which was half of what he needed to secure full ownership of the property. According to records , he paid for the penthouse in option fees and subsequent payments through his wife. He was unable to complete the purchase of the unit, and the penthouse was later resold to another party for S$34.5 million. While the developer claimed that he had forfeited the money he got from Do Kwon, the Terraform Labs founder argued that the forfeiture was invalid, and filed a claim at the Singaporean High Court through his wife. His application was subsequently dismissed. In addition, Kwon and his wife signed a 16-month lease from February 2022 to June 2023 for the apartment, paying about S$40,000 per month. The couple paid S$640,000 upfront and carried out renovations on the property. In May 2023, Kwon asked his wife to pay S$1,000 to the developers, exercising the option to purchase the property, but his wife was unable to complete the transaction as required by May 31, 2023. The option to purchase and the lease expired in June 2023, and the developers terminated the sales and retained the funds paid. Kwon’s wife continued to live in the unit till July 2023, having paid an additional month’s rent. The developer claimed that she breached the terms of the contract and asked her to pay another month’s rent, moving to recover S$90,000 in repair costs. However, in his claims, the High Court Judge Philip Jeyaretnam struck out the seller’s repair claims, awarding him an additional month’s rent, and asked Do Kwon to cover his legal costs. Legal ruling compounds Kwon’s woes The ruling adds to the legal challenges of Do Kwon after the collapse of the Terra-Luna ecosystem, which saw more than $40 billion in investor funds erased. Kwon had pleaded guilty in August 2025 in New York for conspiracy and wire fraud in a United States prosecution case linked to the collapse. As part of his plea deal, he agreed to forfeit about $19.3 million and some properties. The judge in charge of his case moved his sentencing to December 11. Do Kwon and the Luna Foundation Guard were sued by more than 366 investors at the Singapore International Commercial Court in May and face demands of about $66 million to $90 million. Notably, Kwon’s business was originally registered in Singapore. The case mirrors that of FTX executive Sam Bankman-Fried, who was indicted for multiple fraudulent schemes he carried out while he was CEO at the company. He was found guilty of two counts of wire fraud, two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. The court sentenced SBF to 25 years in prison and three years of supervised release. He was also ordered to pay about $11 billion in forfeiture for his part in the numerous fraudulent schemes that were carried out at the company. Get seen where it counts.

The chosen list includes an unexpected newcomer among meme coins. The results feature notable choices that could attract attention from trend watchers. Discover which coins qualified and why one emerging meme token particularly distinguishes itself. PEPE: The Meme King Riding Digital Waves PEPE launched on Ethereum in April 2023 as a tribute to Pepe the Frog, featuring zero taxes, deflationary burns, and pure community momentum. No team allocations, no roadmap—just meme culture meeting crypto. The spring 2023 explosion created overnight millionaires and triggered ""memecoin season 2.0"" where countless animal tokens launched and crashed within hours. Today, PEPE maintains a devoted community and ranks among top cryptocurrencies by market cap. The green frog's survival depends on social media hype and crypto's love affair with internet culture. In a market full of complex projects, PEPE's honest proposition—""we're just here for the memes""—continues to resonate powerfully. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price, far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.005 by Stage 13, with over $15 million already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a target listing price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity VeChain: Tracking Goods, Boosting Trust VeChain was born in 2015 when Sunny Lu left Louis Vuitton to give products a digital spine. Each item gets its own ID and tiny sensor. The data lives on VeChainThor, a public network made just for business use. Food, cars, and shoes can show where they have been in real time. Big names like Walmart China, BMW, and PwC already plug into it. This real world use helps its coin, VET, stay among the top 40 by size. Many coins promise grand dreams, yet few leave the lab. VeChain ships today and earns fees with a second coin, VTHO, so VET holders gain small but steady income. It avoids high power costs by letting chosen leaders confirm moves, keeping speed high. In the current market fresh money often chases hype, but history favors working tools. If supply chain worries and fake goods stay in the news, VET could ride the next cycle harder than pure finance tokens. IOTA’s Tangle: A Fast Lane for Web3 Value and Data IOTA works like a busy spider web instead of a single chain. This web, called the Tangle, links each new action to two earlier ones. No miners stand between users, so fees fade away and speed grows with traffic. The code is open for all, from hobby builders to big firms. With Shimmer as its testing ground, the team rolls out tools for custom networks, smart contracts that speak the Ethereum language, native coins, NFTs, and even digital IDs. In a market that swings like a pendulum, projects with clear use cases shine. IOTA bets on machines paying machines, supply chains talking in real time, and cities that manage power on their own. Unlike many coins that still fight scaling troubles, IOTA gains speed as more people join. New rewards on Shimmer also pull fresh builders. If the next cycle prizes real adoption over hype, this lean and fee-less network could catch the spotlight. Still, every cycle has surprises, so timing remains an art. HBAR: The Silent Sprinter of the Crypto Track Hedera Hashgraph runs on a web of computers that talk in a new way. Instead of long blocks like Bitcoin, it uses tiny chats called gossip to record moves. This cuts power use because no one mines. Fees stay small, and deals finish in seconds. HBAR, the coin of the network, pays those fees and keeps the system honest. Owners can lock up their HBAR and earn extra, so the network stays safe. Banks, games, and supply chains already test this speedy tool. Market moods shift fast, yet HBAR holds a quiet edge. Big names like Google and Boeing sit on its council, adding trust. As traders hunt for coins with real use and green goals, HBAR fits both lists. It has lagged the big rallies, so its price still looks light compared with rivals aiming for smart contracts. The closed patent could slow hobby developers, but it also guards the design from copycats. If the next cycle rewards speed, low cost, and eco care, HBAR may sprint ahead. Conclusion PEPE, VET, IOTA, and HBAR look good in the 2025 bull run, yet XYZVerse (XYZ) emerges stronger, mixing sports passion with meme energy and eyeing a 20,000% climb.

51333763,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=801560,1757237400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51333763.jpeg,Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Price Prediction: Can This DeFi Token Climb From $0.035 to $5 by 2030 as Analysts Expect?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/mutuum-finance-mutm-price-prediction-can-this-defi-token-climb-from-0-035-to-5-by-2030-as-analysts-expect/,"Cryptocurrency price projections are never an easy subject to discuss, more so when we are talking about early-stage tokens that are relatively cheap and useful. A project that is being taken seriously is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a lending protocol that is decentralized. Investors are now wondering whether MUTM can possibly hit $5 by 2030 as some analysts believe it can with the token having only priced at a mere $0.035 right now. To address the question, it is useful to consider the progress of Mutuum Finance in phases since its inception during the presale up to its adoption milestones, and eventually, its future growth prospects. 2025: The Beginning In Phase 1, which opened in early 2025, Mutuum Finance presold at basement-level prices of $0.01, and early adopters were given access to a baseline price of $0.01. Since that time the token has progressed in several phases, and currently at Phase 6 the price is at $0.035, and the official launch price is at $0.06. Investors at this level today are also geared towards approaching 100% gains at the time of listing, which makes it essential to invest at the earliest point possible to avoid being left at the last stages. Mutuum Finance has already raised over $15.4 million and has over 16,100 holders already, evidence of a highly interested market even prior to exchange listings. The presale is designed to pay off early entrants, and the next round will increase the cost to $0.04, an almost 20% increase over current prices. What makes MUTM even more unique is that, unlike most other presale tokens that lapse for months before becoming functional, its beta platform will be launched on the same day as the token listing, so that live lending and borrowing can occur immediately. This is one of the key reasons why it can have early adoption and enable MUTM to gain credibility within a short period. 2026: The First Growth Wave Mutuum Finance is likely to face the first year after launch. The protocol supports both conservative and risk-seeking participants with its dual lending markets, Peer-to-Contract pools that issue mtTokens and its Peer-to-Peer lending with variable or stable borrow rates. The analysts estimate that when the lending markets take off, the token will increase to a short-term objective of between $0.25 and $0.45. This would be a 600% to 1,200% growth over the current presale price of $0.035. It is the kind of infancy phase that a project such as Aave or Solana underwent before it was widely known in the market. The early user adoption, inflows of whales, and the ongoing effects of the Mutuum Finance buy-and-distribute mechanism, which recycles protocol fees by purchasing back MUTM in the market and redistributing it to users, should make this growth phase self-propagating due to the constant buy-side pressure. 2027: The Expansion Phase Mutuum Finance anticipates growing its feature-set by launching its overcollateralized stablecoin, which will be based on a mint-and-burn mechanism. Stablecoins will support the foundation of DeFi, and its direct integration into the system of Mutuum will ensure both liquidity and stability, stimulating an increase in the number of borrowings and lending operations within the protocol. Simultaneously, the intended Layer-2 implementation of the project will make the transaction costs less expensive and faster, and the platform will be more scalable and will be more appealing towards larger numbers of users. Listings on major platforms will also have a wider reach as well. Together, these adoption drivers will help push MUTM closer to the $1.00 milestone. At that price, early Phase 6 participants would see gains of more than 2,700%, a transformative return for those who entered before the launch. 2030: Maturity Phase Moving forward, analysts are estimating that by 2030, Mutuum Finance will be trading at $5.00. The thinking is this simple: the more people use the platform, the higher the demand of borrowing and lending, and as each transaction contributes to the buy-and-distribute system, there is constant pressure to buy, which contributes to appreciation of value in the long term. At this point, not only would Mutuum Finance have its two lending markets and stablecoin operational, but it could also have possibly spread across multiple blockchains, becoming a liquidity marketplace across DeFi networks. The mix of powerful tokenomics, practical adoption, and scalability over the long run is what supports the $5 forecast. Today, the entry of $0.035, at a price of $5.00, would be a markup of over 14,185%, even a gain that could rival the breakout stories of XRP, Aave, or Solana during their early phases. Why Experts Believe It’s Possible Critics might ask how realistic a $5 price target of Mutuum Finance might be, but history makes it very plain what to expect. Aave used to sell at a few dollars and then it rose over $600. Solana shot up by a small fraction of less than $1 to over $250. Early believers were rewarded with 100x with Ripple (XRP). The driving forces in all these situations were utility, timing and adoption. These projects addressed actual issues, were initiated at a time when the demand was gaining momentum and captured the liquidity that propelled them to the top in a short time. Mutuum Finance is also poised to do so, with platform flexibility in borrowing, direct functionality at its inception, and long-term tokenomics that anchor activity in the platform to token demand. Cryptos have always favored tokens which are both pocket-friendly and have practical applications and Mutuum Finance fits that description perfectly. Since it started at presale levels of $0.035, analysts project it to grow to $0.25–$0.45 in its initial growth stage, close to $1.00 in 2027 and will hit $5 in 2030. To investors, the XRP, Aave, and Solana experience is pretty straightforward: first movers get the biggest multiples. Mutuum Finance is yet to become a household name, but with its adoption roadmap continuing to unfold according to schedule, the project may become one of the most notable DeFi success stories of the decade.

Key Takeaways: Michael Saylor joins the Bloomberg Billionaire Index with a $7.37B net worth, most of it tied to his company Strategy. Strategy holds over 659,000 BTC, worth nearly $73B, making it the largest public Bitcoin holder globally. Despite meeting criteria, Strategy was excluded from the S&P 500, possibly due to qualitative judgment by the selection committee. Saylor now holds the 491st spot on the list , after seeing his fortune climb by nearly $1 billion since the start of 2025, a 15.8% increase. Majority of Saylor’s $7.3B Fortune Tied to Strategy Holdings The bulk of Saylor’s wealth, approximately $6.72 billion, is tied to his equity in Strategy, the Nasdaq-listed firm known for its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Bloomberg estimates another $650 million of Saylor’s assets are in cash. The billionaire joins other crypto industry leaders on Bloomberg’s top 500, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, currently ranked 234th with $12.8 billion, and Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao at 40th with $44.5 billion. Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced former CEO of FTX, was previously on the list before the exchange’s collapse in 2022. Strategy currently holds around 659,739 BTC, or approximately 3.42% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, according to data from StrategyTracker. At current prices, that stash is worth nearly $73 billion. Despite concerns from critics, the company maintains that its massive Bitcoin purchases are executed in ways that do not impact market prices. “The way we buy Bitcoin is we do not move the price of the Bitcoin,” said Shirish Jajodia, Strategy’s corporate treasurer. JUST IN: Michael Saylor is now one of the top 500 richest people in the world — Bloomberg The #Bitcoin effect pic.twitter.com/iNCMaOXQ5N — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 6, 2025 Shares of Strategy (MSTR) closed Friday up 2.53%, but remain down over 12% for the month. The company was notably excluded from the S&P 500 during the latest reshuffle in August, despite meeting listing requirements and already being a part of the Nasdaq 100. Analysts suggest the exclusion may stem from qualitative considerations by the S&P selection committee, which evaluates candidates using a broader set of criteria beyond market cap and trading volume. Saylor’s Strategy Adds 7,714 BTC in August as Bitcoin Dips Below $108K Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin-heavy firm, Strategy, added 4,048 BTC for $449.3 million between August 25 and Monday, bringing its total holdings to 636,505 BTC. The latest buy came as Bitcoin’s price briefly touched $113,000 before sliding under $108,000, with the average purchase price at $110,981 per coin. In total, Strategy acquired 7,714 BTC during August, down from 31,466 BTC in July, through multiple smaller purchases, including 3,081 BTC last week. The firm has now spent roughly $46.95 billion on its Bitcoin reserves, averaging $73,765 per coin. According to the SEC filing, the purchases were funded via proceeds from four of Strategy’s at-the-market equity offerings. Saylor previously called these offerings the core of the company’s “Bitcoin defense department.” He has repeatedly stated that Bitcoin represents “digital gold” and a superior form of money. His strategy has been to convert a large portion of Strategy’s balance sheet into Bitcoin, financing some purchases through debt and equity offerings.

Decentralized compute network Spheron has kicked off an ongoing buyback-and-burn program for its native token, $SPON, executing the first cycle this week. The company said it repurchased 0.625% of total supply, worth $500,000 at an $80 million FDV, with all tokens set to be permanently burned, reducing overall supply. This process will now continue on a recurring basis, with future buybacks tied to network revenue and compute demand. How the Mechanism Works The move is part of Spheron’s “Secure Compute” initiative, which links revenue from GPU rentals directly to token scarcity. The Secure Compute Flywheel is built around a simple principle: every increase in network usage creates value for $SPON holders. Compute providers collateralize GPUs with $SPON and offer subsidized rates to users. When demand spikes, surplus margins are generated and funneled back into the ecosystem through buybacks at or above the token’s launch floor value. All repurchased tokens are permanently destroyed, introducing consistent deflationary pressure. “Our first $SPON buyback shows real impact, linking decentralized compute usage to tokenomics,” said Prashant Maurya, Spheron’s co-founder and CEO. “Every workload on Spheron powers AI innovation while making $SPON scarcer, stronger, and more valuable.” Burn the Token, Grow an Ecosystem Spheron has rapidly scaled its network, now counting 44,000+ nodes across 170 regions, more than $100 million in distributed compute, $16 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), and a community of over 400,000 members. The $SPON token facilitates transactions, governance, and now deflationary mechanics. The company said the recurring buyback-and-burn cycle is designed to reward providers, lower costs for users, and benefit token holders to reinforce its goal of building a sustainable compute economy for its growing community.

A team of sharp minds from Harvard, Caltech, and MIT guides the code, and they fund it themselves, keeping choices clear of outside pull. Many users now hunt for lower fees and faster trades; that trend lifts chains like Solana and Arbitrum. Hyperliquid goes further by cutting fees to zero and keeping the book on-chain, a combo few rivals match. If the bull run keeps warming, fresh volume could rush to places that feel smooth yet fair. Early signs show tight spreads and lively flow, hinting that the idea clicks with pro and casual players alike. While no one can promise price moves, a lean set-up, clear vision, and growing need for speed make the coin one to watch this cycle. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.005 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early for Maximum Gains Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Pocket Mining: Pi Network Lets You Earn Crypto with a Daily Tap Pi Network puts coin mining in your pocket. Since 2019, the Stanford-born app has let anyone hit a single button each day and earn Pi. No loud rigs, no hot chips, barely any battery loss. You grow speed by inviting 3-5 trusted friends, forming small safety rings that join into a giant trust web. This web keeps records safe and removes need for power-hungry machines. Extra boosts come from running a home computer node or locking away coins to help apps inside the system. Right now the coin lives on its own chain in a closed phase, so users must pass a simple identity check before moving Pi around. The team says an open door is next; once that happens, Pi can flow to markets and other chains. Many traders hunt fresh projects with low energy use and big crowds, and Pi’s millions of members tick both boxes. Unlike Bitcoin’s costly math or meme coins with no plan, Pi blends green tech and social pull. If the open launch lands during the next crypto upswing, today’s daily taps could age well. PEPE: The Meme King Riding Digital Waves PEPE launched on Ethereum in April 2023 as a tribute to Pepe the Frog, featuring zero taxes, deflationary burns, and pure community momentum. No team allocations, no roadmap—just meme culture meeting crypto. The spring 2023 explosion created overnight millionaires and triggered ""memecoin season 2.0"" where countless animal tokens launched and crashed within hours. Today, PEPE maintains a devoted community and ranks among top cryptocurrencies by market cap. The green frog's survival depends on social media hype and crypto's love affair with internet culture. In a market full of complex projects, PEPE's honest proposition—""we're just here for the memes""—continues to resonate powerfully. When 6900 Beats 500: The Meme Coin Chasing a $69 Trillion Dream Money once meant shiny metal. Now it means digits that dance on screens. SPX6900 is the loudest dancer of all. Born from online jokes, it claims 6900 is better than 500, so it must beat the S&P. The goal is bold: a $69 trillion cap. Fans post memes, trade tokens, and shout the mantra “bigger number, better coin.” This wild energy has pushed SPX6900 from hidden chat rooms to front-page buzz. People now watch the chart like a game, waiting for the next leap. Behind the jokes sits real code that locks supply, burns fees, and rewards holders. That keeps the chart climbing when hype fades. Think of it as Dogecoin with brakes and turbo. In today’s market, Bitcoin rests and traders hunt fresh thrills. Meme coins move fastest, and SPX6900 leads the pack. Volume is rising while rivals like PEPE cool off. If the mood stays bright, the token could sprint again. For buyers who live for headline heat, SPX6900 still looks hot. Conclusion HYPE, PI, PEPE, and SPX thrill in the 2025 surge, but first all-sport memecoin XYZVerse merges fandom and memes, targeting 20,000% upside through a community-driven, GameFi-powered movement.

El Salvador increased its gold reserves with a historic $50 million purchase, while retaining its ambitious Bitcoin policy, strengthening its hybrid approach to stability and innovation. On the other hand, HIVE Digital Technologies expanded in Paraguay, completing Phase 2 of the Yguazú Project and reaching 18 EH/s of Bitcoin mining power using renewable hydroelectric electricity. El Salvador strengthens reserves with gold and Bitcoin El Salvador made a historic purchase of $50 million in gold, its first in 35 years. This move increases the nation’s reserves by more than 31%, bringing the total to approximately 58,105 ounces, valued at $207 million. At the same time, the country continues to amass Bitcoin, with more than 6,290 BTC worth over $706 million. El Salvador’s reserve strategy aims to strike a balance between risk and opportunity by combining gold, a traditional safe-haven asset, and Bitcoin, a symbol of financial innovation. Beyond accumulation, the government has redistributed its Bitcoin into several wallets with less than 500 BTC each as a safeguard against future technical risks, such as those posed by quantum computing. The gold acquisition not only mitigates cryptocurrency volatility, but it also sends a strong message to institutions such as the IMF: El Salvador is not only relying on Bitcoin, but is also strengthening its financial credibility with traditional assets. HIVE reaches 18 EH/s with Yguazú phase 2 completion On September 3, HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. announced the successful completion of Phase 2 of its Yguazú Project in Paraguay, surpassing the global Bitcoin mining capacity of 18 exahashes per second (EH/s). The milestone was met ahead of schedule following the installation of the most recent ASICs, putting the company over its original 17 EH/s target. With this development, HIVE is now mining more than 8 Bitcoin per day globally, cementing its position as one of the industry’s major competitors. The Yguazú mining plant, powered by 200 MW of renewable hydroelectric electricity from the Itaipú Dam, is the company’s largest to date and was finished in record time. The business stated that work on its Phase 3 site in Valenzuela, a 100 MW green energy project, is nearly complete and would be ready for ASIC installation in the following weeks. Once operational, HIVE anticipates its global hashrate to exceed 25 EH/s, accounting for roughly 3% of the total Bitcoin network, with a daily output of approximately 12 BTC. Itaú asset launches dedicated crypto division Itaú Asset Management, Brazil’s largest private asset manager, established a cryptocurrency business within its multibillion-dollar mutual fund arm. João Marco Braga da Cunha, former portfolio management director at Hashdex, will lead the business. Hashdex was a pioneer in Brazil’s cryptocurrency ETF sector. The new branch of Itaú aims to produce alpha for customers by harnessing the volatility and unique opportunities of digital assets, building on current products like its Bitcoin ETF and retirement fund with crypto exposure. Itaú Asset now manages over 1 trillion reais ($185 billion) throughout its portfolio. Itaú’s mobile app already allows for direct trading of 10 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, and USD Coin, with in-house custody management. This endeavour adds to the company’s overall focus on digital assets. The cryptocurrency business intends to provide new financial products ranging from fixed-income style instruments to high-volatility strategies combining derivatives and staking-based funds.

Remittix (RTX) is quickly earning a reputation as perhaps the next “XRP,” with high-growth potential that institutions now appear to notice. XRP Stays Grounded But Faces Resistance Ripple price remains steady in the $2.80–$2.90 range. Some analysts eye a $4 run by 2026, driven by renewed institutional backing and potential ETF approvals. RSI and MACD signals suggest XRP is consolidating and waiting for a pickup in volume to break above $3.10–$3.20. The shift in sentiment is subtle yet real. Investors recognise XRP’s legacy value, but the recent traction suggests a drive for projects that combine reliability with real-world utility. Ethereum’s Momentum Meets Competition Ethereum (ETH) continues to embody mainstream DeFi and smart contract utility. Its Fusaka upgrade, designed to boost scalability and reduce gas costs, reinforces its infrastructure strength. But even amid this foundation upgrade, institutional attention is pivoting toward altcoins solving real problems. Demand for ETH remains high, but some capital is already edging toward younger tokens with sharper growth profiles. Institutions Eye Remittix for Explosive Utility-Driven Gains Remittix (RTX) is gaining investors’ attention for all the right reasons. Investors are drawn not by hype, but by what the token promises: real-world utility via PayFi, crypto solutions designed for everyday payments. Key developments are fueling institutional interest: Raised over $24,2 million in presale, with 649+ million tokens Confirmed listings on BitMart and LBank, ensuring market access. Beta wallet set to launch on September 15, 2025. Designed for the $19 trillion remittance market, blending utility with scale. Accumulation by “smart money” investors seeking high utility + speculative upside. Now called the “Next XRP”, Remittix (RTX) is a token drawing institutional capital precisely because it bridges DeFi with real-world needs. Institutions Are Calling RTX the Next XRP XRP still holds relevance and ETH remains essential. But as crypto evolves, institutions are betting on utility paired with adoption. That has firmly put Remittix on their radar. With strong presale performance, listings and a built-for-purpose model, it’s shaping up as the hottest “next XRP” offering both practicality and explosive potential.

Over the past week alone, the network absorbed $6.7 billion in stablecoin inflows, a larger amount than many chains manage in years. That brings Ethereum’s total stablecoin base to $145B+, more than half of the entire market, solidifying its position as crypto’s settlement layer for dollar-backed tokens. This matters because stablecoin inflows often act as dry powder, ready to rotate into ETH or other assets once sentiment shifts. $ETH pulled in $6.7B of stablecoins in the past 7 days. That’s more new inflows in a week than most chains have managed in years. Ethereum’s total stablecoin base now sits around $145B+ over half of the entire market. pic.twitter.com/HsUGXH7Lcj — NekoZ (@NekozTek) September 4, 2025 At the same time, institutional demand is picking up. Ether ETFs, particularly BlackRock’s spot product, have seen steady growth in assets under management, showing that regulated structures are becoming a gateway for professional investors. Macro and Network Tailwinds On the macro side, the U.S. economy is slowing, and expectations for Fed rate cuts later this year are rising. Looser financial conditions tend to benefit crypto, while stablecoin policy momentum in Washington is adding legitimacy to Ethereum’s role as the backbone of tokenized dollars. Layer-2 networks are also expanding throughput and reducing costs, which continues to strengthen ETH’s long-term adoption case. Key highlights: $6.7B in new stablecoins entered Ethereum in one week. Ethereum now hosts 50%+ of the global stablecoin supply. ETF inflows and policy clarity support institutional growth. Ethereum Technical Setup: $5K in Play At the time of writing, Ethereum price prediction is neutral as ETH trades near $4,305, consolidating inside a descending triangle that has capped upside since late August. Sellers lean on resistance at $4,490, while buyers defend a triple-bottom support near $4,250. The 50-SMA ($4,363) is acting as immediate resistance, with the 200-SMA ($3,885) anchoring the broader trend. The RSI at 47 is neutral but not oversold, leaving room for a breakout. Ethereum 4-hourly Price Chart – Source: Tradingview If ETH clears $4,490 with conviction, the path opens toward $4,665 and the $4,865 zone, which aligns with its all-time highs. A bullish engulfing or three white soldiers formation would confirm momentum. On the downside, losing $4,250 risks a drop to $4,070 and potentially $3,940–$3,785. For traders, the setup is clear: a long entry above $4,490 with stops under $4,250 could target $4,665–$4,865 in the near term. With record stablecoin inflows, ETF demand, and improving macro conditions, Ethereum’s case for a $5,000 breakout this cycle looks stronger than ever. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining BTC’s unmatched security with Solana’s high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $14.3 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today’s stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012875—but that figure will increase as the presale progresses.

With the crypto industry evolving, athletes and their management are now choosing brand reputation ahead of financial rewards from crypto companies. In a recent interview featuring Shelly Socol, marketing executive at BTCC Exchange, the days of athletes taking crypto endorsement deals with huge benefits are long gone, noting that the hype is seriously fading. According to Socol, the management in charge of athletes now carry out deep research and extensive checks, looking for track records, regulatory compliance, and long-term viability of the crypto firm before allowing athletes under their control to sign on as ambassadors. Athletes are prioritizing safe crypto endorsement deals The development comes amid recent scandals that have trailed exchanges in the past, with firms like FTX and Binance serving as examples. While Binance remains a household name in the crypto industry, its popularity hasn’t come without a few issues. According to BTCC, which just signed NBA star Jaren Jackson Jr. as its ambassador, crypto firms are also using the athletes to protect their credibility. Socol mentioned that partnerships like that are no longer about crypto firms gaining popularity, highlighting that crypto and several digital assets have made sure the world knows a thing or two about the digital asset space. He mentioned that most endorsement deals are just about athletes choosing to align with brands that promise stability and other benefits in addition to the financial incentives. The need for research is something that has become a topic worth discussing in the past few years. According to a 2024 report from CoinGecko, there was a 38% drop in crypto and sports sponsorships, dropping sharply from its peak in 2021. The report noted that one of the major reasons why there has been a drop is the state of the market. In addition, athletes are demanding transparency from crypto firms, asking experts about everything they need to know in terms of legal and financial aspects before signing. Digital assets impact endorsement deals Some athletes are also choosing to take their payments in Bitcoin, seeing the asset as the best among all digital assets in the industry. They also see it as the perfect hedge against inflation, something financial experts would have told them time and again. Also, crypto sponsorships have evolved, with firms now adding fan engagements and other metrics across their social media into the contracts. This way, the athletes use their popularity to drive in the crowd, hoping that the firm does better and protects their integrity. Reports also claim that this year has seen athletes seek evidence of firms following the needed regulatory guidelines and approvals before choosing to do business with them. In other cases, crypto firms that boast high-profile players provide the evidence others need to commit to them. For instance, Cristiano Ronaldo’s deal with Binance makes him a face of the brand across his social media, a move that could lure others to sign with the brand. However, the challenges in the sector remain, with factors like the decline in the general crypto market affecting endorsement values. While some athletes prefer to be paid in cash, most exchanges would prefer to pay them in digital assets, and a drop in the price of the asset might affect the financial package of their endorsement deals. Meanwhile, the consensus remains that these firms will be looking to maintain user trust, which would translate into these athletes trusting their brand enough to commit to them.

Key Takeaways: The updated 2025 crypto bill proposes clear roles for the SEC and CFTC, plus a joint advisory committee with mandatory public responses. It includes protections for DeFi developers, validators, and wallet builders, so long as protocols are not centrally controlled. Airdrops, staking rewards, and DePIN tokens would be exempt from securities laws under the bill’s new definitions. The updated draft bill also introduces protections for DeFi developers and emerging blockchain sectors like DePINs. Furthermore, it proposes the formation of a Joint Advisory Committee on Digital Assets, comprised of members from both the SEC and CFTC. SEC and CFTC Must Respond Publicly to Crypto Committee Findings While the committee’s recommendations would be nonbinding, both agencies would be required to publicly respond to any findings, signaling a stronger push for transparency and coordination. “The SEC and CFTC must align to reduce regulatory overlap, eliminate unnecessary friction, and support innovation,” SEC Chairman Paul S. Atkins and CFTC Acting Chair Caroline D. Pham said in a joint statement . The two agencies are also planning a public roundtable on September 29 to further discuss harmonization efforts. Significantly, the draft includes explicit protections for developers and users in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Developers who contribute to decentralized protocols, validators, liquidity providers, wallet builders, and infrastructure contributors would not automatically fall under traditional financial regulations, so long as the protocol isn’t centrally controlled. HUGE: SENATE CRYPTO BILL NOW SAYS TOKENIZED STOCKS ARE STILL SECURITIES! The crypto bill clarifies tokenized assets stay under SEC oversight and can NOT be treated as commodities. pic.twitter.com/xMgQ9U357q — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) September 6, 2025 This provision responds to growing concerns in the wake of legal actions like the conviction of Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm . Critics argued the case blurred the line between software development and criminal liability, raising alarm throughout the developer community . The bill also aims to ease regulatory fears over common crypto activities. Airdrops, staking rewards, and liquid-staking outputs are defined as “gratuitous distributions” that wouldn’t be considered securities offerings under current law, shielding users from unintended legal exposure. DePINs and Tokenized Assets Included For the first time, Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs) receive specific treatment under federal law. Tokens powering these networks would be exempt from securities classification if no single entity controls more than 20% of the supply. The safe harbor is meant to support decentralized telecom, storage, and sensor networks that often rely on community participation. The bill also addresses tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), noting that the act of tokenization doesn’t turn a non-security into a security. It instructs regulators to study verification, custody, audit, and enforcement standards for RWAs, especially as more financial institutions explore blockchain-based asset issuance. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), a key architect of the bill, said the goal is to present a reconciled version of the legislation for President Trump’s signature before the end of the year. The Senate’s version will need to be aligned with the Clarity Act, which passed the House in July .

According to Dalio, a rate cut could lead to a depreciation of the dollar and a drop in stock prices. Speaking during a Reddit Q&A session, Dalio said, “If the Fed cuts interest rates, short-term rates and the dollar will weaken, while long-term rates will rise, steepening the yield curve.” He added that in this situation, stocks could perform poorly, as expected, due to weakening investor confidence and stagflation concerns. While the possibility of a 0.25 point interest rate cut in September is prominent in the markets, major institutions such as Bank of America are predicting at least two additional rate cuts this year and an expansionary policy that will last until 2026. Dalio also highlighted long-term economic risks. He noted that the US national debt, which has reached $37 trillion and is equivalent to 124% of GDP, is the highest level since World War II. Dalio, who has previously likened the US debt problem to “plaque accumulating in the veins” and the economy to “a ship heading towards the rocks,” predicted that the country could face a debt-related crisis within the next three years. Stating that confidence in the dollar and US bonds may weaken due to the increasing budget deficit, rising borrowing costs and financial indiscipline, Dalio wanted 15% of portfolios to be allocated to alternative assets such as gold and Bitcoin. Related News: JPMorgan Chief Analyst Reveals What Will Happen If the Fed Cuts Interest Rates Dalio made the following statement in his assessment of Bitcoin: Bitcoin is now an alternative currency with a limited supply. If the supply of dollars increases or demand decreases, cryptocurrencies could become an attractive alternative. However, Bitcoin also has its drawbacks: it can be monitored and potentially controlled by governments, and its programming can be broken by new technologies. Therefore, it is unlikely to become a reserve currency. Gold, on the other hand, has a stronger position thanks to its longer history and its holding as a reserve by governments. That's why I hold a small amount of Bitcoin but a lot more gold. The most important thing is to have alternative currencies to protect wealth, because most fiat currencies with large debts will lose their value against hard currencies. *This is not investment advice.

While Cardano continues to make headlines in “Cardano news” feeds, traders are increasingly realizing that the biggest upside is happening elsewhere. And in September, that’s Layer Brett , the Ethereum Layer 2 meme coin presale that’s already approaching $2.9 million in funding. With meme season heating up, analysts say Layer Brett is emerging as the play that could outshine big caps in 2025. Cardano news sentiment cools despite technical optimism For months, Cardano has struggled to break out of its long-term downtrend. ADA currently trades near $0.83, repeatedly failing to sustain moves above stiff resistance at $1. On-chain metrics and technical indicators show buyers trying to defend key support around $0.80, but rallies have consistently stalled. Analysts now see risks of a deeper retracement toward $0.68 if momentum fails to keep up. At the same time, broader market sentiment is flashing warning signs. Google Trends data shows a surge in crypto-related searches, often a telltale signal that the market is overheating. Historically, these peaks in search activity have coincided with whales taking profit while retail sentiment runs high. With ADA’s inability to clear resistance and broader signals pointing to a local top, many Cardano holders are reassessing whether this cycle’s upside has already been priced in. Ultimately, while ADA might eventually grind back toward $1 if market conditions align, it lacks the speculative heat that defines this part of the cycle. That speculative energy is flowing directly into Layer Brett, and the charts show it. Why Layer Brett is primed to leave Cardano in the dust Unlike Cardano, Layer Brett combines meme appeal with real Ethereum Layer 2 infrastructure. It offers near-instant transactions, ultra-low fees, and staking rewards north of 800% APY, creating both narrative buzz and tangible incentives for early buyers. As Ethereum cements its role as the backbone of decentralized finance and Layer 2 adoption accelerates, every inflow into ETH infrastructure trickles down to projects like Layer Brett. At a presale price of just $0.055, the token offers asymmetric exposure to Ethereum’s growth story — the kind of early positioning that ADA investors wish they had during Cardano’s launch years. Analysts argue that while ADA may eke out gains in 2025, Layer Brett’s upside could extend into the 4,000% to 8,000% range, making it one of the most compelling meme plays of the year. Layer Brett: The clear frontrunner for meme season in 2025 and beyond The writing is on the wall: Cardano news may keep flowing, but meme capital is flowing elsewhere. With whales selling into euphoric peaks and retail sentiment shifting fast, ADA risks being left behind while the next generation of meme coins takes center stage. Layer Brett ’s presale milestone of nearly $2.9 million proves the market sees where the real opportunity lies. For traders seeking life-changing returns in 2025, the choice is becoming increasingly clear — ADA might limp higher, but Layer Brett is sprinting toward meme stardom. LBRETT is available now at $0.0055. Don’t miss out on the next 100x—join the Layer Brett presale today.

One such opportunity is Layer Brett, a meme coin built on Ethereum's Layer 2 solution, which is currently making waves with its ongoing successful presale. A Fresh Look at Cardano's Market Position Despite the historical achievements and technical advancements of Cardano, it faces challenges breaking through key price resistances, with its value hovering around $0.83. The consistently strong support near $0.80 signifies investor interest, but the inability to surpass the $1 mark raises doubts about its short-term growth potential, particularly when compared to emerging coins like Layer Brett . Market indicators suggest a cooling interest in Cardano as Google Trends show a spike in general crypto searches, a scenario typically associated with market peaks and subsequent sell-offs by large holders. Why Investors are Eyeing Layer Brett As a Meme Coin Leader Unlike traditional crypto assets, Layer Brett merges the meme culture with significant technological backing of Ethereum's Layer 2. This not only enhances transaction efficiency and reduces costs but also aligns with the current trend towards decentralized finance (DeFi). The project offers staggering staking rewards, potentially exceeding 800% APY, making it an attractive investment. Industry experts posit that Layer Brett's current presale value of $0.055 provides a rare asymmetric investment opportunity, especially when juxtaposed with Cardano's slower growth trajectory. The Meme Season of 2025: What to Expect As the crypto market continues to evolve, the narrative and financial momentum are increasingly leaning towards projects like Layer Brett. With a presale nearing the $2.9 million mark, it’s clear that the community sees a massive potential in this meme coin over established cryptocurrencies like ADA. For those considering diversifying their portfolio or looking for high-return investments, Layer Brett is emerging as a viable contender. Early participation in the presale could be the key to securing substantial gains in the burgeoning meme coin sector.

Key Takeaways: Crypto sentiment slipped into “Fear” over the weekend as traders moved into major assets like BTC, ETH, and XRP. Analysts say altcoin season may not return until later this year, with volumes fading and caution rising across the market. Some traders remain optimistic, arguing that altcoins are undervalued and this cycle may not follow historical halving patterns. On Sunday, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index dropped to a score of 44 , after hovering in the “Neutral” range for several days. Traders Ditch Obscure Altcoins for Bitcoin, Ether and XRP: Santiment Data provider Santiment said traders are retreating from obscure altcoins and refocusing on major assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and XRP. “A heavy focus on large-caps can indicate a more cautious or ‘risk-off’ sentiment among traders,” Santiment noted in a Saturday report. The shift comes amid growing anticipation around the possibility of an altcoin season. However, analysts at Bitfinex suggest that renewed momentum in lower-cap assets may not materialize until more crypto ETFs come online later this year. Bitcoin is down 5.38% over the past month, while Ether has gained 9.44%, according to CoinMarketCap. The broader altcoin landscape remains under pressure despite signs of isolated strength. The Altcoin Season Index, published by CoinMarketCap, stood at 56 on Sunday — a level that technically qualifies as “Altcoin Season” but still reflects uncertainty. The metric weighs performance of the top 100 altcoins versus Bitcoin over a 90-day window. “This is the final shakeout for altcoins,” trader Rekt Fencer said, pointing to fading volumes and nervous sentiment. THIS IS THE FINAL SHAKEOUT FOR ALTCOINS Alts are more OVERSOLD than during: COVID FTX Crash Tariff War No one believes anymore That’s exactly why the altseason is coming pic.twitter.com/7VTU742qmU — Rekt Fencer (@rektfencer) September 6, 2025 Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory remains in flux. Daan Crypto Trades said BTC price action is “undecisive” and could sweep monthly lows to shake out late longs. “That should then cause some panic and fear of it losing $100K,” the trader added. Michael van de Poppe, founder of MN Trading Capital, pushed back on the bearishness, arguing that altcoins are “extremely undervalued” relative to prior cycles. He added that 2025 is shaping up to be “completely different” from earlier market patterns. Bitcoin analyst PlanC echoed that view, warning against drawing firm conclusions based on only three previous halving cycles. “Anyone who thinks Bitcoin has to peak in Q4 of this year does not understand statistics or probability,” he wrote on X. Anyone who thinks Bitcoin has to peak in Q4 of this year does not understand statistics or probability. The halving is completely irrelevant at this point, and there is zero fundamental reason—other than a psychological, self-fulfilling prophecy—for the peak to occur in Q4… — PlanC (@TheRealPlanC) September 5, 2025 Eric Trump: ‘No Question’ Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million Eric Trump, co-founder of American Bitcoin (ABTC) and son of US President Donald Trump, has said there is “no question” BTC will hit $1 million in the coming years. Trump pointed to surging demand from governments, major corporations, and wealthy families as key drivers behind his conviction. “Everybody wants Bitcoin. Everybody is buying Bitcoin,” he said. “That’s why I’ve always said Bitcoin is going to hit $1 million. There’s no question.” However, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz has pushed back on predictions that Bitcoin could hit $1 million in the near term, warning that such a move would likely reflect a collapse in the US economy rather than a crypto success story. “People who cheer for the million-dollar Bitcoin price next year, I was like, guys, it only gets there if we’re in such a shitty place domestically,” Novogratz told Natalie Brunell on the Coin Stories podcast recently. “I’d rather have a lower Bitcoin price in a more stable United States than the opposite.” The post Crypto Market Slides Into Fear as Traders Pull Back From Risky Altcoins appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|Bitcoin|Cryptocurrency|Ethereum,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|ALTCOIN|MARKET|ETH,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-09-07 09:58:27

Among them sits a recently launched meme token that differentiates itself from competitors. The compilation aims to highlight tokens with strong upside potential, appealing to those seeking opportunities in the dynamic market landscape. PEPE: The Meme King Riding Digital Waves PEPE launched on Ethereum in April 2023 as a tribute to Pepe the Frog, featuring zero taxes, deflationary burns, and pure community momentum. No team allocations, no roadmap—just meme culture meeting crypto. The spring 2023 explosion created overnight millionaires and triggered ""memecoin season 2.0"" where countless animal tokens launched and crashed within hours. Today, PEPE maintains a devoted community and ranks among top cryptocurrencies by market cap. The green frog's survival depends on social media hype and crypto's love affair with internet culture. In a market full of complex projects, PEPE's honest proposition—""we're just here for the memes""—continues to resonate powerfully. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Hits the $15M Milestone XYZVerse ($XYZ), recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, is drawing significant attention thanks to its standout concept. It is the first ever meme coin that merges the thrill of sports and the innovation of web3. Unlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse offers real utility and a clear roadmap for long-term development. It plans to launch gamified products and form partnerships with big sports teams and platforms. Notably, XYZVerse recently delivered on one of its goals ahead of schedule by partnering with bookmaker.XYZ, the first fully on-chain decentralized sportsbook and casino. As a bonus, $XYZ token holders receive exclusive perks on their first bet. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.005, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.01. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $15 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $20 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors are rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price, and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits VeChain: Tracking Goods, Boosting Trust VeChain was born in 2015 when Sunny Lu left Louis Vuitton to give products a digital spine. Each item gets its own ID and tiny sensor. The data lives on VeChainThor, a public network made just for business use. Food, cars, and shoes can show where they have been in real time. Big names like Walmart China, BMW, and PwC already plug into it. This real world use helps its coin, VET, stay among the top 40 by size. Many coins promise grand dreams, yet few leave the lab. VeChain ships today and earns fees with a second coin, VTHO, so VET holders gain small but steady income. It avoids high power costs by letting chosen leaders confirm moves, keeping speed high. In the current market fresh money often chases hype, but history favors working tools. If supply chain worries and fake goods stay in the news, VET could ride the next cycle harder than pure finance tokens. IOTA’s Tangle: A Fast Lane for Web3 Value and Data IOTA works like a busy spider web instead of a single chain. This web, called the Tangle, links each new action to two earlier ones. No miners stand between users, so fees fade away and speed grows with traffic. The code is open for all, from hobby builders to big firms. With Shimmer as its testing ground, the team rolls out tools for custom networks, smart contracts that speak the Ethereum language, native coins, NFTs, and even digital IDs. In a market that swings like a pendulum, projects with clear use cases shine. IOTA bets on machines paying machines, supply chains talking in real time, and cities that manage power on their own. Unlike many coins that still fight scaling troubles, IOTA gains speed as more people join. New rewards on Shimmer also pull fresh builders. If the next cycle prizes real adoption over hype, this lean and fee-less network could catch the spotlight. Still, every cycle has surprises, so timing remains an art. HBAR: The Silent Sprinter of the Crypto Track Hedera Hashgraph runs on a web of computers that talk in a new way. Instead of long blocks like Bitcoin, it uses tiny chats called gossip to record moves. This cuts power use because no one mines. Fees stay small, and deals finish in seconds. HBAR, the coin of the network, pays those fees and keeps the system honest. Owners can lock up their HBAR and earn extra, so the network stays safe. Banks, games, and supply chains already test this speedy tool. Market moods shift fast, yet HBAR holds a quiet edge. Big names like Google and Boeing sit on its council, adding trust. As traders hunt for coins with real use and green goals, HBAR fits both lists. It has lagged the big rallies, so its price still looks light compared with rivals aiming for smart contracts. The closed patent could slow hobby developers, but it also guards the design from copycats. If the next cycle rewards speed, low cost, and eco care, HBAR may sprint ahead. Conclusion PEPE, VET, IOTA, HBAR remain solid low-cost picks, but First All-Sport Memecoin: XYZVerse (XYZ) targets 20,000% gains by merging sports passion with meme culture, GameFi plans, and community-led growth.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Joins XRP and SOL on Analyst Top Picks,https://timestabloid.com/best-cryptocurrency-under-0-04-mutuum-finance-mutm-joins/,"Investors on the hunt for high-growth opportunities often eye cheap cryptocurrencies under $0.04. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out in this group, now being acknowledged alongside major names such as XRP and Solana (SOL). While XRP and SOL provide stability and established infrastructure, MUTM represents early-stage potential with exponential growth opportunities. Let’s examine why analysts group them together and what truly sets MUTM apart. XRP and SOL: Strength in Market Presence Ripple (XRP) continues to attract attention due to its role in cross-border payments and growing institutional adoption. It trades around $2.81, has high liquidity, and regained momentum after recent regulatory clarity and product filings. Solana, priced at about $207, supports a strong DeFi and NFT ecosystem. Despite regulatory scrutiny, its hybrid consensus model and fast transaction speed keep it competitive with top protocols. Both tokens anchor portfolios, one with a payments utility (XRP), the other with app-building infrastructure (SOL). Their presence on analyst watchlists reflects proven value and upward potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) By contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) remains in its presale phase at under $0.04, having already secured more than $15.4 million and attracted over 16,100 holders. This early traction has positioned MUTM as one of the strongest new entrants in the market, with analysts pointing to its potential for 40x growth—a return that makes it a standout in the “cheap crypto” category. At the core of its design is a lending framework built around dedicated liquidity pools for each supported asset. This model provides lenders with predictable returns by linking yields directly to pool utilization rates, while ensuring borrowers gain access to loans that remain consistently overcollateralized. The approach not only maintains stability for participants but also makes liquidity more dependable across the platform. Mutuum Finance’s Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model enhances efficiency by eliminating the need for direct counterparties in lending transactions. Instead, users interact with smart contracts that automatically enforce terms, set interest rates according to pool activity, and preserve fairness in every deal. To enhance user flexibility, Mutuum Finance offers both variable rates, which adjust with liquidity conditions, and stable rates, which give borrowers predictable repayment costs. By design, the dual-rate structure accommodates traders pursuing quick opportunities and borrowers focused on predictable costs. The result is a lending market that blends transparency with flexibility, backed by an infrastructure that scales with user adoption. It’s this mix of strong presale momentum, robust architecture, and clear yield mechanics that explains why many investors now rank Mutuum alongside much larger names in the DeFi sector. Core Features When users supply assets, they receive mtTokens (e.g., mtBNB or mtBTC) on a one-to-one basis. These tokens steadily increase in redemption value as yield accrues. For instance, depositing 4 ETH issues 4 mtETH today, tokens that will be worth more ETH over time. Transferable and yield-bearing, mtTokens offer a simple and transparent way to earn passive income, making them one of the most compelling low-barrier yield opportunities among emerging cryptocurrencies. Mutuum Finance boosts rewards through a buy-and-redistribute mechanism: platform revenues fund MUTM buybacks on the open market, and the repurchased tokens are distributed to users staking mtTokens in the safety module. That creates consistent demand, benefits active users, and aligns incentives across the ecosystem. Stablecoin Launch Looking ahead, Mutuum Finance plans to issue an overcollateralized on-chain stablecoin pegged to the U.S. Dollar, extending the protocol’s utility beyond lending and borrowing. Each unit of this stablecoin will be created only when users deposit collateral worth more than the minted value, ensuring that the token remains fully backed and stable even during market volatility. When loans are repaid or liquidations occur, the stablecoin is burned, dynamically adjusting supply and reinforcing its peg to the dollar. By embedding it directly into the lending markets, Mutuum Finance strengthens usability while driving adoption, building trust, and sustaining demand across its ecosystem. MUTM vs. XRP & SOL The difference becomes clear when Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is compared with established players like XRP and Solana (SOL). At roughly $2.81, XRP leverages its payments use case and institutional support to provide investors with consistent, if moderate, gains. Solana, trading near $207, continues to thrive through its developer ecosystem, transaction speed, and scalability, making it a solid play for infrastructure-driven growth. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance, still under $0.04 in presale, brings an entirely different value proposition with its yield-generating mtTokens, buy-and-redistribute tokenomics, and a planned overcollateralized stablecoin. Analysts suggest this early-stage setup could give MUTM the potential to deliver 20–40x returns, far outpacing the upside of its more established peers. Why MUTM Deserves a Spot on Watchlists Mutuum Finance is positioned to upgrade how DeFi lending, yield generation, and stablecoin issuance integrate. With the mtToken yield system and buy-and-redistribute mechanics, early adopters tap into passive rewards and structural demand for MUTM. For investors eager to back the next big crypto under $0.04, MUTM stands up next to established picks like XRP and SOL. And while risk is part of the equation, its feature set, presale traction, and clear incentive design make MUTM a timely choice in the hunt for outsized returns, before ADA hits $1, and certainly before many mainstream assets break higher.

In 2025, one of those projects is XYZVerse (XYZ)—a token that combines sports culture with crypto engagement. With a presale already attracting significant participation, XYZVerse is positioning itself as a sports-focused meme coin that emphasizes community building, staking, and gamified interaction. Understanding XYZVerse – The First All-Sports Meme Token Coin name: XYZVerse ($XYZ)Current Stage: Presale Funds Raised: $15M+Community: 21K+ followers on X, 12K+ members on TelegramContract Safety: Audited by Pessimistic Audit and SolidProof XYZVerse.io is designed around sports betting, gamified staking, and meme coin culture. Its positioning as the “first all-sports meme coin” aims to connect with fans who follow both digital assets and athletic competition. One of the early partnerships is with bookmaker.XYZ, a decentralized sportsbook and casino. This collaboration gives token holders access to sports-related features and benefits within the bookmaker’s ecosystem. Looking forward, the team has outlined plans for Telegram-based mini games, airdrop events, and decentralized applications (dApps) focused on staking and community rewards. Presale Structure and Growth XYZVerse launched its presale using a tiered model where the token price increased step by step. Early on, the token rose from an initial $0.0001 to $0.0054 by the time of the latest stage. Instead of fixed stages, the token price adjusts incrementally with every $100,000 raised. This dynamic approach is intended to keep the process continuous and transparent, with the goal of reaching a cap of $30 million. To support visibility, the team set up a dedicated Telegram channel where participants can track presale contributions in real time. So far, the presale has raised over $15 million, showing sustained engagement from its community. Security and Reliability Measures Though XYZVerse is still pre-launch, several steps have been taken to address transparency and security. Independent Audit : The project’s smart contract has been audited by Pessimistic, a blockchain security firm. The results, published publicly, reported no critical or high-risk vulnerabilities. A secondary review by SolidProof has also been completed. Deflationary Mechanism: XYZVerse incorporates token burns through buybacks to gradually reduce supply, aiming to manage inflationary pressure. Fixed Supply: With a total of 100 billion tokens, the design emphasizes scarcity from the outset. What’s Ahead for XYZVerse? The roadmap outlined by the team includes: Staking and rewards-based dApps for token holders Telegram-based play-to-earn mini games Collaborations with influencers and athletes to expand reach Marketing and sponsorship campaigns to connect with sports communities Ongoing token burns and liquidity initiatives If delivered, these features may help XYZVerse establish itself as a project that sits at the intersection of meme coin culture and sports entertainment. Conclusion XYZVerse is still at an early stage, with its presale ongoing and core features yet to launch. However, the combination of a growing community, independent audits, and a clear tokenomics framework has already drawn attention. As with all emerging crypto projects, outcomes will depend on execution, adoption, and broader market conditions. For now, XYZVerse represents one of the more visible attempts to merge sports fandom with the meme coin space, making it a project worth monitoring as 2025 progresses.

In a post on X, Chad stated, “DNA stored on the XRP Ledger. You will be recorded for all of human history.” He linked to the DNA Protocol, a project that aims to merge biological data with distributed ledger technology , presenting a concept that moves beyond traditional financial applications of blockchain. However, XRP Army remains skeptical about its genuineness. In the comments, some experts warned the community members to be watchful, saying the project seems too good to be true. DNA stored on the XRP Ledger. You will be recorded for all of human history. https://t.co/rhhLQWueAh pic.twitter.com/ssZRlcHoyw — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) September 6, 2025 The DNA Protocol and Its Process The DNA Protocol describes itself as a system for anchoring genomic information onto the XRP Ledger. The project describes its process as one that takes DNA sequences and transforms them into cryptographic hashes. These hashes are then distributed across a Byzantine Fault Tolerant validator network, which secures the data. To establish identity, the system relies on additional layers that reference both epigenomic records and contingency genome ledgers, creating a framework for verifiable yet privacy-preserving proofs. This framework suggests that DNA sequences can be represented in a secure, verifiable format without exposing the raw genetic data. Using cryptographic methods, the protocol focuses on proof and verification rather than storing sensitive biological information directly. By situating this process on the XRP Ledger, the project aligns with a blockchain known for its speed and scalability . It proposes that distributed consensus mechanisms can handle transactions and sensitive data anchoring in a way that is immutable and auditable. Tokenization and Broader Implications Steingraber’s comments frame this development in a historical context, emphasizing the permanence of recording DNA on a blockchain ledger. His statement highlights the significance of tokenization in this process. Tokenization, in this context, transforms complex genetic sequences into cryptographic representations that can be validated and exchanged across networks without exposing underlying information. The implications extend into areas such as identity management, medical data security, and personalized healthcare. While the technical architecture remains complex, the foundation rests on the principle that information as fundamental as DNA can be secured, proven, and transmitted through blockchain protocols. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Steingraber sees the DNA Protocol as a step toward permanent, verifiable records that may redefine how humanity treats genetic information. The XRP Ledger has become a major hub for tokenization projects . Whether it is needed for identity, research, or medical use, tokenizing DNA represents a frontier in applying blockchain beyond finance and into the core of human data.
