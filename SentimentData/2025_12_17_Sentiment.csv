While Bitcoin dominates liquidity and investor attention, altcoins are struggling to attract sustained demand, and XRP is increasingly reflecting this imbalance. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin’s Quiet Price Action May Be ‘Dangerous’ – IFP Signals Rising Structural Risk According to a CryptoQuant report by Darkfost, the weakness in XRP is not an isolated event but part of a broader contraction across the altcoin market. Whether on spot markets or in derivatives, trading activity has been shrinking significantly over recent months. Liquidity is gradually drying up, signaling a clear retreat from speculative positioning as investors reduce exposure to higher-risk assets. This trend is especially visible in XRP’s derivatives data. The Taker Buy Volume on Binance, which tracks aggressive buy orders in futures markets, has collapsed to its lowest levels of the year. After peaking above $5.8 billion in July, this metric has fallen to roughly $250 million, representing a sharp 95.7% decline. Such a dramatic contraction highlights the near-total evaporation of buying pressure and underscores the lack of conviction among traders. XRP Liquidity Compression Signals Downside Risk According to Darkfost, the broader market context is a major factor amplifying XRP’s current weakness. Liquidations have been accumulating across crypto markets, confidence remains fragile, and many participants are still psychologically impacted by the October 10 event. This lingering stress has reduced risk tolerance, particularly among short-term traders who typically provide liquidity during corrective phases. Beyond sentiment, altcoins are facing a clear structural headwind. Bitcoin continues to absorb the majority of available capital, both in spot and derivatives markets. As BTC dominance remains elevated, liquidity that would normally rotate into altcoins during recoveries is instead staying concentrated in Bitcoin. This leaves very limited room for a sustained rebound across the broader altcoin market, including XRP. Related Reading: Market Stress Continues As Bitcoin STH SOPR Dips Below 1– When Will The Pain End? Within this environment, the sharp collapse in XRP’s Taker Buy Volume is not surprising. The signal becomes even more relevant given that it is unfolding on Binance, which still accounts for the largest share of global XRP trading activity. A sustained drop in aggressive buying on the dominant exchange highlights the depth of demand erosion. At the same time, the Taker Buy Sell Ratio has remained negative for most of the period, confirming that sellers continue to dominate XRP’s derivatives market. Historically, such severe volume compression can precede volatility expansions. However, in the current setup, the lack of meaningful buying pressure and persistent bearish positioning suggests downside risks remain elevated. Even ETF-related optimism has failed to offset these structural weaknesses. XRP Price Struggles Below Key Moving Averages XRP price action on the 3-day chart reflects a clear loss of bullish structure and growing downside pressure. After peaking above the $3.40–$3.60 zone earlier in the year, XRP has formed a sequence of lower highs and lower lows, confirming a medium-term downtrend. The recent breakdown below the psychological $2.00 level is particularly significant, as this zone previously acted as both support and consolidation. From a technical perspective, XRP is now trading below its 50-day and 100-day moving averages, both of which have started to slope downward. This alignment reinforces bearish momentum and suggests that rallies are being sold rather than accumulated. The 200-day moving average, currently near the $1.70–$1.80 area, represents the next major structural support. A sustained move toward this level would not be surprising if selling pressure persists. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Refuse to Sell: Historic Signal Emerges As Binance CDD Drops To 2017 Levels Volume dynamics further confirm weakness. Since the August high, volume has steadily declined, indicating fading participation and weak dip-buying interest. The sharp volatility spike in October was followed by distribution rather than continuation, often a sign of a local market top. As long as XRP remains below $2.00 and fails to reclaim the declining moving averages, the path of least resistance remains to the downside. For any meaningful trend reversal, XRP would need to regain $2.30–$2.50 with expanding volume, signaling renewed demand rather than short-term relief rallies.

GeeFi has made a significant market entrance, concluding a successful Phase 1 that sold 10 million tokens , generated $500,000 in funding, and attracted over 2,400 investors . The momentum has continued, with total sales climbing past 14 million tokens and capital raised now over $850K . With less than 1 million tokens left in Phase 2, this self-custody ecosystem is seeing intense demand. Analysts suggest Phase 3 is days away, with strong speculation about major exchange listings fueling the excitement. Where Is Real-World Utility? Cardano is currently navigating a difficult market, with its price falling to $0.38 , a 60% decline this year, even as it launches its Midnight (NIGHT) token and advances its decentralized governance. While established blockchains face performance challenges, forward-thinking individuals are exploring GeeFi , a project many experts are calling 2026’s 100x gem . GeeFi directly tackles DeFi’s fragmentation by offering a single, streamlined dashboard. This enables users to manage their portfolios across 14+ networks , allowing for simple token swaps and bridging without technical complexity. The GeeFi Team took a product-first approach, starting development in 2023 and launching a working platform in 2024 before raising public funds. This commitment to delivering a finished product sets it apart from projects built on promises alone. Based on a self-custody model, the platform guarantees that users always maintain complete control over their funds. With an Android app already available and an iOS version on the way, GeeFi is demonstrating tangible progress, confirming why it’s considered 2026’s 100x gem . Unlocking Massive ROI Potential The GeeFi presale is in its final Phase 2 stage, with tokens offered at $0.06 . This price provides early participants with a built-in 667% gain when the token launches at its confirmed $0.40 listing price . The wealth-building possibilities are substantial. An initial investment of $1,800 could transform into $90,000 if GeeFi hits the analyst target of a $3 valuation , representing a 4,900% ROI . The market’s response has been overwhelming. Phase 2 has fewer than 1 million tokens available after raising more than $850K and selling 14 million tokens total. Industry analysts praise the presale structure and expect Phase 3 to launch within days and sell out quickly, fueled by exchange listing rumors. This powerful demand reinforces the view that GeeFi is 2026’s 100x gem . Build Passive Income with Staking GeeFi offers a rewarding staking program designed to benefit its supporters. Participants can lock their tokens to receive 15% APR for one month , 22% APR for three months , or an impressive 55% APR for twelve months . For those who value liquidity, a flexible staking option offers up to 10% APR with no lock-up period . Furthermore, a referral system provides a 5% bonus in GEE tokens for every purchase made through a user’s unique link, expanding the community while boosting holdings. Your Final Chance Before the Next Phase The opportunity to invest in a project with a live application and clear use case at this price point is exceedingly rare. The GeeFi presale is a limited-time event to acquire tokens at a valuation that is unlikely to last. With a deflationary token model, a working mobile app, and a crypto debit card in development, GeeFi is built for mainstream success. The speed of the token sale shows that smart money is moving in fast. Don’t miss your chance to be part of 2026’s 100x gem .

That imbalance creates a clear scenario. If SOL pushes up to $147 this week, short sellers could face up to $1 billion in liquidations, forcing them to buy back positions and accelerate the move higher. But that volatility goes both ways. While long-side exposure is smaller, a drop below $120 could still trigger a $500 million long squeeze and spark a sharp liquidation cascade.

The RSI continues to print higher lows as it trends toward the 50 neutral line, signalling growing buy pressure beneath the surface. At the same time, the MACD is holding just above a potential death cross with the signal line, a sign that current levels are pivotal for the prevailing trend. The $120 level also marks the lower boundary of a year-long descending triangle pattern, with the $210 target of the triple bottom setting up a breakout attempt.

In a major move to tackle fragmentation, Mysten Labs, the core developer behind the Sui blockchain, has just announced the formation of a powerful Blockchain Payment Consortium . This alliance isn’t going solo; it brings together heavyweights like Solana, Polygon, Stellar, TON, and Fireblocks. Their mission? To finally build a common rulebook for the booming world of on-chain payments and stablecoins. Why is a Blockchain Payment Consortium Needed Now? The explosive growth of stablecoins has been a double-edged sword. While adoption soars, the lack of universal standards creates confusion, risks, and friction. Imagine every country had its own unique traffic lights and road signs—that’s the current state of cross-chain payments. This new Blockchain Payment Consortium aims to be the global governing body that installs standard signs and signals everyone agrees to follow. Therefore, the primary goals are clear and critical: Define On-Chain Transactions: Create a clear, shared definition of what constitutes a valid payment transaction across different blockchains. Develop Privacy-Centric Standards: Build frameworks that protect user data while still providing necessary transparency for regulators and authorities. Enable Seamless Interoperability: Make it easier for payments to flow between different blockchain networks without technical hiccups or security gaps. Who’s Powering This Payment Alliance? The strength of this initiative lies in its founding members. This isn’t a project led by one chain; it’s a collaborative effort from leaders across the ecosystem. The consortium includes Layer 1 giants known for speed and scale, like Solana and Polygon, alongside payment-focused networks like Stellar and TON. Crucially, enterprise platform Fireblocks adds deep institutional security expertise. This diverse membership signals a profound understanding: for on-chain payments to reach the next billion users, the industry must present a united front. The formation of this Blockchain Payment Consortium shows that competitors can become collaborators when the goal is mass adoption. What Challenges Will the Consortium Face? Building consensus in a decentralized world is notoriously difficult. The path forward for this Blockchain Payment Consortium will have hurdles. Aligning the technical architectures and economic models of chains as different as Sui, Solana, and Stellar is a monumental engineering and diplomatic task. Furthermore, balancing robust privacy with regulatory compliance remains a tightrope walk. However, the potential payoff is transformative. Unified standards could slash development time for payment apps, reduce errors, and build trust with traditional financial institutions and regulators. It turns the chaotic wild west of crypto payments into a well-regulated, efficient global highway. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Payments? Think of this consortium as laying the foundational plumbing for the future financial internet. Successful standards from this Blockchain Payment Consortium could lead to: Cheaper and Faster Global Transfers: Frictionless cross-border payments for businesses and individuals. Mainstream Merchant Adoption: A clear, safe framework for shops to accept crypto payments without technical fear. Innovation Boom: Developers can build new payment products without worrying about incompatible blockchain rules. The formation of this group is a confident step toward maturity. It moves the conversation from isolated technological triumphs to practical, user-centric solutions. The Blockchain Payment Consortium isn’t just building code; it’s building trust. Conclusion: A Unified Front for a Fragmented World The announcement by Mysten Labs and its partners is a watershed moment. The Blockchain Payment Consortium represents a collective acknowledgment that for crypto to truly revolutionize finance, the industry must standardize the basics. By bringing together rival networks to cooperate on payments, they are prioritizing ecosystem growth over individual chain supremacy. This collaborative spirit, if sustained, may well be remembered as the turning point where crypto payments graduated from a niche novelty to a legitimate global infrastructure. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main goal of the Blockchain Payment Consortium? A1: The primary goal is to establish a common framework and industry-wide standards for on-chain payments. This aims to reduce fragmentation, protect user privacy, ensure regulatory compliance, and make cross-blockchain transactions seamless. Q2: Which companies and blockchains are part of the consortium? A2: The founding members include Mysten Labs (Sui), Solana, Polygon, Stellar, The Open Network (TON), and the digital asset platform Fireblocks. Q3: How will this consortium benefit the average crypto user? A3> Users can expect more reliable, secure, and straightforward payment experiences across different apps and blockchains. It could lead to lower fees, faster transaction times, and greater merchant acceptance of crypto payments. Q4: Does this mean all these blockchains are merging? A4: No, not at all. Each blockchain remains independent. The consortium is focused on creating interoperable standards—like a common language—that allow them to work together smoothly for payment purposes, not on merging their technologies. Q5: What role do stablecoins play in this initiative? A5: Stablecoins are the primary driver. Their massive growth has highlighted the urgent need for standardized payment rails. The consortium’s frameworks will likely be designed heavily around the secure and efficient transfer of stablecoin assets. Q6: When can we expect to see tangible results from this consortium? A6: The group has just been formed. While no specific timeline is given, the work involves complex technical and regulatory alignment. The first whitepapers or proposed standards could emerge within the next 6-12 months, with implementation taking longer. Found this insight into the new Blockchain Payment Consortium valuable? This move could redefine how we use digital money.

But BitGur’s analysis could be the pivot point for a green December and uphold the historic trend of at least one green month through Q4. Dogecoin Price Prediction: December May Only Be the Start The $0.13 demand zone also coincides with the lower boundary of a year-long decedign triangle pattern, and the triple bottom reversal could put it on the breakout path. If the triple bottom can be confirmed with a clean break above its neckline at $0.155, its $0.182 target may stand as a higher and firmer footing for a breakout push.

The RSI continues to form higher lows in a clear trend towards the neutral line, a sign of buy pressure building beneath the surface The MACD death cross below the signal line stands to be short-lived as sellers appear to be losing control of the prevailing trend. A clean triangle breakout sets up a measured move of roughly 260% to past highs around $0.50 , and a fully realised target of $1 for a potoentail 680% gain . Though such a move likely hinges on supportive market conditions, such a U.S. Fed policy shift ot quantatitative easing (QE) in 2026 to stimulate risk appetite. But for an end-of-year rally, BitGur’s analysis remains the setup to watch – though the outcome hinges on the $0.13 level being held. PepeNode: A Way to Avoid the Pitfalls of Meme Coin Investors Those entering the market now face a decision: sit out and miss out on the next leg up, or enter and risk exposure to potential heavy losses if a bull market doesn’t play out. PepeNode ($PEPENODE) removes much of that pressure by offering a way to accumulate without timing the perfect entry — the pitfall of most meme coin investors. It’s a simple mine-to-earn (M2E) game. No hardware needed. Just log in, acquire virtual nodes, stack rigs, and configure their setup to begin generating passive rewards diversified across leading meme coins. Momentum is climbing fast. The presale has already passed $2.35 million, while early stakers can still earn up to 554% APY. And thanks to a built-in deflationary model, where 70% of all $PEPENODE spent on nodes and rigs is burned, scarcity supports long-term token value. PepeNode offers a more measured way to capture high-upside market exposure — without relying on perfect entries. With just 22 days remaining in the presale, a later entry could come at a higher cost.

Saylor Says Network Upgrades Will Strengthen Bitcoin In a December 16 X post , Saylor explained the Bitcoin network would upgrade following a quantum breakthrough, with active coins migrating while lost coins remain frozen. The Bitcoin Quantum Leap: Quantum computing won’t break Bitcoin—it will harden it. The network upgrades, active coins migrate, lost coins stay frozen. Security goes up. Supply comes down. Bitcoin grows stronger. — Michael Saylor (@saylor) December 16, 2025 He concluded, “Security goes up. Supply comes down. Bitcoin grows stronger.” This statement counters numerous fearmongering predictions claiming Bitcoin encryption faces quantum hacking risks that could trigger network collapse. However, when Cryptonews interviewed David Carvalho, CEO and chief scientist of Naoris’ post-quantum protocol, about quantum threats to traditional cryptography, the former ethical hacker predicted that 30% of all circulating BTC could face theft risk when “ Q-Day ” arrives. Nevertheless, he stressed that “ the timeline for such breakthroughs remains uncertain, and exchanges are unlikely to allow compromised coins to circulate freely.” Bitcoin Price Prediction: Monthly Chart Mirrors 2022 Bottoming Pattern Bitcoin’s monthly chart shows price consolidating below the critical $108,000–$110,000 resistance zone, which has capped upside and must be reclaimed to confirm continuation of the 2026 upward leg. This level sits above recent cycle highs and aligns with historical areas where previous bull markets paused before accelerating. Structurally, the chart highlights strong similarities to the 2022 bottoming phase. Source: TradingView After a deep drawdown marked by consecutive red monthly candles, Bitcoin formed a base and delivered a near-2x rally from lows, followed by consolidation before the next expansion. The current market appears to be repeating that sequence since October, with price holding well above long-term support and forming higher monthly closes despite recent volatility. The RSI remains above the neutral 50 level, suggesting the long-term trend stays bullish. Provided Bitcoin maintains above the mid-$80,000 region , the probability favors this consolidation resolving upward. A decisive monthly close above $108,000 would likely open pathways to a renewed 2026 bull run rally toward the $140,000–$150,000 region. Pepenode Raises $2.3M To Position for 2026 Meme Coin Season If Bitcoin finally breaks the $108,000 resistance and begins the 2026 bull run, meme coins like Pepenode (PEPENODE) would see increased demand. Pepenode is a new crypto project that’s already raised over $2.3 million despite the crypto market losing over $1.2 trillion of its value this Q4. It’s a game where you can mine coins without needing expensive hardware setups. You play the game in your web browser, set up virtual mining rigs, and upgrade your facilities to earn PEPENODE tokens . The project is copying PEPE’s success strategy, which contributed to its 1,000x rally during the 2023-24 run when Bitcoin broke out from bear market lows. Now that more people are buying Pepenode’s mining rigs, the presale price is going up very fast. To join the presale before the ongoing round sells out: Go to the official Pepenode website . Connect a crypto wallet like Best Wallet , and buy PEPENODE tokens for $0.0011968. Then pay with crypto using ETH or USDT, or use a bank card in just a few clicks.

XRP has still been pulling in institutional investment as well as regulated investment products, yet the market price is being held in a range around significant support areas. At the same time, those involved in crypto investing who are looking for what crypto to buy are increasingly looking at opportunities in the early stages of DeFi that are priced below $0.05. One such top crypto that is getting this type of rotation is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is a new crypto that is priced below $0.05. XRP Price Compression Despite Broadening Access XRP is trading around $2.02, just above the support level of $2.00. The inflows of capital into its market have continued to accumulate, with $16.42 million of net inflows registered, as it marked the 19th day of positive rotation. Despite this regular pattern of rotation, the movement of XRP remains stagnant. While the launch of the 21Shares spot XRP ETF with a TOXR ticker symbol broadens the regulated framework, it still does not prompt an immediate repricing of assets. More infrastructure development is also expanding, as Ripple Labs received conditional support for trust bank operations, paving the way for other services such as custody for RLUSD cash management. This situation prompts some players to look for top crypto to buy today that provide better short-term gain. Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the solutions that is gaining traction as traders shift attention from large-cap indexing to fill a need for a cheap crypto with good mechanics of taking the upside. The current presale amount is $19,500,000, while Total MUTM Holders since presale began is 18,500. Currently, Phase 6 is 98% filled, leaving a small window of opportunity for acquisition at the current price of $0.035. This is despite it being 250%, or 3.5 times, higher since Phase 1 at $0.01. Phase 6 is selling out quickly, but once slots are allocated, Phase 7 opens at $0.04—a steep 20% change. When launching the MUTM token, the initial selling price will be triggered at $0.06, which translates to a potential gain of 410% for the initial investors. Despite the limited slots left for $0.035, urgency is setting in for traders trying to decide the best crypto to buy this month of December. Mutuum Finance Leaderboard Mutuum Finance has also been promoting engagement through a live dashboard that displays the top 50 holders in real-time. A 24-hour leaderboard that is rotated daily has also brought a bit of healthy competition to presales for participation. The number one ranked participant for each day is given a $500 bonus for MUTM, as long as there is a transaction made within that 24 hour period. This is achieved by a reset of the leaderboard each day at 00:00 UTC. This is a step that takes Mutuum Finance closer to more traders looking for the current best crypto to buy. Stablecoin Vision Mutuum Finance is also defining a more long-term utility chain that focuses on developing a decentralized stablecoin that is backed by over-collaterized assets. These assets are then aimed at integrating directly with the lending and borrowing system of the Mutuum Finance protocol. Security preparation is still active, with an independent audit currently being carried out by Halborn Security to examine the final lending/borrowing terms. These developments continue to position Mutuum Finance correctly as a new type of cryptocurrency with emphasis on delivery and growth rather than timing. While XRP investors remain ready for a matching price with adoption, funds have been transitioning to more reasonably priced investments with better catalysts. Mutuum Finance has been among the key players that investors appear to be searching for in regard to which crypto investment to make as phase 6 draws closer to completion. Investors seeking the best crypto investment before the end of the year have been reacting to the shorter timeframe.

Central to this discussion are comments made by Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, who outlined a vision in which Ripple’s technology could complement established systems such as SWIFT . While these statements were made years ago, they continue to shape how some analysts evaluate XRP’s possible role in global finance and its implications for price. Ripple’s Original Position on Legacy Payment Networks In a 2015 interview with Global Finance Magazine, Larsen, then Ripple’s chief executive, described the company’s strategic approach to international payments. He emphasized that Ripple was not designed to dismantle legacy financial rails like SWIFT or ACH. Instead, Ripple aimed to function as an interoperability layer capable of connecting different financial networks while enabling faster settlement. Larsen contrasted this approach with earlier blockchain models, particularly Bitcoin. While acknowledging Bitcoin’s innovation in enabling peer-to-peer transfers without centralized intermediaries, he argued that its structure posed challenges for institutional use. According to Larsen, Bitcoin either requires universal adoption as a single currency or forced constant conversion between digital assets and national currencies, exposing users to foreign exchange risk. In his view, these limitations made Bitcoin less practical for large financial institutions operating across multiple currencies. Ripple’s solution, as Larsen explained, focused on providing a neutral settlement layer that could facilitate real-time value transfer between existing systems. Under this model, Ripple’s technology, and by extension XRP, could operate alongside SWIFT’s messaging framework rather than replacing it. Revisiting the XRP–SWIFT Discussion More than a decade later, members of the XRP community have revisited Larsen’s comments as debates around blockchain integration within traditional finance intensify. Market analyst Chart Nerd recently highlighted the potential scale of such cooperation by referencing SWIFT’s operational footprint. According to publicly available data cited by the analyst, SWIFT supports approximately 40,000 payment corridors and facilitates an estimated $150 trillion in cross-border transaction value annually. This scale has prompted renewed discussion about what role XRP could play if it were used as a liquidity bridge within or alongside SWIFT-connected payment flows. While there is no indication that such an integration is imminent, the hypothetical scenario has attracted attention due to its potential impact on demand for XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Hypothetical Price Estimates and Underlying Assumptions To explore this possibility, some commentators have turned to scenario-based projections. In one such exercise, Google’s Gemini AI model suggested that if XRP were adopted as a key liquidity asset within SWIFT-related settlement processes, its valuation dynamics would change significantly. Under that assumption, XRP would transition from being primarily speculative to serving a functional role within global financial infrastructure. Based on this premise, Gemini estimated a theoretical price range between $80 and $120 per XRP. The projection assumed that XRP would capture a meaningful share of the liquidity required to support a substantial portion of the $150 trillion in annual cross-border flows. It is important to note that this estimate is purely hypothetical and depends on multiple variables, including adoption levels, regulatory clarity, and liquidity distribution. Current Developments and Practical Constraints Despite ongoing speculation, recent developments suggest that SWIFT is pursuing its own blockchain-based initiatives without direct involvement from XRP. In late 2024, SWIFT announced plans to conduct live trials for digital asset and currency transactions, emphasizing interoperability across tokenized assets, stablecoins, and central bank digital currencies. These efforts expanded further in 2025 with the introduction of a shared digital ledger developed in collaboration with major banks and blockchain firms. As a result, while the concept of XRP operating alongside SWIFT remains a topic of discussion, there is currently no confirmation that such cooperation will materialize. Any price projections tied to this scenario should therefore be viewed as exploratory rather than predictive, reflecting potential outcomes rather than established trajectories.

The activity surge comes as on-chain and options metrics suggest investors are repositioning for a more active market environment. The exchange is on track to set new records across spot and derivatives markets in 2025, even as traders continue to price uncertainty in the crypto market. Binance leads, others follow Source: CryptoQuant Crypto inflows into Binance hit $1.17 trillion in 2025, representing a 31% increase year on year. The inflow, which widens the gulf between Binance and other exchanges, coincided with the platform surpassing 300 million registered users. Coinbase comes second after Binance with respect to crypto inflows, seeing $946 billion in 2025, which is a 30% increase from the previous year. Source: CryptoQuant Binance spot trading volume is projected to reach about $7 trillion by year-end, nearly five times that of its closest competitor, Bybit. According to CryptoQuant, “the total number of spot trades reached a new all-time high of 24.1 billion in 2025, up 4% year over year and more than 3x higher than in 2022.” Binance also posted a record high this year in the total number of perpetual futures trades, which reached 49.6 billion, 33% above last year’s record high of 37.3 billion trades. The platform’s perpetual futures volume has already exceeded $24.6 trillion, more than double the volume of OKX. Source: CryptoQuant Julio, Head of Research at CryptoQuant, pointed out that this current boost in activity metrics indicates “sustained growth in user activity throughout the current bull cycle.” By June 2025, Binance had captured 41.1% of global spot volume, maintaining a market share of 39.8% among centralized exchanges the following month. Market uncertainty drives hedging activity The renewed focus on liquidity comes as volatility shows signs of returning after a stable six-month period. Glasnode analysis indicates that during a sharp drawdown in the market several weeks ago, risk hedging activity increased substantially, with elevated put demand as Bitcoin prices moved into the low-$80,000 range. Source: Glassnode on X While market conditions have stabilized, and expectations for extreme moves have moderated, “implied volatility remains elevated relative to the exceptionally low-volatility regime observed over the prior six months, suggesting a shift toward a more active volatility environment,” according to Glassnode. Large centralized exchanges tend to benefit when volatility rises, as hedging, arbitrage, and high-frequency strategies all rely on deep and continuous liquidity. Binance’s scale across spot and perpetual futures markets places it at the center of that activity. The concentration of liquidity on Binance highlights a structural feature of crypto markets, which is that liquidity tends to pool where liquidity already exists. Other exchanges continue to play important roles in specific regions or product niches, and institutional activity on regulated venues remains influential for benchmark pricing.

Decentralized exchange leader PancakeSwap and venture studio YZi Labs, who are co-incubating the initiative, announced the project on social media today. A Frictionless Forecast Platform According to the announcement posts, Probable is looking to distinguish itself in the prediction market space with a commitment to simplicity and cost structure, and will operate with zero prediction fees from its first day. “Probable delivers true zero-fee predictions,” the team wrote in a Medium post. “No platform fees, no hidden charges.” It plans to support wagers on cryptocurrency price movements, global events, sports, and niche regional occurrences, settling all markets fully on-chain for transparency. To operate , users can deposit various assets, which the system will automatically convert to USDT for placing forecasts. “We believe prediction markets should be simple, transparent, and open to everyone,” stated the team on X. “Probable is built to make on-chain predictions faster, easier, and more accessible.” The new platform will depend on UMA’s Optimistic Oracle for verifying real-world event outcomes, a system designed to provide tamper-resistant results. PancakeSwap’s involvement provides immediate visibility and credibility, connecting the new service to its large user base. BNB Chain founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao acknowledged the launch, as he commented on the growing number of prediction markets on the network. The Growing Race to Predict the Future Probable is the latest entrant in a sector that is attracting substantial attention and capital. The space has seen notable developments in recent months, pointing to increased mainstream and institutional interest. Earlier in the year, Kalshi, one of the more well-known platforms, secured $185 million in funding led by Paradigm, which pushed its valuation to $2 billion. More recently, the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which owns the New York Stock Exchange, announced an investment of up to $2 billion in the decentralized platform Polymarket, alongside serving as the global distributor of its event-driven data. Additionally, in late October, Trump Media’s Truth Social and Crypto.com revealed plans to bring prediction markets to a social media audience, demonstrating the widening appeal of the concept. At the time, Crypto.com co-founder and CEO Kris Marszalek forecasted that prediction markets had the potential to become “a multi-deca-billion dollar industry.” The post PancakeSwap, YZi Labs Launch Zero-Fee Prediction Market on BNB Chain appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|BNB Chain|PancakeSwap,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-12-16 23:45:30

This breakdown could point to a bearish XRP price prediction , suggesting bulls may be on the verge of capitulation. Adding to the sell-off, long liquidations surged to $584 million , showing just how many traders were blindsided by the latest dip. The market had been finding support at this key psychological price level for days, but buying interest was weak and failed to ignite a rally despite efforts by bulls to defend this zone. Trading volumes have doubled in the past day as well, currently standing at $3.9 billion. This implies strong selling pressure following this bearish breakout. Despite the drop, XRP-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have attracted positive net inflows for 21 consecutive days now, reflecting strong interest from institutional buyers and long-term holders in the regulated markets. XRP Price Prediction: Break Below $1.86 Could Result in Another 10% Drop Heading to the charts, the 4-hour time frame shows that a break below the $2 level with strong volumes occurred yesterday. This quickly triggered a stronger drop toward the next area of support at $1.86. Source: TradingView Bulls are now trying to defend this mark as a move below could result in a drop to the token’s October 10 lows of $1.58. This translates into a downside risk of 10% in the near term. Notably, however, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has hit extreme oversold levels at 21.5 in this lower time frame. The last two times this has happened, the price recovered slightly. However, a break below $1.86 would mean that the market is ready to resume its downtrend.

This strategic acquisition, reported by The Block, is far more than a simple business transaction. It represents a calculated expansion of Anchorage’s core services, directly targeting the complex needs of institutional clients navigating the digital asset space. The financial details remain confidential, but the strategic intent is crystal clear: to build an unrivaled, full-service platform for managing digital wealth. Why Did Anchorage Digital Acquire Hedgey? The acquisition of Hedgey is a direct response to a critical pain point in the crypto industry: managing token vesting schedules and distributions at scale. For startups, DAOs, and investment firms, administering these programs manually is error-prone and inefficient. By integrating Hedgey’s specialized technology, Anchorage Digital can now offer a seamless, automated solution. This move perfectly complements their recent purchase of Securitize For Advisors, painting a picture of a company aggressively assembling a comprehensive asset management toolkit. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Banking Landscape? This acquisition fundamentally strengthens Anchorage Digital’s position. It transforms the firm from a premier digital asset custodian into a holistic service provider. Clients can now potentially manage the entire lifecycle of their digital assets in one place—from secure custody and trading to complex distribution and compliance. For the broader market, it underscores a significant trend: the race to provide “crypto infrastructure as a service” to institutions is intensifying. The deal highlights several key benefits: Streamlined Operations: Combines secure custody with automated token management. Enhanced Compliance: Built-in tools for managing regulatory and tax reporting around vesting. Competitive Edge: Creates a unique, end-to-end offering that is difficult for competitors to match immediately. What Are the Challenges and Opportunities Ahead? However, successful integration is the next hurdle. Merging different company cultures and technology stacks smoothly is crucial. Furthermore, Anchorage Digital must clearly communicate this expanded value proposition to its existing and potential clients. The opportunity, though, is immense. By solving the tedious problem of token management, they remove a major barrier to entry for traditional institutions. This could accelerate the adoption of tokenized equity, real-world assets (RWAs), and more sophisticated DeFi strategies within a regulated framework. Conclusion: A Defining Move for Institutional Crypto The decision by Anchorage Digital to acquire Hedgey is a masterstroke in vertical integration. It’s not just about growing their business; it’s about shaping the very infrastructure that will support the next wave of institutional capital flowing into digital assets. By addressing a niche but critical operational challenge, they are building a moat around their services and setting a new standard for what a crypto bank can be. This move signals that the industry’s future winners will be those who provide the most robust, secure, and comprehensive platforms. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does Hedgey actually do? A: Hedgey provides smart contract-based software that automates the creation, management, and execution of token vesting schedules and distributions for companies and DAOs. Q: Why is this acquisition important for Anchorage Digital clients? A: Clients gain access to integrated, automated tools for managing token-based compensation, investor distributions, and other complex asset flows directly within Anchorage’s secure banking environment. Q: Were the financial terms of Anchorage Digital acquiring Hedgey disclosed? A: No, the specific financial details of the deal were not made public. Q: How does this relate to Anchorage’s purchase of Securitize For Advisors? A: Both acquisitions are part of a strategy to expand asset management services. Securitize focuses on digital securities, while Hedgey focuses on token utility and distribution, together creating a broader suite. Q: What is the main benefit for the crypto industry? A: It provides a more professional, regulated, and efficient framework for institutions to manage digital assets, potentially encouraging greater mainstream adoption.

This substantial movement follows Bitmain’s recent $321 million Ethereum purchase, creating significant speculation about the mining giant’s strategic intentions. What Does This Massive Bitmain ETH Withdrawal Mean? The transaction involved 48,049 ETH moving from FalconX to addresses 0x9a93 and 0x611f, which blockchain analytics platform Onchain Lens has linked to Bitmain (BMNR). This Bitmain ETH withdrawal represents one of the largest single movements of Ethereum by a corporate entity in recent months. The timing is particularly noteworthy, occurring just one week after Bitmain’s substantial acquisition of Ethereum. Several key aspects make this transaction significant: The sheer scale of the withdrawal – $141.78 million represents substantial market liquidity The timing relative to Bitmain’s recent $321 million ETH purchase The use of institutional exchange FalconX rather than retail platforms The potential implications for Ethereum’s price and market dynamics Why Is Bitmain Moving So Much Ethereum? Understanding the motivation behind this Bitmain ETH withdrawal requires examining Bitmain’s position in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As the world’s largest manufacturer of cryptocurrency mining hardware, Bitmain has traditionally focused on Bitcoin mining. However, their recent Ethereum activities suggest a strategic diversification. Several possibilities exist for this substantial movement: Cold storage transfer : Moving assets from exchange custody to more secure private wallets Strategic allocation : Repositioning assets for future staking or DeFi participation Corporate treasury management : Optimizing their cryptocurrency holdings portfolio Preparatory move : Setting up for future transactions or corporate actions How Does This Impact the Ethereum Market? The Bitmain ETH withdrawal from FalconX represents more than just a large transaction – it signals institutional behavior that can influence market sentiment. When major players like Bitmain make substantial moves, the market often interprets these actions as signals about future price direction or strategic importance. Market analysts are watching several potential impacts: Reduced exchange liquidity could increase price volatility Institutional confidence in Ethereum as a store of value Potential for reduced selling pressure if assets move to cold storage Increased attention to Ethereum from other institutional investors Moreover, this transaction demonstrates the growing sophistication of corporate cryptocurrency management. Companies like Bitmain are no longer simply holding assets – they’re actively managing them across different platforms and strategies. What Can We Learn From This Transaction? The Bitmain ETH withdrawal provides valuable insights into current cryptocurrency market dynamics. First, it highlights the continued institutional interest in Ethereum despite market fluctuations. Second, it demonstrates how major players utilize specialized platforms like FalconX for large transactions. Finally, it shows the importance of on-chain analytics in understanding market movements. For investors and market observers, several lessons emerge: Large transactions often precede significant market movements Institutional behavior provides clues about market sentiment Exchange flows offer valuable data about supply dynamics Corporate cryptocurrency strategies are becoming increasingly sophisticated The Bottom Line on Bitmain’s Ethereum Strategy This substantial Bitmain ETH withdrawal from FalconX represents more than just a large transaction – it’s a statement about institutional confidence in Ethereum’s future. While the exact motivation remains speculative, the movement of $141.78 million in Ethereum by one of cryptocurrency’s most influential companies cannot be ignored. The transaction reinforces several key trends in cryptocurrency markets: growing institutional participation, sophisticated asset management strategies, and the increasing importance of Ethereum in corporate treasuries. As the market continues to mature, movements like this Bitmain ETH withdrawal will become more common but no less significant for understanding market dynamics. Frequently Asked Questions What is Bitmain and why is their ETH withdrawal significant? Bitmain is the world’s largest manufacturer of cryptocurrency mining hardware. Their $141.8 million ETH withdrawal is significant because it represents substantial institutional movement that can influence market sentiment and liquidity. How was Bitmain identified as the owner of these addresses? Blockchain analytics platform Onchain Lens identified patterns linking addresses 0x9a93 and 0x611f to Bitmain based on transaction history, wallet behavior, and correlation with known Bitmain activities. Why would Bitmain withdraw ETH from an exchange? Common reasons include moving to more secure cold storage, preparing for staking or DeFi participation, corporate treasury management, or strategic portfolio reallocation. How does this affect Ethereum’s price? Large withdrawals can reduce exchange liquidity, potentially increasing price volatility. However, movement to cold storage often reduces immediate selling pressure, which could be supportive for prices. What is FalconX and why do institutions use it? FalconX is an institutional cryptocurrency exchange offering large-scale trading, custody solutions, and credit services tailored for corporate and institutional clients. Should retail investors follow Bitmain’s moves? While institutional moves provide valuable market signals, retail investors should consider multiple factors and conduct their own research rather than blindly following large transactions.

Related Reading: Crypto Market Structure Bill Stalled: Senate Banking Committee Pushes Markup To Early 2026 What many investors had hoped would be a closing act for regulatory clarity in 2025 instead became another extension of uncertainty, triggering risk-off behavior across digital assets and related investment products. The delay arrived at a fragile moment for markets grappling with growing sensitivity to policy signals from Washington. Bitcoin slid below the $86,000 level, while the broader digital asset market shed roughly $140 billion in capitalization within hours. The total market value has fallen to around $2.93 trillion, its lowest level in several weeks, as traders reassessed regulatory timelines that now extend into early 2026. Senate Pushes Crypto Market Structure Talks Into 2026 The Senate Banking Committee confirmed it will not hold a markup hearing on the crypto market structure bill before Congress adjourns for the holidays. While committee leadership says bipartisan negotiations are progressing, lawmakers acknowledged that time has run out to move the bill forward in 2025. Chairman Tim Scott’s office reiterated that discussions with Democratic counterparts are ongoing, with a markup now expected in early 2026. The proposed legislation is designed to clarify how digital assets are regulated in the U.S., including defining the respective roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Under current drafts, the CFTC would oversee spot crypto markets, while securities laws would be more clearly applied to token issuers and intermediaries. Parallel efforts in the Senate Agriculture Committee, which also oversees the CFTC, have yet to reach a markup stage, further slowing the process. Market Reaction Highlights Fragile Sentiment The legislative setback quickly translated into market pressure. Bitcoin fell from near $90,000 to the mid-$85,000 range, while Ethereum dropped below $3,000. Additionally, the average crypto RSI fell to around 32, indicating that the market is within oversold territory. Analysts pointed to elevated derivatives positioning and heavy open interest around key price levels as factors amplifying downside moves. Exchange-traded products reflected the shift, with Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs recording significant outflows as institutional investors reduced exposure. Some market observers noted that unrealized losses have risen sharply, while funding conditions and leverage remain stretched, making prices more vulnerable to negative catalysts such as policy delays. Regulatory Uncertainty Persists Despite Agency Actions Despite the legislative pause, regulators have continued to act within existing frameworks. The SEC has issued staff guidance and hosted public discussions on how current securities laws apply to crypto activities, while the CFTC has taken steps to expand supervised spot market participation. However, industry participants say these measures fall short of the comprehensive clarity the market structure bill is meant to deliver.

According to his latest assessment, XRP has completed a corrective phase within its broader Elliott Wave structure and could be entering a new impulsive move. Dark Defender’s analysis is rooted in Elliott Wave theory, which he applies to XRP’s long-term market structure. He argues that the token has finalized its fourth wave on the monthly timeframe, a phase typically marked by consolidation rather than trend reversal. With this stage now complete, his framework points to the emergence of Wave 5, which he associates with renewed upward momentum. People who say the bear market has started will switch and can't believe the market behaviour shortly after BTC.D lose strength, and the narrative will continue to shift in favour of #XRP . We have been literally following the Wave 4 since 13 February. We set $1.88, and XRP… https://t.co/SpQzMtQXn7 — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) December 15, 2025 Corrective Phase and Market Sentiment The analyst has tracked the development of Wave 4 since February 2025, outlining a clear internal structure throughout the correction. XRP first declined toward the $1.60 area in April, followed by a rebound to approximately $3.66 in July, before the final leg of the correction concluded near $1.88. During this period, Dark Defender repeatedly urged market participants to disregard fear-driven narratives. He cautioned that heightened uncertainty and negative sentiment often emerge during corrective phases, even when broader technical structures remain intact. In his view, such FUD tends to obscure underlying trend signals rather than reflect genuine structural weakness. He previously identified a critical support band between roughly $1.88 and $2.22, noting that sustained interaction with this range would be key to confirming the end of the corrective cycle. XRP’s recent stabilization near the lower boundary of this zone, followed by a modest rebound, is interpreted as confirmation that Wave 4 has concluded. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Outlook Moving Forward Despite ongoing volatility, Dark Defender maintains that the broader bullish structure remains valid. His assessment combines Elliott Wave principles with Fibonacci retracement levels, framing the recent pullback as a technically healthy correction rather than the onset of a bear market. While XRP continues to experience short-term price pressure, trading near $1.88 after daily, weekly, and monthly declines, the analyst argues that these movements do not invalidate the larger setup. Instead, he views them as typical of transition phases between corrective and impulsive waves. Based on this framework, Dark Defender projects that the next advance could carry XRP toward the $5.85 level , representing a gain of more than 200% from current prices. He emphasizes that this target is derived from historical wave behavior and structural analysis, not short-term speculation.

Related Reading: Ethereum Meets Wall Street: JPMorgan Rolls Out Tokenized Fund The report lays out 10 key investing themes for 2026 and ties the Bitcoin call to two main forces: growing portfolio demand for stores of value and what Grayscale describes as improving regulatory clarity. Spot-Bitcoin ETPs reached the market in 2024, the firm notes, and Congress passed the GENIUS Act in 2025, steps that the report says reduce barriers for big investors. Macro Risks And Demand For Crypto Grayscale frames its outlook around a simple macro point. Rising public debt and the risk that fiat currencies lose buying power are pushing some money toward Bitcoin and Ether, the report says. That argument will sound familiar to many institutional buyers. It is also a broad claim. No exact price targets were offered for Bitcoin, only a view that valuations will climb in 2026 and that the so-called four-year cycle may be ending. Stablecoins are another major theme. Grayscale expects stablecoin use to grow: cross-border payments, collateral on derivatives, even use on corporate balance sheets are all mentioned as likely developments. Asset Tokenization And DeFi Growth Reports have disclosed that Grayscale sees asset tokenization reaching an inflection point next year. Lending protocols and staking are singled out as areas where activity could expand. The firm foresees practical outcomes: stablecoins in payment rails, more institutional access to staking, and tokenized assets showing up in trading and custody systems. Grayscale also flags two narratives it does not expect to move markets in 2026 — quantum computing risk for crypto and digital asset treasuries — saying research will continue but valuations are unlikely to be affected this soon.

MetaX Integrated Circuits Shanghai Co. will commence trading in its home city after raising $585.8 million in an initial public offering that was 2,986 times oversubscribed on the retail portion. It attracted even higher demand than Moore Threads, whose shares were oversubscribed by 2,750 times in its IPO. MetaX’s listing follows an incredibly strong investor response, reflecting surging enthusiasm for domestic players in the global race for artificial intelligence computing power . AI Chip market heats up as MetaX targets Nvidia rivals MetaX manufactures graphics processing units for artificial intelligence developers similar to Moore Threads. The trend is a growing industry and expanding at a rapid clip as consumers and businesses adopt AI services. The stock is expected to attract investors who weren’t lucky enough to get an allotment in the notoriously tough IPO lottery. Moore Threads climbed more than 500% in eight trading sessions since its debut, with the stock rising five times in just its opening day of trading. Investors are betting on national champions who could seem like legitimate local rivals to global leader Nvidia Corp., whose most cutting-edge chips are blocked by the US from being sold to China. Worth 104.66 yuan per share at its IPO, MetaX will open at a market capitalization of 41.8 billion yuan ($6 billion), significantly below Moore Threads’ current valuation of 341 billion yuan. MetaX’s price-to-sales ratio stands at 56.4, compared with an average of 127.4 for peer companies like Cambricon Technologies Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., according to the company’s exchange filing. “If we use Moore and Cambricon’s market caps as a yardstick, then MetaX might have a 10-12 times upside potential,” said Xu Dawei, a fund manager at Jintong Private Fund Management in Beijing. “MetaX’s listing may potentially spearhead a rally in tech stocks and create more excitement around new and secondary listings.” Chinese tech listings draw investors amid record oversubscriptions MetaX’s roots can be found at AMD , with three of its founding members having previously worked for the US chipmaker. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Chen Weiliang is one of those. A Chinese company that designs and sells GPUs for AI workloads and graphics rendering in gaming and other visualization applications. Its AI-focused Xiyun C500 series, which the company claimed was comparable to Nvidia’s A100, made up almost 98% of total revenue in 2024. The new generation, called C588, has significantly narrowed the performance gap with Nvidia’s H100, according to MetaX. Last year, MetaX captured approximately 1% of China’s AI chip market, according to the company’s prospectus, which cites data from an industry consultancy. Chinese IPOs have been robust this year, with an average first-day trading jump of 250%, according to Bloomberg data. That has at least partly been because Chinese officials have been quelling issuances to prevent sapping liquidity in the broader market. At the same time, a softer risk appetite in the secondary market and year-end profit-taking have also increased interest in new offerings, which are seen as a reliable opportunity to capture gains in the first few days of trading. Radio frequency chipmaker Beijing Onmicro Electronics Co. more than doubled on its debut on Tuesday, after filing in a 2,899-times oversubscribed IPO. Changxin Memory Technologies Inc. and Yangtze Memory Technologies Co. are among chipmakers that could consider listing in China. They could each seek a valuation of 200 billion yuan to 300 billion yuan. In Hong Kong, too, a swarm of companies in the AI space is gearing up for market debuts. MiniMax and Zhipu, backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Tencent Holdings Ltd., and others, aim to complete their IPOs as soon as January.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a crucial barometer for investor psychology, has inched up five points to 16. However, this small rise doesn’t signal a shift in the overall mood. The market remains firmly in the grip of extreme fear . For investors, understanding this index is more than just watching a number—it’s about reading the market’s emotional pulse to make smarter decisions. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does It Matter? Think of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as the market’s mood ring. It quantifies the collective emotion driving cryptocurrency prices on a scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 screams ‘Extreme Fear,’ while 100 shouts ‘Extreme Greed.’ Currently sitting at 16, the index tells a clear story: fear is the dominant force. This metric matters because extreme fear often creates potential buying opportunities, while extreme greed can signal a market top. It helps you look beyond price charts to understand the ‘why’ behind the moves. How is the Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The index isn’t based on a gut feeling. Alternative.me uses a data-driven formula combining several market factors. Here’s the breakdown: Volatility (25%): Sharp price swings, especially downward, increase fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): High trading volume during downturns amplifies fear signals. Social Media (15%): The tone and volume of conversations on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Polls and community sentiment checks. Dominance (10%): Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Rising dominance can indicate a ‘flight to safety.’ Trends (10%): Google search volume for related terms. This multi-source approach ensures the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reflects a comprehensive, real-time snapshot of market psychology. What Does a Score of ‘Extreme Fear’ Mean for Your Portfolio? A reading of 16 in the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone is a powerful signal. Historically, prolonged periods of extreme fear have often preceded significant market rallies, as weak hands sell and value investors step in. However, it is not a standalone ‘buy’ signal. You must consider it alongside fundamental analysis and your personal risk tolerance. This environment demands caution but also presents a chance to research fundamentally strong projects that may be undervalued due to the negative sentiment captured by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. Actionable Insights in a Fearful Market Navigating a market ruled by fear requires a disciplined strategy. First, avoid making panic-driven decisions. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool for perspective, not a crystal ball. Second, consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to build positions gradually, reducing the impact of volatility. Third, use this time to review and rebalance your portfolio, ensuring it aligns with your long-term goals. Remember, the crowd is often most fearful near potential bottoms. Conclusion: Reading Between the Lines of Market Sentiment The recent uptick in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 16 is a minor relief in a sea of anxiety. It highlights that while fear persists, small shifts in sentiment are occurring. For the astute investor, this index provides critical context. It reminds us that markets are driven by human emotion as much as by technology and fundamentals. By understanding these emotional extremes, you can strive to be fearful when others are greedy and greedy only when others are fearful. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Where can I check the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A: The index is published daily on websites like Alternative.me. Many major crypto news platforms also feature it. Q: Is the Fear & Greed Index a reliable timing tool for buying or selling? A: No, it should not be used alone for timing trades. It is a sentiment indicator best used alongside technical and fundamental analysis to gauge overall market psychology. Q: Has the index ever been wrong? A: Like any indicator, it is not infallible. It reflects current sentiment, which can remain ‘extreme’ for extended periods during prolonged bear markets or bubbles. Q: Does it only track Bitcoin? A> While Bitcoin is a major component (via its dominance metric), the index aims to measure sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market. Q: What is considered a ‘neutral’ score on the index? A: A score around 50 is generally considered neutral, indicating a balance between fear and greed. Found this breakdown of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index helpful?

The asset management fund manages over $15 billion in client assets over 30 investment products. The Chief Investment Officer of Bitwise, Matt Hougan and Head of Research, Ryan Rasmussen aired bullish sentiments about crypto, saying that demand from institutional investors in the long term will be more than the new supply. New supply refers to new tokens entering into circulation through either mining, staking rewards or protocol issuance. They also highlighted institutional adoption and more mature regulations as the main drivers. What’s Bitwise predicting for crypto in 2026? In a recent publication where it made predictions about the crypto market, Bitwise said the supply of BTC, ETH, and SOL will be outpaced by institutional demand for crypto ETFs. This can cause a supply squeeze for the three most popular crypto assets, which should result in positive price action. However, Bitwise cautioned that this is just a prediction, not a guarantee. Crypto ETFs are seeing massive adoption, with traditional financial institutions like Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch giving their wealth management customers an opportunity to add crypto to their portfolios. Since the launch of Bitcoin ETFs in 2024, ETFs have purchased 710,777 Bitcoins, almost double the 363,047 Bitcoins that have been mined in the same time frame, signalling a higher demand than supply. Bitwise also predicted that over 100 crypto ETFs will launch in the US in 2026, giving investors more options to invest. Bitcoin to break four-year cycle Bitwise also made a prediction that Bitcoin is going to break its four-year cycle in 2026 as more institutional capital flows into the crypto market. Historically, BTC’s price has been tied to several factors, including halving events and retail speculation. However, Bitwise expects institutional funds, such as spot Bitcoin ETFs to become a dominant force shaping the market. The investment manager credits regulatory approvals for the growth and adoption of crypto ETFs. In 2025, the SEC made it a point of emphasis to streamline the listing process for spot crypto ETFs, significantly cutting down on approval timelines and creating a clearer, repeatable framework for issuers. Since then, Bitcoin and crypto ETFs have gone from niche products into mainstream portfolio-building products. Bitwise believes Bitcoin’s price behavior could begin to resemble that of a mature macro asset rather than a purely cyclical trade, bringing an end to the four-year cycle.

That’s the vision driving a pivotal shift in Canada’s cryptocurrency landscape. The Bank of Canada has announced a decisive move: starting in 2026, it will only approve high-quality fiat-pegged stablecoins . This regulation aims to transform these digital assets into trustworthy monetary instruments, marking a significant step in the maturation of crypto markets. What Does Canada’s New Stablecoin Policy Mean? In simple terms, Canada is setting a high bar for digital currency stability. The forthcoming rules, reported by sources like Cointelegraph, mandate that for a stablecoin to receive regulatory approval, it must be securely pegged to the Canadian dollar or another reputable fiat currency. Therefore, only assets that can reliably maintain a 1:1 value with traditional money will be greenlit. This move directly targets the volatility and reserve transparency issues that have plagued some stablecoin projects globally. Why is Canada Focusing on Fiat-Pegged Stablecoins? The Bank of Canada’s strategy is clear: prioritize safety and reliability in the emerging digital economy. By endorsing only fiat-pegged stablecoins , regulators aim to protect consumers and ensure financial system integrity. Let’s break down the core benefits of this approach: Consumer Protection: Users gain confidence that their digital currency holds a predictable, government-backed value. Financial Stability: It prevents the systemic risks posed by unstable algorithmic or commodity-backed stablecoins. Clear Regulation: It provides a straightforward framework for crypto businesses to operate within. Mainstream Adoption: Reliability is key for businesses and individuals to use crypto for everyday transactions. What Challenges Lie Ahead for This Policy? However, this path is not without its hurdles. The policy, while promoting stability, could limit innovation by excluding other models of stable digital assets. Moreover, defining “high-quality” reserves and ensuring constant, transparent audits will be a complex task for regulators. The global nature of cryptocurrency also poses a challenge, as users might simply access unregulated, international stablecoins instead. How Will This Impact Crypto Investors and Users in Canada? For anyone involved with crypto in Canada, this is a call to prepare. After 2026, the landscape for fiat-pegged stablecoins will be more structured but also more restrictive. Investors should scrutinize the reserve backing of any stablecoin they use. Developers and crypto firms must align their products with the coming fiat-peg requirement. Ultimately, this policy could make Canadian-approved stablecoins a global benchmark for safety. Actionable Insights for Navigating the New Rules You don’t have to wait until 2026 to adapt. Start by researching stablecoin projects that already emphasize full fiat collateral and regular, public audits. Furthermore, diversify your crypto holdings to avoid over-reliance on any single asset class. Stay informed on the Bank of Canada’s evolving guidance to ensure full compliance and capitalize on the new opportunities that regulated fiat-pegged stablecoins will create. In conclusion, Canada’s 2026 mandate is a landmark decision that prioritizes stability over unchecked innovation. By anchoring digital currency to traditional fiat, the country is building a bridge between the old financial world and the new. This bold move promises a safer environment for users and could set a powerful precedent for global cryptocurrency regulation, proving that trust is the most valuable asset in finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are fiat-pegged stablecoins? Fiat-pegged stablecoins are digital cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by being backed one-to-one by a reserve of traditional government-issued currency, like the Canadian or US dollar. When do Canada’s new stablecoin rules take effect? The regulations are scheduled to take effect in 2026, giving the market and regulators time to prepare for the transition. Will existing stablecoins be banned in Canada after 2026? The policy applies to regulatory *approval*. It likely means that only Bank of Canada-approved, fiat-pegged stablecoins will be officially recognized for certain regulated activities, but accessing other stablecoins may still be possible through international platforms. How does this protect Canadian crypto users? It ensures that approved stablecoins are fully backed by reliable reserves, reducing the risk of a sudden loss in value—a problem seen in some unbacked or algorithmically stabilized coins. What is the Bank of Canada’s main goal with this policy? Its primary goal is to ensure stablecoins can function as safe and reliable digital monetary instruments within the Canadian financial system, protecting consumers and maintaining economic stability. Could this policy stifle cryptocurrency innovation? Some critics argue it might, by favoring one model over others. However, proponents believe that establishing a foundation of trust through fiat-pegged stablecoins is necessary for broader, long-term innovation and adoption.

The widely watched Altcoin Season Index has taken a notable hit, falling four points to a reading of just 18. This drop suggests Bitcoin is tightening its grip on the market, potentially squeezing out alternative cryptocurrencies. But what does this index really measure, and should you be concerned about your altcoin holdings? Let’s break down the implications. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Actually Tell Us? Maintained by CoinMarketCap, the Altcoin Season Index is a crucial thermometer for the crypto market’s health. It doesn’t measure absolute prices. Instead, it tracks a simple but powerful comparison: how the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) perform against Bitcoin over a rolling 90-day window. The core question it answers is: are altcoins collectively beating the king, or is Bitcoin reigning supreme? The index operates on a clear threshold system. When 75% of these top altcoins outperform Bitcoin, an “ altcoin season ” is officially declared—a period often marked by explosive, broad-based rallies across the crypto board. Conversely, if most altcoins lag behind, we’re in a “Bitcoin season.” A score of 100 signals a strong altcoin season, while a low score like 18 points firmly toward Bitcoin dominance. Why Has the Index Fallen to a Reading of 18? A drop from 22 to 18 might seem small, but in the context of this index, it’s a significant move. This decline indicates that fewer altcoins are managing to outpace Bitcoin’s price action. Several factors could be at play: Risk-Off Sentiment: In times of market uncertainty, investors often flock to Bitcoin, perceived as a more established and less risky digital asset compared to altcoins. Liquidity and Focus: Market liquidity may be concentrating in Bitcoin, leaving altcoins with less capital to fuel independent rallies. Macroeconomic Pressures: Broader economic factors, like interest rate fears, can impact speculative altcoins more severely than Bitcoin. Therefore, this dip in the Altcoin Season Index is less about altcoins crashing and more about Bitcoin demonstrating relative strength or resilience. Should You Panic About Your Altcoin Investments? Not necessarily. It’s vital to understand that the Altcoin Season Index is a broad, macro indicator. It reflects the median performance of the top 100, not the fate of every project. A low index reading does not mean all altcoins are doomed. In fact, some sectors or individual coins with strong fundamentals can still thrive during a Bitcoin season. However, the index is a powerful reminder of the market’s current rhythm. For investors, this environment demands a more selective strategy. Chasing low-cap, high-risk moonshots may be less fruitful when the Altcoin Season Index is this low. Instead, focus might shift to: Altcoins with proven utility and strong development activity. Sector leaders within niches like DeFi or Layer 2 solutions. Dollar-cost averaging into fundamentally sound projects, using the period of weaker sentiment as an accumulation opportunity. What’s Next for the Crypto Market Cycle? History shows that crypto markets move in cycles. Prolonged Bitcoin seasons often eventually give way to explosive altcoin seasons . The current low reading on the index could be setting the stage for a future shift. When investor confidence returns and capital starts searching for higher returns, it often flows from Bitcoin into altcoins, potentially triggering the index to climb rapidly toward that critical 75 threshold. Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index provides a data-driven way to gauge when that transition might be beginning. A sustained move above 50 would be the first sign of altcoins regaining momentum, while a surge past 75 would confirm the season’s arrival. Conclusion: Navigating the Bitcoin-Dominant Tide The four-point fall in the Altcoin Season Index to 18 is a clear, quantitative signal that Bitcoin is currently driving the market. While this may dampen short-term enthusiasm for altcoins, it is a normal phase of the crypto market cycle. Savvy investors use tools like this index not for panic, but for perspective. It helps confirm the market’s primary trend, allowing for more informed decisions about portfolio allocation, risk management, and timing. Remember, in crypto, seasons always change. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Altcoin Season Index? A1: The Altcoin Season Index is a metric from CoinMarketCap that measures the percentage of top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins) outperforming Bitcoin over the past 90 days. A reading above 75 indicates an “altcoin season.” Q2: Why is a score of 18 considered low? A2: A score of 18 means only a small fraction of major altcoins are beating Bitcoin’s performance. It signals strong Bitcoin dominance and a market environment where capital is not broadly flowing into alternative crypto assets. Q3: Does a low index mean all altcoins are losing value? A3: Not necessarily. It means they are underperforming relative to Bitcoin. Some altcoins may still be rising in USD value, but just not as quickly as Bitcoin is. Q4: How can I use this index in my trading strategy? A4: Traders can use it as a risk gauge. A low index suggests a more cautious approach to altcoin speculation and potentially a greater focus on Bitcoin. A rising index can signal growing appetite for altcoin risk. Q5: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? A5: The index is typically updated daily, providing a near real-time pulse on the shifting dynamics between Bitcoin and the broader altcoin market. Q6: Has the index ever been at 100? A6: Yes, during peak altcoin bull markets, the index can reach 100, indicating virtually all top altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin simultaneously.

They are likely to transpire when a project has already silently passed, a supply is constricting, and the next phase is to be initiated. Such is the case that is shaping up. One of the new DeFi crypto is on the brink of a transition phase that has been influencing the way investors perceive value particularly with the market projecting itself to 2026. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a protocol of a decentralized lending and borrowing framework based on actual use, but not temporary price fluctuation. The system is designed to favor both the extremes of the market with articulate guidelines. Respondents who post assets get interest bearing exposure related to the demand to borrow. Real activity yields profit. Liquidity is offered to the borrowers through the posting of collateral on the basis of agreed terms in which the interest rates, Loan-to-Value limits as well as repayment behavior are determined. The liquidations are conducted in a balanced fashion in case the collateral becomes less than the established thresholds. This is what predisposes the idea that Mutuum Finance can be viewed as utility-based and not a narrative-driven structure. It is stated in the official X statement that V1 will enter Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 the very moment development is open to interaction. Meanwhile, Halborn Security will be looking at the finalized smart contracts, which enhances preparation before exercise. Investment Growth and What the Numbers Indicate Their participation is on the increase. Mutuum Finance is a company that has raised over $19.30M, and currently boasts over 18 400 investors. This is important to a DeFi protocol that has not yet been actively used. Lending sites rely on timely liquidity and the extensive involvement to operate well as soon as it gets going. The token was introduced in early 2025 at a price of $0.01. It currently costs $0.035 in presale, which is an increment of 250% in systematic development. This increase has not been due to increased hype. It was a result of slow motion in stages. To a lot of viewers, the trend is a sign of accumulation and not temporary attention. The total supply of MUTM is 4B. That is distributed to the early distribution of 45.5% or 1.82B tokens. The number of 820M tokens sold so far is 820M. This is because much of the initial allocation has been consumed. It is now in Phase 6 that is more than 98% allocated. The token price goes up as every step is made. Phase 7 is the next phase with an increment in price of approximately 20%. That is significant as it is weakening supply at the latest point. It is the time when behavior changes rapidly historically. The ability to engage with the community is still evident. The leaderboard introduced by the 24-hour, which provides the best contributor of the day with the $500 of MUTM, has made the activity regular. Card payment options are offered with no restrictions and reduce friction especially among new players despite restricted ability. Security Signals and Infrastructure Planning Preparation of security is an added security assurance. Mutuum finance successfully passed a CertiK audit with 90/100 score in Token Scan. This gives a preliminary certification of the smart contract design. In addition to this, the ongoing Halbon Security review and the existing bug bounty of $50K eliminate code uncertainty in the pre-V1. In addition to lending, the roadmap also has protocol-native stablecoin that would be secured by interest on the generated system. Cryptocurrency pegged to the internal operations typically increase the liquidity and maintain the value flowing in the ecosystem. These suspensions imply that the protocol is developed to be used in long terms and not in short cycles. Phase shifts are important since they reform entry conditions. At the current price, Phase 6 has just a small window since it is close to selling out. The course of action in the next stage is the introduction of a premium price, not speculative in the market. Active within the last few years whale allocations of around $110K. Greater penetrations at this point can be a sign of positioning before milestones as opposed to responding after the milestones. Together with the tightening of supply and a sure timeline of V1, these clues are the reason why a sense of urgency is a growing concern these days. To a person who has $500, the arithmetic opportunity is aided. The lower price of the tokens in earlier stages is offered. With increase in stages, the same quantity purchases fewer tokens. That is the reason why a close observance of Phase 7 is being done. Positioning Ahead of 2026 Mutuum Finance is a Ethereum-Based crypto, and this places it in an ecosystem that most users are familiar with. V1 is planned to be used in Q4 2025, its debut procedural time frame, not as a concept, as V1. In the meantime, there is tightening of supply, infrastructure is being completed, security reviews are underway. These are the conditions oftentimes that have pre-empted wider visibility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already experienced a 250% rise in price. Phase 6 is more than 98% allocated and Phase 7 proposes an almost 20% rise in price. The project is in a decisive phase with a raised amount of $19.30M, 18,400 investors, good security indicators, and a confirmed window of V1 launch.

According to data shared by Lookonchain, two large whales dumped a combined 14,000 ETH, worth approximately $40.82 million, in just the past two hours. Such aggressive selling during already weak conditions adds pressure to an asset that is struggling to attract sustained demand. While isolated whale activity does not define the broader trend on its own, timing matters. Large distributions during periods of low liquidity often amplify downside moves and reinforce negative sentiment across the market. Ethereum Whale Selling Meets Long-Term Conviction Arkham data shared by Lookonchain reveals fresh evidence of large-scale selling as Ethereum trades under sustained pressure. Address 0x2802 sold 10,000 ETH, worth approximately $29.16 million, at an average price of $2,915.5 through decentralized exchanges. Shortly after, another whale, 0x4c0A, offloaded 4,000 ETH, valued at around $11.66 million, distributing the sale across multiple centralized venues, including OKX, Binance, KuCoin, and Gate. The timing and coordination of these moves reinforce the current bearish tone, particularly as liquidity remains thin and broader market sentiment leans defensive. In the short term, such activity adds to downside pressure and fuels uncertainty among smaller investors, who often interpret whale selling as a signal of deeper weakness ahead. However, price action and sentiment do not tell the full story. Despite the drawdown, Ethereum’s fundamentals continue to strengthen at a pace rarely seen before. Institutional adoption is accelerating, not slowing. Most notably, JP Morgan recently announced the use of Ethereum to launch its first tokenized money-market fund, a milestone that underscores growing confidence in Ethereum as a settlement and financial infrastructure layer. While markets may remain bearish in the near term, the divergence between price sentiment and fundamental progress is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore. Ethereum Price Struggles to Hold Key Weekly Support Ethereum continues to trade under pressure on the weekly chart, with price now sitting around $2,950 after a sharp rejection from the $3,200–$3,300 region. This area previously acted as a key pivot zone and has now clearly flipped into resistance. The inability to reclaim it confirms that sellers remain in control of the medium-term structure. From a trend perspective, ETH is consolidating around its 200-week moving average (red line), a historically important level that often determines whether corrections remain cyclical or evolve into deeper bearish phases. So far, this moving average is acting as dynamic support, preventing a more aggressive breakdown. However, momentum remains weak, and upside follow-through is limited. The 50-week and 100-week moving averages (blue and green lines) are beginning to flatten and converge, reflecting indecision and reduced trend strength. Volume also remains muted compared to prior expansion phases, suggesting that neither strong accumulation nor capitulation is taking place at current levels. Structurally, ETH remains in a wide consolidation range between $2,500 and $3,300. A weekly close below the $2,800–$2,900 area would expose downside toward the lower end of that range. Conversely, reclaiming $3,300 is required to reestablish bullish momentum. Until then, Ethereum remains technically fragile despite its long-term fundamentals.

The cryptocurrency is currently trading within a broad range between $85,000 and $93,000, leading to growing concerns about further price corrections in the upcoming months. Amid this uncertainty, market expert NoLimit recently expressed on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that he anticipates Bitcoin could bottom out at around $40,000 sometime in 2026. This forecast implies a significant 54% decline from current levels, which are just above $87,860. A Historical Perspective On Market Cycles NoLimit’s analysis outlines several reasons for this predicted downturn. He points out that Bitcoin has a historical tendency to surprise investors, often when confidence in the market is high. While each price cycle may appear unique on the surface, NoLimit argues that the underlying mechanics remain largely unchanged. He emphasizes the cyclical nature of Bitcoin, noting that it moves within a four-year cycle influenced by liquidity, leverage, and human behavior rather than mere sentiment. According to him, the market is currently late in this cycle, and Bitcoin has consistently followed a three-step process during past upward movements.

This is typically followed by an influx of maximum leverage and late-stage buyers. Finally, the cycle concludes with a sharp and often chaotic reset before the next significant price expansion occurs. Historically, Bitcoin has experienced steep declines during these resets, such as an approximate 85% drop in 2013-2014, an 84% drop in 2017-2018, and a 77% drop during the 2021-2022 cycle. In each scenario, investors were convinced that the conditions were different, yet the outcomes remained consistent. $40,000 As Foundation For Bitcoin’s Next Bull Run Considering the current market situation, NoLimit highlights several critical indicators. He notes that Bitcoin has already seen substantial price appreciation, with institutional interest and exchange-trade fund (ETF) approvals now part of the landscape. He also observes that many traders are over-leveraged, market volatility is compressed, and there exists widespread hope for further price increases. These factors often signal a heightened risk of downside movement in the market. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Suffer A 20% Decline After Japan’s Rate Hike? Historical Patterns Suggest So A potential drop toward the $40,000 range should not be viewed as an unforeseen disaster, according to NoLimit. He argues that significant price declines have historically preceded major upward movements. Additionally, this price target aligns well with several technical indicators, including previous resistance levels that have turned into support, long-term moving averages, and the liquidity gap created by ETF approvals. Such factors suggest that a move toward this region could exhaust forced sellers and provide a solid foundation for recovery.
