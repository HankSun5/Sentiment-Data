While Bitcoin dominates liquidity and investor attention, altcoins are struggling to attract sustained demand, and XRP is increasingly reflecting this imbalance. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin’s Quiet Price Action May Be ‘Dangerous’ – IFP Signals Rising Structural Risk According to a CryptoQuant report by Darkfost, the weakness in XRP is not an isolated event but part of a broader contraction across the altcoin market. Whether on spot markets or in derivatives, trading activity has been shrinking significantly over recent months. Liquidity is gradually drying up, signaling a clear retreat from speculative positioning as investors reduce exposure to higher-risk assets. This trend is especially visible in XRP’s derivatives data. The Taker Buy Volume on Binance, which tracks aggressive buy orders in futures markets, has collapsed to its lowest levels of the year. After peaking above $5.8 billion in July, this metric has fallen to roughly $250 million, representing a sharp 95.7% decline. Such a dramatic contraction highlights the near-total evaporation of buying pressure and underscores the lack of conviction among traders. XRP Liquidity Compression Signals Downside Risk According to Darkfost, the broader market context is a major factor amplifying XRP’s current weakness. Liquidations have been accumulating across crypto markets, confidence remains fragile, and many participants are still psychologically impacted by the October 10 event. This lingering stress has reduced risk tolerance, particularly among short-term traders who typically provide liquidity during corrective phases. Beyond sentiment, altcoins are facing a clear structural headwind. Bitcoin continues to absorb the majority of available capital, both in spot and derivatives markets. As BTC dominance remains elevated, liquidity that would normally rotate into altcoins during recoveries is instead staying concentrated in Bitcoin. This leaves very limited room for a sustained rebound across the broader altcoin market, including XRP. Related Reading: Market Stress Continues As Bitcoin STH SOPR Dips Below 1– When Will The Pain End? Within this environment, the sharp collapse in XRP’s Taker Buy Volume is not surprising. The signal becomes even more relevant given that it is unfolding on Binance, which still accounts for the largest share of global XRP trading activity. A sustained drop in aggressive buying on the dominant exchange highlights the depth of demand erosion. At the same time, the Taker Buy Sell Ratio has remained negative for most of the period, confirming that sellers continue to dominate XRP’s derivatives market. Historically, such severe volume compression can precede volatility expansions. However, in the current setup, the lack of meaningful buying pressure and persistent bearish positioning suggests downside risks remain elevated. Even ETF-related optimism has failed to offset these structural weaknesses. XRP Price Struggles Below Key Moving Averages XRP price action on the 3-day chart reflects a clear loss of bullish structure and growing downside pressure. After peaking above the $3.40–$3.60 zone earlier in the year, XRP has formed a sequence of lower highs and lower lows, confirming a medium-term downtrend. The recent breakdown below the psychological $2.00 level is particularly significant, as this zone previously acted as both support and consolidation. From a technical perspective, XRP is now trading below its 50-day and 100-day moving averages, both of which have started to slope downward. This alignment reinforces bearish momentum and suggests that rallies are being sold rather than accumulated. The 200-day moving average, currently near the $1.70–$1.80 area, represents the next major structural support. A sustained move toward this level would not be surprising if selling pressure persists. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Refuse to Sell: Historic Signal Emerges As Binance CDD Drops To 2017 Levels Volume dynamics further confirm weakness. Since the August high, volume has steadily declined, indicating fading participation and weak dip-buying interest. The sharp volatility spike in October was followed by distribution rather than continuation, often a sign of a local market top. As long as XRP remains below $2.00 and fails to reclaim the declining moving averages, the path of least resistance remains to the downside. For any meaningful trend reversal, XRP would need to regain $2.30–$2.50 with expanding volume, signaling renewed demand rather than short-term relief rallies.

GeeFi has made a significant market entrance, concluding a successful Phase 1 that sold 10 million tokens , generated $500,000 in funding, and attracted over 2,400 investors . The momentum has continued, with total sales climbing past 14 million tokens and capital raised now over $850K . With less than 1 million tokens left in Phase 2, this self-custody ecosystem is seeing intense demand. Analysts suggest Phase 3 is days away, with strong speculation about major exchange listings fueling the excitement. Where Is Real-World Utility? Cardano is currently navigating a difficult market, with its price falling to $0.38 , a 60% decline this year, even as it launches its Midnight (NIGHT) token and advances its decentralized governance. While established blockchains face performance challenges, forward-thinking individuals are exploring GeeFi , a project many experts are calling 2026’s 100x gem . GeeFi directly tackles DeFi’s fragmentation by offering a single, streamlined dashboard. This enables users to manage their portfolios across 14+ networks , allowing for simple token swaps and bridging without technical complexity. The GeeFi Team took a product-first approach, starting development in 2023 and launching a working platform in 2024 before raising public funds. This commitment to delivering a finished product sets it apart from projects built on promises alone. Based on a self-custody model, the platform guarantees that users always maintain complete control over their funds. With an Android app already available and an iOS version on the way, GeeFi is demonstrating tangible progress, confirming why it’s considered 2026’s 100x gem . Unlocking Massive ROI Potential The GeeFi presale is in its final Phase 2 stage, with tokens offered at $0.06 . This price provides early participants with a built-in 667% gain when the token launches at its confirmed $0.40 listing price . The wealth-building possibilities are substantial. An initial investment of $1,800 could transform into $90,000 if GeeFi hits the analyst target of a $3 valuation , representing a 4,900% ROI . The market’s response has been overwhelming. Phase 2 has fewer than 1 million tokens available after raising more than $850K and selling 14 million tokens total. Industry analysts praise the presale structure and expect Phase 3 to launch within days and sell out quickly, fueled by exchange listing rumors. This powerful demand reinforces the view that GeeFi is 2026’s 100x gem . Build Passive Income with Staking GeeFi offers a rewarding staking program designed to benefit its supporters. Participants can lock their tokens to receive 15% APR for one month , 22% APR for three months , or an impressive 55% APR for twelve months . For those who value liquidity, a flexible staking option offers up to 10% APR with no lock-up period . Furthermore, a referral system provides a 5% bonus in GEE tokens for every purchase made through a user’s unique link, expanding the community while boosting holdings. Your Final Chance Before the Next Phase The opportunity to invest in a project with a live application and clear use case at this price point is exceedingly rare. The GeeFi presale is a limited-time event to acquire tokens at a valuation that is unlikely to last. With a deflationary token model, a working mobile app, and a crypto debit card in development, GeeFi is built for mainstream success. The speed of the token sale shows that smart money is moving in fast. Don’t miss your chance to be part of 2026’s 100x gem .

That imbalance creates a clear scenario. If SOL pushes up to $147 this week, short sellers could face up to $1 billion in liquidations, forcing them to buy back positions and accelerate the move higher. But that volatility goes both ways. While long-side exposure is smaller, a drop below $120 could still trigger a $500 million long squeeze and spark a sharp liquidation cascade.

The RSI continues to print higher lows as it trends toward the 50 neutral line, signalling growing buy pressure beneath the surface. At the same time, the MACD is holding just above a potential death cross with the signal line, a sign that current levels are pivotal for the prevailing trend. The $120 level also marks the lower boundary of a year-long descending triangle pattern, with the $210 target of the triple bottom setting up a breakout attempt.

In a major move to tackle fragmentation, Mysten Labs, the core developer behind the Sui blockchain, has just announced the formation of a powerful Blockchain Payment Consortium . This alliance isn’t going solo; it brings together heavyweights like Solana, Polygon, Stellar, TON, and Fireblocks. Their mission? To finally build a common rulebook for the booming world of on-chain payments and stablecoins. Why is a Blockchain Payment Consortium Needed Now? The explosive growth of stablecoins has been a double-edged sword. While adoption soars, the lack of universal standards creates confusion, risks, and friction. Imagine every country had its own unique traffic lights and road signs—that’s the current state of cross-chain payments. This new Blockchain Payment Consortium aims to be the global governing body that installs standard signs and signals everyone agrees to follow. Therefore, the primary goals are clear and critical: Define On-Chain Transactions: Create a clear, shared definition of what constitutes a valid payment transaction across different blockchains. Develop Privacy-Centric Standards: Build frameworks that protect user data while still providing necessary transparency for regulators and authorities. Enable Seamless Interoperability: Make it easier for payments to flow between different blockchain networks without technical hiccups or security gaps. Who’s Powering This Payment Alliance? The strength of this initiative lies in its founding members. This isn’t a project led by one chain; it’s a collaborative effort from leaders across the ecosystem. The consortium includes Layer 1 giants known for speed and scale, like Solana and Polygon, alongside payment-focused networks like Stellar and TON. Crucially, enterprise platform Fireblocks adds deep institutional security expertise. This diverse membership signals a profound understanding: for on-chain payments to reach the next billion users, the industry must present a united front. The formation of this Blockchain Payment Consortium shows that competitors can become collaborators when the goal is mass adoption. What Challenges Will the Consortium Face? Building consensus in a decentralized world is notoriously difficult. The path forward for this Blockchain Payment Consortium will have hurdles. Aligning the technical architectures and economic models of chains as different as Sui, Solana, and Stellar is a monumental engineering and diplomatic task. Furthermore, balancing robust privacy with regulatory compliance remains a tightrope walk. However, the potential payoff is transformative. Unified standards could slash development time for payment apps, reduce errors, and build trust with traditional financial institutions and regulators. It turns the chaotic wild west of crypto payments into a well-regulated, efficient global highway. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Payments? Think of this consortium as laying the foundational plumbing for the future financial internet. Successful standards from this Blockchain Payment Consortium could lead to: Cheaper and Faster Global Transfers: Frictionless cross-border payments for businesses and individuals. Mainstream Merchant Adoption: A clear, safe framework for shops to accept crypto payments without technical fear. Innovation Boom: Developers can build new payment products without worrying about incompatible blockchain rules. The formation of this group is a confident step toward maturity. It moves the conversation from isolated technological triumphs to practical, user-centric solutions. The Blockchain Payment Consortium isn’t just building code; it’s building trust. Conclusion: A Unified Front for a Fragmented World The announcement by Mysten Labs and its partners is a watershed moment. The Blockchain Payment Consortium represents a collective acknowledgment that for crypto to truly revolutionize finance, the industry must standardize the basics. By bringing together rival networks to cooperate on payments, they are prioritizing ecosystem growth over individual chain supremacy. This collaborative spirit, if sustained, may well be remembered as the turning point where crypto payments graduated from a niche novelty to a legitimate global infrastructure. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main goal of the Blockchain Payment Consortium? A1: The primary goal is to establish a common framework and industry-wide standards for on-chain payments. This aims to reduce fragmentation, protect user privacy, ensure regulatory compliance, and make cross-blockchain transactions seamless. Q2: Which companies and blockchains are part of the consortium? A2: The founding members include Mysten Labs (Sui), Solana, Polygon, Stellar, The Open Network (TON), and the digital asset platform Fireblocks. Q3: How will this consortium benefit the average crypto user? A3> Users can expect more reliable, secure, and straightforward payment experiences across different apps and blockchains. It could lead to lower fees, faster transaction times, and greater merchant acceptance of crypto payments. Q4: Does this mean all these blockchains are merging? A4: No, not at all. Each blockchain remains independent. The consortium is focused on creating interoperable standards—like a common language—that allow them to work together smoothly for payment purposes, not on merging their technologies. Q5: What role do stablecoins play in this initiative? A5: Stablecoins are the primary driver. Their massive growth has highlighted the urgent need for standardized payment rails. The consortium’s frameworks will likely be designed heavily around the secure and efficient transfer of stablecoin assets. Q6: When can we expect to see tangible results from this consortium? A6: The group has just been formed. While no specific timeline is given, the work involves complex technical and regulatory alignment. The first whitepapers or proposed standards could emerge within the next 6-12 months, with implementation taking longer. Found this insight into the new Blockchain Payment Consortium valuable? This move could redefine how we use digital money.

But BitGur’s analysis could be the pivot point for a green December and uphold the historic trend of at least one green month through Q4. Dogecoin Price Prediction: December May Only Be the Start The $0.13 demand zone also coincides with the lower boundary of a year-long decedign triangle pattern, and the triple bottom reversal could put it on the breakout path. If the triple bottom can be confirmed with a clean break above its neckline at $0.155, its $0.182 target may stand as a higher and firmer footing for a breakout push.

The RSI continues to form higher lows in a clear trend towards the neutral line, a sign of buy pressure building beneath the surface The MACD death cross below the signal line stands to be short-lived as sellers appear to be losing control of the prevailing trend. A clean triangle breakout sets up a measured move of roughly 260% to past highs around $0.50 , and a fully realised target of $1 for a potoentail 680% gain . Though such a move likely hinges on supportive market conditions, such a U.S. Fed policy shift ot quantatitative easing (QE) in 2026 to stimulate risk appetite. But for an end-of-year rally, BitGur’s analysis remains the setup to watch – though the outcome hinges on the $0.13 level being held. PepeNode: A Way to Avoid the Pitfalls of Meme Coin Investors Those entering the market now face a decision: sit out and miss out on the next leg up, or enter and risk exposure to potential heavy losses if a bull market doesn’t play out. PepeNode ($PEPENODE) removes much of that pressure by offering a way to accumulate without timing the perfect entry — the pitfall of most meme coin investors. It’s a simple mine-to-earn (M2E) game. No hardware needed. Just log in, acquire virtual nodes, stack rigs, and configure their setup to begin generating passive rewards diversified across leading meme coins. Momentum is climbing fast. The presale has already passed $2.35 million, while early stakers can still earn up to 554% APY. And thanks to a built-in deflationary model, where 70% of all $PEPENODE spent on nodes and rigs is burned, scarcity supports long-term token value. PepeNode offers a more measured way to capture high-upside market exposure — without relying on perfect entries. With just 22 days remaining in the presale, a later entry could come at a higher cost.

Saylor Says Network Upgrades Will Strengthen Bitcoin In a December 16 X post , Saylor explained the Bitcoin network would upgrade following a quantum breakthrough, with active coins migrating while lost coins remain frozen. The Bitcoin Quantum Leap: Quantum computing won’t break Bitcoin—it will harden it. The network upgrades, active coins migrate, lost coins stay frozen. Security goes up. Supply comes down. Bitcoin grows stronger. — Michael Saylor (@saylor) December 16, 2025 He concluded, “Security goes up. Supply comes down. Bitcoin grows stronger.” This statement counters numerous fearmongering predictions claiming Bitcoin encryption faces quantum hacking risks that could trigger network collapse. However, when Cryptonews interviewed David Carvalho, CEO and chief scientist of Naoris’ post-quantum protocol, about quantum threats to traditional cryptography, the former ethical hacker predicted that 30% of all circulating BTC could face theft risk when “ Q-Day ” arrives. Nevertheless, he stressed that “ the timeline for such breakthroughs remains uncertain, and exchanges are unlikely to allow compromised coins to circulate freely.” Bitcoin Price Prediction: Monthly Chart Mirrors 2022 Bottoming Pattern Bitcoin’s monthly chart shows price consolidating below the critical $108,000–$110,000 resistance zone, which has capped upside and must be reclaimed to confirm continuation of the 2026 upward leg. This level sits above recent cycle highs and aligns with historical areas where previous bull markets paused before accelerating. Structurally, the chart highlights strong similarities to the 2022 bottoming phase. Source: TradingView After a deep drawdown marked by consecutive red monthly candles, Bitcoin formed a base and delivered a near-2x rally from lows, followed by consolidation before the next expansion. The current market appears to be repeating that sequence since October, with price holding well above long-term support and forming higher monthly closes despite recent volatility. The RSI remains above the neutral 50 level, suggesting the long-term trend stays bullish. Provided Bitcoin maintains above the mid-$80,000 region , the probability favors this consolidation resolving upward. A decisive monthly close above $108,000 would likely open pathways to a renewed 2026 bull run rally toward the $140,000–$150,000 region. Pepenode Raises $2.3M To Position for 2026 Meme Coin Season If Bitcoin finally breaks the $108,000 resistance and begins the 2026 bull run, meme coins like Pepenode (PEPENODE) would see increased demand. Pepenode is a new crypto project that’s already raised over $2.3 million despite the crypto market losing over $1.2 trillion of its value this Q4. It’s a game where you can mine coins without needing expensive hardware setups. You play the game in your web browser, set up virtual mining rigs, and upgrade your facilities to earn PEPENODE tokens . The project is copying PEPE’s success strategy, which contributed to its 1,000x rally during the 2023-24 run when Bitcoin broke out from bear market lows. Now that more people are buying Pepenode’s mining rigs, the presale price is going up very fast. To join the presale before the ongoing round sells out: Go to the official Pepenode website . Connect a crypto wallet like Best Wallet , and buy PEPENODE tokens for $0.0011968. Then pay with crypto using ETH or USDT, or use a bank card in just a few clicks.

XRP has still been pulling in institutional investment as well as regulated investment products, yet the market price is being held in a range around significant support areas. At the same time, those involved in crypto investing who are looking for what crypto to buy are increasingly looking at opportunities in the early stages of DeFi that are priced below $0.05. One such top crypto that is getting this type of rotation is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is a new crypto that is priced below $0.05. XRP Price Compression Despite Broadening Access XRP is trading around $2.02, just above the support level of $2.00. The inflows of capital into its market have continued to accumulate, with $16.42 million of net inflows registered, as it marked the 19th day of positive rotation. Despite this regular pattern of rotation, the movement of XRP remains stagnant. While the launch of the 21Shares spot XRP ETF with a TOXR ticker symbol broadens the regulated framework, it still does not prompt an immediate repricing of assets. More infrastructure development is also expanding, as Ripple Labs received conditional support for trust bank operations, paving the way for other services such as custody for RLUSD cash management. This situation prompts some players to look for top crypto to buy today that provide better short-term gain. Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the solutions that is gaining traction as traders shift attention from large-cap indexing to fill a need for a cheap crypto with good mechanics of taking the upside. The current presale amount is $19,500,000, while Total MUTM Holders since presale began is 18,500. Currently, Phase 6 is 98% filled, leaving a small window of opportunity for acquisition at the current price of $0.035. This is despite it being 250%, or 3.5 times, higher since Phase 1 at $0.01. Phase 6 is selling out quickly, but once slots are allocated, Phase 7 opens at $0.04—a steep 20% change. When launching the MUTM token, the initial selling price will be triggered at $0.06, which translates to a potential gain of 410% for the initial investors. Despite the limited slots left for $0.035, urgency is setting in for traders trying to decide the best crypto to buy this month of December. Mutuum Finance Leaderboard Mutuum Finance has also been promoting engagement through a live dashboard that displays the top 50 holders in real-time. A 24-hour leaderboard that is rotated daily has also brought a bit of healthy competition to presales for participation. The number one ranked participant for each day is given a $500 bonus for MUTM, as long as there is a transaction made within that 24 hour period. This is achieved by a reset of the leaderboard each day at 00:00 UTC. This is a step that takes Mutuum Finance closer to more traders looking for the current best crypto to buy. Stablecoin Vision Mutuum Finance is also defining a more long-term utility chain that focuses on developing a decentralized stablecoin that is backed by over-collaterized assets. These assets are then aimed at integrating directly with the lending and borrowing system of the Mutuum Finance protocol. Security preparation is still active, with an independent audit currently being carried out by Halborn Security to examine the final lending/borrowing terms. These developments continue to position Mutuum Finance correctly as a new type of cryptocurrency with emphasis on delivery and growth rather than timing. While XRP investors remain ready for a matching price with adoption, funds have been transitioning to more reasonably priced investments with better catalysts. Mutuum Finance has been among the key players that investors appear to be searching for in regard to which crypto investment to make as phase 6 draws closer to completion. Investors seeking the best crypto investment before the end of the year have been reacting to the shorter timeframe.

Central to this discussion are comments made by Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, who outlined a vision in which Ripple’s technology could complement established systems such as SWIFT . While these statements were made years ago, they continue to shape how some analysts evaluate XRP’s possible role in global finance and its implications for price. Ripple’s Original Position on Legacy Payment Networks In a 2015 interview with Global Finance Magazine, Larsen, then Ripple’s chief executive, described the company’s strategic approach to international payments. He emphasized that Ripple was not designed to dismantle legacy financial rails like SWIFT or ACH. Instead, Ripple aimed to function as an interoperability layer capable of connecting different financial networks while enabling faster settlement. Larsen contrasted this approach with earlier blockchain models, particularly Bitcoin. While acknowledging Bitcoin’s innovation in enabling peer-to-peer transfers without centralized intermediaries, he argued that its structure posed challenges for institutional use. According to Larsen, Bitcoin either requires universal adoption as a single currency or forced constant conversion between digital assets and national currencies, exposing users to foreign exchange risk. In his view, these limitations made Bitcoin less practical for large financial institutions operating across multiple currencies. Ripple’s solution, as Larsen explained, focused on providing a neutral settlement layer that could facilitate real-time value transfer between existing systems. Under this model, Ripple’s technology, and by extension XRP, could operate alongside SWIFT’s messaging framework rather than replacing it. Revisiting the XRP–SWIFT Discussion More than a decade later, members of the XRP community have revisited Larsen’s comments as debates around blockchain integration within traditional finance intensify. Market analyst Chart Nerd recently highlighted the potential scale of such cooperation by referencing SWIFT’s operational footprint. According to publicly available data cited by the analyst, SWIFT supports approximately 40,000 payment corridors and facilitates an estimated $150 trillion in cross-border transaction value annually. This scale has prompted renewed discussion about what role XRP could play if it were used as a liquidity bridge within or alongside SWIFT-connected payment flows. While there is no indication that such an integration is imminent, the hypothetical scenario has attracted attention due to its potential impact on demand for XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Hypothetical Price Estimates and Underlying Assumptions To explore this possibility, some commentators have turned to scenario-based projections. In one such exercise, Google’s Gemini AI model suggested that if XRP were adopted as a key liquidity asset within SWIFT-related settlement processes, its valuation dynamics would change significantly. Under that assumption, XRP would transition from being primarily speculative to serving a functional role within global financial infrastructure. Based on this premise, Gemini estimated a theoretical price range between $80 and $120 per XRP. The projection assumed that XRP would capture a meaningful share of the liquidity required to support a substantial portion of the $150 trillion in annual cross-border flows. It is important to note that this estimate is purely hypothetical and depends on multiple variables, including adoption levels, regulatory clarity, and liquidity distribution. Current Developments and Practical Constraints Despite ongoing speculation, recent developments suggest that SWIFT is pursuing its own blockchain-based initiatives without direct involvement from XRP. In late 2024, SWIFT announced plans to conduct live trials for digital asset and currency transactions, emphasizing interoperability across tokenized assets, stablecoins, and central bank digital currencies. These efforts expanded further in 2025 with the introduction of a shared digital ledger developed in collaboration with major banks and blockchain firms. As a result, while the concept of XRP operating alongside SWIFT remains a topic of discussion, there is currently no confirmation that such cooperation will materialize. Any price projections tied to this scenario should therefore be viewed as exploratory rather than predictive, reflecting potential outcomes rather than established trajectories.

The activity surge comes as on-chain and options metrics suggest investors are repositioning for a more active market environment. The exchange is on track to set new records across spot and derivatives markets in 2025, even as traders continue to price uncertainty in the crypto market. Binance leads, others follow Source: CryptoQuant Crypto inflows into Binance hit $1.17 trillion in 2025, representing a 31% increase year on year. The inflow, which widens the gulf between Binance and other exchanges, coincided with the platform surpassing 300 million registered users. Coinbase comes second after Binance with respect to crypto inflows, seeing $946 billion in 2025, which is a 30% increase from the previous year. Source: CryptoQuant Binance spot trading volume is projected to reach about $7 trillion by year-end, nearly five times that of its closest competitor, Bybit. According to CryptoQuant, “the total number of spot trades reached a new all-time high of 24.1 billion in 2025, up 4% year over year and more than 3x higher than in 2022.” Binance also posted a record high this year in the total number of perpetual futures trades, which reached 49.6 billion, 33% above last year’s record high of 37.3 billion trades. The platform’s perpetual futures volume has already exceeded $24.6 trillion, more than double the volume of OKX. Source: CryptoQuant Julio, Head of Research at CryptoQuant, pointed out that this current boost in activity metrics indicates “sustained growth in user activity throughout the current bull cycle.” By June 2025, Binance had captured 41.1% of global spot volume, maintaining a market share of 39.8% among centralized exchanges the following month. Market uncertainty drives hedging activity The renewed focus on liquidity comes as volatility shows signs of returning after a stable six-month period. Glasnode analysis indicates that during a sharp drawdown in the market several weeks ago, risk hedging activity increased substantially, with elevated put demand as Bitcoin prices moved into the low-$80,000 range. Source: Glassnode on X While market conditions have stabilized, and expectations for extreme moves have moderated, “implied volatility remains elevated relative to the exceptionally low-volatility regime observed over the prior six months, suggesting a shift toward a more active volatility environment,” according to Glassnode. Large centralized exchanges tend to benefit when volatility rises, as hedging, arbitrage, and high-frequency strategies all rely on deep and continuous liquidity. Binance’s scale across spot and perpetual futures markets places it at the center of that activity. The concentration of liquidity on Binance highlights a structural feature of crypto markets, which is that liquidity tends to pool where liquidity already exists. Other exchanges continue to play important roles in specific regions or product niches, and institutional activity on regulated venues remains influential for benchmark pricing.

Decentralized exchange leader PancakeSwap and venture studio YZi Labs, who are co-incubating the initiative, announced the project on social media today. A Frictionless Forecast Platform According to the announcement posts, Probable is looking to distinguish itself in the prediction market space with a commitment to simplicity and cost structure, and will operate with zero prediction fees from its first day. “Probable delivers true zero-fee predictions,” the team wrote in a Medium post. “No platform fees, no hidden charges.” It plans to support wagers on cryptocurrency price movements, global events, sports, and niche regional occurrences, settling all markets fully on-chain for transparency. To operate , users can deposit various assets, which the system will automatically convert to USDT for placing forecasts. “We believe prediction markets should be simple, transparent, and open to everyone,” stated the team on X. “Probable is built to make on-chain predictions faster, easier, and more accessible.” The new platform will depend on UMA’s Optimistic Oracle for verifying real-world event outcomes, a system designed to provide tamper-resistant results. PancakeSwap’s involvement provides immediate visibility and credibility, connecting the new service to its large user base. BNB Chain founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao acknowledged the launch, as he commented on the growing number of prediction markets on the network. The Growing Race to Predict the Future Probable is the latest entrant in a sector that is attracting substantial attention and capital. The space has seen notable developments in recent months, pointing to increased mainstream and institutional interest. Earlier in the year, Kalshi, one of the more well-known platforms, secured $185 million in funding led by Paradigm, which pushed its valuation to $2 billion. More recently, the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which owns the New York Stock Exchange, announced an investment of up to $2 billion in the decentralized platform Polymarket, alongside serving as the global distributor of its event-driven data. Additionally, in late October, Trump Media’s Truth Social and Crypto.com revealed plans to bring prediction markets to a social media audience, demonstrating the widening appeal of the concept. At the time, Crypto.com co-founder and CEO Kris Marszalek forecasted that prediction markets had the potential to become “a multi-deca-billion dollar industry.” The post PancakeSwap, YZi Labs Launch Zero-Fee Prediction Market on BNB Chain appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|BNB Chain|PancakeSwap,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-12-16 23:45:30

This breakdown could point to a bearish XRP price prediction , suggesting bulls may be on the verge of capitulation. Adding to the sell-off, long liquidations surged to $584 million , showing just how many traders were blindsided by the latest dip. The market had been finding support at this key psychological price level for days, but buying interest was weak and failed to ignite a rally despite efforts by bulls to defend this zone. Trading volumes have doubled in the past day as well, currently standing at $3.9 billion. This implies strong selling pressure following this bearish breakout. Despite the drop, XRP-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have attracted positive net inflows for 21 consecutive days now, reflecting strong interest from institutional buyers and long-term holders in the regulated markets. XRP Price Prediction: Break Below $1.86 Could Result in Another 10% Drop Heading to the charts, the 4-hour time frame shows that a break below the $2 level with strong volumes occurred yesterday. This quickly triggered a stronger drop toward the next area of support at $1.86. Source: TradingView Bulls are now trying to defend this mark as a move below could result in a drop to the token’s October 10 lows of $1.58. This translates into a downside risk of 10% in the near term. Notably, however, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has hit extreme oversold levels at 21.5 in this lower time frame. The last two times this has happened, the price recovered slightly. However, a break below $1.86 would mean that the market is ready to resume its downtrend.

This strategic acquisition, reported by The Block, is far more than a simple business transaction. It represents a calculated expansion of Anchorage’s core services, directly targeting the complex needs of institutional clients navigating the digital asset space. The financial details remain confidential, but the strategic intent is crystal clear: to build an unrivaled, full-service platform for managing digital wealth. Why Did Anchorage Digital Acquire Hedgey? The acquisition of Hedgey is a direct response to a critical pain point in the crypto industry: managing token vesting schedules and distributions at scale. For startups, DAOs, and investment firms, administering these programs manually is error-prone and inefficient. By integrating Hedgey’s specialized technology, Anchorage Digital can now offer a seamless, automated solution. This move perfectly complements their recent purchase of Securitize For Advisors, painting a picture of a company aggressively assembling a comprehensive asset management toolkit. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Banking Landscape? This acquisition fundamentally strengthens Anchorage Digital’s position. It transforms the firm from a premier digital asset custodian into a holistic service provider. Clients can now potentially manage the entire lifecycle of their digital assets in one place—from secure custody and trading to complex distribution and compliance. For the broader market, it underscores a significant trend: the race to provide “crypto infrastructure as a service” to institutions is intensifying. The deal highlights several key benefits: Streamlined Operations: Combines secure custody with automated token management. Enhanced Compliance: Built-in tools for managing regulatory and tax reporting around vesting. Competitive Edge: Creates a unique, end-to-end offering that is difficult for competitors to match immediately. What Are the Challenges and Opportunities Ahead? However, successful integration is the next hurdle. Merging different company cultures and technology stacks smoothly is crucial. Furthermore, Anchorage Digital must clearly communicate this expanded value proposition to its existing and potential clients. The opportunity, though, is immense. By solving the tedious problem of token management, they remove a major barrier to entry for traditional institutions. This could accelerate the adoption of tokenized equity, real-world assets (RWAs), and more sophisticated DeFi strategies within a regulated framework. Conclusion: A Defining Move for Institutional Crypto The decision by Anchorage Digital to acquire Hedgey is a masterstroke in vertical integration. It’s not just about growing their business; it’s about shaping the very infrastructure that will support the next wave of institutional capital flowing into digital assets. By addressing a niche but critical operational challenge, they are building a moat around their services and setting a new standard for what a crypto bank can be. This move signals that the industry’s future winners will be those who provide the most robust, secure, and comprehensive platforms. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does Hedgey actually do? A: Hedgey provides smart contract-based software that automates the creation, management, and execution of token vesting schedules and distributions for companies and DAOs. Q: Why is this acquisition important for Anchorage Digital clients? A: Clients gain access to integrated, automated tools for managing token-based compensation, investor distributions, and other complex asset flows directly within Anchorage’s secure banking environment. Q: Were the financial terms of Anchorage Digital acquiring Hedgey disclosed? A: No, the specific financial details of the deal were not made public. Q: How does this relate to Anchorage’s purchase of Securitize For Advisors? A: Both acquisitions are part of a strategy to expand asset management services. Securitize focuses on digital securities, while Hedgey focuses on token utility and distribution, together creating a broader suite. Q: What is the main benefit for the crypto industry? A: It provides a more professional, regulated, and efficient framework for institutions to manage digital assets, potentially encouraging greater mainstream adoption.

This substantial movement follows Bitmain’s recent $321 million Ethereum purchase, creating significant speculation about the mining giant’s strategic intentions. What Does This Massive Bitmain ETH Withdrawal Mean? The transaction involved 48,049 ETH moving from FalconX to addresses 0x9a93 and 0x611f, which blockchain analytics platform Onchain Lens has linked to Bitmain (BMNR). This Bitmain ETH withdrawal represents one of the largest single movements of Ethereum by a corporate entity in recent months. The timing is particularly noteworthy, occurring just one week after Bitmain’s substantial acquisition of Ethereum. Several key aspects make this transaction significant: The sheer scale of the withdrawal – $141.78 million represents substantial market liquidity The timing relative to Bitmain’s recent $321 million ETH purchase The use of institutional exchange FalconX rather than retail platforms The potential implications for Ethereum’s price and market dynamics Why Is Bitmain Moving So Much Ethereum? Understanding the motivation behind this Bitmain ETH withdrawal requires examining Bitmain’s position in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As the world’s largest manufacturer of cryptocurrency mining hardware, Bitmain has traditionally focused on Bitcoin mining. However, their recent Ethereum activities suggest a strategic diversification. Several possibilities exist for this substantial movement: Cold storage transfer : Moving assets from exchange custody to more secure private wallets Strategic allocation : Repositioning assets for future staking or DeFi participation Corporate treasury management : Optimizing their cryptocurrency holdings portfolio Preparatory move : Setting up for future transactions or corporate actions How Does This Impact the Ethereum Market? The Bitmain ETH withdrawal from FalconX represents more than just a large transaction – it signals institutional behavior that can influence market sentiment. When major players like Bitmain make substantial moves, the market often interprets these actions as signals about future price direction or strategic importance. Market analysts are watching several potential impacts: Reduced exchange liquidity could increase price volatility Institutional confidence in Ethereum as a store of value Potential for reduced selling pressure if assets move to cold storage Increased attention to Ethereum from other institutional investors Moreover, this transaction demonstrates the growing sophistication of corporate cryptocurrency management. Companies like Bitmain are no longer simply holding assets – they’re actively managing them across different platforms and strategies. What Can We Learn From This Transaction? The Bitmain ETH withdrawal provides valuable insights into current cryptocurrency market dynamics. First, it highlights the continued institutional interest in Ethereum despite market fluctuations. Second, it demonstrates how major players utilize specialized platforms like FalconX for large transactions. Finally, it shows the importance of on-chain analytics in understanding market movements. For investors and market observers, several lessons emerge: Large transactions often precede significant market movements Institutional behavior provides clues about market sentiment Exchange flows offer valuable data about supply dynamics Corporate cryptocurrency strategies are becoming increasingly sophisticated The Bottom Line on Bitmain’s Ethereum Strategy This substantial Bitmain ETH withdrawal from FalconX represents more than just a large transaction – it’s a statement about institutional confidence in Ethereum’s future. While the exact motivation remains speculative, the movement of $141.78 million in Ethereum by one of cryptocurrency’s most influential companies cannot be ignored. The transaction reinforces several key trends in cryptocurrency markets: growing institutional participation, sophisticated asset management strategies, and the increasing importance of Ethereum in corporate treasuries. As the market continues to mature, movements like this Bitmain ETH withdrawal will become more common but no less significant for understanding market dynamics. Frequently Asked Questions What is Bitmain and why is their ETH withdrawal significant? Bitmain is the world’s largest manufacturer of cryptocurrency mining hardware. Their $141.8 million ETH withdrawal is significant because it represents substantial institutional movement that can influence market sentiment and liquidity. How was Bitmain identified as the owner of these addresses? Blockchain analytics platform Onchain Lens identified patterns linking addresses 0x9a93 and 0x611f to Bitmain based on transaction history, wallet behavior, and correlation with known Bitmain activities. Why would Bitmain withdraw ETH from an exchange? Common reasons include moving to more secure cold storage, preparing for staking or DeFi participation, corporate treasury management, or strategic portfolio reallocation. How does this affect Ethereum’s price? Large withdrawals can reduce exchange liquidity, potentially increasing price volatility. However, movement to cold storage often reduces immediate selling pressure, which could be supportive for prices. What is FalconX and why do institutions use it? FalconX is an institutional cryptocurrency exchange offering large-scale trading, custody solutions, and credit services tailored for corporate and institutional clients. Should retail investors follow Bitmain’s moves? While institutional moves provide valuable market signals, retail investors should consider multiple factors and conduct their own research rather than blindly following large transactions.

Related Reading: Crypto Market Structure Bill Stalled: Senate Banking Committee Pushes Markup To Early 2026 What many investors had hoped would be a closing act for regulatory clarity in 2025 instead became another extension of uncertainty, triggering risk-off behavior across digital assets and related investment products. The delay arrived at a fragile moment for markets grappling with growing sensitivity to policy signals from Washington. Bitcoin slid below the $86,000 level, while the broader digital asset market shed roughly $140 billion in capitalization within hours. The total market value has fallen to around $2.93 trillion, its lowest level in several weeks, as traders reassessed regulatory timelines that now extend into early 2026. Senate Pushes Crypto Market Structure Talks Into 2026 The Senate Banking Committee confirmed it will not hold a markup hearing on the crypto market structure bill before Congress adjourns for the holidays. While committee leadership says bipartisan negotiations are progressing, lawmakers acknowledged that time has run out to move the bill forward in 2025. Chairman Tim Scott’s office reiterated that discussions with Democratic counterparts are ongoing, with a markup now expected in early 2026. The proposed legislation is designed to clarify how digital assets are regulated in the U.S., including defining the respective roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Under current drafts, the CFTC would oversee spot crypto markets, while securities laws would be more clearly applied to token issuers and intermediaries. Parallel efforts in the Senate Agriculture Committee, which also oversees the CFTC, have yet to reach a markup stage, further slowing the process. Market Reaction Highlights Fragile Sentiment The legislative setback quickly translated into market pressure. Bitcoin fell from near $90,000 to the mid-$85,000 range, while Ethereum dropped below $3,000. Additionally, the average crypto RSI fell to around 32, indicating that the market is within oversold territory. Analysts pointed to elevated derivatives positioning and heavy open interest around key price levels as factors amplifying downside moves. Exchange-traded products reflected the shift, with Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs recording significant outflows as institutional investors reduced exposure. Some market observers noted that unrealized losses have risen sharply, while funding conditions and leverage remain stretched, making prices more vulnerable to negative catalysts such as policy delays. Regulatory Uncertainty Persists Despite Agency Actions Despite the legislative pause, regulators have continued to act within existing frameworks. The SEC has issued staff guidance and hosted public discussions on how current securities laws apply to crypto activities, while the CFTC has taken steps to expand supervised spot market participation. However, industry participants say these measures fall short of the comprehensive clarity the market structure bill is meant to deliver.

55896297,https://timestabloid.com/?p=92528,1765929638,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Dark Defender Highlights Why XRP Will Pump, Sets Price Target",https://timestabloid.com/dark-defender-highlights-why-xrp-will-pump-sets-price-target/,"Market analyst Dark Defender, who previously anticipated XRP’s decline toward the $1.88 level, has released a fresh outlook suggesting that the asset may now be positioned for a strong recovery. According to his latest assessment, XRP has completed a corrective phase within its broader Elliott Wave structure and could be entering a new impulsive move. Dark Defender’s analysis is rooted in Elliott Wave theory, which he applies to XRP’s long-term market structure. He argues that the token has finalized its fourth wave on the monthly timeframe, a phase typically marked by consolidation rather than trend reversal. With this stage now complete, his framework points to the emergence of Wave 5, which he associates with renewed upward momentum. People who say the bear market has started will switch and can't believe the market behaviour shortly after BTC.D lose strength, and the narrative will continue to shift in favour of #XRP . We have been literally following the Wave 4 since 13 February. We set $1.88, and XRP… https://t.co/SpQzMtQXn7 — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) December 15, 2025 Corrective Phase and Market Sentiment The analyst has tracked the development of Wave 4 since February 2025, outlining a clear internal structure throughout the correction. XRP first declined toward the $1.60 area in April, followed by a rebound to approximately $3.66 in July, before the final leg of the correction concluded near $1.88. During this period, Dark Defender repeatedly urged market participants to disregard fear-driven narratives. He cautioned that heightened uncertainty and negative sentiment often emerge during corrective phases, even when broader technical structures remain intact. In his view, such FUD tends to obscure underlying trend signals rather than reflect genuine structural weakness. He previously identified a critical support band between roughly $1.88 and $2.22, noting that sustained interaction with this range would be key to confirming the end of the corrective cycle. XRP’s recent stabilization near the lower boundary of this zone, followed by a modest rebound, is interpreted as confirmation that Wave 4 has concluded. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Outlook Moving Forward Despite ongoing volatility, Dark Defender maintains that the broader bullish structure remains valid. His assessment combines Elliott Wave principles with Fibonacci retracement levels, framing the recent pullback as a technically healthy correction rather than the onset of a bear market. While XRP continues to experience short-term price pressure, trading near $1.88 after daily, weekly, and monthly declines, the analyst argues that these movements do not invalidate the larger setup. Instead, he views them as typical of transition phases between corrective and impulsive waves. Based on this framework, Dark Defender projects that the next advance could carry XRP toward the $5.85 level , representing a gain of more than 200% from current prices. He emphasizes that this target is derived from historical wave behavior and structural analysis, not short-term speculation.

Related Reading: Ethereum Meets Wall Street: JPMorgan Rolls Out Tokenized Fund The report lays out 10 key investing themes for 2026 and ties the Bitcoin call to two main forces: growing portfolio demand for stores of value and what Grayscale describes as improving regulatory clarity. Spot-Bitcoin ETPs reached the market in 2024, the firm notes, and Congress passed the GENIUS Act in 2025, steps that the report says reduce barriers for big investors. Macro Risks And Demand For Crypto Grayscale frames its outlook around a simple macro point. Rising public debt and the risk that fiat currencies lose buying power are pushing some money toward Bitcoin and Ether, the report says. That argument will sound familiar to many institutional buyers. It is also a broad claim. No exact price targets were offered for Bitcoin, only a view that valuations will climb in 2026 and that the so-called four-year cycle may be ending. Stablecoins are another major theme. Grayscale expects stablecoin use to grow: cross-border payments, collateral on derivatives, even use on corporate balance sheets are all mentioned as likely developments. Asset Tokenization And DeFi Growth Reports have disclosed that Grayscale sees asset tokenization reaching an inflection point next year. Lending protocols and staking are singled out as areas where activity could expand. The firm foresees practical outcomes: stablecoins in payment rails, more institutional access to staking, and tokenized assets showing up in trading and custody systems. Grayscale also flags two narratives it does not expect to move markets in 2026 — quantum computing risk for crypto and digital asset treasuries — saying research will continue but valuations are unlikely to be affected this soon.

MetaX Integrated Circuits Shanghai Co. will commence trading in its home city after raising $585.8 million in an initial public offering that was 2,986 times oversubscribed on the retail portion. It attracted even higher demand than Moore Threads, whose shares were oversubscribed by 2,750 times in its IPO. MetaX’s listing follows an incredibly strong investor response, reflecting surging enthusiasm for domestic players in the global race for artificial intelligence computing power . AI Chip market heats up as MetaX targets Nvidia rivals MetaX manufactures graphics processing units for artificial intelligence developers similar to Moore Threads. The trend is a growing industry and expanding at a rapid clip as consumers and businesses adopt AI services. The stock is expected to attract investors who weren’t lucky enough to get an allotment in the notoriously tough IPO lottery. Moore Threads climbed more than 500% in eight trading sessions since its debut, with the stock rising five times in just its opening day of trading. Investors are betting on national champions who could seem like legitimate local rivals to global leader Nvidia Corp., whose most cutting-edge chips are blocked by the US from being sold to China. Worth 104.66 yuan per share at its IPO, MetaX will open at a market capitalization of 41.8 billion yuan ($6 billion), significantly below Moore Threads’ current valuation of 341 billion yuan. MetaX’s price-to-sales ratio stands at 56.4, compared with an average of 127.4 for peer companies like Cambricon Technologies Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., according to the company’s exchange filing. “If we use Moore and Cambricon’s market caps as a yardstick, then MetaX might have a 10-12 times upside potential,” said Xu Dawei, a fund manager at Jintong Private Fund Management in Beijing. “MetaX’s listing may potentially spearhead a rally in tech stocks and create more excitement around new and secondary listings.” Chinese tech listings draw investors amid record oversubscriptions MetaX’s roots can be found at AMD , with three of its founding members having previously worked for the US chipmaker. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Chen Weiliang is one of those. A Chinese company that designs and sells GPUs for AI workloads and graphics rendering in gaming and other visualization applications. Its AI-focused Xiyun C500 series, which the company claimed was comparable to Nvidia’s A100, made up almost 98% of total revenue in 2024. The new generation, called C588, has significantly narrowed the performance gap with Nvidia’s H100, according to MetaX. Last year, MetaX captured approximately 1% of China’s AI chip market, according to the company’s prospectus, which cites data from an industry consultancy. Chinese IPOs have been robust this year, with an average first-day trading jump of 250%, according to Bloomberg data. That has at least partly been because Chinese officials have been quelling issuances to prevent sapping liquidity in the broader market. At the same time, a softer risk appetite in the secondary market and year-end profit-taking have also increased interest in new offerings, which are seen as a reliable opportunity to capture gains in the first few days of trading. Radio frequency chipmaker Beijing Onmicro Electronics Co. more than doubled on its debut on Tuesday, after filing in a 2,899-times oversubscribed IPO. Changxin Memory Technologies Inc. and Yangtze Memory Technologies Co. are among chipmakers that could consider listing in China. They could each seek a valuation of 200 billion yuan to 300 billion yuan. In Hong Kong, too, a swarm of companies in the AI space is gearing up for market debuts. MiniMax and Zhipu, backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Tencent Holdings Ltd., and others, aim to complete their IPOs as soon as January.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a crucial barometer for investor psychology, has inched up five points to 16. However, this small rise doesn’t signal a shift in the overall mood. The market remains firmly in the grip of extreme fear . For investors, understanding this index is more than just watching a number—it’s about reading the market’s emotional pulse to make smarter decisions. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does It Matter? Think of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as the market’s mood ring. It quantifies the collective emotion driving cryptocurrency prices on a scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 screams ‘Extreme Fear,’ while 100 shouts ‘Extreme Greed.’ Currently sitting at 16, the index tells a clear story: fear is the dominant force. This metric matters because extreme fear often creates potential buying opportunities, while extreme greed can signal a market top. It helps you look beyond price charts to understand the ‘why’ behind the moves. How is the Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The index isn’t based on a gut feeling. Alternative.me uses a data-driven formula combining several market factors. Here’s the breakdown: Volatility (25%): Sharp price swings, especially downward, increase fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): High trading volume during downturns amplifies fear signals. Social Media (15%): The tone and volume of conversations on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Polls and community sentiment checks. Dominance (10%): Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Rising dominance can indicate a ‘flight to safety.’ Trends (10%): Google search volume for related terms. This multi-source approach ensures the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reflects a comprehensive, real-time snapshot of market psychology. What Does a Score of ‘Extreme Fear’ Mean for Your Portfolio? A reading of 16 in the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone is a powerful signal. Historically, prolonged periods of extreme fear have often preceded significant market rallies, as weak hands sell and value investors step in. However, it is not a standalone ‘buy’ signal. You must consider it alongside fundamental analysis and your personal risk tolerance. This environment demands caution but also presents a chance to research fundamentally strong projects that may be undervalued due to the negative sentiment captured by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. Actionable Insights in a Fearful Market Navigating a market ruled by fear requires a disciplined strategy. First, avoid making panic-driven decisions. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool for perspective, not a crystal ball. Second, consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to build positions gradually, reducing the impact of volatility. Third, use this time to review and rebalance your portfolio, ensuring it aligns with your long-term goals. Remember, the crowd is often most fearful near potential bottoms. Conclusion: Reading Between the Lines of Market Sentiment The recent uptick in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 16 is a minor relief in a sea of anxiety. It highlights that while fear persists, small shifts in sentiment are occurring. For the astute investor, this index provides critical context. It reminds us that markets are driven by human emotion as much as by technology and fundamentals. By understanding these emotional extremes, you can strive to be fearful when others are greedy and greedy only when others are fearful. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Where can I check the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A: The index is published daily on websites like Alternative.me. Many major crypto news platforms also feature it. Q: Is the Fear & Greed Index a reliable timing tool for buying or selling? A: No, it should not be used alone for timing trades. It is a sentiment indicator best used alongside technical and fundamental analysis to gauge overall market psychology. Q: Has the index ever been wrong? A: Like any indicator, it is not infallible. It reflects current sentiment, which can remain ‘extreme’ for extended periods during prolonged bear markets or bubbles. Q: Does it only track Bitcoin? A> While Bitcoin is a major component (via its dominance metric), the index aims to measure sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market. Q: What is considered a ‘neutral’ score on the index? A: A score around 50 is generally considered neutral, indicating a balance between fear and greed. Found this breakdown of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index helpful?

The asset management fund manages over $15 billion in client assets over 30 investment products. The Chief Investment Officer of Bitwise, Matt Hougan and Head of Research, Ryan Rasmussen aired bullish sentiments about crypto, saying that demand from institutional investors in the long term will be more than the new supply. New supply refers to new tokens entering into circulation through either mining, staking rewards or protocol issuance. They also highlighted institutional adoption and more mature regulations as the main drivers. What’s Bitwise predicting for crypto in 2026? In a recent publication where it made predictions about the crypto market, Bitwise said the supply of BTC, ETH, and SOL will be outpaced by institutional demand for crypto ETFs. This can cause a supply squeeze for the three most popular crypto assets, which should result in positive price action. However, Bitwise cautioned that this is just a prediction, not a guarantee. Crypto ETFs are seeing massive adoption, with traditional financial institutions like Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch giving their wealth management customers an opportunity to add crypto to their portfolios. Since the launch of Bitcoin ETFs in 2024, ETFs have purchased 710,777 Bitcoins, almost double the 363,047 Bitcoins that have been mined in the same time frame, signalling a higher demand than supply. Bitwise also predicted that over 100 crypto ETFs will launch in the US in 2026, giving investors more options to invest. Bitcoin to break four-year cycle Bitwise also made a prediction that Bitcoin is going to break its four-year cycle in 2026 as more institutional capital flows into the crypto market. Historically, BTC’s price has been tied to several factors, including halving events and retail speculation. However, Bitwise expects institutional funds, such as spot Bitcoin ETFs to become a dominant force shaping the market. The investment manager credits regulatory approvals for the growth and adoption of crypto ETFs. In 2025, the SEC made it a point of emphasis to streamline the listing process for spot crypto ETFs, significantly cutting down on approval timelines and creating a clearer, repeatable framework for issuers. Since then, Bitcoin and crypto ETFs have gone from niche products into mainstream portfolio-building products. Bitwise believes Bitcoin’s price behavior could begin to resemble that of a mature macro asset rather than a purely cyclical trade, bringing an end to the four-year cycle.

That’s the vision driving a pivotal shift in Canada’s cryptocurrency landscape. The Bank of Canada has announced a decisive move: starting in 2026, it will only approve high-quality fiat-pegged stablecoins . This regulation aims to transform these digital assets into trustworthy monetary instruments, marking a significant step in the maturation of crypto markets. What Does Canada’s New Stablecoin Policy Mean? In simple terms, Canada is setting a high bar for digital currency stability. The forthcoming rules, reported by sources like Cointelegraph, mandate that for a stablecoin to receive regulatory approval, it must be securely pegged to the Canadian dollar or another reputable fiat currency. Therefore, only assets that can reliably maintain a 1:1 value with traditional money will be greenlit. This move directly targets the volatility and reserve transparency issues that have plagued some stablecoin projects globally. Why is Canada Focusing on Fiat-Pegged Stablecoins? The Bank of Canada’s strategy is clear: prioritize safety and reliability in the emerging digital economy. By endorsing only fiat-pegged stablecoins , regulators aim to protect consumers and ensure financial system integrity. Let’s break down the core benefits of this approach: Consumer Protection: Users gain confidence that their digital currency holds a predictable, government-backed value. Financial Stability: It prevents the systemic risks posed by unstable algorithmic or commodity-backed stablecoins. Clear Regulation: It provides a straightforward framework for crypto businesses to operate within. Mainstream Adoption: Reliability is key for businesses and individuals to use crypto for everyday transactions. What Challenges Lie Ahead for This Policy? However, this path is not without its hurdles. The policy, while promoting stability, could limit innovation by excluding other models of stable digital assets. Moreover, defining “high-quality” reserves and ensuring constant, transparent audits will be a complex task for regulators. The global nature of cryptocurrency also poses a challenge, as users might simply access unregulated, international stablecoins instead. How Will This Impact Crypto Investors and Users in Canada? For anyone involved with crypto in Canada, this is a call to prepare. After 2026, the landscape for fiat-pegged stablecoins will be more structured but also more restrictive. Investors should scrutinize the reserve backing of any stablecoin they use. Developers and crypto firms must align their products with the coming fiat-peg requirement. Ultimately, this policy could make Canadian-approved stablecoins a global benchmark for safety. Actionable Insights for Navigating the New Rules You don’t have to wait until 2026 to adapt. Start by researching stablecoin projects that already emphasize full fiat collateral and regular, public audits. Furthermore, diversify your crypto holdings to avoid over-reliance on any single asset class. Stay informed on the Bank of Canada’s evolving guidance to ensure full compliance and capitalize on the new opportunities that regulated fiat-pegged stablecoins will create. In conclusion, Canada’s 2026 mandate is a landmark decision that prioritizes stability over unchecked innovation. By anchoring digital currency to traditional fiat, the country is building a bridge between the old financial world and the new. This bold move promises a safer environment for users and could set a powerful precedent for global cryptocurrency regulation, proving that trust is the most valuable asset in finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are fiat-pegged stablecoins? Fiat-pegged stablecoins are digital cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by being backed one-to-one by a reserve of traditional government-issued currency, like the Canadian or US dollar. When do Canada’s new stablecoin rules take effect? The regulations are scheduled to take effect in 2026, giving the market and regulators time to prepare for the transition. Will existing stablecoins be banned in Canada after 2026? The policy applies to regulatory *approval*. It likely means that only Bank of Canada-approved, fiat-pegged stablecoins will be officially recognized for certain regulated activities, but accessing other stablecoins may still be possible through international platforms. How does this protect Canadian crypto users? It ensures that approved stablecoins are fully backed by reliable reserves, reducing the risk of a sudden loss in value—a problem seen in some unbacked or algorithmically stabilized coins. What is the Bank of Canada’s main goal with this policy? Its primary goal is to ensure stablecoins can function as safe and reliable digital monetary instruments within the Canadian financial system, protecting consumers and maintaining economic stability. Could this policy stifle cryptocurrency innovation? Some critics argue it might, by favoring one model over others. However, proponents believe that establishing a foundation of trust through fiat-pegged stablecoins is necessary for broader, long-term innovation and adoption.

The widely watched Altcoin Season Index has taken a notable hit, falling four points to a reading of just 18. This drop suggests Bitcoin is tightening its grip on the market, potentially squeezing out alternative cryptocurrencies. But what does this index really measure, and should you be concerned about your altcoin holdings? Let’s break down the implications. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Actually Tell Us? Maintained by CoinMarketCap, the Altcoin Season Index is a crucial thermometer for the crypto market’s health. It doesn’t measure absolute prices. Instead, it tracks a simple but powerful comparison: how the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) perform against Bitcoin over a rolling 90-day window. The core question it answers is: are altcoins collectively beating the king, or is Bitcoin reigning supreme? The index operates on a clear threshold system. When 75% of these top altcoins outperform Bitcoin, an “ altcoin season ” is officially declared—a period often marked by explosive, broad-based rallies across the crypto board. Conversely, if most altcoins lag behind, we’re in a “Bitcoin season.” A score of 100 signals a strong altcoin season, while a low score like 18 points firmly toward Bitcoin dominance. Why Has the Index Fallen to a Reading of 18? A drop from 22 to 18 might seem small, but in the context of this index, it’s a significant move. This decline indicates that fewer altcoins are managing to outpace Bitcoin’s price action. Several factors could be at play: Risk-Off Sentiment: In times of market uncertainty, investors often flock to Bitcoin, perceived as a more established and less risky digital asset compared to altcoins. Liquidity and Focus: Market liquidity may be concentrating in Bitcoin, leaving altcoins with less capital to fuel independent rallies. Macroeconomic Pressures: Broader economic factors, like interest rate fears, can impact speculative altcoins more severely than Bitcoin. Therefore, this dip in the Altcoin Season Index is less about altcoins crashing and more about Bitcoin demonstrating relative strength or resilience. Should You Panic About Your Altcoin Investments? Not necessarily. It’s vital to understand that the Altcoin Season Index is a broad, macro indicator. It reflects the median performance of the top 100, not the fate of every project. A low index reading does not mean all altcoins are doomed. In fact, some sectors or individual coins with strong fundamentals can still thrive during a Bitcoin season. However, the index is a powerful reminder of the market’s current rhythm. For investors, this environment demands a more selective strategy. Chasing low-cap, high-risk moonshots may be less fruitful when the Altcoin Season Index is this low. Instead, focus might shift to: Altcoins with proven utility and strong development activity. Sector leaders within niches like DeFi or Layer 2 solutions. Dollar-cost averaging into fundamentally sound projects, using the period of weaker sentiment as an accumulation opportunity. What’s Next for the Crypto Market Cycle? History shows that crypto markets move in cycles. Prolonged Bitcoin seasons often eventually give way to explosive altcoin seasons . The current low reading on the index could be setting the stage for a future shift. When investor confidence returns and capital starts searching for higher returns, it often flows from Bitcoin into altcoins, potentially triggering the index to climb rapidly toward that critical 75 threshold. Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index provides a data-driven way to gauge when that transition might be beginning. A sustained move above 50 would be the first sign of altcoins regaining momentum, while a surge past 75 would confirm the season’s arrival. Conclusion: Navigating the Bitcoin-Dominant Tide The four-point fall in the Altcoin Season Index to 18 is a clear, quantitative signal that Bitcoin is currently driving the market. While this may dampen short-term enthusiasm for altcoins, it is a normal phase of the crypto market cycle. Savvy investors use tools like this index not for panic, but for perspective. It helps confirm the market’s primary trend, allowing for more informed decisions about portfolio allocation, risk management, and timing. Remember, in crypto, seasons always change. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Altcoin Season Index? A1: The Altcoin Season Index is a metric from CoinMarketCap that measures the percentage of top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins) outperforming Bitcoin over the past 90 days. A reading above 75 indicates an “altcoin season.” Q2: Why is a score of 18 considered low? A2: A score of 18 means only a small fraction of major altcoins are beating Bitcoin’s performance. It signals strong Bitcoin dominance and a market environment where capital is not broadly flowing into alternative crypto assets. Q3: Does a low index mean all altcoins are losing value? A3: Not necessarily. It means they are underperforming relative to Bitcoin. Some altcoins may still be rising in USD value, but just not as quickly as Bitcoin is. Q4: How can I use this index in my trading strategy? A4: Traders can use it as a risk gauge. A low index suggests a more cautious approach to altcoin speculation and potentially a greater focus on Bitcoin. A rising index can signal growing appetite for altcoin risk. Q5: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? A5: The index is typically updated daily, providing a near real-time pulse on the shifting dynamics between Bitcoin and the broader altcoin market. Q6: Has the index ever been at 100? A6: Yes, during peak altcoin bull markets, the index can reach 100, indicating virtually all top altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin simultaneously.

They are likely to transpire when a project has already silently passed, a supply is constricting, and the next phase is to be initiated. Such is the case that is shaping up. One of the new DeFi crypto is on the brink of a transition phase that has been influencing the way investors perceive value particularly with the market projecting itself to 2026. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a protocol of a decentralized lending and borrowing framework based on actual use, but not temporary price fluctuation. The system is designed to favor both the extremes of the market with articulate guidelines. Respondents who post assets get interest bearing exposure related to the demand to borrow. Real activity yields profit. Liquidity is offered to the borrowers through the posting of collateral on the basis of agreed terms in which the interest rates, Loan-to-Value limits as well as repayment behavior are determined. The liquidations are conducted in a balanced fashion in case the collateral becomes less than the established thresholds. This is what predisposes the idea that Mutuum Finance can be viewed as utility-based and not a narrative-driven structure. It is stated in the official X statement that V1 will enter Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 the very moment development is open to interaction. Meanwhile, Halborn Security will be looking at the finalized smart contracts, which enhances preparation before exercise. Investment Growth and What the Numbers Indicate Their participation is on the increase. Mutuum Finance is a company that has raised over $19.30M, and currently boasts over 18 400 investors. This is important to a DeFi protocol that has not yet been actively used. Lending sites rely on timely liquidity and the extensive involvement to operate well as soon as it gets going. The token was introduced in early 2025 at a price of $0.01. It currently costs $0.035 in presale, which is an increment of 250% in systematic development. This increase has not been due to increased hype. It was a result of slow motion in stages. To a lot of viewers, the trend is a sign of accumulation and not temporary attention. The total supply of MUTM is 4B. That is distributed to the early distribution of 45.5% or 1.82B tokens. The number of 820M tokens sold so far is 820M. This is because much of the initial allocation has been consumed. It is now in Phase 6 that is more than 98% allocated. The token price goes up as every step is made. Phase 7 is the next phase with an increment in price of approximately 20%. That is significant as it is weakening supply at the latest point. It is the time when behavior changes rapidly historically. The ability to engage with the community is still evident. The leaderboard introduced by the 24-hour, which provides the best contributor of the day with the $500 of MUTM, has made the activity regular. Card payment options are offered with no restrictions and reduce friction especially among new players despite restricted ability. Security Signals and Infrastructure Planning Preparation of security is an added security assurance. Mutuum finance successfully passed a CertiK audit with 90/100 score in Token Scan. This gives a preliminary certification of the smart contract design. In addition to this, the ongoing Halbon Security review and the existing bug bounty of $50K eliminate code uncertainty in the pre-V1. In addition to lending, the roadmap also has protocol-native stablecoin that would be secured by interest on the generated system. Cryptocurrency pegged to the internal operations typically increase the liquidity and maintain the value flowing in the ecosystem. These suspensions imply that the protocol is developed to be used in long terms and not in short cycles. Phase shifts are important since they reform entry conditions. At the current price, Phase 6 has just a small window since it is close to selling out. The course of action in the next stage is the introduction of a premium price, not speculative in the market. Active within the last few years whale allocations of around $110K. Greater penetrations at this point can be a sign of positioning before milestones as opposed to responding after the milestones. Together with the tightening of supply and a sure timeline of V1, these clues are the reason why a sense of urgency is a growing concern these days. To a person who has $500, the arithmetic opportunity is aided. The lower price of the tokens in earlier stages is offered. With increase in stages, the same quantity purchases fewer tokens. That is the reason why a close observance of Phase 7 is being done. Positioning Ahead of 2026 Mutuum Finance is a Ethereum-Based crypto, and this places it in an ecosystem that most users are familiar with. V1 is planned to be used in Q4 2025, its debut procedural time frame, not as a concept, as V1. In the meantime, there is tightening of supply, infrastructure is being completed, security reviews are underway. These are the conditions oftentimes that have pre-empted wider visibility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already experienced a 250% rise in price. Phase 6 is more than 98% allocated and Phase 7 proposes an almost 20% rise in price. The project is in a decisive phase with a raised amount of $19.30M, 18,400 investors, good security indicators, and a confirmed window of V1 launch.

According to data shared by Lookonchain, two large whales dumped a combined 14,000 ETH, worth approximately $40.82 million, in just the past two hours. Such aggressive selling during already weak conditions adds pressure to an asset that is struggling to attract sustained demand. While isolated whale activity does not define the broader trend on its own, timing matters. Large distributions during periods of low liquidity often amplify downside moves and reinforce negative sentiment across the market. Ethereum Whale Selling Meets Long-Term Conviction Arkham data shared by Lookonchain reveals fresh evidence of large-scale selling as Ethereum trades under sustained pressure. Address 0x2802 sold 10,000 ETH, worth approximately $29.16 million, at an average price of $2,915.5 through decentralized exchanges. Shortly after, another whale, 0x4c0A, offloaded 4,000 ETH, valued at around $11.66 million, distributing the sale across multiple centralized venues, including OKX, Binance, KuCoin, and Gate. The timing and coordination of these moves reinforce the current bearish tone, particularly as liquidity remains thin and broader market sentiment leans defensive. In the short term, such activity adds to downside pressure and fuels uncertainty among smaller investors, who often interpret whale selling as a signal of deeper weakness ahead. However, price action and sentiment do not tell the full story. Despite the drawdown, Ethereum’s fundamentals continue to strengthen at a pace rarely seen before. Institutional adoption is accelerating, not slowing. Most notably, JP Morgan recently announced the use of Ethereum to launch its first tokenized money-market fund, a milestone that underscores growing confidence in Ethereum as a settlement and financial infrastructure layer. While markets may remain bearish in the near term, the divergence between price sentiment and fundamental progress is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore. Ethereum Price Struggles to Hold Key Weekly Support Ethereum continues to trade under pressure on the weekly chart, with price now sitting around $2,950 after a sharp rejection from the $3,200–$3,300 region. This area previously acted as a key pivot zone and has now clearly flipped into resistance. The inability to reclaim it confirms that sellers remain in control of the medium-term structure. From a trend perspective, ETH is consolidating around its 200-week moving average (red line), a historically important level that often determines whether corrections remain cyclical or evolve into deeper bearish phases. So far, this moving average is acting as dynamic support, preventing a more aggressive breakdown. However, momentum remains weak, and upside follow-through is limited. The 50-week and 100-week moving averages (blue and green lines) are beginning to flatten and converge, reflecting indecision and reduced trend strength. Volume also remains muted compared to prior expansion phases, suggesting that neither strong accumulation nor capitulation is taking place at current levels. Structurally, ETH remains in a wide consolidation range between $2,500 and $3,300. A weekly close below the $2,800–$2,900 area would expose downside toward the lower end of that range. Conversely, reclaiming $3,300 is required to reestablish bullish momentum. Until then, Ethereum remains technically fragile despite its long-term fundamentals.

The cryptocurrency is currently trading within a broad range between $85,000 and $93,000, leading to growing concerns about further price corrections in the upcoming months. Amid this uncertainty, market expert NoLimit recently expressed on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that he anticipates Bitcoin could bottom out at around $40,000 sometime in 2026. This forecast implies a significant 54% decline from current levels, which are just above $87,860. A Historical Perspective On Market Cycles NoLimit’s analysis outlines several reasons for this predicted downturn. He points out that Bitcoin has a historical tendency to surprise investors, often when confidence in the market is high. While each price cycle may appear unique on the surface, NoLimit argues that the underlying mechanics remain largely unchanged. He emphasizes the cyclical nature of Bitcoin, noting that it moves within a four-year cycle influenced by liquidity, leverage, and human behavior rather than mere sentiment. According to him, the market is currently late in this cycle, and Bitcoin has consistently followed a three-step process during past upward movements. Related Reading: XRP Price Forecast: Key Factors That Could Propel It To $3 In Early 2026 First, Bitcoin tends to surge in price following the Halving event. This is typically followed by an influx of maximum leverage and late-stage buyers. Finally, the cycle concludes with a sharp and often chaotic reset before the next significant price expansion occurs. Historically, Bitcoin has experienced steep declines during these resets, such as an approximate 85% drop in 2013-2014, an 84% drop in 2017-2018, and a 77% drop during the 2021-2022 cycle. In each scenario, investors were convinced that the conditions were different, yet the outcomes remained consistent. $40,000 As Foundation For Bitcoin’s Next Bull Run Considering the current market situation, NoLimit highlights several critical indicators. He notes that Bitcoin has already seen substantial price appreciation, with institutional interest and exchange-trade fund (ETF) approvals now part of the landscape. He also observes that many traders are over-leveraged, market volatility is compressed, and there exists widespread hope for further price increases. These factors often signal a heightened risk of downside movement in the market. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Suffer A 20% Decline After Japan’s Rate Hike? Historical Patterns Suggest So A potential drop toward the $40,000 range should not be viewed as an unforeseen disaster, according to NoLimit. He argues that significant price declines have historically preceded major upward movements. Additionally, this price target aligns well with several technical indicators, including previous resistance levels that have turned into support, long-term moving averages, and the liquidity gap created by ETF approvals. Such factors suggest that a move toward this region could exhaust forced sellers and provide a solid foundation for recovery.

According to a recent statement from Coinbase, younger generations are pouring money into cryptocurrency at a rate more than three times that of their older counterparts. This isn’t just a trend; it’s a fundamental rethinking of how to build wealth for the future. But what’s driving this dramatic change, and what does it mean for the financial system as we know it? Why Are Younger Generations Investing So Heavily in Crypto? Coinbase points to a powerful sentiment: younger people feel locked out of traditional wealth-building paths. Soaring real estate prices, stagnant wages, and perceived barriers in the stock market have created a sense of frustration. Therefore, they are turning to alternative assets. Cryptocurrency represents not just an investment, but a new, accessible vehicle for financial growth that they believe the old system failed to provide. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong didn’t mince words. He stated that the existing financial system has numerous problems, from high fees to slow transactions and limited access. This critique resonates deeply with a generation that values speed, transparency, and decentralization. For them, crypto isn’t a gamble; it’s a logical solution. The Generational Wealth Paradigm Shift This isn’t merely about choosing a different asset class. It signals a profound paradigm shift in how different generations perceive and approach asset investment. Older generations often built wealth through: Traditional retirement accounts (401ks, IRAs) Real estate ownership Blue-chip stock portfolios In contrast, younger generations view cryptocurrency as a key vehicle for future wealth growth. They see digital assets as integral to a modern portfolio, not a fringe alternative. This shift is powered by technology, a distrust of centralized institutions, and a desire for assets that align with a digital-first worldview. What Challenges Does This New Investment Trend Face? While the enthusiasm is clear, this move is not without its hurdles. New investors must navigate a complex and volatile market. Understanding blockchain technology, managing digital wallets, and recognizing security risks are essential skills. Moreover, regulatory uncertainty remains a significant cloud over the entire sector. However, these challenges have not deterred younger investors. Instead, they often see volatility as an opportunity and educate themselves through online communities and resources. Their approach is hands-on, self-directed, and fundamentally different from the advisor-led models of the past. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Crypto Landscape If you’re considering following this trend, knowledge is your most valuable asset. Start with these steps: Educate First, Invest Second: Understand blockchain basics, different cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin and Ethereum), and what drives their value. Start Small and Diversify: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider spreading investments across different assets. Prioritize Security: Use reputable exchanges and secure hardware wallets. Your private keys are your responsibility. Think Long-Term: View crypto as part of a long-term wealth strategy, not a scheme for getting rich quick. This movement led by younger generations investing in crypto is more than a statistic. It’s a powerful signal of changing values and a demand for a more inclusive financial future. While risks exist, the underlying driver—a search for accessible wealth creation—is both understandable and compelling. The financial world is watching as a new generation places its bets on a digital tomorrow. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What did Coinbase actually say about younger investors? A: Coinbase stated that younger generations are investing more than three times as much in alternative assets like cryptocurrency compared to traditional financial assets, viewing crypto as a key vehicle for future wealth. Q: Why do younger people prefer crypto over stocks or real estate? A> Many feel traditional paths to wealth are difficult to access due to high barriers to entry (like down payments) and a perception that the old system doesn’t work for them. Crypto offers accessibility, potential for high growth, and aligns with their digital-native mindset. Q: Is investing in cryptocurrency safe for beginners? A> It carries significant risk due to volatility and complexity. Safety comes from thorough education, using secure platforms, starting with small amounts, and never investing emergency funds. Q: Does this mean traditional investing is dead? A> Not at all. This indicates a diversification of strategies. A balanced portfolio can include both traditional and alternative assets. The shift highlights a demand for more options, not necessarily the elimination of old ones. Q: What is the main takeaway from Coinbase’s observation? A> The core takeaway is a generational paradigm shift. Younger demographics are fundamentally rethinking wealth building, driven by technology and a desire for a more equitable financial system, with cryptocurrency at the center of this change.

Now, the shelves are overflowing with specialized products. According to a bold prediction from Bitwise researcher Ryan Rasmussen, this is the future for crypto investors. He forecasts that over 100 new crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) will launch in 2026, transforming a niche market into a mainstream financial buffet. Why Are So Many Crypto ETPs Suddenly on the Horizon? The catalyst for this predicted explosion is regulatory clarity. Rasmussen points to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) refining its guidelines for the sector. This expected regulatory roadmap gives asset managers the confidence to develop and launch a wave of new products. Therefore, the market is poised to shift from a state of uncertainty to one of structured innovation. This isn’t just about more of the same. The coming wave of crypto ETPs will introduce unprecedented variety. Rasmussen highlights that investors should prepare for a diverse menu including: Spot ETPs tracking direct crypto asset prices. Index ETPs following baskets of cryptocurrencies. Equity-linked ETPs connected to crypto-related companies. Smart Beta ETPs using alternative weighting strategies. What Does This Mean for the Average Crypto Investor? For years, investors seeking regulated exposure to crypto had very limited choices. This predicted surge in crypto ETPs changes the game entirely. Rasmussen likens the future landscape to a restaurant with an extensive menu, offering dozens or even hundreds of choices. This diversity empowers you with new tools for portfolio construction. You can tailor your exposure based on specific strategies, risk tolerance, and thematic interests. Want broad market access? There will be an index product. Believe in the infrastructure behind crypto? Equity-linked crypto ETPs could be your answer. This evolution mirrors the maturation seen in traditional finance, bringing sophisticated, accessible products to the digital asset space. What Challenges Could This Growth Face? While the forecast is optimistic, the path is not without potential hurdles. The SEC’s final stance and the speed of approval will be critical. Moreover, market education will be essential. With so many new crypto ETPs , investors must understand the nuances of each product—its underlying assets, fees, and risks. Another consideration is market saturation. Can investor demand support over 100 new products? Likely, we will see a period of competition where the most useful and well-structured crypto ETPs thrive. However, this competition will ultimately benefit you, the investor, by driving down costs and improving product features. How Should You Prepare for This New Era of Crypto ETPs? First, view this as a sign of the market’s accelerating institutional adoption. Second, use this time to educate yourself on the different types of ETP structures. Finally, consider consulting with a financial advisor to understand how these new tools might fit into your long-term strategy. The arrival of diverse crypto ETPs is a powerful step toward legitimizing crypto as an asset class. In conclusion, the prediction of over 100 new crypto ETPs by 2026 signals a monumental shift. It represents a move from a constrained, speculative frontier to a mature, diversified investment landscape. Regulatory progress is unlocking a wave of innovation that will provide investors with unprecedented choice and strategic flexibility in the digital asset world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly is a crypto ETP? A crypto Exchange-Traded Product (ETP) is a regulated financial instrument traded on traditional stock exchanges that tracks the price of one or more cryptocurrencies. It allows investors to gain exposure to crypto without directly buying and storing the assets. Why is 2026 seen as a key year for crypto ETP launches? Analysts like Ryan Rasmussen believe that by 2026, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will have established clearer, more refined guidelines for these products. This regulatory clarity gives financial institutions the green light to develop and launch a wide array of new offerings. How will more crypto ETPs benefit me as an investor? More products mean more choice and better tools for portfolio diversification. You’ll be able to select ETPs that match specific strategies (e.g., broad market, thematic, low-volatility) and gain regulated exposure through familiar brokerage accounts. What’s the difference between a spot crypto ETP and other types? A spot ETP directly tracks the current (spot) price of a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. Other types, like index or smart beta ETPs, track a custom basket or use rules-based strategies to target specific factors like reduced volatility or equal weighting. Are there any risks with the predicted flood of new crypto ETPs? Yes. Key risks include regulatory delays, potential investor confusion due to product complexity, and the possibility of market saturation where some products fail to attract enough assets to remain viable.

He said Oracle’s role in the OpenAI partnership puts real pressure on how the AI build-out moves forward, and he argued that the company needs “discipline” before things spin out.He pointed to Oracle’s debt and said the bond market will eventually push the firm to step back. “Oracle already has a huge amount of debt.Their balance sheet’s not that good.At some point, they’ll heed the warning of the bond market and slow things down.” Jim also said the data center race is burning cash at a level that even strong operators struggle with. He warned that “Oracle can’t risk blowing up its balance sheet for Sam Altman,” and said that a slowdown is “when and how we’re going to get out of this morass.” Jim said the biggest players driving this race are Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta and OpenAI with Oracle.He said they’re all trying to outspend each other by building data centers in every location they can secure. He also said they’re doing this to keep rivals from touching their main businesses. He did not soften the point at all.He said this “reckless, imprudent data center spending” has knocked down valuations across the group. Jim argued that OpenAI “is funded by venture capitalists and the company seems willing to spend itself to death,” and that the rest of the sector will keep matching that pace as long as the ChatGPT maker refuses to slow down. Report tracks Oracle debt risk Jim said OpenAI already committed more than $300 billion over five years on Oracle technology, and added that its other promises across the market sit near $1.4 trillion.He said this scale makes the entire space fragile. He pointed to Oracle’s $18 billion bond sale and said the response was sharp because traders rushed into credit default swaps.He said these swaps show how real the fear is that Oracle could face pressure if spending continues at the current speed. Jim said if Oracle holds back on spending, the rivals will feel safe enough to slow down too, and that could lift their stocks. He put it simply: “This way Oracle stays alive, and OpenAI is forced to choose which businesses it truly wants to target. Because he who defends everything defends nothing.” According to Jim, “institutional money and institutional memory fled the bubble stocks months ago and moved into all sorts of non-tech growth plays.” He described this as the real strength of the market right now. He said that is why the pullback in the Mag Seven is not the disaster many expected. He said the rotation already happened before the latest shocks. Market rotation drives new positioning Jim said Wall Street’s fear of a new data center bubble is missing the point because the hype faded months earlier. He said investors already rotated into aerospace, retail and fintech, and he called these groups the “salvation of this market” as the speculative names came down. He compared today’s setup to the dotcom crash but said this time is different because “there is now more money around and more money indexed to the S&P 500 than there was 25 years ago,” so the average investor didn’t get wiped out. Jim then said this rotation makes him “more sanguine than most,” and said there is “a great deal of strength in the very stocks that tried to save us in 2000, but failed because there wasn’t enough capital around to rotate to them.” Jim’s final point was that “it isn’t 2000. It’s what I call 2025, with an orderly migration back to old, sustainable growth that’s a beneficiary of AI, not a maker of it.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

The platform has announced it will now back up critical user data to Microsoft Azure, creating a robust secondary system alongside its existing Amazon Web Services (AWS) setup. This strategic Upbit data backup enhancement is a direct response to the need for unwavering operational resilience in the digital asset space. Why Did Upbit Add a Second Cloud Backup? According to an exclusive report by Herald Business, an Upbit official clarified the rationale. The core mission is business continuity. By distributing its Upbit data backup across two independent cloud giants—AWS and Microsoft Azure—the exchange creates a powerful safety net. This approach directly addresses potential large-scale emergencies, such as natural disasters or regional outages, that could impact a single provider’s data centers. What Does This Multi-Cloud Strategy Mean for Users? For the millions of users trusting Upbit with their assets, this upgrade translates to tangible security benefits. Think of it as your crypto holdings being secured in two ultra-modern, geographically separate digital fortresses instead of one. Enhanced Resilience: If one cloud platform experiences a disruption, the other ensures operations and data access continue seamlessly. Reduced Risk: It mitigates the ‘all eggs in one basket’ risk associated with relying on a single vendor. Operational Confidence: It demonstrates a proactive, enterprise-grade approach to safeguarding the platform’s integrity. How Does This Align with Broader Crypto Security Trends? The cryptocurrency industry is maturing, and robust infrastructure is no longer optional—it’s expected. Exchanges are increasingly held to the same standards as traditional financial institutions. Upbit’s investment in a multi-cloud Upbit data backup architecture signals this shift. It’s a technical decision with a clear user-centric message: the security of your assets is our paramount concern. Moreover, this move leverages the strengths of both AWS and Azure. While AWS is a long-standing leader, Microsoft Azure brings its own global network and enterprise security protocols. This diversification itself is a best practice in critical data management. What Are the Practical Implications for Exchange Security? Implementing a synchronized, real-time backup across two different cloud environments is complex. However, the payoff for security is monumental. It means transaction records, wallet keys, and user information are continuously protected. In a worst-case scenario, recovery time objectives (RTO) would be drastically improved, minimizing any potential downtime for deposits, withdrawals, or trading. This strategy goes beyond compliance; it’s about building unshakeable trust. In an era where news of exchange hacks or failures can shake market confidence, such transparent investments in backbone security are reassuring. Conclusion: A Proactive Step in a Demanding Landscape Upbit’s integration of Microsoft Azure is more than a technical upgrade—it’s a strategic shield. By proactively addressing potential single points of failure, the exchange strengthens its promise of safety and reliability. This enhanced Upbit data backup protocol sets a higher benchmark for operational security in the crypto exchange ecosystem, ultimately providing users with greater peace of mind for their digital wealth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does this change affect how I log in or use my Upbit account? A: No. This is a backend infrastructure upgrade. Users will not notice any change in their daily experience on the platform. Q: Is my personal data now stored in two places? Does that increase privacy risk? A> Your data is backed up in two highly secure, encrypted systems. The security protocols for each cloud (AWS and Azure) are industry-leading. The redundancy increases availability in an emergency but does not inherently increase privacy risk if proper encryption is maintained. Q: Why choose Microsoft Azure as the second provider? A> Azure is a major global cloud provider with a strong reputation for enterprise services and security compliance. Using a second provider different from AWS ensures diversity in infrastructure and reduces correlated risks. Q: Will this make Upbit’s services more expensive for users? A> There is no indication that this operational cost will be passed directly to users via increased fees. It is likely viewed as a necessary cost of doing business at a secure, institutional level. Q: Have other crypto exchanges made similar moves? A> While not universal, employing multi-cloud or hybrid cloud strategies is becoming a best practice among top-tier exchanges aiming for maximum resilience and disaster recovery capability.

This dramatic escalation from seasonal restrictions aims to tackle severe power shortages that have plagued these energy-rich areas. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and miners worldwide, this development represents a significant regulatory hardening in one of the world’s most important mining regions. Why Is Russia Implementing a Permanent Cryptocurrency Mining Ban? The Russian government’s decision stems from growing concerns about energy infrastructure strain. Cryptocurrency mining operations, particularly those using proof-of-work consensus mechanisms, consume enormous amounts of electricity. In Siberia’s Irkutsk and Krasnoyarsk regions—where cheap hydroelectric power initially attracted miners—the local grids simply cannot handle the demand. Authorities report that residential areas have experienced blackouts during peak mining periods, creating public discontent and safety concerns. This permanent cryptocurrency mining ban expands upon existing seasonal restrictions that already affect 10 Russian regions annually from November to March until 2031. The seasonal bans were implemented as temporary measures, but the government now believes permanent action is necessary in the most affected areas. The move reflects a broader global tension between cryptocurrency development and energy sustainability. What Does This Mean for Global Cryptocurrency Mining? Russia has emerged as a major player in global cryptocurrency mining following China’s 2021 mining crackdown. The country’s cold climate and abundant energy resources made it an attractive destination for mining operations seeking lower operational costs. However, this new cryptocurrency mining ban could significantly alter the global mining landscape: Reduced hash rate contribution : Russia currently contributes approximately 4-5% of Bitcoin’s global hash rate Relocation pressure : Miners must now consider moving operations to other regions or countries Increased operational costs : Remaining Russian miners face higher energy costs in permitted regions Regulatory uncertainty : The ban creates questions about Russia’s long-term crypto stance The Siberian regions affected by the permanent cryptocurrency mining ban were particularly popular due to their exceptionally low electricity rates—sometimes as little as $0.01 per kWh. This made them economically viable even for smaller mining operations. With this advantage disappearing, the economic calculus for mining in Russia changes fundamentally. How Will This Impact Russia’s Crypto Economy? Russia’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation has been notably ambivalent. While the central bank has advocated for strict controls, other government bodies have recognized the potential economic benefits of embracing digital assets. This permanent cryptocurrency mining ban represents a victory for energy security advocates but may come at an economic cost: Lost tax revenue : Mining operations generate significant electricity consumption taxes Reduced foreign investment Informal mining growth : Bans often push activities underground rather than eliminating them Technology sector impact : Related businesses like hardware sales and maintenance may suffer Interestingly, the ban appears geographically targeted rather than nationwide. Other Russian regions with surplus energy capacity might continue to host mining operations. This suggests the government is attempting to balance energy management with economic opportunity—a challenging tightrope walk that other nations are also attempting. What Can Cryptocurrency Miners Do Now? For miners currently operating in the affected Siberian regions, several practical steps should be considered immediately. First, assess whether operations can be relocated to other Russian regions not covered by the cryptocurrency mining ban . Areas with energy surpluses and cooler climates might offer viable alternatives within the country. Second, explore international relocation options. Countries like Kazakhstan, Canada, and the United States have become increasingly popular mining destinations, though each presents unique regulatory and operational challenges. Third, consider diversifying into less energy-intensive blockchain activities or alternative consensus mechanisms that don’t face the same regulatory scrutiny. Finally, stay informed about potential legal challenges or exceptions. The Russian cryptocurrency regulatory landscape remains fluid, and industry advocacy groups may challenge the scope or implementation of the cryptocurrency mining ban . The Bigger Picture: Energy vs. Innovation Russia’s permanent cryptocurrency mining ban highlights a fundamental tension facing many nations: how to balance innovative technologies with infrastructure limitations. As cryptocurrency adoption grows globally, more countries will face similar decisions about allocating finite energy resources. This development serves as a cautionary tale for miners about geographical concentration risk and the importance of regulatory diversification. The Siberian situation also underscores the need for more energy-efficient blockchain technologies. While proof-of-work mining faces increasing scrutiny, alternative consensus mechanisms like proof-of-stake continue to gain traction. The long-term solution may not be banning mining but rather encouraging technological evolution toward sustainable models. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Crypto Regulation Russia’s decision to implement a permanent cryptocurrency mining ban in two Siberian regions represents a watershed moment in global crypto regulation. It demonstrates how local infrastructure limitations can drive national policy decisions, even in resource-rich nations. For the cryptocurrency industry, this development reinforces the importance of energy efficiency and regulatory engagement. As the sector matures, finding sustainable models that balance innovation with practical constraints will be essential for long-term viability. The coming months will reveal how effectively Russia enforces this ban and how miners adapt to the new reality. One thing is certain: the global cryptocurrency mining map continues to evolve, with energy considerations increasingly driving geographical distribution. Frequently Asked Questions Which Siberian regions face the permanent cryptocurrency mining ban? The ban specifically targets the Irkutsk and Krasnoyarsk regions, where power shortages have been most severe due to mining operations straining local grids. When does the permanent ban take effect? The permanent cryptocurrency mining ban is scheduled to begin next year, though exact implementation dates may vary by locality within the affected regions. Does this mean all cryptocurrency mining is banned in Russia? No, the ban is geographically limited to two Siberian regions. Other Russian areas may continue to host mining operations, particularly those with energy surpluses. What about the existing seasonal mining bans? Seasonal bans in 10 regions from November to March will continue until 2031 as previously planned. The permanent ban in Siberia is an additional, more severe restriction. Can miners apply for exceptions to the ban? Current reports suggest the ban will be comprehensive, but the Russian government has sometimes created exceptions for registered industrial operations. Miners should consult local authorities for specific guidance. How will this affect cryptocurrency prices? While any major mining disruption can theoretically affect network security and potentially prices, Russia’s 4-5% share of global Bitcoin mining means the direct price impact may be limited unless other countries follow with similar restrictions.

55899514,645718,1765936821,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55899514.jpeg,Will Quantum Computing Suppress Bitcoin Prices In 2026? Grayscale Answers,https://bitcoinist.com/quantum-computing-suppress-bitcoin-price-in-2026/,"Quantum risk has been getting louder in the Bitcoin conversation over the past few months. The question is whether that noise translates into price pressure in 2026. Grayscale’s answer, in its updated 2026 Digital Asset Outlook: “Dawn of the Institutional Era” (last updated Dec. 15), is essentially no. Quantum belongs on the risk register and in the research pipeline, not on the list of themes the firm expects to steer Bitcoin’s valuation next year. In its view, it’s not “likely to move prices” in 2026. Why The Quantum Computer Threat Won’t Move Bitcoin Price In 2026 That call matters because the quantum debate arrived while the market is already looking for new failure modes — everything from “the four-year cycle is dead” to renewed anxiety about large holders distributing supply. Grayscale’s framing is simpler: the threat is real in theory, but the relevant timelines don’t line up with a 2026 trading horizon. The firm lays out the core concern in plain terms: “Theoretically, a sufficiently powerful quantum computer could derive private keys from public keys, which could then be used to create valid digital signatures to spend users’ coins. Therefore, Bitcoin and most other blockchains — and virtually everything else in the economy that uses cryptography — will eventually need to be updated for post-quantum tools .” The key word is eventually. Grayscale points to expert estimates suggesting a machine capable of breaking Bitcoin’s cryptography is “unlikely before 2030 at the earliest.” That pushes 2026 into a preparedness bucket: more research, more coordination, more work on mitigation — but not a year where markets suddenly apply a quantum discount because a lab headline hit the wires. Grayscale makes that explicit. “However, expert estimates suggest a quantum computer powerful enough to break Bitcoin’s cryptography is unlikely before 2030 at the earliest. Research on quantum risk and community preparedness efforts will likely accelerate in 2026, but this theme is unlikely to move prices, in our view,” the firm writes. In the report’s taxonomy, quantum sits closer to “high attention, low near-term impact” than to a true 2026 catalyst. Grayscale groups it with other heavily discussed trades that may not drive returns on a one-year view, including the digital-asset-treasury (DAT) narrative that had its Michael Saylor copycat phase in 2025. The broader outlook is firmly “institutional era” in tone. Grayscale expects 2026 to extend structural shifts in how digital assets are owned and allocated, driven by macro demand for alternative stores of value and an improving regulatory backdrop that reduces frictions for large investors. In that context, the firm is calling for Bitcoin to set a new all-time high in the first half of 2026, while arguing the classic four-year halving cycle is becoming less dominant as spot ETPs and slower-moving portfolio allocation play a bigger role. That’s also why quantum looks like a mismatch for the 2026 price question. If the marginal buyer is an allocator working through due diligence checklists, the market’s response function changes. Those investors do not ignore tail risks — but they also tend not to liquidate positions on long-dated, low-probability scenarios unless the timeline becomes immediate. Grayscale highlights one other, quieter point that fits the institutional framing: Bitcoin’s supply schedule . The report notes investors can be “highly confident” the 20 millionth bitcoin will be mined in March 2026 — a predictable, verifiable milestone that speaks to the protocol’s rule-based issuance. So will quantum computing suppress Bitcoin in 2026? Grayscale’s base case is no — not because the problem is imaginary, but because it isn’t close on the timeline markets usually need before they reprice risk. For next year, the firm expects the bigger drivers to look familiar, even if they arrive in more institutional packaging: rates, regulation, ETP plumbing, and steady absorption of BTC into mainstream portfolios. Quantum remains a theme to track. Just not, in Grayscale’s view, the theme that sets the price in 2026.

Several industry figures echoed Arrington’s mix; Tony Edward, for example, listed XRP with BTC and ETH when discussing core positions. The debate was loud and fast on social feeds. Some users framed the move as a vote of confidence. Others warned that one investor’s choices do not equal a market-wide shift. Tell me your top five crypto holdings (by total dollar value). Mine are XRP, BTC, ETH and IMX — Michael Arrington 🏴‍☠️ (@arrington) December 13, 2025 Institutional Moves Follow Based on reports, Arrington’s public support is tied to direct institutional activity. In October, Arrington Capital joined Ripple and SBI Holdings to back an initiative by Evernorth aimed at building a large institutional XRP treasury. The project, which has been described in some circles as among the biggest of its kind, aims to increase institutional use of XRP and to support on-ledger activity such as decentralized finance and lending. That involvement means Arrington is more than a vocal supporter; he is also tied to projects that could change how institutions use the token. XRP Market Moves And Key Figures XRP’s market picture has been mixed. As of December 16, 2025, the token was trading around $1.98, having held in a roughly $2.00 to $2.20 band in recent sessions. There was a small daily lift of about 1.2% to roughly $2.08 on Monday, which helped the token cover some ground after early-December weakness. The year has seen bigger swings: XRP peaked near $3.65 in July before giving back some gains. Activity in regulated derivatives has also grown. Reports point to XRP futures on the CME reaching a record open interest of roughly $3 billion in late October 2025, a figure that market watchers say reflects rising institutional appetite for regulated exposure. Related Reading: Analyst: Bitcoin’s Cycle Is Intact, Yet No Longer Purely Market-Driven A Past Claim That No Longer Holds Arrington has previously highlighted XRP’s strong performance. In March, he tweeted that XRP had been the best-performing major asset across multiple time frames — 90 days, 180 days, one year and three years. That claim no longer lines up with current rankings. Performance metrics have shifted since then, and the statement has been overtaken by later results.

This deal is linked to a 2022 hack that resulted in significant losses after nearly all the funds on the platform were stolen. If, by any chance, the settlement proposal gets approved, Illusory will not be permitted to deceive anyone regarding its security practices. This proposal will require the platform to develop an official information security initiative, undergo independent security checks every two years, and return any recovered funds that have not yet been returned to the users who were affected. To determine the exact amount lost in this hack, reporters questioned the FTC about the information it had regarding this practice. The federal agency highlighted that the loss incurred in this hack amounted to approximately $186 million in digital assets. This left clients suffering losses of more than $100 million. Nomad crypto hack incident raises safety concerns among crypto investors The FTC mentioned in its original complaint that Nomad failed to effectively prevent the hack because it lacked the right incident response systems in place. According to the agency, “They had to depend on an engineer who was on a plane to send code snippets back and forth with the incident manager. Because of this delay, Nomad couldn’t shut down the bridge until after it lost all its assets.” In the proposed agreement , the FTC highlighted that it decided to submit a Complaint, indicating the charges, after discovering sufficient evidence to support its claim that the Respondent had breached the Federal Trade Commission Act. This conclusion followed a thorough investigation into the matter that was conducted by the commission. “The Commission has accepted the signed Consent Agreement and made it public for 30 days to allow for public comments,” the agency added. Meanwhile, established in 2021, Nomad operated as a blockchain bridge that enabled users to transfer tokens across various blockchain networks, including Ethereum and Avalanche. According to a report from the FTC, a code update implemented in June 2022 resulted in a major defect in one of the smart contracts on Nomad. Hackers began to take advantage of the situation on August 1, 2022, resulting in substantial losses of approximately $186 million in Ethereum , USDC, DAI, and WBTC. Illusory Systems had marketed Nomad as a Safety-focused platform, according to the agency’s complaint. However, the commission argued that they failed to properly test the code or keep clear processes for reporting suspicious incidents and responding to them. The FTC accuses Illusory Systems of ignoring basic safety measures The federal agency alleged that Illusory Systems failed to establish basic safety measures that could have mitigated the losses clients faced and did not comply with established secure coding practices, such as conducting proper unit tests before introducing the code. The FTC stated that although Nomad pointed out that it had adopted thorough testing of smart contracts in its advertising, Nomad engineers admitted that the platform did not frequently test them adequately before the hack took place. After the hack incident, Nomad was able to recover around $22 million of the $190 million that was robbed. This situation illustrates a growing trend in the cryptocurrency industry, where criminals often steal substantial sums of clients’ funds. To support this claim, Israeli authorities reported earlier this year that they managed to arrest Alexander Gurevich for supposedly starting the Nomad bridge exploit. Reports from the police stated that Gurevich was caught at an Israel-based airport while attempting to flee to Moscow just a few days after he lawfully changed his name to remain hidden from the authorities.

The initiative aims to reduce legal disputes and enhance transparency in the auction process. The public auction will include the sale of ten warehouses. The Court of Auditors will also time-stamp and register every piece of documentation involved on the unidentified blockchain. Nordeste Leiloes partners with InspireIP Local media reported earlier that auction platform Nordeste Leiloes will conduct the sale in partnership with blockchain firm InspireIP. The country’s auction market has previously faced instances of fraud, with altered documents, inconsistent public records, and fake websites. Arthur Nunes, official auctioneer at Nordeste Leiloes, said that adopting blockchain technology in public auctions improves transparency for a country vulnerable to fraud and documentary disputes. He also acknowledged that the firm included a blockchain model in the TCE-SP auction, where no file can be altered. He argued that it gives the buyer and the auctioneer technical safety. The country aims to introduce a verification layer in its auction market to mitigate problems commonly seen in traditional systems, particularly in high-risk sales. Documents from the public auction will be converted into technical evidence, with each file being cryptographically sealed. Nordeste Leiloes believes the initiative will help the company further its reach into larger urban markets. The initiative enables the company to expand its operations, which have been ongoing for more than 15 years, from the North and Northeastern regions to the South and Southeastern regions. The firm also reported $1.74 million in sales across 65 auctions this year. “Entering major centers requires not only experience, but also substantially raising the standard of trust. This partnership with InspireIP accelerates this expansion because it brings technological proof that the market already demands and that public bodies are beginning to require.” – Arthur Nunes , Official auctioneer at Nordeste Leiloes. Nunes argued that blockchain is not about modernity, but about responsibility, traceability, and transparency. Caroline Nunes, Founder of InspireIP, also acknowledged that the verification process will become public, traceable, and independent. Caroline also believes that blockchain’s security in public auctions transforms each document into evidence that is difficult to alter. She said that the smallest attempt to change the cryptographic identifier for the photos, reports, or notices will be immediately exposed. Brazil advances its stance towards blockchain and digital assets The Brazilian government announced on October 21 that it has advanced its stance towards blockchain and digital assets to better protect investors, prevent illicit activity, and support innovation. The Legal Framework for Crypto Assets also categorizes crypto assets as private movable goods or financial assets, and they do not have legal tender status. The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) has also extended its anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism rules to digital asset service providers. The initiative is scheduled to begin in February 2026 and aims to boost Brazil’s cryptocurrency adoption. The central bank’s Director of Regulation Gilneu Vivan said that the new regulations will reduce scams, fraud, and the use of crypto assets for money laundering. Reuters also reported that the new rules will require crypto service providers to meet corporate oversight standards. They are also required to meet standards around internal monitoring systems, security protocols, and disclosures to regulators. The BCB added that the regulations come with customer protection requirements and transparency standards that didn’t previously apply to crypto asset service providers. Brazil’s interest in the cryptocurrency sector has surged over the years, with local firm Itau Asset Management urging investors to allocate 1% to 3% of their portfolios to Bitcoin. Cryptopolitan previously reported that the financial firm said the initiative aims to reduce Brazil’s reliance on local markets and local currency. Itau’s note to investors follows other recommendations from giant financial institutions, including Bank of America’s suggestion of up to 4% in BTC, while BlackRock suggested about 2% for its wealth advisors.

The firm’s sudden collapse comes directly on the heels of a major fraud lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This event sends shockwaves through the industry, raising urgent questions about transparency and trust. What Led to the Shima Capital Shutdown? According to reports from Decrypt’s Kate Irwin, founder Yida Gao announced the firm’s effective liquidation in an email to portfolio founders. He stated he would step down as managing partner. This decision was not voluntary market exit but a direct consequence of regulatory action. The SEC’s complaint paints a damning picture, alleging that Shima Capital secretly created an offshore entity and misused investor assets without their knowledge. Understanding the SEC’s Fraud Allegations The SEC’s lawsuit is the core reason for the shutdown. The regulator claims the firm engaged in deceptive practices that breached its fiduciary duty to investors. The central allegations include: Undisclosed Offshore Entity: The SEC claims Shima Capital set up a separate entity outside the U.S. without informing the investors who funded its $200 million fund. Asset Misappropriation: The complaint alleges the firm diverted assets from its main venture fund for unauthorized purposes. Lack of Transparency: Investors were reportedly kept in the dark about these critical actions and the associated risks. These serious charges highlight the regulatory risks facing crypto investment firms, especially those managing significant capital from traditional investors. Which Crypto Projects Are Impacted? The fall of Shima Capital creates immediate uncertainty for its portfolio companies. Launched in 2021, the firm was an active investor in several high-profile crypto ventures. The affected projects include: Berachain: A promising Layer 1 blockchain. Monad: A parallelized Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) layer. Pudgy Penguins: A popular and valuable NFT collection. While these projects have their own communities and funding, losing a key venture backer can affect future support, strategic guidance, and market confidence. Founders must now navigate this unexpected challenge. What Does This Mean for Crypto Venture Capital? This event is a watershed moment. The SEC’s aggressive action against Shima Capital signals a clear intent to police the crypto VC space rigorously. For other firms, this means: Increased Scrutiny: Regulatory compliance is no longer optional. Investor Demands: Limited partners will demand higher levels of transparency and governance. Industry Maturation: While painful, such enforcement can weed out bad actors, potentially leading to a more stable and trustworthy ecosystem in the long run. The shutdown underscores that the ‘wild west’ era of crypto investing is facing a powerful sheriff. Key Takeaways and Final Thoughts The story of Shima Capital is a cautionary tale. It demonstrates that rapid growth and large fundraises are not shields against fundamental failures in ethics and compliance. For investors, due diligence is paramount. For founders, choosing a venture partner requires looking beyond the check size to their integrity and operational soundness. Ultimately, this shutdown may accelerate a necessary shift toward greater accountability in crypto finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly did Shima Capital do wrong according to the SEC? A: The SEC alleges the firm committed fraud by secretly creating an offshore entity and misusing investor funds without disclosure, violating securities laws. Q: Will projects like Berachain and Pudgy Penguins fail because of this? A> Not necessarily. While losing a VC backer is a setback, these projects have independent operations and community support. Their success depends on their own execution, though they may need to seek alternative funding. Q: Can investors in Shima Capital’s fund get their money back? A> The liquidation process will determine that. However, asset recovery in fraud cases is often complex and lengthy, and investors may not recoup their full investment. Q: Does this mean all crypto VCs are risky? A> No, but it highlights the importance of thorough due diligence. Investors must scrutinize a fund’s structure, governance, and compliance history, not just its track record. Q: Is this part of a wider SEC crackdown on crypto? A> Yes. The SEC has consistently increased enforcement across the crypto sector, targeting exchanges, token issuers, and now investment advisers like Shima Capital .

A significant shift is underway. Recent data reveals the South Korean crypto trading volume reached approximately $1.58 trillion this year, marking a 5% decrease from the previous period. This overall dip, however, masks a dramatic and competitive reshuffling among the nation’s major exchanges. While the total pie shrank slightly, how the slices were divided tells a far more compelling story of winners, losers, and changing investor behavior. What Does the 5% Drop in South Korean Crypto Trading Volume Really Mean? On the surface, a 5% decline in the massive South Korean crypto trading volume might seem modest. However, this figure represents a cooling of market activity worth tens of billions of dollars. The data, reported by Digital Asset and covering the period up to December 15th, indicates a total trading volume of about 2,179 trillion won. This subtle contraction suggests that while interest remains robust, external factors like global macroeconomic uncertainty or local regulatory developments may be prompting a more cautious approach from some traders. Therefore, the headline number is just the beginning of the analysis. Upbit vs. Bithumb: A Tale of Two Exchanges The most striking narrative within the South Korean crypto trading volume data is the divergent paths of the two largest platforms. Upbit, the market leader, saw its volume fall by a notable 11%, dropping to around 1,512 trillion won. In stark contrast, its main competitor, Bithumb, achieved an 11% increase , climbing to approximately 613 trillion won. This seesaw effect highlights intense competition for market share. Several factors could explain this shift: Fee Structures: Aggressive trading fee promotions or loyalty programs. Listings: Exclusive access to certain altcoins or new token launches. User Experience: Improvements in platform interface, security, or mobile app functionality. This battle for dominance is a key driver reshaping the landscape. How Did Other Major Korean Crypto Exchanges Perform? Beyond the top two, the story for other exchanges was mixed but generally positive. Coinone posted a solid 10% growth in its contribution to the overall South Korean crypto trading volume . Korbit also grew, albeit modestly, with a 1% increase. The most dramatic decline, however, was at Gopax, which experienced a steep 65% drop in trading activity. This could be related to specific operational challenges, loss of key partnerships, or heightened competition for its user base. The varied performance underscores that in a consolidating market, exchanges cannot rely on past success and must continuously innovate to attract and retain traders. Key Takeaways and Future Outlook for South Korea’s Crypto Market So, what can we learn from this year’s South Korean crypto trading volume report? First, the market is mature and highly competitive, with traders actively moving between platforms based on value propositions. Second, overall resilience is evident; a 5% dip during a period of global financial tightening is not a collapse but a normalization. Looking ahead, several trends will be crucial: Regulatory Clarity: New frameworks from South Korean authorities will directly impact exchange operations and investor sentiment. Institutional Entry: Increased participation from funds and corporations could boost volumes significantly. Market Recovery: A broader crypto bull market would likely propel the South Korean crypto trading volume to new record highs. The data paints a picture of a dynamic, evolving market where agility and user focus are paramount for survival and growth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Why did South Korean crypto trading volume fall by 5% this year? A: The 5% decline can be attributed to a combination of global factors like economic uncertainty and potential local regulatory caution, leading to slightly reduced trading activity compared to the previous year’s highs. Q: Which South Korean crypto exchange grew the most? A: Among major exchanges, Bithumb showed the strongest growth, increasing its trading volume by 11%. Coinone also performed well with a 10% increase. Q: What happened to Upbit’s trading volume? A: Upbit, while remaining the largest exchange, saw its trading volume decrease by 11%, indicating a loss of market share to competitors like Bithumb during this period. Q: How significant is the $1.58 trillion South Korean crypto trading volume? A: It is extremely significant, confirming South Korea as one of the world’s largest and most active retail cryptocurrency markets, even with a slight year-over-year dip. Q: What does Gopax’s 65% volume drop mean? A: Such a steep decline suggests Gopax faced significant challenges, possibly including intense competition, technical issues, or a loss of key trading pairs or user confidence. Q: Will South Korean crypto trading volume recover? A> Most analysts expect a recovery, especially if the global crypto market enters a bullish phase and local regulations provide clearer guidelines, boosting both retail and institutional participation.

This significant movement, with the rate currently trading at 1480.58 according to TradingView data, signals important shifts in global currency dynamics. For investors in both traditional forex and cryptocurrency markets, understanding this development is crucial. What Does the Won-Dollar Exchange Rate Hitting 1480 Mean? When the won-dollar exchange rate climbs, it means the South Korean won is weakening against the US dollar. This movement to 1480 represents an 8-month high for the dollar’s value against the won. Several factors typically drive such movements: US Federal Reserve policies regarding interest rates South Korea’s economic indicators and export performance Global risk sentiment affecting emerging market currencies Capital flows between different markets and asset classes The timing is particularly noteworthy as markets navigate year-end positioning and prepare for 2024 monetary policy expectations. Why Should Crypto Investors Care About Forex Movements? You might wonder why cryptocurrency enthusiasts should monitor traditional won-dollar exchange rate movements. The connection is stronger than many realize. South Korea has consistently been one of the most active cryptocurrency trading markets globally, often showing premium prices compared to other exchanges. When the won weakens significantly against the dollar, several dynamics emerge: Korean investors may seek cryptocurrency as a potential hedge against currency depreciation Arbitrage opportunities can appear between Korean and international exchanges Market sentiment in one of crypto’s most active markets can influence global prices Trading volumes on Korean exchanges often correlate with won volatility Therefore, this forex development isn’t just about traditional currencies—it has real implications for digital asset markets. Historical Context: When Was the Last Time We Saw This Level? The last time the won-dollar exchange rate reached the 1480 level was on April 9 of this year. Since then, the rate has fluctuated within a range, making this breakthrough particularly significant. Historical patterns suggest that once key psychological levels break, further movement often follows. Market analysts will be watching several key indicators: Whether the rate sustains above 1480 or retreats Bank of Korea’s potential response to currency weakness Impact on South Korean import/export businesses Effects on inflation and consumer purchasing power Understanding this historical context helps investors make more informed decisions about both forex and related cryptocurrency positions. Practical Implications for Traders and Investors For active traders monitoring the won-dollar exchange rate , this development offers both challenges and opportunities. The currency pair’s volatility creates trading possibilities, but also increases risk. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency traders should watch Korean exchange premiums and volumes closely. Consider these actionable insights: Monitor Korean crypto exchanges like Upbit and Bithumb for unusual activity Watch for arbitrage signals between global and Korean crypto prices Consider broader market implications for emerging market currencies Stay informed about central bank statements from both South Korea and the US Successful navigation of these markets requires understanding how traditional forex movements interact with cryptocurrency dynamics. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for the Won-Dollar Pair? The critical question now is whether the won-dollar exchange rate will continue its upward trajectory or find resistance around current levels. Several factors will determine the next move, including upcoming economic data, central bank communications, and global market sentiment. Key levels to watch include: Resistance around the 1500 psychological level Support near previous highs around 1460 Moving averages that might indicate trend strength Volume patterns confirming the breakout’s validity As we approach year-end, currency markets often experience increased volatility, making careful risk management essential for all market participants. Conclusion: Navigating Currency Volatility in Global Markets The won’s slide against the dollar to the 1480 level marks a significant moment for currency markets with ripple effects across asset classes. This development reminds us that in today’s interconnected financial world, movements in traditional forex markets can significantly impact cryptocurrency dynamics. By understanding these connections, investors can make more informed decisions and potentially identify opportunities others might miss. Frequently Asked Questions What does a higher won-dollar exchange rate mean? A higher won-dollar exchange rate means the South Korean won is weakening against the US dollar.

High-quality, well-supported digital tokens are the only type that will be approved under the new rules expected to come into force in 2026. The central bank hopes that stablecoins will be operated like real money, rather than investment products that could pose risks to financial stability. Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem said that all stablecoins must be safe, reliable, and trusted by users. People must be confident they can always redeem them at full value, even during periods of market stress. On Tuesday, speaking at the Montreal Chamber of Commerce, he said that digital money should meet the same standards as cash and bank deposits, and that technology is only welcome if it enhances financial stability and public trust. Bank of Canada sets strict requirements for stablecoins The Bank of Canada envisions a one-to-one peg model for stablecoins. Macklem said that if a bank is allowed to issue a stablecoin, that currency must be linked to a currency issued by a central bank, such as the digital coin must always equal $1 Canadian. This peg would need to be backed by solid liquid assets that are readily convertible into cash. By that standard, then, Treasury bills and government bonds would presumably meet the criteria, while riskier bets are likely outside those bounds. The measures are supported by Canada’s 2025 federal budget, which was published in early November. Among other measures, the proposal outlines requirements that stablecoin issuers must meet, including holding 100% reserves and maintaining transparent conditions for redemptions. Issuers will also be required to maintain strong, effective risk management frameworks that are capable of mitigating the risk of a sudden failure or run event involving stablecoins. It also has data privacy at its core. The draft rules focus on protecting personal and financial information, as well as ensuring strong cybersecurity and operational resilience. Canadian regulators are attempting to prevent the site meltdowns and investor losses that other jurisdictions have experienced, with a focus on consumer protection at the core of their approach. Stablecoin rules align with broader financial reforms The stablecoin push is part of a broader effort to modernize Canada’s financial system, with the government and the central bank aiming to make digital payments faster, cheaper, and more secure for a population of over 40 million. Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem said they are levelling the playing field by ensuring Canadians can reliably benefit from innovation in stablecoins, stressing the reforms are designed to support both innovation and trust. Some industry players said the changes could reshape the digital finance landscape in the country. Proposed rules could fundamentally change how Canadians use money and the internet in the long run, said Lucas Matheson, Chief Executive of Coinbase Canada. The country’s policy also comes amid increasing international momentum. Matheson remarks intensified ongoing regulatory work, which has gained momentum in the wake of the United States’ approval of the GENIUS Act in July. Additionally, recent months have seen UK and Hong Kong regulators advancing stablecoin frameworks. The setting is a rapidly expanding market. The total value of global stablecoins is currently around $313.6 billion, according to the US Treasury’s estimates, which suggest it could balloon to $2 trillion by 2028. Canada is beginning to respond – and not just through regulation. There’s also a Real-Time Rail payments system under construction, which will enable businesses and consumers to make instantaneous settlements, and an open banking framework that aims to simplify the process of switching banks and encourage greater competition. At the same time, Canada has chosen not to issue its own digital currency for the time being. A CBDC was shelved in September 2024, when Macklem said there was no strong reason to proceed. Instead, Canada is focusing on creating clear rules for private digital money systems, based on the idea that any stablecoin operating in the country should act like cash to some degree.

55901458,645693,1765940415,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55901458.jpeg,"Why Bitcoin’s Current Weakness Is Structural, Not Emotional",https://bitcoinist.com/why-bitcoins-current-weakness-structural-emotional/,"Bitcoin has lost the critical $90,000 level and is now hovering near the $86,000 area, a zone that is quickly becoming the last meaningful support in the current structure. The recent decline has unfolded with little resistance from buyers, as bullish participation has largely disappeared from the market. Momentum-driven demand has faded, spot buying remains weak, and rallies are consistently being sold. As a result, a growing number of analysts are openly shifting their outlook toward a bear market scenario. According to a recent report by on-chain analyst Axel Adler, conditions beneath the surface reinforce this pessimistic view. Derivatives positioning remains firmly negative, indicating that short sellers continue to dominate short-term market dynamics. At the same time, market sentiment metrics have fallen to levels historically associated with major capitulation phases. Fear is widespread, confidence is fragile, and risk appetite across crypto markets is clearly deteriorating. The combination of negative futures positioning and extreme investor fear creates a challenging environment for Bitcoin. Rather than signaling an immediate bottom, these conditions suggest that selling pressure remains structurally embedded in the market. Futures Positioning And Sentiment Signal Deep Stress Adler explains that the Bitcoin Positioning Index provides a clear view of who controls the derivatives market. The indicator aggregates changes in open interest and funding rates to identify the dominant direction of futures positioning. At present, the index sits at -4, firmly in negative territory. This reading corresponds to a bearish regime and aligns with an active downtrend signal. Visually, the chart is dominated by purple bars over the past four weeks, highlighting sustained pressure from short positions and a lack of bullish conviction in derivatives markets. Negative positioning combined with falling prices confirms that bears remain in control of short-term market dynamics. According to Adler, a meaningful regime shift will only occur if the index returns above zero and the price consolidates above local resistance levels. Without that confirmation, downside risk remains elevated. The Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index reinforces this bearish backdrop. The index, which tracks market sentiment from extreme fear to extreme greed, has fallen deep into the extreme fear zone and well below the 25th percentile. The 30-day SMA has dropped to 20, while the 90-day SMA sits near 32, signaling persistent sentiment deterioration since September. While extreme fear alone does not guarantee a reversal, its alignment with negative futures positioning suggests that selling pressure is structural rather than purely emotional. Bitcoin Tests Critical Support As Downtrend Persists The chart shows Bitcoin trading under sustained technical pressure after failing to reclaim higher levels. Price has decisively broken below the medium-term moving averages and is now consolidating around the $87,000–$88,000 zone, a level that previously acted as support during the mid-cycle advance. The rejection from the blue moving average signals that bullish momentum has weakened significantly, while the downward slope confirms a loss of trend strength. More importantly, Bitcoin is now hovering just above the red long-term moving average, a level that historically acts as a key structural support during broader corrections. The recent bounce from the $85,000–$86,000 area suggests that buyers are still present, but the response lacks conviction. Volume remains muted compared to earlier distribution phases, indicating hesitation rather than aggressive accumulation. Structurally, the sequence of lower highs since the $120,000 peak remains intact. Until Bitcoin can reclaim the $92,000–$95,000 range and hold above the declining mid-term average, downside risks persist. A clean loss of the long-term support could expose deeper retracement levels toward the low $80,000s. In the short term, this price behavior reflects a market in repair mode. Bitcoin is no longer trending, but it has not yet shown the strength required to invalidate the corrective structure.

The 62-page analysis predicts significant growth for both the platform and its native token over the next decade, painting a bullish outlook for investors. Hyperliquid As ‘The Exchange Of All Exchanges’ As detailed in the report, Hyperliquid operates as a decentralized exchange specializing in trading perpetual futures and is built on a custom layer-1 blockchain. Currently, HYPE has a fully diluted market cap of approximately $15.8 billion. Year-to-date (YTD) 2025, the platform has generated an impressive $874 million in fees from a staggering $2.947 trillion in trading volume. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bottom Forecast: Top Expert Predicts $40,000 Target Next Year, Here’s The Analysis A key feature that makes HYPE particularly attractive, and highlighted in the report, is its unique fee structure: approximately 99% of all fees generated by the protocol are allocated to repurchasing and burning the underlying token. This mechanism not only supports the value of HYPE but also reduces its circulating supply. In early 2025 alone, about 2.6% of all HYPE tokens expected to be in circulation, or roughly 5% of the current supply, were repurchased and burned. With the anticipation of new product launches, Cantor Fitzgerald views HYPE as “the exchange of all exchanges” and believes there’s a realistic path for annual fees to soar to $5 billion within the next decade. Why Market Dynamics Favor HYPE When it comes to the platform’s native token, HYPE has successfully captured considerable market share and emerged as one of the standout products in the cryptocurrency space over the past year. In addition to perpetual trading, Hyperliquid has launched spot trading and HIP-3 markets, enabling users to create new markets for a variety of assets including stocks and commodities. Cantor Fitzgerald’s report emphasizes that the immediate determinant of HYPE’s market price will hinge on industry sentiment regarding competition. The ability of emerging rivals to challenge HYPE and affect its fee-generating capacity is paramount. However, the report argues that current fears surrounding competition may be overstated. It posits that “point tourists”—those who shift from platform to platform seeking incentives—are likely to return to the platform offering the deepest liquidity and best execution, which, according to Cantor Fitzgerald, is Hyperliquid. A mere 1% increase in market share from CEX competitors in the perpetuals sector could translate to approximately $600 billion in trading volume. Based on existing perpetual fee rates, this could result in an additional $272 million in annual fees. By applying a conservative 25x valuation multiple to these fees, the potential market capitalization would rise to $6.8 billion. HYPE Price To Reach $271? Assuming moderate share gains over the next decade—projecting around 17% in perpetual trades and 18% in spot trading—Hyperliquid’s annual fees could surpass the $5 billion mark. A conservative valuation multiple of 25x, this would suggest a future market capitalization of approximately $125 billion. Given that nearly all generated fees will be used to repurchase HYPE tokens, a large portion of the circulating supply could potentially be bought back by the time the platform reaches these fee levels. With a forecasted expansion of the fully diluted market cap from roughly $15.8 billion today to $125 billion in the future, combined with a declining supply of HYPE tokens, the projected share price is poised to increase at an even faster pace. Related Reading: XRP Price Forecast: Key Factors That Could Propel It To $3 In Early 2026 If 20% of the Hyperliquid token float is repurchased—valued at around $3.5 billion today—the report suggests that the HYPE price could reach $271 at a fully diluted valuation of $125 billion. The projections suggest that if HYPE captures just 1% of the market share annually and maintains consistent trading volumes from CEXs, the price of HYPE could grow substantially. By year 10, the asset manager believes that circulating supply could decrease from 577.2 million to approximately 144.9 million, while the market cap could remain around $16.1 billion based on conservative fee estimates excluding spot and HIP-3 revenues. At the time of writing, Hyperliquid’s native token is trading at $26.49, having recorded major losses of almost 32% over the past month. This represents a 55% gap from the current trading levels and the all-time high of $59.30.

ETH is now consolidating and might soon aim to start a recovery wave if it clears $3,025. Ethereum started a fresh decline below the $3,050 zone. The price is trading below $3,000 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,110 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it settles below the $2,900 zone. Ethereum Price Starts Consolidation Ethereum price failed to stay above $3,050 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin . ETH price dipped below $3,020 and $3,000 to enter a bearish zone. The bears even pushed the price below $2,920. A low was formed at $2,875 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor recovery toward the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,175 swing high to the $2,875 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $3,000 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . Besides, there is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,110 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. If there is another upward move, the price could face resistance near the $2,975 level. The next key resistance is near the $3,025 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,175 swing high to the $2,875 low. The first major resistance is near the $3,050 level. A clear move above the $3,050 resistance might send the price toward the $3,110 resistance and the trend line. An upside break above the $3,110 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,200 resistance zone or even $3,250 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,025 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,920 level. The first major support sits near the $2,900 zone. A clear move below the $2,900 support might push the price toward the $2,840 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,800 region.

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000359. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000583 and an average trading price of $0.000560 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1?

Support at $0.000041–0.000042 is critical. Without a reclaim of $0.000046 and above, sellers continue to hold their place. FLOKI on the daily timeframe On the 1-day timeframe for December 17, FLOKI is trading around $0.0000426, sitting below the mid Bollinger Band near $0.0000466 and closer to the lower band around $0.0000417, which signals persistent downside pressure rather than mean reversion strength. The price has been making lower highs since the rejection near $0.000051–0.000052, confirming a short-term downtrend. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The RSI is hovering in the high-30s to low-40s, showing weak momentum without yet being deeply oversold, meaning bears still have room to push. The MACD remains negative with a flat histogram, implying selling pressure is slowing but not reversing. A clean daily close below $0.0000415 would expose $0.000039–$0.000040 next, while bulls need to reclaim $0.000046–0.000047 to neutralize the structure. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe On the 4-hour timeframe, FLOKI remains firmly below the Alligator averages, with price capped under $0.0000435–0.0000445, reinforcing bearish trend alignment. The recent bounce from the $0.0000418–0.0000420 area failed to break structure, forming a lower high instead. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The MACD is flattening near the zero line, hinting at short-term stabilization, but OBV continues to trend lower, confirming that buying interest is weak and rallies are being sold into. As long as the price holds below $0.0000445, upside attempts appear corrective rather than impulsive, while a breakdown below $0.0000420 increases the likelihood of a continuation toward $0.000040.

Traders can expect continued choppy downside or sideways-to-bearish price action in the near term, unless bulls decisively reclaim the mid-$0.00004s with volume. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~11x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a market cap of up to $95 to $100 billion to hit $0.01, over 95x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

If you’re trading leveraged positions, these numbers are a stark warning. Over $105 million in Ethereum (ETH) long positions were wiped out, while Bitcoin (BTC) shorts faced a $61.81 million reckoning. This wave of crypto liquidations reveals intense market pressure and shifting sentiment. Let’s break down what happened and, more importantly, what it means for your strategy. What Triggered This Wave of Crypto Liquidations? Forced liquidations occur when a trader’s leveraged position is automatically closed because they can’t meet the margin requirements. This typically happens during sharp, unexpected price movements. The recent data shows a clear pattern: ETH longs and BTC shorts bore the brunt of the pain. This suggests the market moved against these popular bets. For instance, if ETH’s price dropped swiftly, those betting on a rise (longs) got liquidated. Conversely, if BTC’s price rallied, those betting on a fall (shorts) were caught out. Understanding this mechanism is crucial. Crypto liquidations aren’t just individual losses; they can create a cascading effect. As large positions get liquidated, they create additional selling or buying pressure, which can trigger more liquidations. This domino effect amplifies market volatility, creating opportunities and risks. Breaking Down the Damage: ETH, BTC, and Beyond The scale of the damage was significant and tells a story of two different market narratives. Ethereum (ETH): A staggering $105 million was liquidated. The critical detail is that 69.92% of these were long positions. This indicates a strong downward price move that crushed bullish traders. Bitcoin (BTC): Here, $61.81 million was liquidated, but with a twist. 66.74% were short positions. This points to a price surge that overwhelmed traders betting on a decline. Other Assets (e.g., PIPPIN): The data also shows $10.90 million in liquidations for other tokens like PIPPIN, with shorts making up 54.55%. This highlights how crypto liquidations can ripple across the entire market, not just the majors. How Can Traders Navigate This Volatility? Seeing such figures can be intimidating, but they offer valuable lessons. First, this event underscores the extreme risk of high leverage in a volatile market. A small price move against your position can result in a total loss. Therefore, managing your risk is non-negotiable. Here are actionable steps to consider: Use Stop-Loss Orders: Always set stop-losses to define your maximum loss before entering a trade. Employ Sensible Leverage: Avoid maximum leverage. Using 2x or 3x instead of 10x or 20x gives your position room to breathe. Monitor Funding Rates: Extremely high positive or negative funding rates in perpetual futures markets can signal overcrowded trades, often preceding a squeeze and potential crypto liquidations . Diversify Strategies: Don’t put all your capital into one directional bet, especially using leverage. What Do These Massive Crypto Liquidations Signal for the Market? Large-scale liquidations often act as a contrarian indicator or a market reset. They can flush out weak hands and excessive leverage, sometimes leading to a short-term price reversal. For example, after a long squeeze (like with ETH), selling pressure may temporarily exhaust itself. Similarly, a short squeeze (like with BTC) can force shorts to buy back, fueling the rally further. However, it’s not a guaranteed signal. The underlying market trend and broader macroeconomic factors remain the primary drivers. Treat these crypto liquidations as a high-resolution snapshot of market stress and positioning, not a crystal ball. Conclusion: Respect the Market’s Power The $105M ETH long and $61.81M BTC short liquidations are a powerful reminder of the cryptocurrency market’s raw force. They highlight the double-edged sword of leverage: immense opportunity paired with existential risk. By understanding what causes these events, analyzing the data they produce, and implementing strict risk management, you can navigate these turbulent waters more safely. The goal isn’t to avoid volatility but to survive and thrive within it. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are crypto liquidations? Crypto liquidations happen when an exchange automatically closes a trader’s leveraged position because they have lost the collateral (margin) needed to keep it open. This prevents the trader’s account from going negative. Why did ETH long positions get liquidated? ETH long positions were liquidated because the price of Ethereum likely fell sharply. Traders who borrowed money to bet on a price increase (go long) got caught when the market moved against them, triggering margin calls. What is a short squeeze? A short squeeze occurs when the price of an asset rises rapidly, forcing traders who bet on a price drop (shorts) to buy back the asset to close their positions. This buying pressure can fuel the rally even higher, which is what the BTC liquidation data suggests may have happened. How can I avoid getting liquidated? To avoid liquidation, use lower leverage, always set stop-loss orders, never invest more than you can afford to lose, and constantly monitor your margin ratio. Ensure you have additional capital ready to add as margin if needed. Are large liquidations bullish or bearish? They can be both. Large liquidations can remove excess leverage from the market, potentially leading to a price reversal. A long liquidation flush might be followed by a bounce, while a short squeeze can lead to a sustained rally. Context is key. Where can I track liquidation data? You can track real-time and historical liquidation data on websites like Coinglass, Bybit, and Binance. These platforms provide charts showing liquidations across various exchanges and cryptocurrencies. Share Your Thoughts Did this analysis help you understand the recent market moves?

This planned pause is a standard operational procedure to facilitate a significant network upgrade. If you trade or hold LUNC, here’s everything you need to know to navigate this brief hiatus smoothly and securely. Why is Binance Suspending LUNC Transactions? Binance will temporarily suspend deposits and withdrawals for Terra Classic (LUNC) starting at 2:10 p.m. UTC on December 18. The primary reason for this action is to support an upcoming network upgrade on the Terra Classic blockchain. Therefore, this Binance LUNC suspension is a proactive measure to ensure the safety of user funds and the technical integrity of the integration during the upgrade process. Exchanges like Binance often halt external wallet movements during such events to prevent transaction errors or potential loss of funds that could occur if the network rules change mid-process. It’s a standard industry practice that prioritizes security over convenience for a short period. What Does This Binance LUNC Suspension Mean for You? Understanding the scope of this suspension is crucial for managing your assets. Here’s a breakdown of what will and won’t be affected: Deposits and Withdrawals (Suspended): You will not be able to move LUNC tokens into or out of your Binance spot wallet from an external wallet. Trading (Unaffected): Importantly, the suspension does not impact trading. You can still buy, sell, and trade LUNC against other pairs on the Binance spot market during this time. Existing Holdings (Safe): Your LUNC tokens stored in your Binance wallet remain secure and unaffected. The key takeaway is that while external transfers are paused, all other functions within the Binance ecosystem continue as normal. How to Prepare for the Temporary Binance LUNC Halt A little preparation can prevent last-minute stress. Follow these simple steps before the suspension window begins: Complete Planned Transfers Early: If you need to deposit LUNC to Binance for trading or withdraw to a private wallet, do so well before the 2:10 p.m. UTC deadline on December 18. Do Not Panic Sell: Remember, this is a temporary, planned technical procedure. It is not a reflection on LUNC’s value or a reaction to market conditions. Avoid making impulsive trading decisions based on the suspension alone. Monitor Official Channels: For the most accurate updates on when services will resume, keep an eye on the official Binance Announcements page . What Happens After the Network Upgrade? Once the Terra Classic network upgrade is successfully completed and validated by the Binance team, the exchange will reopen deposits and withdrawals for LUNC. They will make a public announcement to confirm the resumption of services. There is typically no need for users to take any action on their end; the wallet will simply become active again. These upgrades are generally positive, often bringing improvements such as: Enhanced network security and stability. Improved transaction efficiency. New features or protocol adjustments. Consequently, this brief Binance LUNC suspension is a step toward a more robust infrastructure for the asset. Final Summary: A Routine Step for Progress In summary, the temporary Binance LUNC suspension is a controlled, security-focused event tied to a network upgrade. While it briefly pauses external token movements, trading continues uninterrupted, and user funds remain safe. By planning your transfers ahead of time and relying on official information, you can easily manage this short operational window. Ultimately, such upgrades are essential for the long-term health and evolution of blockchain networks like Terra Classic. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I still trade LUNC on Binance during the suspension? A1: Yes. The suspension only affects deposits and withdrawals from external wallets. All trading activities for LUNC on the Binance spot market will continue as normal. Q2: How long will the Binance LUNC suspension last? A2: Binance has not specified an exact end time. The suspension will last for the duration required to safely implement and verify the network upgrade. Services will reopen as soon as possible, announced officially by Binance. Q3: Are my LUNC tokens safe on Binance during this time? A3: Absolutely. Your funds are secure in your Binance wallet. The suspension is a preventative measure to protect users from potential errors during the network transition. Q4: Do I need to move my LUNC tokens before the suspension? A4: No, you do not need to move your tokens if they are already on Binance. You only need to act if you had planned to deposit or withdraw LUNC to or from an external wallet around December 18. Q5: Will this suspension affect the price of LUNC? A5: Such routine technical halts typically have minimal direct impact on price, as they are anticipated and do not affect trading. Any market movement would likely be due to broader sentiment, not the suspension itself. Q6: Where can I get the official update when services resume? A6: The official confirmation will be posted on the Binance Announcements page. Avoid relying on unofficial social media channels for this critical information. Found this guide helpful?

The plan? A permanent burn of all HYPE tokens currently held in its community Aid Fund (AF). This isn’t just a routine update; it’s a fundamental vote on scarcity, value, and long-term vision that puts the power directly in the hands of token holders and validators. What Does the HYPE Tokens Burn Proposal Mean? The core of the proposal is straightforward: permanently remove from circulation every HYPE token stored in the foundation’s Aid Fund. Think of a token burn as taking coins out of the total supply forever, like removing them from a digital vault and throwing away the key. This action is often used in cryptocurrency projects to increase scarcity, which can, in theory, support the value of the remaining tokens. The HYPE tokens burn represents a significant commitment, as these funds were originally earmarked for community support and development initiatives. How Does the Governance Vote Work? This is where the community’s voice becomes critical. The Hyperliquid Foundation has initiated a formal vote, and the process is transparent. Validators, who help secure the network, must declare their stance on the proposal on the governance forum. They have until 4:00 a.m. UTC on December 21 to make their position known. The final outcome won’t be a simple majority of validators. Instead, it will be determined by the weight of user-staked tokens. This means: Users who have staked their HYPE tokens with a validator are effectively lending their voting power to that validator’s position. The total amount of staked tokens supporting ‘For’ or ‘Against’ will decide the proposal’s fate. This system ensures that large token holders and the broader staking community have a direct say in this major economic decision. Why Propose a Permanent HYPE Burn Now? While the official proposal outlines the mechanism, the strategic reasons behind a permanent HYPE tokens burn are worth exploring. Such moves are typically designed to signal strong, long-term confidence in the project’s fundamentals. By reducing the total supply, the foundation may aim to create a more deflationary model for HYPE, potentially benefiting all existing holders. It transforms the Aid Fund from a potential source of future selling pressure into a demonstrated commitment to tokenomics. This can be a powerful tool for building trust and aligning the interests of the foundation with those of its community. What Are the Potential Impacts of This Decision? The implications of this vote extend beyond a simple supply reduction. A successful HYPE tokens burn could be interpreted by the market as a profoundly bullish signal. It demonstrates a willingness to make tough, long-term choices over short-term discretionary spending. However, it also means those specific funds are permanently unavailable for future community grants, emergency aid, or development bounties—purposes for which the Aid Fund was originally created. The community must weigh the potential for immediate tokenomic benefits against the loss of a flexible financial resource. Key Questions for Voters to Consider Scarcity vs. Utility: Is creating permanent scarcity more valuable than retaining a fund for ecosystem growth? Market Perception: How will major exchanges and institutional investors view this act of deliberate supply destruction? Precedent: Does this set a responsible precedent for future treasury management? The Final Countdown and Lasting Legacy As the December 21 deadline approaches, all eyes are on the validators and the staking community. This governance vote is a textbook example of decentralized decision-making in action. The choice to execute a permanent HYPE tokens burn is irreversible, making this one of the most consequential votes in Hyperliquid’s recent history. The result will send a clear message about the community’s collective priorities: is it optimized for immediate tokenomics or long-term, flexible governance capital? In conclusion, the Hyperliquid Foundation’s proposal is a defining moment . It moves beyond typical protocol upgrades and touches the core economic engine of the project. Whether the burn proceeds or not, the very act of holding this vote underscores a commitment to transparent, community-led governance. The outcome will not only affect the HYPE token supply chart but will also carve out the strategic identity of the Hyperliquid ecosystem for years to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a token burn? A token burn is the permanent removal of cryptocurrency tokens from circulation. This is typically done by sending them to a verifiable, inaccessible wallet address, often called a ‘burn address,’ making them unusable forever. Who gets to vote on the HYPE burn proposal? The vote is conducted through validators. Users who have staked their HYPE tokens delegate their voting power to the validator they chose. The final decision is based on the total weight of staked tokens aligned with each validator’s ‘For’ or ‘Against’ position. What happens to the HYPE tokens if the burn is approved? If the proposal passes, all HYPE tokens held in the Hyperliquid Foundation’s Aid Fund will be sent to a burn address. They will be permanently destroyed and can never be recovered or spent, reducing the total supply of HYPE. Why would burning tokens be beneficial? Burning tokens reduces the total supply. If demand for the token remains steady or increases, this reduced supply can create scarcity, which is a fundamental economic principle that can positively influence the token’s price and perceived value. What was the Aid Fund originally for? The Aid Fund (AF) was typically a reserve of tokens set aside by the foundation for community initiatives, developer grants, emergency response, and other projects aimed at growing and supporting the ecosystem. Can this decision be reversed later? No. A permanent burn is, by definition, irreversible. The tokens are destroyed completely, which is why this is considered such a significant and final governance decision. Found this deep dive into Hyperliquid’s major governance decision helpful?

The exchange raised $206 million in the IPO after pricing shares at HK$6.68, close to the top of the HK$5.95–HK$6.95 range.It also pulled in about HK$1.6 billion, a big number in a market where crypto assets have been struggling. Mainland China’s full crypto ban has not stopped Hong Kong from leaning into digital assets, but investors clearly wanted more from this debut. The list of early backers was heavy. It included Fidelity, UBS, CDH Investments, and Cithara Fund, while JPMorgan and Guotai Haitong handled bookrunner roles. HashKey CFO Eric Zhu said, “Our mission is to make digital assets massively accessible, and what we are doing is to create a compliant platform to connect our users with the digital assets industry.” Eric also said :- “We are confident that the [crypto] penetration rate in Hong Kong, in the Asian market, is going to catch up with what happens in the U.S.” That confidence did not show up in the stock chart. Asia-Pacific markets react to new data Across the region, markets moved in different directions as investors looked at fresh trade data out of Japan.Japan’s exports for November rose 6.1% year over year, beating the 4.8% forecast from economists. It also came in above the 3.6% recorded the month before. The Nikkei 225 stayed flat, while the Topix slipped 0.25%. South Korea’s Kospi climbed 0.72%, and the Kosdaq added 0.19%. Japan also saw a major banking move, with SBI Shinsei Bank jumping more than 12% after a 322 billion yen IPO priced at 1,450 yen per share. Export data showed a 23.6% rise in goods shipped to Western Europe and an 8.8% rise in exports to the U.S., marking the first U.S. export increase since March. Auto exports fell 4.1% by value, yet shipments to the U.S. grew 1.5% year over year. Revised GDP numbers showed Japan shrinking 0.6% in Q3 and 2.3% on an annualized basis.Shipments to mainland China dropped 2.4%, while exports to Hong Kong jumped 11.4% compared to last year. “Foodstuff” exports to China fell 5.9%, adding to a tense month between both countries after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said a Chinese attempt to take Taiwan by force could push Japan’s military to step in. Beijing reacted by limiting seafood imports. Imports into Japan rose 1.3%, missing the 2.5% forecast. Even with the trade friction, business sentiment looked better, with the Bank of Japan’s latest Tankan survey showing stronger views among firms, especially small manufacturers. Regional indexes move as oil jumps on Trump order Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.25%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched up 0.18% to 25,280.13.The CSI 300 on the mainland dipped slightly.South Korea’s Kospi closed at 4,028.17, up 0.73%.

Equity markets remained measured across the region after a mixed US jobs report and soft purchasing managers’ data left investors debating whether growth is cooling fast enough to justify easier policy. Akshat Siddhant, lead quant analyst at Mudrex, said “Despite this uncertainty, Bitcoin exchange reserves sitting at record lows have supported the upside, giving bulls an edge. Attention now turns to the upcoming CPI data, which will shape expectations around a potential Fed rate cut.” “If momentum holds, BTC could advance toward $90,000, with support gradually moving higher to the $86,000 zone,” he added.

Technology shares helped lift sentiment after a bruising stretch. South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.6% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 0.3%, as buyers returned to large-cap tech names and the broader AI complex. Some of that lift spilled into the robotaxi theme in Hong Kong. Pony AI and WeRide climbed more than 3% each, tracking strength in Tesla after chief executive Elon Musk said the carmaker was testing robotaxis with no human safety drivers. On Wall Street, the Nasdaq finished Tuesday higher and the S&P 500 and Dow ended lower, with healthcare and energy weighing. Investors parsed delayed economic releases after a recent government shutdown slowed data collection, and the market treated the numbers as directionally useful rather than definitive. Payroll Surprise Fails To Ease Growth Concerns A Labor Department report showed nonfarm payrolls rose by 64,000 jobs in November after an October drop linked to government spending cuts, and the unemployment rate climbed to 4.6%. Separate figures showed retail sales were flat in October, slightly below economists’ expectations. Nic Puckrin, an investment analyst and co-founder of Coin Bureau, said year-end tax-loss selling is adding pressure, with Bitcoin among the assets where many investors are sitting on losses. He said that dynamic could weigh on prices into the end of 2025 and leaves room for a slide below $80,000 if the sell-off deepens. In the near-term, he pointed to the ETF cost basis around $83,800 as a key level, with further support near $81,200, which he described as the market’s true mean. Japan Gains On Trade Data As Rate Hike Bets Build In Greater China, the Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 rose 0.5% and the Shanghai Composite stayed flat, as investors waited for clearer signs of fiscal support from Beijing after a run of soft November data. Elsewhere, Australia’s ASX 200 dipped 0.2% and Singapore’s Straits Times index fell 0.3%, and data showed Singapore’s non-oil exports rose in November. Japan’s Nikkei 225 added 0.3% and the broader Topix gained 0.1% after trade data showed exports beat expectations, a signal that overseas demand is supporting growth into year-end. Traders also watched the Bank of Japan ahead of Friday’s policy decision, with markets leaning toward a rate increase as the yen stays weak and inflation remains sticky. US rate expectations also sat under a leadership storyline, after the Wall Street Journal reported President Donald Trump is set to interview Fed Governor Christopher Waller on Wednesday for the chair role, adding another variable to a week already driven by CPI risk.

This partnership aims to unlock new financial avenues for Japanese corporations through innovative Bitcoin staking and BTCFi solutions. Let’s explore what this alliance means for the future of digital assets in Japan. What Does This Strategic Partnership Entail? Animoca Brands Japan, a key subsidiary of the global Web3 leader, is joining forces with Babylon Labs, a pioneer in Bitcoin staking protocols. Their primary goal is to explore and support self-custody Bitcoin finance (BTCFi) for businesses in Japan. The collaboration will leverage Babylon Labs’ core technology: a trustless Bitcoin vault. This system allows users to stake their Bitcoin to help secure other proof-of-stake blockchains without giving up custody of their assets. Therefore, Japanese corporations can potentially earn yield on their Bitcoin holdings while maintaining full control. This addresses a major concern for institutional players wary of third-party custody risks. The partnership signifies a focused effort to bridge traditional corporate finance with the evolving world of decentralized finance (DeFi). Why Is Bitcoin Staking a Game-Changer for Japan? Japan has a unique and strictly regulated cryptocurrency landscape. Its corporations hold significant capital but often face high barriers to engaging with DeFi protocols due to compliance and security concerns. The trustless model of Bitcoin staking promoted by this partnership could be a pivotal solution. Enhanced Security: Babylon’s vault technology eliminates the need to transfer Bitcoin to a custodian, drastically reducing counterparty risk. New Revenue Streams: Corporations can generate yield from idle Bitcoin treasury assets, creating a novel income channel. Regulatory Alignment: The self-custody aspect aligns better with Japan’s stringent financial regulations regarding asset control. Market Education: Animoca’s strong presence can help educate the market on the practical benefits of Bitcoin staking . Moreover, this initiative could accelerate institutional adoption by providing a familiar and secure entry point into more complex crypto-economic activities. What Are the Challenges and Opportunities Ahead? While promising, this venture is not without its hurdles. The regulatory environment for Bitcoin staking and yield-generating activities remains nuanced in Japan. Clear guidelines from authorities will be crucial for widespread corporate adoption. Furthermore, the technical complexity of integrating these vaults with corporate treasury systems presents a practical challenge. However, the opportunities are immense. Animoca Brands Japan brings deep local market knowledge, an extensive network, and a trusted brand. Babylon Labs provides the cutting-edge technical infrastructure. Together, they can create tailored solutions that meet both corporate and regulatory standards. This partnership could position Japan as a leader in institutional-grade Bitcoin utility, setting a template for other regulated markets globally. Conclusion: A Strategic Step Toward Mainstream BTCFi The alliance between Animoca Brands Japan and Babylon Labs is more than a simple agreement; it’s a strategic bridge. It connects the world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, with the sophisticated needs of Japanese institutional finance through the mechanism of Bitcoin staking . By focusing on security, self-custody, and education, this partnership has the potential to unlock billions in corporate capital for the crypto ecosystem. It represents a mature, next-phase approach to blockchain adoption, moving beyond speculation to practical financial utility. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Bitcoin staking? Bitcoin staking, in this context, refers to using Bitcoin as a form of collateral or security to support other blockchain networks. With Babylon’s protocol, you can “stake” your Bitcoin to help secure a proof-of-stake chain without ever transferring it out of your own wallet. What is BTCFi? BTCFi stands for Bitcoin Finance. It encompasses all financial applications and services built around Bitcoin, enabling it to be used for lending, borrowing, earning yield, and more—beyond just holding it as an asset. Why is self-custody important for corporations? Self-custody means the asset holder retains full control of their private keys. For corporations, this reduces legal, operational, and counterparty risks associated with entrusting assets to a third-party custodian, which is often a regulatory preference. What does Animoca Brands Japan bring to the partnership? Animoca Brands Japan brings crucial local expertise, a strong regulatory understanding, and an established network of partners and clients in the Japanese Web3 and corporate sectors. Is Bitcoin staking available in Japan now? The partnership is currently at the MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) stage, meaning the companies are formally exploring and developing these services. Widespread availability will follow further development and regulatory engagement. How does this differ from Ethereum staking? Ethereum staking involves locking ETH directly into the Ethereum network’s consensus mechanism. Babylon’s Bitcoin staking allows Bitcoin to be used to secure other, separate blockchains while the Bitcoin itself remains on its native chain.

This decision reflects growing confidence in ETH security, scalability, ecosystem maturity, and qualities that institutional investors and asset managers increasingly demand when moving regulated financial instruments onto public blockchains. How The New On-Chain Settlement Improves Operational Efficiency The largest money whale in institutional finance just made its biggest move by launching a new money market fund on Ethereum, and it’s coming from J.P. Morgan Asset Management. According to an analyst known as Milk Road on X, the company oversees roughly $4 trillion in client assets, and seeds these funds with $100 million of its own capital before opening them up to the public. This fund is called My On-Chain Net Yield Fund (MONY), which is similar to a normal money market fund. Related Reading: Ethereum Emerges As A Dollar Settlement Powerhouse, Outpacing Traditional Payment Networks – Details It is set to hold assets designed to preserve capital and remain liquid. A key difference between the fund and others is that shares are issued and tracked on ETH using JPMorgan’s Kinexys platform. The feature allows the fund to settle faster, issue and redeem shares continuously, and transfer ownership without waiting on the traditional clearing system. Furthermore, this product is limited to large investors, individuals with at least $5 million investments, and institutions with $25 million, including a $1 million minimum to get started. The risk profile and purpose are familiar, and it’s a safe yield for investors. Meanwhile, for JPMorgan, this is a major operational upgrade offering faster cash transactions, tighter integration with treasury systems, and smoother collateral movement. Larger asset managers are starting by moving the safest, most conservative products on-chain first, because that’s where efficiency gains would show up immediately. “Adoption is accelerating,” Milk Road noted. Why Ethereum Is More Than Just Technology According to AdrianoFeria, the world’s greatest misunderstanding of Ethereum is viewing it solely as a technology. AdrianoFeria has pointed out that ETH is a network of economic actors coordinating around shared rules. It is also a social contract and a system that is designed to enable collaboration in the most adverse situations. Related Reading: Here’s Why Ethereum Emerges As The Global Capital Rails For On-Chain Finance At the core, ETH functions as a global and neutral arbitrator. Over time, it has proven itself to be the most long-standing, reliable, and trustworthy neutral arbitrator in the world. This arbitrator is the most valuable aspect of ETH, and any valuable model must account for it to have a chance of estimating realistic ETH price targets. “If you are stuck with a cash flow-centric valuation for ETH, then it is time to sit down and study the system more deeply, and if you believe cash flow explains most of ETH’s value, you haven’t dug deep enough,” the expert mentioned.

The initiative is designed to help banks, fintechs, merchants, and other large companies explore how stablecoins can be used for payments, treasury operations, and other business processes. The program combines market research, technology integration support, and training to give clients practical guidance as they test and adopt stablecoin solutions. Visa Expands Advisory Services Sources indicate the advisory practice will provide market-fit assessments, strategy development, go-to-market planning, and technical enablement. Visa has even launched a specialized stablecoin course via Visa University to train clients on the fundamentals and practical application of these digital assets. The service aims to help organizations move from pilot programs to fully operational stablecoin systems while maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements. BREAKING: Visa launches Stablecoin Advisory Practice Every bank is asking the same question right now: “What’s our stablecoin strategy?” And when they don’t know the answer, who do they call? Their card network. — Visa just formalized what was probably happening… — Simon Taylor (@sytaylor) December 15, 2025 Early Clients And Market Context Based on reports , several US financial institutions are among the first clients, including Navy Federal Credit Union, VyStar Credit Union, and Pathward. The digital payments technology company has reported that its stablecoin settlement volume has reached an annualized run rate of roughly $3.5 billion as of late November 2025. The company supports over 130 stablecoin-linked card programs across more than 40 countries. The overall stablecoin market has surpassed $250 billion in total value, highlighting strong interest from both retail and institutional participants. Partnerships And Pilot Programs Reports show Visa has been piloting stablecoin settlements for several years, including early work with USDC in 2023. Partnerships with firms like Aquanow have expanded settlement capabilities in regions such as Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Visa also experimented with initiatives allowing businesses to make cross-border payments using stablecoins for pre-funding, in an effort to lower transaction costs and manage liquidity. The Importance And Rise Of Stablecoins According to analysts quoted in news reports, the use of stablecoins by banks and fintechs for various purposes such as cross-border payments and business-to-business payments is being explored. The advisory service offered by Visa assists the traditional firm in understanding the options available to them while implementing controls and incorporating new technology into existing payment systems. Such overall expertise in technology and regulations puts the company on their advisory panel to pilot their stablecoin offering.

While AAVE’s price reaction was modest, the closure still removes a long-standing regulatory overhang for the company and its token. Aave Escapes Enforcement Aave founder and CEO Stani Kulechov said the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ended a four-year investigation into the decentralized finance protocol. The disclosure was made in a Tuesday post on X , where Kulechov shared a letter dated Aug. 12 from the SEC stating that the agency does “not intend to recommend an enforcement action” against Aave. The language in the letter suggests that Aave was under the threat of potential enforcement action after a probe that was initiated roughly four years ago, during a time when US regulators ramped up scrutiny of crypto and decentralized finance platforms. Kulechov welcomed the conclusion of the matter, and described it as an important turning point for the industry. He said the closure of the investigation allows Aave and other developers to move forward “as we enter a new era where developers can truly build the future of finance.” So far, market reaction to the news has been a bit muted. According to CoinMarketCap, the AAVE token rose more than 3% after the announcement was shared, climbing to around $187.85. At press time, the price of AAVE fell to about $186.95. The price move could suggest that investors are relieved and confident after the removal of a major regulatory overhang that lingered over the protocol for many years. AAVE price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The conclusion of the Aave investigation seems to align with a shift in the SEC’s approach to crypto enforcement since US President Donald Trump took office in January. Trump campaigned on reducing regulatory pressure on the digital asset industry, and recent actions by the SEC suggest a softening of its stance. Over the past few months, the regulator has dropped or paused several long-running investigations and legal cases involving major crypto firms, including Uniswap Labs, Gemini and Ripple. That trend was also pointed out in a recent report by The New York Times, which found that since January the SEC paused, dropped, or dismissed roughly 60% of its cases involving cryptocurrency companies and projects.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,AAVE|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-17 05:30:00

According to on-chain data, an address linked to financial services giant Matrixport deposited a staggering 1,000 BTC—worth approximately $86.9 million—to the Binance exchange. This move, occurring in real-time, raises immediate questions about market strategy and potential price implications. What Does This Major Bitcoin Transfer Mean? On-chain analytics platform Onchain-lense flagged the transaction, which happened just minutes before this report. Such a large, single Bitcoin transfer from an institutional player like Matrixport is never just a routine move. It represents a major shift of assets onto a trading platform, which typically signals one of a few intentions. The market is now analyzing whether this is preparation for a sale, a collateral move, or part of a larger institutional strategy. Breaking Down the Matrixport to Binance Transaction Let’s examine the key details of this high-value movement: Volume: 1,000 Bitcoin (BTC) Value: $86.9 million at the time of transfer Destination: Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Source: An address “presumed to belong” to Matrixport based on historical on-chain activity Timing: Executed approximately 12 minutes before initial reporting This Bitcoin transfer is a textbook example of “whale” activity that can influence market sentiment. When large holders move coins to exchanges, it often increases selling pressure, as exchanges provide immediate liquidity. Why Do Large Bitcoin Transfers Matter for Investors? For everyday investors, monitoring these flows is crucial. A major Bitcoin transfer to an exchange can be a leading indicator. However, context is everything. It’s not automatically bearish. The coins could be moved for: OTC Sale: A private, over-the-counter deal settled on an exchange. Collateral: To secure a loan or other financial product. Custody Shift: Simply moving assets between institutional custody solutions. Market Making: Providing liquidity for trading pairs. Therefore, while the transaction is significant, jumping to conclusions without further data can be misleading. The true impact will be revealed by whether the BTC remains on Binance or is quickly withdrawn to cold storage. How to Interpret On-Chain Data Like a Pro This event highlights the power of transparent blockchain data. Anyone can track a Bitcoin transfer of this size. The key for savvy investors is to look for patterns, not single events. Ask these questions: Has this address moved coins before sales or during rallies? Is this part of a larger trend of exchange inflows? What is the current exchange reserve level for Bitcoin? By combining this on-chain data with broader market trends, you get a clearer picture than from a single transaction alone. Conclusion: A Signal to Watch, Not a Reason to Panic In summary, the $86.9 million Bitcoin transfer from a Matrixport-linked address to Binance is a major market event that demands attention. It demonstrates the active movement of institutional capital within the crypto ecosystem. However, it is a single data point in a complex market. Astute investors will use this information to stay informed and watch for confirming signals, rather than making impulsive decisions based on one transaction. The transparency of the Bitcoin blockchain turns every large move into a public lesson in market dynamics. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Does a large Bitcoin transfer to an exchange always mean a price drop? A: Not always. While it can indicate potential selling, large transfers are also made for over-the-counter (OTC) trades, collateralization, or moving funds between custody providers. The key is to watch if the coins are sold on the spot market. Q2: How can we be sure the address belongs to Matrixport? A: On-chain analysts use clustering techniques. They track addresses that have interacted with known, verified Matrixport custody addresses in the past. This creates a “presumed” link based on behavioral patterns, not absolute proof. Q3: What is the best site to track large Bitcoin transfers? A: Several platforms specialize in on-chain analytics, such as Glassnode, CryptoQuant, and Whale Alert. These sites monitor blockchain data and flag large transactions in real-time. Q4: How quickly can a transfer of this size impact the Bitcoin price? A: If the 1,000 BTC were sold all at once on the Binance spot market, it could create significant short-term downward pressure. However, institutional players often use OTC desks or execute sales slowly to minimize market impact. Q5: What should I do as an investor when I see news of a large transfer? A: Don’t react immediately. Use it as a data point. Check if exchange inflows are rising overall, look at order book depth, and consider the broader market trend. One transaction is rarely a standalone buy or sell signal. Q6: Has Matrixport made similar large transfers before? A: As a major institutional player in crypto financial services, Matrixport and similar entities regularly move large sums. Tracking their historical patterns can provide context for whether the current move is unusual. Call to Action Did this analysis help you understand the implications of major Bitcoin movements?

OpenAI allegedly started speaking with Amazon around October, and that timing lines up with the company’s long corporate overhaul that ended with Microsoft owning 27% of the business. That long reset gave OpenAI room to look outward again. Now Amazon is trying to move fast, because everyone in the chip race wants to chip away at Nvidia’s control. Amazon pushes Trainium to rival Nvidia If the deal lands, it will be a milestone for Amazon’s semiconductor group. Nvidia still leads the market and everyone knows it, but developers like Meta are already testing alternatives from Google and others. Amazon wants in. According to Bloomberg, company says Trainium gives cheaper and more efficient compute than Nvidia’s GPUs for the heavy math behind large models, and it’s trying to win over teams who want to trim their bills. Amazon Web Services is still the biggest provider of rented compute and storage.But AWS has not reached that same level with AI developers, and Microsoft’s backing of OpenAI has made the gap feel even wider. Amazon wants a way to move the needle. A major funding tie-up with OpenAI, plus OpenAI using Trainium, would give Amazon something it has been trying to get for years: real weight in model training. OpenAI’s valuation already hit $500 billion in an employee share sale, a number that briefly put it ahead of SpaceX. That kind of jump has made Wall Street nervous. Analysts warn about a bubble because some companies invest in customers only to push those customers to buy more of their own products. It becomes a loop. But for now, the money keeps coming in. Amazon expands chips and models to get more AI customers OpenAI and Amazon also signed another deal last month.AWS will provide $38 billion of cloud power to OpenAI over seven years.That agreement depends on huge batches of Nvidia chips. Amazon is not dropping Nvidia anytime soon, but it wants Trainium in the mix. The new Trainium3 accelerator is now in a few data centers and will open to customers on Tuesday. Dave Brown from AWS said, “As we get into early next year we’ll start to scale out very, very quickly.” He said the pace will match Nvidia’s yearly chip cycle. But Trainium has a weakness. Nvidia has massive software libraries that help teams get started fast. Amazon does not have that yet. Bedrock Robotics uses AWS for compute, but when it trains models to guide construction machines, it switches to Nvidia. CTO Kevin Peterson said, “We need it to be performant and easy to use. That’s Nvidia.” Amazon is also trying to improve its AI models. Its earlier Nova models did not score high in public benchmarks. Rohit Prasad, who oversees model work at Amazon, said, “The real benchmark is the real world,” and he expects newer models to compete. Amazon also built Nova Forge, a tool that lets advanced users customize Nova models while they are still training. Reddit is using it to check rule-breaking posts. CTO Chris Slowe said, “The fact that we can make it an expert in our specific area is where the value comes from.” Join a premium crypto trading community free for 30 days - normally $100/mo.",Business|Nvidia|OpenAI,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-17 05:30:31

This lightning-fast funding round demonstrates the explosive demand for AI-powered customer solutions in today’s digital economy. What Makes MoEngage’s Customer Engagement Platform So Compelling? The latest funding round reveals fascinating details about MoEngage’s financial structure and growth trajectory. About $123 million of the $180 million represents secondary transactions, providing liquidity to early investors and employees through a $15 million employee tender benefiting 259 current and former team members. The remaining $57 million enters the business as primary capital for expansion. This secondary-heavy approach offers significant advantages: Early investors including Eight Roads Ventures, Helion Venture Partners, Z47, and Ventureast can realize returns Employees gain financial rewards for their contributions The company avoids pressure for immediate IPO, maintaining strategic flexibility MoEngage can focus on long-term growth rather than investor exit timelines Strategic Investors Back MoEngage’s Series F Funding Vision The funding round was led by ChrysCapital and Dragon Funds, with participation from Schroders Capital and existing investors TR Capital and B Capital. This diverse investor base reflects confidence in MoEngage’s global potential and business model. Ventureast, which backed MoEngage in 2018, achieved a remarkable 10-times return on investment. Partner Vinay Rao highlighted MoEngage’s competitive advantage: “While many global customer engagement companies operate with cost structures geared toward the U.S. market, MoEngage has retained an India-based cost structure, which has helped it compete more effectively in the U.S. while scaling the business.” How AI Agents Will Transform MoEngage’s Platform MoEngage plans to deploy fresh capital toward ambitious AI expansion. Co-founder and CEO Raviteja Dodda explained the company will invest heavily in its Merlin AI suite and expand AI agents to improve decision-making and efficiency for marketing teams. The company’s AI strategy includes three key components: AI Initiative Purpose Expected Impact Merlin AI Suite Enhancement Advanced customer behavior prediction Improved marketing campaign effectiveness AI Agent Expansion Automated decision-making support Increased team efficiency and reduced manual work Strategic AI Team Acquisitions Bolstering intelligence-led offerings Faster product development and innovation Why This Indian Startup Represents a Global Success Story MoEngage’s 11-year journey from Bengalaru to global markets demonstrates how Indian startups can compete internationally. The company maintains dual headquarters in Bengaluru and San Francisco, with revenue distribution showing impressive global reach: Over 30% of revenue from North America Approximately 25% from Europe and the Middle East Remaining 45% from India and Southeast Asia The company is tracking toward $100 million in annualized recurring revenue this year and expects to turn EBITDA positive this quarter. MoEngage targets compound annual growth of about 35% over the next three years. Strategic Expansion Through Acquisitions and Product Bundling MoEngage will use part of its funding to pursue strategic acquisitions, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. The company targets software companies that complement its customer engagement platform or help accelerate expansion in those markets. Additionally, MoEngage is pushing deeper into product and engineering teams by bundling analytics and transactional messaging tools into a broader offering. Dodda explained this strategic shift: “When you look at customer engagement, it is not necessarily focused on marketing teams. There are product and engineering teams, which also focus on how to make sense of customer behavior and data.” This bundling approach is expected to lift average contract values and expand MoEngage’s addressable market significantly. Customer Validation and Future IPO Plans Bhavin Turakhia, co-founder and CEO of fintech firm Zeta (a MoEngage customer), provided real-world validation: “MoEngage’s analytics and messaging tools have helped us improve onboarding, activation, and cross-sell across key customer journeys.” Regarding future plans, Dodda stated the funding “gives us the opportunity not to have an urgency with regard to going IPO,” though the startup still aims to go public in a couple of years, depending on market conditions. With the latest round, MoEngage has raised approximately $307 million in primary funding to date. FAQs About MoEngage’s Funding and Expansion What is MoEngage’s current valuation? The Series F round valued MoEngage at “well over” $900 million post-money, according to sources close to the deal. Who are MoEngage’s key investors? The latest round was led by ChrysCapital and Dragon Funds, with participation from Schroders Capital and existing investors TR Capital and B Capital . Who leads MoEngage? The company is led by co-founder and CEO Raviteja Dodda , who has guided the company through 11 years of growth. What companies use MoEngage? Notable customers include Zeta , with CEO Bhavin Turakhia publicly praising the platform’s effectiveness. What are MoEngage’s revenue targets? The company is tracking toward $100 million in annualized recurring revenue this year and targets 35% compound annual growth over the next three years. Conclusion: A New Benchmark for Indian Startup Success MoEngage’s rapid succession of funding rounds represents more than just financial success—it signals a fundamental shift in how Indian startups can compete and win on the global stage. By combining India’s cost advantages with world-class technology and strategic AI investments, MoEngage has created a blueprint for international expansion that other startups will undoubtedly study and emulate. The company’s focus on providing liquidity to early supporters while maintaining growth momentum demonstrates sophisticated financial strategy rarely seen in startups of this stage.

In a surprising twist, the Indian rupee managed to claw back from its record lows , offering a glimmer of hope in an otherwise turbulent trading session. This volatility presents both danger and opportunity for currency traders navigating these uncertain waters. Why Is Asia FX Under Pressure From US Economic Data? Asian currencies experienced broad-based weakness as traders positioned themselves ahead of the pivotal US non-farm payrolls report. The forex market operates on anticipation, and current sentiment suggests that strong US jobs data could force the Federal Reserve to maintain higher interest rates for longer. This creates a challenging environment for Asia FX as: Higher US rates attract capital away from emerging markets Dollar strength makes Asian exports less competitive Regional central banks face pressure to match US rate hikes The Japanese yen, Chinese yuan, and South Korean won all traded lower against the dollar, reflecting the market’s cautious stance. How Did the Rupee Escape Record Lows Against the Dollar? In a remarkable turnaround, the Indian rupee bounced back from its record lows , demonstrating unexpected resilience. Several factors contributed to this recovery: Factor Impact on Rupee Central Bank Intervention Potential dollar sales to support currency Improved Oil Prices Lower import costs for India’s oil-dependent economy Foreign Investment Flows Increased portfolio investments in Indian markets Technical Correction Oversold conditions triggering automatic buying This recovery in the rupee provides temporary relief but doesn’t eliminate the fundamental challenges facing the currency in the global forex market . What Does US Jobs Data Mean for Currency Trading Strategies? The upcoming US jobs data represents a critical inflection point for currency trading strategies worldwide. Traders are preparing for multiple scenarios: Strong jobs report: Could trigger dollar rally and further Asia FX weakness Weak jobs data: Might ease pressure on Asian currencies as Fed pivot expectations grow Mixed results: Likely to increase volatility across all currency pairs Successful currency trading in this environment requires careful risk management and flexibility to adapt to rapidly changing conditions. Can Asian Currencies Sustain Recovery Amid Global Uncertainty? The broader Asia FX landscape remains fragile despite the rupee’s temporary rebound. Several structural challenges persist: Diverging monetary policies between the US and Asia Persistent inflation concerns in several Asian economies Geopolitical tensions affecting trade flows Slowing global growth reducing export demand The forex market will continue to test these currencies, with the rupee’s ability to maintain its recovery serving as an important indicator of regional resilience. Essential Insights for Navigating Current Forex Market Volatility For traders and investors monitoring the forex market , several actionable insights emerge from current developments: Monitor central bank communications for policy clues Diversify currency exposure to manage risk Use technical levels to identify potential reversal points Stay informed about commodity price movements affecting currency values Prepare for increased volatility around major economic releases FAQs: Understanding the Asia FX and Rupee Movements Which Asian currencies are most affected by US jobs data? The Japanese yen, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee, and South Korean won typically show the strongest reactions to US economic data due to their deep integration with global markets. What role does the Reserve Bank of India play in rupee valuation? The Reserve Bank of India intervenes in currency markets to manage excessive volatility and may use foreign exchange reserves to support the rupee during periods of extreme pressure. How does the Federal Reserve’s policy affect Asia FX? The Federal Reserve sets US interest rates that influence global capital flows. Higher US rates typically strengthen the dollar and weaken Asian currencies as investors seek higher returns in US assets. Which companies benefit from rupee recovery? Indian companies with significant foreign debt, such as Tata Motors and Reliance Industries , benefit from rupee strength as it reduces their repayment burdens in local currency terms. Who monitors these currency movements for policy decisions? Policymakers including International Monetary Fund officials and national central bank governors like the RBI’s Shaktikanta Das closely monitor these developments to inform economic policy decisions. The turbulence in Asia FX markets, punctuated by the rupee’s dramatic recovery from record lows , underscores the high-stakes nature of modern currency trading . As the forex market holds its breath for the US jobs data release, one truth becomes undeniable: in today’s interconnected financial world, economic indicators from one nation can send shockwaves across continents, creating both peril and possibility for alert traders. The rupee’s resilience offers a powerful lesson – even in the face of overwhelming pressure, strategic intervention and market fundamentals can trigger unexpected reversals that reward the prepared and punish the complacent.

55908229,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=879822,1765950337,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55908229.jpeg,"Securitize to offer real, regulated onchain shares starting Q1 2026",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/securitize-to-offer-regulated-onchain-shares/,"Securitize has unveiled plans to issue real, regulated shares onchain that are representative of full shareholder rights, not synthetic price trackers or IOUs against custodians. The compliant shares will be recorded directly on the issuer’s cap table and can be traded through familiar Web3 swap-style experiences. Securitize said the initiative feels like DeFi for investors under the hood, meeting high standards of investor protection, regulatory compliance, and market integrity. The tokenization platform is committed to working with DeFi builders and regulators to integrate public markets with onchain innovation. According to Securitize, the tokenized stocks will attempt to modernize the traditional stock market experience for most investors. However, most of these tokenized products typically offer exposure, rather than ownership. They rely on SPVs, derivatives, or offshore structures that mirror stock prices despite introducing counterparty risk, fragmentation, and inconsistent pricing. In some cases, the issued bearer assets may not be compliant, despite representing securities, as they are issued as permissionless assets without any AML or KYC controls. These instruments do not place investors on the issuer’s cap table, and they do not carry shareholder voting rights. They often rely on legal constructs outside the issuer’s jurisdiction and misrepresent what they are, as they are not tokenized stocks but something else. Stocks on Securitize represent real public company equity Stocks purchased on Securitize are compliantly issued and maintained on-chain, representing genuine public company equity. Investors who buy a stock on Securitize also appear directly on the issuer’s cap table and receive full shareholder rights, including proxy voting and dividend entitlements. The shares exist as tokens under self-custody, and the assets cannot be rehypothecated or lent without the owner’s consent. However, the tokens can be transferred peer-to-peer across whitelisted, compliant wallets. Securitize says this model works because it acts as the U.S. SEC-registered transfer agent. The token itself is the legally recognized share, while blockchain serves as the record of ownership. The architecture was demonstrated in 2024 when the publicly traded Exodus Movement Inc. (NYSE: EXOD) issued its equity natively onchain. However, this model is expected to expand rapidly as investors and issuers experience the actual benefits of onchain ownership. Native issuance provides full onchain tokenized stock trading Natively tokenized public stocks have remained mainly static assets until now. They are issued onchain, held onchain, but traded through traditional off-chain processes if at all. However, with this launch, natively tokenized public stocks can now be sold and bought fully onchain. For the first time, tokenized stocks can be traded in real time through a Web3-native experience. Meanwhile, the transfers comply with the regulatory requirements governing public market trading. Securitize believes this is necessary, despite some in the industry believing it was not possible. The tokenization platform has made it possible by combining regulatory engagement, purpose-built infrastructure, and a commitment to protecting investors. It also aims to safely expand tokenization across the industry by sharing the workings of the newly launched real tokenized stocks with the broader ecosystem. Purchasing stocks on Securitize is designed to feel like Web3, as investors must complete a Securitize ID once to connect their wallets. Investors can use stablecoins to buy stocks through instant onchain swaps and receive shares directly in their wallets. Meanwhile, the tokenized tokens are available 24/7, including nights, weekends, and holidays. Trading is carried out through Securitize’s regulated broker-dealers, and all transactions are executed through the platform’s U.S. SEC-registered Broker Dealer and ATS, Securitize Markets. However, European investor orders are processed through Securitize Europe Brokerage & Markets. The platform’s European investment firm was recently approved for a Trading Services System (TSS) license. Securitize Markets supports around-the-clock trading in two different ways, depending on whether U.S. markets are open or closed. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The update delivers modernized navigation, integrated analytics, and a new visual design system while preserving the audited smart contracts and non-custodial architecture that users rely on. ""Whether you're discovering Hedera DeFi for the first time or you're a professional trader, everything has been rebuilt to feel fast, trusted, and intuitive,"" said Peter Campbell, CEO and Co-founder of SaucerSwap Labs. ""This is a serious workstation for capital."" A New Era for Hedera's Liquidity Protocol Since launching in 2022, SaucerSwap has grown from an early-stage automated market maker into Hedera's dominant DeFi protocol, routing the majority of on-chain liquidity and processing tens of millions of swaps. The redesigned platform brings the user experience in line with that scale, introducing clearer information architecture and analytics built directly into every workflow. The launch also introduces a refreshed visual identity for SaucerSwap, including an updated logo, new color palette, and a modern design system that reflects the protocol's evolution from startup to infrastructure. Navigation Built Around Real Workflows The platform is now organized into clear, action-driven sections. Trading, token discovery, liquidity provisioning , staking, governance, and portfolio monitoring each have dedicated views. Users can move from a token swap to providing liquidity, staking SAUCE, or voting on a governance proposal in seconds. A bridge modal connects Hedera to external networks including Base and BNB Chain, making it easier to move capital in and out of the ecosystem. The redesign standardizes how information is displayed across the platform: pair and pool charts, liquidity depth, fee APYs, LP position analytics, historical performance, and protocol health metrics all follow consistent visual patterns. These components are designed to scale with SaucerSwap's roadmap, including the planned V3 protocol upgrade, perpetuals, limit orders, dollar cost averaging, and ETF-style products. ""The interface was designed so that complex features feel simple,"" said Markus Bergvinson, Chief Strategy Officer at SaucerSwap Labs. ""Whether it's swaps today or advanced derivatives tomorrow, it all lives inside one consistent experience."" Built for Every Type of User The platform is tuned for different audiences. Retail users and newcomers get clear copy and guided flows that feel similar to modern banking apps. Advanced users and liquidity providers gain faster access to deeper analytics and more powerful LP tools. Builders and token projects can rely on the interface for token launches and liquidity programs. Professional partners can bridge assets from other networks and interact with a protocol that matches their expectations for security and longevity. Protocol Unchanged, Experience Upgraded The redesign does not change SaucerSwap's audited smart contracts, non-custodial architecture, on-chain governance via SAUCE and xSAUCE, or any existing LP positions, stakes, or rewards. Everything users have built on SaucerSwap remains intact. This launch marks the beginning of SaucerSwap's next chapter: new design, new brand, and new capabilities, with the same mission of being the most efficient, accessible, and secure liquidity protocol on Hedera.

The Bitcoin Lightning Network just delivered some electrifying news. According to data from analytics platform Amboss, the network’s capacity has rocketed to 5,606 BTC. This marks the highest level we’ve seen since March 2023, signaling a powerful reversal of a previous downward trend. Let’s explore what’s fueling this remarkable surge and why it matters for the future of everyday Bitcoin transactions. What Does This Surge in Bitcoin Lightning Network Capacity Actually Mean? Simply put, capacity represents the total amount of Bitcoin locked in the network’s payment channels to facilitate transactions. Think of it as the network’s liquidity pool. A higher capacity means more funds are available for instant, low-cost payments. For over a year, this metric was declining. However, a clear uptrend began in November, culminating in this recent peak. This isn’t just a random blip; it’s a strong indicator of renewed confidence and utility. This growth is crucial because the Bitcoin Lightning Network is Bitcoin’s premier solution for scalability. It enables millions of transactions per second at a fraction of the cost of on-chain payments. Therefore, a growing capacity directly supports greater adoption and use. What’s Driving the Remarkable Growth of the Lightning Network? The rebound isn’t accidental. It’s driven by concrete developments that are strengthening the network’s foundation. Two primary factors are at play here. First, major cryptocurrency exchanges are embracing the technology. When large platforms integrate Lightning deposits and withdrawals, they bring massive liquidity and user bases. This institutional adoption validates the network’s reliability for moving significant value. Second, continuous functional improvements are making the network more robust and user-friendly. Developers are relentlessly working on: Improved routing algorithms for more reliable payments. Better wallet interfaces that abstract away complexity. Enhanced security models to protect user funds. These technical upgrades reduce friction, making the Bitcoin Lightning Network more accessible to everyone, not just tech enthusiasts. Why Should You Care About a More Robust Lightning Network? You might wonder how this technical milestone affects you. The implications are profound for both users and the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. A stronger Lightning Network translates to tangible benefits for anyone interacting with Bitcoin. For starters, it makes Bitcoin a truly viable medium for daily exchange. Imagine buying a coffee, tipping a creator online, or paying for a subscription instantly with Bitcoin, without worrying about high fees or slow confirmations. That’s the promise being realized. Furthermore, this growth enhances Bitcoin’s value proposition. It demonstrates that the network can evolve to meet demand without compromising its decentralized and secure core. This scalability is essential for Bitcoin to function as a global peer-to-peer electronic cash system, as originally envisioned. What Challenges Remain for Widespread Lightning Adoption? Despite this encouraging news, it’s important to acknowledge that hurdles remain. The path to mass adoption is not without its obstacles. The network still requires a better user experience to onboard non-technical people. Managing channels and liquidity can be confusing for beginners. Moreover, achieving true global scale will require even more liquidity, better tools for merchants, and seamless integration across countless applications. The recent capacity increase is a vital step, but the journey continues. The community’s focus is now on turning this technical success into mainstream usability. Conclusion: A Bright Spark for Bitcoin’s Future The surge in Bitcoin Lightning Network capacity to over 5,600 BTC is a beacon of progress. It signals a powerful combination of growing institutional support and maturing technology. This isn’t just a number on a chart; it’s a reflection of increasing trust and utility in Bitcoin’s most important scaling innovation. As capacity grows, so does the potential for Bitcoin to transform how we think about and use money every single day. The future of fast, cheap, and reliable Bitcoin payments looks brighter than ever. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Bitcoin Lightning Network? A1: The Bitcoin Lightning Network is a “layer 2” payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. It enables instant, high-volume, and low-cost transactions by creating private payment channels between users. Q2: Why is network capacity important? A2: Capacity refers to the total Bitcoin locked in the network’s payment channels. Higher capacity means more liquidity is available, allowing for larger and more reliable transactions across the entire network. Q3: Which exchanges are supporting the Lightning Network? A3: Major exchanges like Kraken, Bitfinex, and OKX have integrated Lightning Network support, allowing users to deposit and withdraw Bitcoin using the protocol, which significantly boosts network liquidity. Q4: Are Lightning Network transactions secure? A4: Yes, Lightning transactions are secured by the underlying Bitcoin blockchain. The protocol uses smart contracts to ensure that funds can always be settled on-chain if needed, making it a trustless system. Q5: How can I start using the Lightning Network? A5: You can start by downloading a Lightning-enabled wallet (like Phoenix, Breez, or Muun), purchasing some Bitcoin, and funding your wallet. Many wallets make the process simple for beginners. Q6: What does this capacity growth mean for Bitcoin’s price? A6: While not directly causing price movements, a stronger, more usable Lightning Network enhances Bitcoin’s fundamental utility as a spendable currency. This long-term improvement in functionality can positively influence adoption and perceived value. Found this insight into the Bitcoin Lightning Network ‘s remarkable growth valuable?

According to reporters present at a White House exchange, Trump said he would “take a look” and asked that the matter be examined by the Attorney General. The comment came after federal prosecutors secured guilty pleas and later sent Rodriguez to prison. Statement On A High-Profile Sentencing According to the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, Rodriguez and a co-defendant, William Lonergan Hill, pleaded guilty to charges tied to running an unlicensed money-transmitting business and related conspiracy counts. Reports have disclosed that the service was linked to more than $230 million in criminal proceeds. Prosecutors said those transfers were connected in their factual recitation to narcotics trafficking, darknet markets, cyber intrusions, frauds, sanctioned jurisdictions and other criminal activity. Sentencing And Legal Outcomes Based on court filings and public notices, the guilty pleas were entered in late July 2025 and sentencing took place on November 19, 2025. The Department of Justice has also pursued forfeiture tied to the amounts it described in court, and fines were assessed at the time of sentence. These actions were carried out by federal prosecutors in Manhattan, who handled the investigation and prosecution. Responding to Trump’s remarks, Rodriguez said “This President knows all about lawfare.” I have always said that the most challenging aspect of getting a pardon for me and Bill would be getting the attention of @realDonaldTrump . He is very busy with many people competing for his attention. Today, thanks to the journalist at Decrypt, the President is aware of our… https://t.co/lmYljfFax9 — Keonne Rodriguez (@keonne) December 15, 2025 Trump Pardon: How A Presidential Review Might Move Forward The process for clemency typically involves the Office of the Pardon Attorney at the Justice Department, which vets petitions and may seek input from prosecutors and judges. The president, however, has broad constitutional authority to grant pardons or commutations for federal offenses. In this case, press accounts say the president asked that the Attorney General examine the matter, which could lead to a formal review of any clemency petition. Political And Public Reactions Reports have varied in tone, with some outlets focusing on the scale of the funds prosecutors said were moved — $237 million — and others highlighting the unusual nature of a president publicly saying he would “look into” an active clemency matter shortly after sentencing. Legal experts note that public comments from a sitting president can speed attention to a case, but they do not guarantee relief. Opinions among commentators are mixed; some urge careful review while others stress that federal sentences reflect convictions from established court processes.

55908353,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=867336,1765951218,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,XRP’s Price Action Sends A Warning Despite Positive ETF Flows,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrps-price-sends-a-warning/,"Despite recent positive closes from spot XRP ETFs, the cryptocurrency’s price action is sending a clear warning to traders. Market structure remains weak, and without signs of a confirmed reversal, short-term risks persist. XRP’s current behavior highlights that bullish sentiment from ETFs alone isn’t enough to drive a sustained rally, making caution essential for anyone entering the market. New Year Volatility Hits Crypto Markets Hard Efloud, in a recent update, highlighted that with the start of the new year and continued uncertainty across the markets, cryptocurrencies have once again been among the hardest hit. Low trading volume and a lack of clear direction have kept pressure on the sector, and without an obvious reversal signal, altcoins continue to grind lower day by day. Related Reading: XRP Dominates Institutional Inflows, But Why Is Price Still Low? Given this backdrop, caution remains essential. As emphasized in previous analyses, any attempt to trade against the prevailing trend at support levels should be backed by clear bullish breakout structures on lower timeframes. Without such confirmation, moves higher are more likely to be short-lived reactions rather than meaningful reversals. From a technical standpoint, XRP’s price has now lost the “Daily Imb” zone, weakening the overall structure. If price dips below the most recent swing low and then attracts buying interest, the $1.98 area is expected to act as the first major resistance. As previously noted, the outlook remains negative unless the YO region is reclaimed. Beyond $1.98, another key resistance lies within the red boxed zone. Together, $1.98, the YO area, and the red boxed region form three critical hurdles where price is likely to face selling pressure in the near term. Price Action Still Outweighs ETF Optimism According to Efloud, while spot XRP ETFs have posted positive closes for 18 consecutive days, this development alone does not outweigh what the chart itself is signaling. He emphasized that price action and market structure remain the most important factors. Until these begin to shift in a clearly bullish direction, any purchases are better seen as part of a gradual accumulation strategy rather than a confirmation of a trend reversal.

Efloud added that if market suppression continues and a sharper correction unfolds, the area around $1.53 could emerge as a potential buy zone. However, this scenario depends on broader market behavior and is not a certainty. Finally, the analyst clarified that the $1.53 level was illustrated as a hypothetical example. Efloud warned that entering positions at support zones or key levels without observing clear breakout or reversal structures carries added risk and should be approached with caution.

The whole thing now looks like a hybrid between a sportsbook and a trading platform, except it sits inside an app people already use for stocks and crypto. Robinhood is clearly chasing volume, because this update lets users stack outcomes, totals and spreads across multiple NFL games in single trades. And starting early 2026, users will be able to build their own combos with up to ten outcomes, which takes the whole parlay vibe to another level. JB Mackenzie from the company said these new setups will have “a structural look or feel as a parlay,” which pretty much tells you what direction Robinhood is going. On top of that, users can now trade contracts tied to individual NFL players in the middle of live games. People can bet on whether someone scores at any point or hit passing, rushing or receiving yard marks while the game is still moving. Mackenzie said , “This was a great opportunity for us to really be able to become the leader in the space,” adding that the goal is to give users “more advanced order types and trading capabilities” because the demand is already there. Expanding combos across sports and non-sports events The new tools were revealed at the “Robinhood Presents: YES/NO” event at Summit Skywalker Ranch near San Francisco. The preset combos are only for NFL right now, but the company said it wants to extend these trades beyond football. They are studying ways to mix outcomes from totally different event groups. That includes anything from sports to economic reports. Mackenzie said people may want to pair “something that’s associated with climate and an election,” and he said the firm is also looking at domestic and international data, plus policy events, which makes the future lineup wide open. Robinhood’s push into prediction markets actually started right before the 2024 election. Users could trade contracts tied to Kamala Harris or Donald Trump. It was a test run, and it turned into a major part of the platform. After linking with ForecastEx for election trading, the company kept expanding into the space. It partnered with Kalshi earlier this year and then went into a joint venture with Susquehanna International Group in November. So they’ve been planting flags everywhere. The business has grown fast. The company said prediction markets already make about $100 million in annualized revenue. Users have traded 11 billion contracts, and more than 1 million people have taken part. Based on October numbers, the business is on track to hit $300 million. November alone was their biggest month ever with more than 3 billion contracts traded. That was a jump of roughly 20% from October’s 2.5 billion. That single month beat the entire third quarter, which saw 2.3 billion. Mackenzie said, “I actually think we’re at the beginning of where this is really going to go,” and he expects expansion into more events and more asset classes. Tracking revenue drivers and market interest Analysts see a lot of profit potential here, even though nobody is sugarcoating the competition. Piper Sandler said the product is a major growth shot for Robinhood . Mizuho’s Dan Dolev said users on platforms like Robinhood and Coinbase are about nine times more likely to use prediction markets than non-users. He said the company is targeting a base that is already interested in these kinds of trades. He also said, “Over time, they’re going to become sort of a hub for prediction markets.” Dolev pointed to prediction markets as one reason the stock has run up 220% in 2025. But prediction markets are not the only part of the story. Robinhood is building out retirement, advisory, its gold card and other products. Dolev said this mix is why he thinks the company could become “the new Schwab for Gen Z.” To get a sense of scale, Robinhood’s assets under custody for 2024 were at $193 billion. Schwab reported $10.10 trillion in client assets in the same period. Dolev said, “Prediction markets is one aspect,” and he argued the company is circling around more parts of a customer’s financial life. KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Alex Markgraff also pointed to several areas of growth. He said the advisory business and the gold card are still early. He said prediction markets will likely give a large boost in the near term because people want event contracts. In his view, Robinhood has “multiple sources of growth,” and prediction markets are only one piece of the company’s expanding stack.

Stani Kulechov, the founder and CEO of the Aave protocol, confirmed the end of the four-year investigation in a post on social media, expressing relief and optimism about the future of DeFi. Aave Founder Celebrates End Of SEC Investigation In his announcement, Kulechov emphasized the considerable effort and resources invested by the Aave team throughout this process. He stated, “We are finally ready to share that the SEC has concluded its investigation into the Aave Protocol.” Highlighting the impact of regulatory scrutiny on DeFi, he added, “This process demanded significant effort… to protect Aave, its ecosystem, and DeFi more broadly.” Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Suffer A 20% Decline After Japan’s Rate Hike? Historical Patterns Suggest So Kulechov expressed hope for a new chapter in which developers can freely innovate and contribute to the future of finance, asserting, “DeFi will win.” This conclusion is notable against the backdrop of heightened regulatory pressure that DeFi projects have faced in recent years. Under the previous SEC chair, Gary Gensler, the agency made a concerted effort to enforce regulations in the crypto space. In 2021, the SEC initiated 19 enforcement actions related to cryptocurrency in just the first nine months. However, recent patterns reveal a substantial shift in the commission’s stance on crypto enforcement. SEC Eases Crypto Enforcement Actions By Over 60% Since President Donald Trump returned to the White House, the SEC has reportedly eased enforcement actions in over 60% of ongoing cryptocurrency cases. A New York Times investigation published recently analyzed thousands of government documents and court records, revealing that the SEC has either dismissed, paused, or reduced penalties for a significant majority of active crypto cases since January 20, 2021. Related Reading: XRP Price Forecast: Key Factors That Could Propel It To $3 In Early 2026 While Trump’s first term saw an average of one high-profile cryptocurrency case per month—including the notable action against Ripple Labs—the current landscape indicates a less aggressive regulatory approach for major players like Binance, Ripple, and Gemini. Following the administration shift, enforcement actions against these companies have either been withdrawn or significantly softened. Paul S. Atkins, the newly appointed SEC chair under the Trump administration, has labeled this regulatory shift a “new day” for the cryptocurrency industry. At the time of writing, the protocol’s native token, AAVE, was trading at $187, having only surged by 1% following the announcement. However, on a year-to-date basis, the AAVE token has seen a significant 52% drop, with prices currently 72% down from the all-time high of $661 reached in May 2021.

The analyst shared a 3-day chart focused on the EMA ribbon, a trend tool that has repeatedly aligned with extended downside phases. The chart shows XRP slipping below the ribbon as it flips toward a bearish phase. This setup has preceded every major decline in this timeframe. On the 3-day $XRP chart, every time the EMA ribbon flips bearish and price holds below it, a major drawdown follows. These moves weren’t quick wicks — they were multi-month trend declines, ranging from −27% to −66%, with deeper losses occurring when the ribbon stayed bearish… pic.twitter.com/1zOeYHY74G — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 14, 2025 A Repeating Signal on the 3-Day Chart Steph summarized the pattern clearly. On the 3-day chart, “every time the EMA ribbon flips bearish and price holds below it, a major drawdown follows.” He stressed that these moves were not brief reactions. They developed into sustained declines that reshaped market structure. The chart marks several historical examples. Each bearish flip led to multi-month downturns rather than sharp wicks. Recorded drawdowns ranged from 27% to 66%. Deeper losses appeared when the ribbon stayed bearish for longer periods. According to the analyst, “so far, this signal has no exceptions.” This history gives the current setup added weight. XRP now trades below the EMA ribbon on the 3-day chart. The ribbon itself has turned bearish, and XRP’s price continues to respect it as resistance , a behavior seen before previous declines accelerated. Context From Past Market Cycles Earlier cycles on the chart reveal a consistent rhythm. After strong rallies, XRP consolidated near the EMA ribbon. Once it lost support and the ribbon flipped, sellers gained control. The declines unfolded over months. Recovery only followed after its price reclaimed the ribbon and restored bullish alignment. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The chart also shows that shallow corrections occurred when bearish conditions resolved quickly. Larger losses followed when the bearish structure persisted. This distinction matters now, as XRP remains below the ribbon. Can XRP Break this Cycle? A reversal scenario exists, but XRP tends to mirror historical performance . The asset is trading at $2, and would need to reclaim the EMA ribbon on the 3-day chart and remain above it. Until that happens, the chart remains consistent with earlier bearish phases. Steph Is Crypto did not forecast a specific target or timeline. His post focused on structure. The signal has appeared before, and each time, the outcome followed the same path. The absence of exceptions in past data emphasizes what XRP will do next.

Key Takeaways: Exodus and MoonPay plan to launch a fully reserved US dollar stablecoin for everyday payments in early 2026. The stablecoin will power Exodus Pay, enabling global digital dollar spending with self-custody. MoonPay and M0 will handle issuance and infrastructure. The Exodus Movement, known for its self-custodial crypto wallet, said Tuesday that the fully reserved digital dollar is scheduled to launch in early 2026. The asset will be issued and managed by MoonPay and built using M0, a stablecoin infrastructure platform that enables companies to create and operate custom fiat-backed tokens. Exodus Pay to Bring Self-Custodial Digital Dollar Spending to Global Users The yet-to-be-named stablecoin will be integrated into Exodus Pay, a forthcoming payments feature within the Exodus app. The goal is to allow users to spend and send digital dollars globally while maintaining self-custody, without requiring technical knowledge of cryptocurrencies or blockchain networks. “Stablecoins are quickly becoming the simplest way for people to hold and move dollars onchain, but the experience still needs to meet the expectations set by today’s consumer apps,” said JP Richardson, co-founder and CEO of Exodus. He added that the project aims to make digital dollar payments as seamless as traditional financial apps, starting with Exodus Pay. MoonPay will distribute the stablecoin across its global network, supporting buying, selling, swapping, deposits and checkout services. BREAKING: the @exodus stablecoin is coming issued and managed by MoonPay, in partnership with @m0 pic.twitter.com/ZMiKggzDQ8 — MoonPay (@moonpay) December 16, 2025 According to the companies, this broad integration is intended to give the digital dollar immediate real-world utility for consumers, merchants and partner applications. The collaboration comes as MoonPay expands its enterprise stablecoin business, launched in November, which focuses on issuing and managing compliant digital dollars across multiple blockchains. Its integration with M0 allows stablecoins to be programmable and interoperable while remaining tailored to specific product use cases. “Enterprises want stablecoins that are programmable, interoperable and tailored to a specific product experience,” said Luca Prosperi, co-founder and CEO of M0. “Our infrastructure is built to support that flexibility at scale.” GENIUS Act Sparks Renewed Stablecoin Push Across Banks and Crypto Firms The announcement lands amid a renewed surge of interest in stablecoins following the passage of the GENIUS Act in July , which established a federal regulatory framework for fiat-backed stablecoins in the US. Since then, banks and crypto firms alike have accelerated their efforts to launch proprietary digital dollars. This year alone has seen the Trump family-linked World Liberty Financial introduce the USD1 stablecoin , Stripe roll out stablecoin-based accounts in more than 100 countries, and Tether announce plans for a regulatory-compliant token dubbed USAT. Despite the influx of new entrants, the market remains heavily concentrated. Tether’s USDT dominates with roughly 60% market share and about $186 billion in circulation, while Circle’s USDC holds around 25% with a market capitalization of $78 billion. Together, the two account for roughly 85% of the $310 billion global stablecoin market.

This Binance listing system introduces a structured, three-stage journey from discovery to full market integration. For investors and project teams alike, this transparent process marks a significant step towards a more mature and trustworthy ecosystem. Let’s break down how this innovative pipeline works and what it means for the future of crypto. What is Binance’s New Three-Stage Listing System? Binance’s new approach is designed to systematically evaluate and onboard cryptocurrency projects. The Binance listing system consists of three distinct phases: Binance Alpha, Binance Futures, and Binance Spot. This methodical progression replaces a more opaque, single-step listing process. The goal is clear: to methodically guide high-potential projects to market while giving the community early visibility and building unwavering trust in the exchange’s due diligence. Stage 1: Binance Alpha – The Discovery Zone The journey begins at Binance Alpha. Think of this as an exclusive preview stage. Here, Binance pre-discloses promising projects to its vast community before any trading goes live. This stage serves a crucial purpose: It allows for early community feedback and discussion. It provides projects with initial exposure and gauges organic interest. It sets the foundation for the rigorous evaluation to come. Essentially, Binance Alpha acts as a proving ground where a project’s fundamentals and community appeal get their first major test within the Binance listing system . Stage 2: Binance Futures – The Performance Test Projects that demonstrate strong potential in the Alpha stage may graduate to Binance Futures. This step involves listing the project’s token on Binance’s perpetual futures market. Listing here is not automatic; it is a reward for meeting specific performance and engagement criteria. This phase serves as a critical stress test: It evaluates the token’s trading dynamics and liquidity in a derivatives environment. It assesses sustained user engagement and market depth. It acts as a final checkpoint before the ultimate spot market listing. Successfully navigating the Futures stage is a powerful signal of a project’s resilience and trader confidence. Stage 3: Binance Spot – Achieving Full Liquidity The final destination in the Binance listing system is the Binance Spot market. Admission here is reserved for projects that satisfy all of Binance’s final, comprehensive requirements. Achieving a spot listing is a major milestone, as it unlocks: Full market liquidity with direct token trading pairs. Access to Binance’s entire global user base for spot trading. Enhanced credibility and visibility as a fully vetted asset. This structured ascent ensures that only projects with proven fundamentals, robust communities, and compliance postures reach the pinnacle of the spot market. Why Did Binance Create This New Listing Process? Binance’s decision to implement this phased Binance listing system is a strategic masterstroke. It directly addresses long-standing concerns about transparency and quality in crypto listings. The system is built to: Increase User Trust: By making the progression criteria more transparent, users can understand the “why” behind a listing. Promote Quality Projects: The multi-stage filter systematically identifies and promotes projects with genuine utility and strong communities. Ensure Regulatory Vigilance: Each stage includes checks for compliance, helping to create a safer trading environment. Therefore, this is not just a new rulebook; it’s a commitment to elevating the entire market standard. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors and Projects? This transformative Binance listing system creates a new paradigm. For investors, it offers a clearer roadmap. Watching a project climb from Alpha to Spot provides valuable insight into its long-term viability, far beyond hype. For project teams, the path to a Binance listing is now a defined journey with clear milestones. It rewards sustained development, genuine community building, and operational excellence over short-term speculation. In conclusion, Binance’s three-stage listing framework is a revolutionary step towards maturity in the cryptocurrency industry. By instituting a transparent, performance-based pipeline from Alpha to Spot, Binance is building a fortress of trust. This system empowers informed investment decisions and incentivizes projects to focus on lasting value. Ultimately, it signals a future where quality and transparency are the true currencies of success in the crypto world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can any project apply to enter the Binance Alpha stage? A1: Binance has not disclosed public application details for the Alpha stage. Projects are typically selected based on Binance’s internal research and evaluation of their fundamentals, team, technology, and community potential. Q2: How long does a project typically spend in each stage of the listing system? A2: There is no fixed timeline. The duration in each stage depends entirely on the project’s performance against Binance’s evaluation criteria, which include trading volume, community growth, and regulatory compliance. Q3: Does listing on Binance Futures guarantee a future Spot listing? A3: No, it does not. While the Futures stage is a prerequisite, advancement to the Spot market is contingent on meeting all final requirements. A project must continue to perform well and satisfy all due diligence checks. Q4: What are the main benefits of this system for regular traders? A4> The main benefit is increased transparency and reduced risk. Traders gain early visibility into promising projects (Alpha) and can see a project’s performance under market conditions (Futures) before it reaches the spot market, allowing for more informed decisions. Q5: Will this new system slow down the rate of new listings on Binance? A5: It may lead to a more deliberate pace, as the focus shifts from quantity to quality. The system is designed to ensure that only thoroughly vetted projects achieve a full spot listing, which could mean fewer, but potentially higher-quality, new listings. Q6: Are existing spot-listed tokens affected by this new system? A6: No, this new three-stage Binance listing system applies to new projects seeking listing. Tokens already listed on Binance Spot are not re-evaluated through this new pipeline unless specific circumstances warrant it. Found this deep dive into Binance’s new transparent framework helpful?

(Nasdaq: JZXN) (""Jiuzi"" or the ""Company"") today announced it is in strategic cooperation discussions with a Web3 technology company specializing in the development of an artificial intelligence (AI) cryptocurrency trading platform (the ""Counterparty""). According to the preliminary agreement, both parties plan to jointly develop and promote an AI-powered cryptocurrency diagnostics and trading platform to advance its market-oriented application. To facilitate this collaboration, JZXN intends to acquire tokens issued by the Counterparty at a significant discount through a private placement of its common stock, representing a total value of approximately US$1 billion. Based on current market valuations and assumptions, upon successful completion of the transaction, the Company expects to generate considerable unrealized gains. Furthermore, the Counterparty's tokens are expected to apply for listing and trading on Binance, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, which could enhance the token's market discovery capabilities and liquidity. However, there can be no assurance regarding the success, timing, or post-listing performance of such potential listing. The Company makes no commitments concerning the future price or returns of the tokens. This partnership aims to integrate the resources and expertise of both parties in AI technology, cryptocurrency trading, and the Web3 sector, jointly advancing the productization and commercialization of AI-driven market trend analysis, risk identification, and intelligent trading engines. The Company believes that, if finalized and successfully implemented, this cooperation will strengthen its technological reserves and business footprint in related fields, potentially creating new business opportunities and delivering medium-to-long-term value. It should be noted that the matter remains subject to ongoing negotiations and framework arrangements. There are material uncertainties regarding whether a legally binding definitive agreement will be signed, and whether the proposed private placement and token acquisition arrangements will proceed as anticipated. JZXN will strictly comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and supervisory requirements. It will advance these matters under the principles of prudence, compliance, and manageable risk, fulfilling its information disclosure obligations promptly. The Company will issue separate announcements regarding specific subsequent issuance plans, the signing of any definitive agreement, and other important progress updates.

The last cycle rewarded those who anticipated structural change: institutional access, better infrastructure, and meaningful regulatory progress. While Bitcoin briefly touched new all-time highs near $126,000, the broader market struggled to sustain momentum, leaving year-to-date returns under pressure. This divergence has tested investor patience, but it has also reset expectations. More importantly, it has created the conditions for a healthier and more durable phase of growth. As we enter 2026, the next leg of durable returns will not be driven by a single theme but by the intersection of institutional capital, real-world utility, and infrastructure that finally scales. Several key trends have taken shape toward the end of this year, quietly strengthening the crypto ecosystem. For long-term investors, these shifts offer valuable signals on where the next phase of market action could unfold. Institutional flows via ETPs Institutional demand has become a stabilising factor for the market. Since their launch, they have emerged as the fastest-growing ETFs globally, attracting over $112.7 billion in net inflows. This steady capital has helped reduce volatility and strengthen Bitcoin’s position as a mainstream portfolio asset. The momentum has not been limited to Bitcoin alone. Over the past year, ETFs linked to assets such as XRP, Solana, and even Dogecoin have entered the market, expanding institutional access and injecting fresh liquidity across the ecosystem. Once these ETFs are approved, we could potentially see the launch of crypto basket or index ETFs, offering diversified exposure in a single product. Supply Dynamics Flashing Bullish Signal One of the strongest structural signals today comes from on-chain supply trends. Bitcoin held on centralized exchanges has fallen to near all-time lows of around 2.75 million BTC. Lower exchange balances mean less readily available supply for selling, increasing the likelihood of sharp price moves when demand returns. Ethereum is showing a similar pattern. ETH reserves on centralized exchanges have dropped to multi-year lows of roughly 16.28 million ETH. With Ethereum increasingly viewed as a strategic treasury asset and demand from staking and applications continuing to grow, even modest inflows could trigger a supply shock in 2026. Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization Tokenization is moving from experimentation to execution. Governments and institutions are beginning to use blockchain rails to unlock dormant capital and improve asset liquidity. In India, states such as Maharashtra have outlined plans to tokenize land assets worth up to ₹ 50 trillion, highlighting the scale of opportunity. Globally, the RWA segment has grown nearly 380% over the past three years. As legal clarity improves and custodial standards mature, tokenized real estate, bonds, and funds could become a major growth engine, offering investors yield, transparency, and access to assets that were previously difficult to enter or exit, creating an environment with the potential for higher growth in the coming years. Growing significance of layer 2 chains Layer-2 networks and scaling primitives are something that investors should look at. Transaction throughput, fees, and finality define whether blockchain rails can support payments, microtransactions, and institutional settlement. Layer-2 networks and rollup technologies have made 2025 the year that scaling stopped being theoretical and became production-grade. These layers are where stablecoins, merchant payments, and high-frequency DeFi activity will converge, creating new product primitives and revenue pools that can compound into sizable token and protocol returns. Investors should watch adoption metrics across leading L2s. Conclusion The crypto market heading into 2026 looks fundamentally different from previous cycles. Institutional capital is more embedded, supply dynamics are tighter, real-world use cases are expanding, and infrastructure is finally scaling to meet demand. The next wave of returns is unlikely to come from chasing hype, but from identifying where capital, utility, and technology intersect. For investors, the opportunity lies in staying disciplined, watching structural signals, and aligning with long-term adoption rather than short-term noise. Those who do so may find that the foundations laid today define the winners of the next cycle.

One of the most revealing metrics is the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio. This data provides a real-time snapshot of trader positioning on major exchanges. Over the last 24 hours, the aggregate data from the top three exchanges by open interest shows a market in near-perfect equilibrium, but the devil is in the details. What Do These BTC Perpetual Futures Ratios Actually Mean? The long/short ratio tells us the percentage of traders holding positions betting on a price increase (long) versus a price decrease (short). A ratio above 50% for longs indicates bullish sentiment, while a ratio below 50% suggests bearishness. The current aggregate data shows a fascinating picture: Long 49.11%, Short 50.89%. This reveals a market that is almost perfectly balanced, hinting at a potential inflection point. However, to get the full story, we must look at the individual exchange data. A Deep Dive into Exchange-Specific Sentiment Breaking down the aggregate number shows subtle but important differences in trader behavior across platforms. This granular view is often where actionable insights are found. Binance: Long 48.9%, Short 51.1%. The world’s largest exchange shows a slight lean towards bearish sentiment among its futures traders. Bybit: Long 49.32%, Short 50.68%. Similar to Binance, Bybit traders are also marginally net-short, indicating cautious optimism at best. OKX: Long 50%, Short 50%. This is the most neutral reading of the three, showing a perfect split between bulls and bears on this platform. These figures highlight that sentiment is not monolithic. While the overall market for BTC perpetual futures is balanced, the slight bearish tilt on Binance and Bybit, which command massive volume, is a critical detail for analysts. How to Use This Data in Your Trading Strategy So, you have the numbers—now what? This data is most powerful when used as a contrarian indicator. Extreme readings often signal a crowded trade. For instance, if longs were at 70% or higher, it might suggest the market is overly optimistic and due for a correction. The current near-neutral state, however, suggests there is no extreme sentiment pressure pushing the price in either direction. This often precedes a strong, decisive move as the market searches for a new catalyst. Therefore, monitoring shifts from this equilibrium in BTC perpetual futures ratios can provide early warning signals. The Bigger Picture: Why This Equilibrium Matters A balanced long/short ratio in BTC perpetual futures is like a coiled spring. It indicates a lack of consensus and high uncertainty. In such environments, price can be more sensitive to external news or large buy/sell orders. Traders should watch for a breakout from this tight range, as the subsequent move could be significant. The data from Binance, Bybit, and OKX collectively acts as a sophisticated sentiment gauge, offering a clearer view than spot market data alone. Conclusion: Navigating a Balanced Market In summary, the latest BTC perpetual futures ratios paint a picture of a market at a crossroads. The aggregate and exchange-specific data reveal a cautious, wait-and-see approach among major traders. This neutrality is not a signal to be passive, but rather a cue to heighten vigilance for the next catalyst that will tip the scales. By understanding these metrics, you equip yourself with a deeper layer of market intelligence beyond simple price charts. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is a BTC perpetual futures contract? A: It’s a derivative contract that allows you to speculate on Bitcoin’s future price without an expiry date, using leverage. Funding rates are exchanged periodically between longs and shorts to keep the contract price anchored to the spot price. Q: Why are Binance, Bybit, and OKX highlighted? A: These three platforms consistently have the highest open interest (total value of unsettled contracts) in Bitcoin futures, making their trader sentiment data highly influential and representative of the broader market. Q: Is a 50/50 long/short ratio bullish or bearish? A: It is neutral. It indicates a balance of power between buyers and sellers and often precedes a period of volatility as the market decides on a new direction. Q: How often should I check these ratios? A: For active traders, monitoring daily changes is useful. Look for sustained shifts rather than one-off fluctuations, as sustained changes indicate a evolving sentiment trend. Q: Can this data predict Bitcoin’s price? A> No single metric can predict price. However, it is a excellent gauge of market sentiment. Extreme readings can signal potential reversals, while neutral readings like the current one highlight key decision points. Q: Where can I find this data myself? A> Many cryptocurrency analytics websites like Coinglass, TradingView, and the exchanges’ own data pages provide real-time and historical long/short ratio data.

In this tense environment, one currency stands out: the Indian rupee is staging a surprising recovery from record lows, offering a glimmer of resilience amid widespread currency volatility . What does this mean for traders and investors navigating these turbulent waters? Why Is Asia FX Under Pressure? Most Asian currencies traded lower on Thursday, extending losses as investors positioned themselves cautiously ahead of the US nonfarm payrolls report. The data is expected to provide critical clues about the Federal Reserve’s interest rate trajectory, which directly impacts Asia FX performance. A strong jobs report could reinforce expectations of prolonged higher US rates, drawing capital away from emerging markets and strengthening the dollar further. The US Jobs Data: A Market-Moving Event The upcoming US jobs data represents more than just economic statistics—it’s a potential catalyst for significant forex market movements. Here’s what traders are watching: Nonfarm payrolls growth figures Unemployment rate changes Average hourly earnings growth Labor force participation rate Each component could signal whether the US economy is cooling sufficiently to justify rate cuts or remains too hot for the Fed’s comfort. Indian Rupee’s Remarkable Resilience While most Asian currencies weakened, the Indian rupee displayed unexpected strength, bouncing back from record lows hit earlier in the week. This recovery suggests several underlying factors at play: Factor Impact on Rupee Central Bank Intervention Likely dollar sales by RBI to support currency Improved Economic Fundamentals Strong GDP growth and controlled inflation Foreign Investment Flows Continued interest in Indian assets Oil Price Stability Reduced pressure on India’s import bill Navigating Forex Market Volatility The current currency volatility presents both challenges and opportunities for market participants. Successful navigation requires understanding several key dynamics: Interest Rate Differentials: The gap between US rates and Asian central bank policies drives capital flows Risk Sentiment: Global risk appetite affects emerging market currency demand Technical Levels: Key support and resistance zones become crucial during volatile periods Central Bank Policies: Diverging monetary policies across regions create trading opportunities Actionable Insights for Currency Traders In this environment of heightened forex market sensitivity, consider these strategic approaches: Monitor US economic indicators beyond jobs data, including inflation reports and Fed communications Watch for potential intervention signals from Asian central banks, particularly regarding the Indian rupee Consider hedging strategies to manage currency volatility exposure Pay attention to technical patterns that may indicate trend reversals or continuations FAQs: Understanding the Current Currency Landscape What is driving the pressure on Asian currencies? The primary driver is anticipation of strong US economic data that could delay Federal Reserve rate cuts, maintaining the dollar’s yield advantage and drawing capital away from emerging markets. Why is the Indian rupee performing differently? The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) has likely intervened in currency markets, while India’s strong economic fundamentals and foreign investment inflows provide underlying support. How does US jobs data affect global currencies? Strong employment data suggests a robust US economy, potentially leading to sustained higher interest rates that strengthen the dollar against other currencies, particularly in emerging markets. What should traders watch next? Beyond the immediate jobs report, monitor Federal Reserve communications, particularly from Chair Jerome Powell , and upcoming inflation data from both the US and major Asian economies. Are other Asian central banks likely to intervene? Several Asian central banks, including the Bank of Japan and People’s Bank of China, have historically intervened during periods of excessive currency weakness, though approaches vary by country. The Asia FX landscape remains delicately balanced between domestic economic strengths and global monetary policy currents. While most regional currencies face headwinds from anticipated strong US jobs data , the Indian rupee ‘s recovery demonstrates that local fundamentals can sometimes overcome broader market trends. This divergence highlights the importance of country-specific analysis in navigating forex market opportunities amid ongoing currency volatility . As global economic conditions evolve, currencies that combine solid fundamentals with proactive policy management may offer the most resilience.

The proposed separate taxation framework for cryptocurrency gains, once eyed for 2027, may now be pushed to 2028. This potential shift highlights the government’s cautious approach and the ongoing debate over fair taxation for a rapidly evolving market. Why is Japan Delaying Its Crypto Tax Implementation? The primary reason for the delay, as reported by Reuters, centers on investor protection. Japanese authorities believe the current safeguards for cryptocurrency investors are not yet robust enough to support a new, separate tax regime. Therefore, the government aims to observe market conditions and strengthen regulatory frameworks before finalizing the rules. This decision reflects a mature, patient strategy rather than a rushed policy change. The Current Tax Burden on Crypto Investors in Japan Understanding the delay requires a look at the present system, which many consider punitive. Currently, profits from cryptocurrency trading in Japan are classified as “miscellaneous income.” This classification leads to a significantly higher tax rate when combined with an individual’s other earnings. Tax rates can soar to a staggering 55% for top earners. This contrasts sharply with the flat 20% tax rate applied to capital gains from traditional stock investments. The disparity has been a major point of contention, discouraging domestic investment and innovation in the crypto sector. What Does the New Crypto Tax Implementation Promise? The proposed reform seeks to create a separate category for cryptocurrency capital gains, aligning it with the taxation of stocks. The industry’s central demand is a flat 20% tax rate. Implementing this change would achieve several key goals: Fairness: Create tax parity between crypto assets and other financial instruments. Clarity: Provide clear, dedicated rules for crypto taxation, reducing compliance complexity. Growth: Encourage domestic participation and position Japan as a more competitive hub for digital asset businesses. However, the path to this new crypto tax implementation is tied to the amendment of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, which must pass the Diet (Japan’s parliament). The Road Ahead: From 2027 to 2028 Initial discussions pointed towards a 2027 launch if the necessary legislation passed next year. The emerging consensus to delay until 2028 suggests a more methodical timeline. This extra year would allow regulators to: Monitor global regulatory trends and market developments. Design and implement enhanced investor protection measures. Ensure the technical and administrative infrastructure is ready for a smooth rollout. While the delay may test the patience of investors and businesses advocating for change, it underscores a commitment to getting the crypto tax implementation right. Conclusion: A Delay for a Stronger Foundation Japan’s potential decision to postpone its separate crypto tax implementation to 2028 is a strategic pause, not a cancellation. It prioritizes building a secure and fair regulatory environment over speed. For the global crypto community, Japan’s careful, principle-based approach offers a model of how major economies can thoughtfully integrate digital assets. The eventual reform, when it arrives, could significantly boost Japan’s standing in the fintech world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the current tax rate on crypto profits in Japan? A1: Currently, crypto gains are taxed as miscellaneous income at a progressive rate that can reach up to 55% for high earners. Q2: What is the proposed new tax rate? A2: The industry is advocating for a separate, flat tax rate of 20%, which would match the tax rate on stock market gains. Q3: Why is the government delaying the new crypto tax implementation? A3: The main reason is to allow more time to develop adequate investor protection measures and observe market conditions before enacting major tax changes. Q4: Has the new tax law been passed? A4: No. The change depends on an amendment to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, which must be debated and passed by Japan’s parliament, the Diet. Q5: How will this delay affect crypto investors in Japan? A5: In the short term, investors will continue under the current high-tax system. The delay signals that a fairer system is being carefully planned for the future. Q6: Is Japan still supportive of cryptocurrency innovation? A6: Yes. This deliberate approach suggests Japan wants to foster a sustainable and secure crypto ecosystem, not hinder it with poorly designed regulations.

Key Takeaways: Gemini has launched regulated prediction markets across the US following Gemini Titan’s CFTC approval. Major crypto platforms are racing to build all-in-one products as prediction markets gain momentum. PancakeSwap-backed Probable signals growing competition from decentralized prediction market platforms. Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, announced Monday that it has launched its in-house prediction platform, Gemini Predictions, across all 50 US states. The product is offered through Gemini Titan, an affiliate that recently secured a designated contract market license from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), clearing the way for regulated prediction markets in the country. Gemini Launches Regulated Prediction Markets in US Gemini’s new platform allows users to trade on the outcomes of real-world events with near-instant execution and transparent settlement, according to the company. The launch follows Gemini Titan’s regulatory approval last week , marking one of the most notable US expansions of prediction markets by a major crypto exchange. The move fits into Gemini’s broader strategy of building an “everything app” for digital assets. Alongside spot trading, the exchange has expanded into staking, rewards, tokenized stocks and now prediction markets, mirroring a wider industry trend toward all-in-one platforms.

Multiple prediction markets on @BNBCHAIN https://t.co/epJuybrLiA — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) December 16, 2025 Probable is set to launch exclusively on BNB Chain and will initially charge no fees. According to PancakeSwap, the platform will automatically convert deposited tokens into USDT on BNB Chain, eliminating the need for users to manually swap or bridge assets. Event outcomes and settlement will be verified using UMA’s Optimistic Oracle. While PancakeSwap is supporting the project’s early development, Probable will operate as an independent platform. A launch date has not yet been announced. Prediction Markets Gain Traction as Volumes Hit Billions The rapid expansion reflects growing demand for prediction markets, which gained momentum this year as platforms such as Kalshi and Polymarket posted billions of dollars in monthly trading volumes beginning in October. The trend has attracted attention from both crypto-native firms and traditional financial players, including Robinhood and MetaMask. As reported, Kalshi has secured a major media breakthrough after signing a partnership with CNN, making the company the network’s official prediction markets partner while closing a $1 billion funding round at an $11 billion valuation. Under the agreement, Kalshi’s real-time market data will be used inside CNN’s newsroom to support reporting on politics, economics, and major cultural events. Meanwhile, Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital is in talks with Polymarket and Kalshi about becoming a liquidity provider, as on-chain betting on real-world events draws more attention from both retail traders and Wall Street.compliance remain unresolved.

55911440,https://cryptonews.com/?p=464704,1765956214,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/55911440.jpeg,SBF’s Ex-Girlfriend Caroline Ellison Transferred to Early Community Confinement,https://cryptonews.com/news/sbfs-ex-girlfriend-caroline-ellison-transferred-to-early-community-confinement/,"Caroline Ellison has been transferred from federal prison to community confinement after serving approximately 11 months of her two-year sentence for her role in the $11 billion FTX fraud scheme . The former Alameda Research CEO was moved from Danbury Federal Correctional Institution in Connecticut to either home confinement or a halfway house on October 16, according to Federal Bureau of Prisons records obtained by Business Insider . Ellison’s projected release date is now February 20, 2026, nearly 9 months ahead of the completion of her original sentence. The 31-year-old former Alameda executive, who served as a star witness against her ex-boyfriend, Sam Bankman-Fried, during his criminal trial, began her sentence at the low-security Connecticut facility in early November 2024 after receiving a two-year prison term from U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan. Bloomberg via Getty Images Cooperation Earns Leniency Despite Serious Fraud Charges Judge Kaplan praised Ellison’s “ substantial ” cooperation during Bankman-Fried’s prosecution while maintaining that the case’s severity still warranted incarceration. Ellison had pleaded guilty in December 2022 to conspiracy charges, including wire fraud, money laundering, securities fraud, and commodities fraud, offenses carrying a potential maximum sentence of 110 years in prison. During her September 2024 sentencing hearing, Ellison expressed deep remorse while holding back tears. “On some level, my brain doesn’t even comprehend all the people I harmed,” she told the court. “That doesn’t mean I don’t try.” Her attorneys had requested no prison time, but Kaplan rejected what he termed a “ literal get-out-of-jail-free card ” despite acknowledging her unprecedented cooperation. Federal prosecutors emphasized Ellison’s critical testimony in their September 17 letter recommending leniency. “The ‘what’ and ‘how’ of the crimes, as well as the ‘why,’ would have been difficult to prove without Ellison’s testimony,” they wrote, noting she endured extraordinary public attention and harassment for her cooperation. During Bankman-Fried’s month-long October 2023 trial , Ellison testified for three days, painting the FTX founder as an image-conscious and power-hungry figure who orchestrated the fraudulent scheme. Ellison revealed that Bankman-Fried instructed her and other executives to use Alameda Research to invest billions of dollars in customer assets that had been secretly siphoned from FTX. She described feeling like an “ unequal partner ” in their romantic relationship due to his position of power. “ I would always ultimately defer to Sam, ” Ellison testified, explaining concerns about the intersection of their personal and professional relationship. FTX Associates Face Divergent Legal Outcomes Ellison’s early community placement follows contrasting fates for other FTX executives involved in the collapse. Former FTX CTO Gary Wang and engineering director Nishad Singh both received time-served sentences with supervised release after testifying against Bankman-Fried, avoiding additional prison time entirely. Both testified that Bankman-Fried directed them to create an “ allow negative ” feature on Alameda’s FTX-linked account, granting access to nearly unlimited customer funds. Meanwhile, former FTX Digital Markets CEO Ryan Salame serves a seven-year sentence at a Maryland federal facility after pleading guilty to campaign finance violations and operating an unlicensed money transmitter. Salame refused to cooperate with prosecutors and has vocally criticized the disparate treatment, claiming authorities offered “ get out of jail free cards ” to witnesses supporting their narrative. “ The government hands get out of jail free cards if you parrot the narrative they want and everyone who would provide any counterpoint is frightened, ” Salame told journalist Tucker Carlson . Bankman-Fried remains incarcerated at a California federal prison serving his 25-year sentence following conviction on all seven fraud and conspiracy counts. The FTX founder’s appeal hearing was scheduled for November 4, as his legal team argues he was “ presumed guilty ” and denied a fair trial. Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) is pushing for a new trial this week following his 2023 conviction tied to his time at FTX. #SBF #FTX https://t.co/xEIAr7gcJE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 3, 2025 His family has called for presidential clemency while he continues to contest that FTX was never truly insolvent , claiming the exchange always had sufficient assets to repay customers in full. Federal Bureau of Prisons spokesperson Randilee Giamusso declined to specify Ellison’s exact location or conditions within community confinement, citing privacy and security protocols. Ellison’s attorneys have not commented on her early transfer to supervised community placement, as FTX creditors continue to receive bankruptcy distributions exceeding $16 billion in recovered funds.

This upgrade marks a pivotal step for the platform, which operates as an exclusive on-chain trading venue within Binance Wallet, specializing in early-stage cryptocurrency listings. The addition of ZKP directly addresses the growing demand for enhanced privacy and security in decentralized trading environments. What Does Binance Alpha Adding ZKP Actually Mean? For users of Binance Alpha, the integration of ZKP technology is a game-changer. Zero-Knowledge Proofs are a cryptographic method that allows one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. In practical terms, this means transactions and interactions on the Binance Alpha platform can become more private and secure. This is particularly crucial for a venue that lists nascent, volatile projects where strategic trading positions are highly sensitive. Why Is Privacy Crucial for Early-Stage Coin Trading? Trading early-stage coins involves unique risks and opportunities. The market for these assets is often less liquid and more susceptible to influence. Therefore, the benefits of ZKP on Binance Alpha are substantial: Shielded Trading Activity: ZKP can help obscure wallet balances and transaction specifics, preventing front-running and market manipulation. Enhanced Security: By minimizing the amount of sensitive data on-chain, the attack surface for bad actors is reduced. Regulatory Compliance Flexibility: While ensuring privacy for users, the technology can still allow for necessary compliance checks under the hood, a balance that platforms like Binance Alpha must strike. This focus on privacy does not happen in a vacuum. It reflects a broader industry trend where user demand for confidentiality meets technological innovation. How Will ZKP Technology Shape the Future of Binance Alpha? The implementation of ZKP is more than a feature update; it’s a foundational shift. For Binance Alpha, this could translate into a stronger value proposition. The platform can attract a more sophisticated user base—traders and investors who prioritize discretion when dealing with high-potential, early-stage assets. Furthermore, this move positions Binance Alpha at the forefront of the “privacy-fi” movement within decentralized finance (DeFi), potentially setting a new standard for other trading venues. However, challenges remain. The computational complexity of ZKP can sometimes lead to higher transaction costs or slower processing times. The team behind Binance Alpha will need to optimize this integration to ensure a seamless user experience. The success of this Binance Alpha ZKP integration will depend on its execution and how well it balances robust privacy with the platform’s core functionality. Conclusion: A Strategic Leap for On-Chain Trading The addition of ZKP to Binance Alpha is a clear signal that privacy is becoming a non-negotiable feature in advanced crypto trading. By leveraging this cutting-edge cryptography, Binance Alpha is not just upgrading its platform; it is proactively addressing the core concerns of its user base. This strategic enhancement strengthens its role as a dedicated hub for discovering and trading the next generation of digital assets with greater confidence and discretion. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Binance Alpha? A1: Binance Alpha is an on-chain trading platform integrated within the Binance Wallet ecosystem. It focuses primarily on listing and facilitating trade for early-stage and emerging cryptocurrency projects. Q2: What is ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proof)? A2: ZKP is a cryptographic protocol that allows one party to prove the truth of information to another party without revealing the underlying data. It’s a powerful tool for enhancing privacy and security in blockchain transactions. Q3: How does ZKP benefit me as a trader on Binance Alpha? A3: The primary benefit is increased privacy. ZKP can help protect your trading strategies, wallet holdings, and transaction history from being publicly visible on the blockchain, reducing risks like front-running. Q4: Will using ZKP on Binance Alpha make my transactions slower or more expensive? A4: There is a potential for increased computational load, which can impact speed and cost. However, the development team’s goal is to implement efficient ZKP systems to minimize any negative impact on the user experience. Q5: Does ZKP mean my activity is completely anonymous? A5: Not necessarily. ZKP enhances privacy by minimizing data leakage, but true anonymity depends on multiple factors, including how you use the platform and other tools in conjunction with it. Q6: Is this ZKP integration live now on Binance Alpha? A6> You should check the official Binance Alpha announcements and documentation for the most current status and rollout phases of the ZKP integration.

Emerging into prominence with accelerated presale momentum, with Phase 7 soon to come, and with more than 18,500 distinct wallets acquired in record time, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now a household name in crypto circles. Priced at a mere $0.035, it is increasingly noted as the best cheap cryptocurrency to buy because of its exemplary fundamentals dedicated to a purely decentralized financial application. Aiming towards bringing a decentralized lending and borrowing platform with interest-bearing tokens, yield programs, and a sound value-capture mechanism in place, with over $19.5 million already in the pot and soon to see the light of day in V1 Sepolia TestNet, Mutuum Finance is all set to make a mark among emerging projects in the crypto space. Stage 6 Presale Accelerates with Rising Momentum for MUTM Mutuum Finance is now in Presale Stage 6, where tokens cost $0.035, a 16% jump from the previous stage. The next presale stage, Presale Stage 7, will see an increase in the price of the token to $0.04, a 20% jump. Therefore, this presale stage is one of the last chances for investors to invest in this project at a discounted rate since over 18,500 people are already holding this token, with a total of $19.5 million raised in this presale. Investors searching for what crypto to buy will find MUTM’s dual-lending protocol and V1 Sepolia TestNet offering significant utility and early-stage growth potential. Mutuum Finance describes itself as a Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending protocol and a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending protocol, allowing borrowers to gain interest on their savings while still retaining control over them. The platform aims to deliver a complete decentralized finance service, which is safer, transparent, and flexible compared to other traditional lending systems. With all this, MUTM is clearly the best cheap cryptocurrency to buy for investors looking for early access to a strong DeFi ecosystem. Stablecoin Fully Collateralized Mutuum Finance is set to launch a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar and fully collateralized on the Ethereum blockchain. The project is transparent with audited and certified code by CertiK. Moreover, a Bug Bounty Program with a $50,000 USDT prize went live in collaboration with CertiK, encouraging contributors to detect critical, major, minor, and low-severity bugs in the protocol. With the purpose of encouraging community development, a $100,000 giveaway event is being conducted by Mutuum Finance, in which a total of ten people will be given $10,000 each in the form of MUTM tokens. A trust score of 95.0/100 in a smart contract audit conducted by CertiK verifies that Mutuum Finance upholds a high standard of security. With a combination of state-of-the-art lending solutions and a safe and transparent setting, Mutuum Finance is poised to provide a safe and dependable, not to mention progressive, DeFi experience, making it a strong contender as the new crypto to watch in 2025. Coming Soon: The Lending & Borrowing Protocol A soon-to-be-unveiled version 1 lending and borrowing protocol by Mutuum Finance is set to be launched on Sepolia Testnet by the end of 2025. Early supporters will be given a chance to work with heavy-hitting assets such as ETH and USDT on capabilities such as liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and the automated liquidator bot.

This move signals a bold step toward user-owned mobile infrastructure, blending hardware, software, and tokenomics into a single, profit-sharing model. How Will SKR Holders Receive Profits from Solana Mobile? Anatoly Yakovenko explained that while the full technology stack is still in development, its completion will grant SKR holders unprecedented control. This includes governance over the phone’s operation, the overall user experience, and, most importantly, the revenue generation structure. The core mechanism enabling this is the integration of the Solana Mobile stack with a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). This TEE acts as a secure, isolated zone within the phone’s processor. Therefore, it can autonomously manage and execute financial agreements. Consequently, the system is designed to automatically calculate and distribute a share of the network’s profits to all SKR holders , creating a seamless flow of value. What Does This Mean for the Future of Mobile? This model fundamentally shifts the power dynamics of mobile technology. Instead of profits flowing solely to a corporate entity, they are shared with the token holders who support the network. For SKR holders , this presents a direct financial incentive tied to the adoption and success of Solana Mobile. Direct Revenue Share: Profits generated through the mobile stack are automatically distributed. Governance Rights: Token holders influence development and user experience decisions. Ecosystem Alignment: Incentives are structured so that user growth benefits all SKR holders . However, the success of this vision hinges on the completion of the complex technology stack and widespread adoption of the mobile devices themselves. What Are the Key Benefits and Challenges? The primary benefit is clear: creating a mobile ecosystem where users are also owners. This could drive stronger community loyalty and faster innovation. For SKR holders , the promise of automated profit distribution offers a tangible return on investment beyond mere token speculation. Nevertheless, challenges remain. The technology, particularly the secure integration of the TEE, must be flawlessly executed to ensure trust. Moreover, regulatory landscapes for such profit-sharing models are still evolving and could pose hurdles. Conclusion: A New Paradigm for Device Ownership Solana’s proposal reimagines the relationship between a user and their device. By ensuring SKR holders will receive profits , Yakovenko is advocating for a more equitable digital future. This model, if successfully implemented, could set a powerful precedent for how blockchain technology integrates with everyday hardware, turning consumers into stakeholders. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the SKR token? SKR is the upcoming token for Solana Mobile, designed to grant holders control over the phone’s ecosystem and a share of its revenue. How will profits be distributed to SKR holders? Profits are designed to be distributed automatically through a system combining the Solana Mobile stack and a secure Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) on the device. When will SKR token holders start receiving profits? The profit-sharing mechanism depends on the completion of the Solana Mobile technology stack and the successful launch and adoption of the devices. A specific timeline has not been announced. Do I need to own a Solana Mobile phone to be an SKR holder? No, token ownership is separate from device ownership. However, the phone’s usage and adoption are what will generate the profits shared with SKR holders. What is a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)? A TEE is a secure area inside a main processor. It ensures that code and data loaded inside are protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity. What are the risks for SKR holders? Risks include technological delays, adoption challenges, regulatory changes, and the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market.

This transaction, valued at approximately $260 million, originated from an unknown wallet, immediately sparking intense speculation about its implications for the market. Such substantial movements often serve as critical indicators of investor sentiment and potential price volatility. What Does This Massive Bitcoin Transfer to Binance Mean? When a Bitcoin transfer to Binance of this magnitude occurs, analysts and traders pay close attention. Typically, large deposits to major exchanges like Binance suggest one of several possibilities. The entity behind the transfer might be preparing to sell, which could exert downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. Alternatively, it could signal a strategic move for trading, staking, or utilizing other financial services offered by the exchange. The anonymity of the sender adds a layer of mystery, leaving the market to interpret the whale’s intentions. This event highlights the transparent yet pseudonymous nature of blockchain technology. While anyone can see the transaction’s details on the public ledger, the identity of the wallet owner remains hidden. This characteristic is a double-edged sword, providing privacy for users while creating uncertainty for market observers trying to gauge sentiment. Why Should You Care About Whale Movements? Whale transactions, especially a significant Bitcoin transfer to Binance , act as a barometer for the crypto market. Large holders, or ‘whales,’ possess the power to influence prices through their actions. Therefore, monitoring these movements can provide valuable insights. Here are key reasons why this transaction matters: Price Impact : A potential large sell order can increase selling pressure, potentially leading to a price dip. Market Sentiment : It can signal confidence or concern among major investors about Bitcoin’s near-term future. Liquidity Events : Such moves often precede increased trading volume and volatility on exchanges. Strategic Positioning Whales may move assets to exchanges to participate in new trading pairs, earn yield, or secure loans. How Do Unknown Wallets Influence Crypto Markets? The origin of this transaction—an unknown wallet—fuels speculation. Unknown wallets could belong to institutional investors, early Bitcoin adopters, investment funds, or even exchange cold wallets. Their actions are closely watched because they often represent ‘smart money’ with significant resources and information. A Bitcoin transfer to Binance from such a source is rarely an arbitrary decision; it usually follows careful analysis and strategy. For retail investors, understanding the context is crucial. However, it’s important to remember that correlation does not equal causation. While whale alerts provide data, they do not guarantee a specific market outcome. The market’s reaction depends on numerous other factors, including global economic conditions, regulatory news, and overall trader psychology. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should you do when you see news of a major Bitcoin transfer to Binance ? First, avoid making impulsive trading decisions based solely on one data point. Instead, consider it as part of a broader market analysis. Check trading volume, order book depth on Binance, and related news. Second, use this information to reinforce your risk management strategies. Ensure your portfolio is diversified and that you are not overexposed to sudden volatility. Finally, remember that blockchain transparency is a powerful tool. Services like Whale Alert allow you to track these movements in real-time. By staying informed, you can better navigate the often-turbulent crypto waters. Conclusion: Decoding the Signal in the Noise The recent 3,000 BTC transfer is a powerful reminder of the dynamic and interconnected nature of cryptocurrency markets. While the exact intent behind this Bitcoin transfer to Binance remains unknown, it underscores the importance of on-chain data in modern crypto analysis. For savvy investors, such events are not just news items but pieces of a larger puzzle that, when combined with other indicators, can help inform smarter, more resilient investment strategies in the digital asset space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a ‘whale’ in cryptocurrency? A whale is an individual or entity that holds a large amount of a particular cryptocurrency. Their trades can significantly impact the market price due to the size of their holdings. Why would someone transfer Bitcoin to an exchange? Common reasons include preparing to sell/trade, using exchange-based financial services (like earning interest or taking a loan), or moving funds for security purposes. Does a large deposit to Binance always mean the price will drop? Not always. While it can indicate a potential sell-off, it could also be for other purposes like trading altcoins or participating in Binance Launchpad. The market impact depends on if and how the Bitcoin is sold. How can I track large Bitcoin transactions myself? You can use blockchain explorers (like Blockchain.com) or monitoring services like Whale Alert, which posts large transaction alerts on social media platforms. What is an ‘unknown wallet’? It’s a cryptocurrency wallet address that is not publicly linked to a known identity, such as an exchange, company, or individual. Its owner remains anonymous. Should I sell my Bitcoin if I see a large transfer to an exchange? Making a decision based on a single transaction is risky. It’s better to consider it alongside other market data, your investment goals, and risk tolerance. Did this analysis of the major Bitcoin transfer to Binance help you understand market dynamics?

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-will-change-lives-for-the-worst-around-the-world-heres-why/,"A sharp warning has resurfaced from crypto analyst JD (@jaydee_757), a figure known for his market insight and an uncompromising stance on investor behavior. While optimism around XRP continues to circulate, JD has remained consistent in a far less comforting message. He believes the next major XRP cycle will not reward most participants. Instead, he argues it will financially damage them. Kenny Nguyen, a well-known figure in the cryptocurrency space, has recently predicted that XRP will positively impact many lives around the world. While JD partially agrees with this assessment, he has a different opinion. He decided that XRP would change lives, but he expects the asset to change lives for the worse. True but honestly, it will change lives for the worst brotha.. many will buy the hype and sell the fear getting REKT We need them so we can use them as exit liquidity again — JD (@jaydee_757) December 14, 2025 A Long-Held View on Investor Failure JD has repeatedly stated that the majority of XRP investors misunderstand market cycles. He argues that confidence alone does not protect capital. According to JD, roughly 95% of investors who claim they “know what they hold” will still lose money in the next cycle . He suggests that this outcome stems from poor timing, emotional decision-making, and blind trust in hype-driven narratives. Many retail traders enter positions too late after strong price moves. They then exit too late during downturns. This pattern turns them into exit liquidity for more disciplined market participants. JD reinforced this belief again by stating that many will buy into excitement and sell into fear, leaving them at a loss. Exit Liquidity and Market Reality JD’s comments highlight a recurring theme in his analysis that markets do not reward belief. They reward execution. He has emphasized that price cycles rely on late entrants to sustain exits for early buyers. In this structure, inexperienced investors absorb losses while others lock in profits. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He has made it clear that this process is not accidental. Ignoring timing, risk management, and cycle awareness can lead to poor outcomes. Holding through extreme volatility without a plan does not signal conviction. In his analysis, it signals exposure. XRP: The 95% Crash Prediction JD has also issued one of his most controversial forecasts regarding XRP’s future. He has predicted a 95% crash at the end of the next major cycle. He believes this collapse will erase gains for most late-stage buyers. Those who fail to exit at the top will suffer the largest losses. This view directly contradicts long-term hold narratives that dominate XRP-focused communities. JD does not deny the possibility of strong upside during the cycle. His argument centers on what follows. Without disciplined profit-taking , he believes investors will suffer notable losses.

Addressing a TASS press conference , he emphasized that payments in Russia must only be conducted in rubles. He dismissed the possibility of cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum becoming legal tender. “We must understand that cryptocurrencies will never become money within our country,” he noted. “They can only be used as an investment instrument. If payment is required, it will only be in rubles.” Under the Russian Law on Digital Financial Assets, cryptos are defined as property, which can be held and traded. However, their use is strictly limited to investment purposes. Russia has maintained a ban on using cryptocurrencies as a payment method since 2020. Russia to Regulate Crypto Despite Central Bank’s Reluctance Anatoly Aksakov’s remarks mirror the Russian Central Bank’s stance to prohibit the use of crypto assets for payments. The national bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina called for a ‘crypto ban’ in March, blocking traders from buying and selling coins. The long-serving Governor has previously called for total bans on crypto exchanges and token trading . Despite continued calls to restrict crypto payments, Russia has topped all European markets in crypto adoption. The nation recorded $376.3 billion in received transactions between July 2024 and June 2025, a recent Chainalysis report said.

In September, Yevgeny Masharov of the Russian Public Chamber suggested the creation of a “national crypto bank” to bring informal crypto transactions into the regulated sector radar. Additionally, President Putin has acknowledged the growth of the cryptocurrency mining industry. Russia legalized cryptocurrency mining on November 1, 2024. Besides, Yevgeny Masharov, a member of the Civic Chamber of the Russian Federation’s Commission for Public Review of Bills and Other Regulatory Acts, recently advocated for crypto regulation .

The burn of the Assistance Fund HYPE would strengthen community consensus and transparency by eliminating the tokens from both circulation and total supply. The proposal requests that validators acknowledge that, even in the absence of an on-chain transaction, the Hyperliquid tokens accrued in the Assistance Fund are permanently burned. The tokens cannot be accessed since they are already located in a system address that has never been controlled by a private key, without a protocol-level intervention. Hyper Foundation proposes governance vote on Assistance Fund The Hyper Foundation is proposing a validator vote to formally recognize the Assistance Fund HYPE as burned, removing the tokens permanently from the circulating and total supply. For context, the Assistance Fund converts trading fees to HYPE in a fully automated manner as part… — Hyper Foundation (@HyperFND) December 17, 2025 Factually, the Assistance Fund fully automates the conversion of trading costs to HYPE as part of the L1 execution. The Assistance Fund uses the system address 0xfefefefefefefefefefefefefefefefefefefefefefe. The Assistance Fund system address has never had a private key with control over its funds, much as the zero address. Hyper Foundation proposed that a “Yes” vote would create a legally binding societal agreement that the protocol would never permit an update to access such funds. According to the Foundation, since the tokens are already mathematically irretrievable, no technical modifications are needed. According to community estimates, the Assistance Fund’s balance is approximately 37 million HYPE , or more than 10% of the total supply in circulation. The tokens would not be included in the total supply calculations if they were formally deleted. Hyper Foundation stated that a stake-weighted validator procedure will be used to make the decision. The decentralized blockchain platform emphasized that validators must indicate their intention on the governance forum by December 21 at 04:00 UTC. After that, token holders can assign stakes to validators who share their viewpoint until December 24 at 4:00 UTC, at which point the outcome will be decided. If adopted, the change would limit future use of the Assistance Fund balance for grants, development, or emergency measures, thereby locking in a more constrained supply model. According to the Foundation, the outcome of the vote will decide whether the Assistance Fund balance is permanently removed from supply calculations. Hyperliquid supply reduction proposal impacts HYPE dynamics The vote comes after previous community talks regarding 2025 supply cuts, such as a September plan that proposed a 45% reduction in overall supply but was unsuccessful. On September 22, researcher Hasu and co-founder of DBA investment business Jon Charbonneau filed a proposal that would change Hyperliquid’s tokenomics. According to the proposal, authorization for approximately 421 million tokens in the Future Emissions & Community Rewards pool would be revoked. The proposal revealed that approximately 31 million HYPE held in the Assistance Fund would be burned. The burning of about 31 million HYPE and authorization for roughly 421 million tokens would reduce the approved total supply from 1 billion to roughly 550 million HYPE, a reduction of more than 45%. Additionally, HYPE’s $1 billion hard cap would be lifted, enabling future issuance only via channels authorized by governance, including staking emissions or community awards. Crucially, approximately 45 million tokens in circulation would not change, meaning current holders would not face dilution. Notably, in 2025, Hyperliquid ranked as the leading on-chain perpetuals venue by volume and fee revenue. A large portion of those fees has continued to flow into the Assistance Fund through the automated conversion process of the protocol. The evolution of HYPE supply dynamics over time has been largely dependent on that mechanism. On September 18, HYPE hit an all-time high of $59.29, up more than 40% for the month, solidifying its position as the preferred platform for trading decentralized derivatives. On-chain data reveal that as of December 17, the price of Hyperliquid (HYPE) is $26.98. The price has changed by 1.6% in the last day and 1.1% in the last hour. In terms of longer-term performance, the price has fluctuated by 30.6% down over the previous month and by 6.7% down during the last seven days.

Pro-crypto Waller, whom Trump originally appointed to the Fed board in 2020, has been a leading advocate for rate cuts this year and could take over when Jerome Powell’s term ends in May 2026. He is favored by Wall Street economists for his consistent policy arguments, according to the report. Last week, Trump interviewed former Fed governor Kevin Warsh and director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, both of whom are high on the list for the job. Poylmarket prediction polls currently have Hassett on 53%, Warsh at 29%, and Waller with a 15.3% probability of nomination. A Welcome Move For Crypto The crypto industry would welcome the move, as Waller could usher in master accounts for crypto companies, said Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Cusodia Bank. “The timing couldn’t be better – tomorrow is his interview for Fed chair; he deserves strong consideration,” she added. I’M EXCITED TO SEE THIS, as there’s *finally* some movement on Fed master accounts for #crypto -native companies & Waller is one of the key architects of this at the Fed. The timing couldn’t be better–tomorrow is his interview for Fed chair; he deserves strong consideration. https://t.co/Pj6BzOKol1 — Caitlin Long (@CaitlinLong_) December 16, 2025 The WSJ reported that Waller is considered an underdog because he lacks the close personal relationship with Trump that other leading candidates have. Some Trump allies also view Waller’s support for a September 2024 rate cut before Trump took office as disloyal. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Trump will likely announce his decision in early January after interviewing candidates this week and next. However, the president remains cautious after regretting his 2017 appointment of current Chair Jerome Powell, saying he received a “bad recommendation” at the time. “Waller is a distinguished academic and is already on the Fed board, but notably, he was one of the few Governors to dissent earlier in the year in favor of lowering rates. That is likely what got Trump’s attention,” said Jaron Zhou, head of politics at Kalshi. All Change at the Fed Trump is eager to replace Jerome Powell, whom he has labelled “too slow” over his delays in reducing interest rates. However, Powell remained hawkish following his most recent rate cut. “Trump’s just going to replace him with a dove. So we’re gonna get a lot of monetary stimulus. We’re going to get a lot of fiscal stimulus,” said David Waddell, CEO of Waddell & Associates. The Fed made three rate cuts in 2024 and three in 2025, the most recent on December 10, bringing the rate down from a high of 5.5% to 3.75%, which is still too high, according to economists and the President.

55912836,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=246218,1765958411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,IoTeX Achieves Crucial Milestone with MiCA-Compliant White Paper,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/iotex-mica-compliant-white-paper/,"BitcoinWorld IoTeX Achieves Crucial Milestone with MiCA-Compliant White Paper In a significant move for regulatory clarity, the IoTeX network has published a MiCA-compliant white paper for its IOTX token. This proactive step positions IoTeX at the forefront of blockchain projects preparing for the European Union’s comprehensive crypto framework. For investors and users, this signals a major commitment to compliance and long-term viability within one of the world’s largest economic blocs. What Does a MiCA-Compliant White Paper Mean for IoTeX? The release of this document is far more than a simple update. It serves as a foundational blueprint for EU-based crypto service providers. Essentially, the MiCA-compliant white paper provides exchanges, custody platforms, and institutional partners with the legal and technical disclosures they need to confidently list and support the IOTX token. Under MiCA rules, utility tokens like IOTX can be distributed without prior authorization, but a compliant white paper is mandatory. Why Is MiCA Compliance a Game-Changer? The Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation aims to create a unified legal landscape for digital assets across all 27 EU member states. For a project like IoTeX, which focuses on powering the Internet of Things with blockchain, this compliance is transformative. It removes a significant layer of uncertainty for European operations. Market Access: It opens doors to regulated EU exchanges and financial service providers. Investor Confidence: It demonstrates a serious commitment to transparency and regulatory standards. Operational Clarity: It sets clear rules of engagement for token issuance and management within the EU. Therefore, this strategic move by IoTeX is not just about checking a box; it’s about building a sustainable future in a regulated market. How Does This Benefit IOTX Holders and the Ecosystem? The immediate benefit is enhanced legitimacy and reduced regulatory risk for anyone interacting with IOTX in Europe. A MiCA-compliant white paper acts as a seal of preparedness. For the broader IoTeX ecosystem—which includes developers building decentralized applications (dApps) for machine finance and smart devices—this regulatory groundwork provides a stable environment for growth. Partners can innovate with greater assurance, knowing the foundational token complies with upcoming laws. What Challenges Does Regulatory Compliance Present? While this is a positive step, navigating MiCA is complex. The regulation imposes strict requirements on white paper content, including disclosures about the issuer, the project’s rights and obligations, and associated risks. Maintaining ongoing compliance as the project evolves will require dedicated resources. However, by addressing these requirements early, IoTeX gains a first-mover advantage over projects that delay their preparations. Conclusion: A Proactive Step Toward Mainstream Adoption IoTeX’s publication of a MiCA-compliant white paper is a clear signal of maturity and strategic foresight. It moves the project from the regulatory gray area into a framework designed for consumer protection and market integrity. This action not only secures its position in the European market but also sets a benchmark for other utility token projects. In the journey toward mainstream blockchain adoption, regulatory compliance is no longer optional—it’s essential. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is MiCA? A: MiCA stands for Markets in Crypto-Assets. It’s a landmark regulation by the European Union to create a harmonized legal framework for cryptocurrencies and digital assets across all member states. Q: Does a MiCA-compliant white paper mean IOTX is officially approved? A: For utility tokens, MiCA does not require a pre-approval process. Instead, it mandates that issuers publish a compliant white paper. This document serves as the primary disclosure mechanism, allowing the token to be distributed and listed by regulated entities. Q: How does this affect IOTX users outside the EU? A> The direct legal implications are for the European Economic Area. However, the increased legitimacy and potential for broader exchange listings can positively impact the project’s global perception and liquidity. Q: What specific information is in a MiCA-compliant white paper? A> It must include detailed information about the issuer, the project’s objectives, the rights attached to the token, the underlying technology, and a comprehensive risk assessment, among other disclosures. Q: When does MiCA fully come into effect? A> The regulation is being phased in. Key provisions for crypto-asset service providers are expected to apply from December 2024, with rules for asset-referenced and e-money tokens starting in June 2024. Q: Can other blockchain projects use IoTeX’s white paper as a template? A> While they can study its structure, each project’s MiCA-compliant white paper must be tailored to its specific technology, use case, and tokenomics. Legal advice is crucial.

Bitcoin IFP Has Witnessed A Plunge Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about the trajectory that the Bitcoin IFP has been following recently. The IFP refers to an on-chain indicator that measures the BTC flows taking place between spot and derivatives exchanges. When the value of this metric is going up, it means investors are ramping up transactions to derivatives platforms. Such a trend can be a sign that demand for speculation is on the rise. On the other hand, the indicator witnessing a decline implies fewer coins are traveling from spot exchanges to derivatives ones. This kind of trend can suggest traders are lowering their appetite for risk. Now, here is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the Bitcoin IFP and its 90-day moving average (MA) over the past decade: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin IFP was witnessing an uptrend in the last few months of 2024, but with the start of this year, a reversal in the indicator occurred. The switch to a downtrend meant that its value slipped below the 90-day MA, something that has historically signaled bearish conditions. Over the course of 2025, the IFP has continued its downward trajectory, but lately, the decline has accelerated, indicating that derivatives interest is cooling off fast. Two cycles ago, the IFP sliding below its 90-day MA led into the 2018 bear market . In the 2021 bull market, the bear signal on the IFP was initially followed by the second half of that bull run, but then the 2022 bear market took over as the metric failed to recover. A similar trend has been witnessed this year as well, with Bitcoin exploring new all-time highs (ATHs) despite the IFP suggesting bearish conditions. The recent acceleration in the indicator’s downtrend, however, has been accompanied by a bearish period in the asset’s price. Only time will tell whether this is a repeat of the pattern from the last cycle, or if risk appetite will make a comeback among investors and the IFP will reverse course. In some other news, the Bitcoin treasury companies have seen their holdings go up recently, despite the drawdown that the market has faced, as pointed out by Glassnode co-founder Rafael in an X post . From the chart, it’s apparent that since Bitcoin started declining from its ATH above $126,000, the treasury companies have still continued a net upward trajectory. “Not seeing much of the alleged forced selling here despite some equities trading below mNAV,” noted Rafael. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $87,500, down over 7% in the last week.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin IFP|Bitcoin Speculation|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-17 08:00:50

Top Chainlink Addresses Have Been Adding Since The Start Of November In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed about the latest trend in the holdings of the top Chainlink addresses. Santiment defines “top addresses” as the 100 largest wallets on the network. Related Reading: Bitcoin, Ethereum Plunge Triggers Near-$600 Million Crypto Long Flush This category would naturally include the largest of whales on the blockchain, who carry some degree of influence due to the sheer size of their holdings. As such, the behavior of these investors may be worth monitoring. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows how the Chainlink supply held by the top addresses has changed over the last few months: The value of the metric appears to have gone up in recent weeks | Source: Santiment on X As displayed in the above graph, the combined supply of the 100 largest Chainlink wallets witnessed a decline in October, implying that these massive entities were participating in distribution. The selling from the top addresses first began as LINK’s price went through a sharp crash. The selloff continued until the start of November, when the indicator finally arrived at a bottom. Shortly after, the supply of the 100 largest LINK investors saw a reversal, signaling the return of accumulation. According to Santiment, these whales have collectively added 20.46 million tokens (about $263 million) to their holdings. This has not only retraced the October drawdown in their supply, but also in fact taken it to an even higher level. While the top Chainlink addresses have shown net accumulation since the start of November, the pace of buying hasn’t been constant. From the chart, it’s apparent that most of the accumulation occurred in November, with not much coming in December so far. It now remains to be seen what trend the 100 largest LINK investors will show next, and whether it will have any influence on where the cryptocurrency heads next. In some other news, Chainlink recently lost a multi-year technical support line, as analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted in an X post. As is visible in the above chart, Chainlink made two retests of this line during the first half of 2025 and each time, it found support. The retest that occurred after the latest price downtrend, however, ended up in failure, with the asset dropping below this line for the first time since 2023. Related Reading: US Bitcoin Session Leads December Returns After Weak November After the breakdown, LINK attempted to retrace it, but the retest from below also ended in rejection, a potential sign that the support may have flipped into resistance.

The discussion examined the shifting power dynamics shaping the future of global payments and financial infrastructure. Caption: Bybit CEO and Co-Founder Ben Zhou speaks during a session at Fintech Abu Dhabi, held as part of Abu Dhabi Finance Week (ADFW) 2025. The session, titled “Invisible Payments, Visible Growth: Under the Hood of Today’s Power Plays,” brought together leaders who are helping redefine the modern financial stack. Zhou appeared alongside Hosam Arab, CEO and Co-founder of Tabby, and Mark Rydquist, managing director at Google. The panel was moderated by Lenah Hassaballah, editor at CNN Business Arabic. Set against ADFW 2025’s theme, “Engineering the Capital Network,” the panel explored how financial systems are being redesigned to harness innovation, artificial intelligence and global capital flows, with the UAE and the wider Gulf Cooperation Council increasingly positioned as a hub for finance and investment. Addressing Industry Security Challenges Following the February 2025 Incident The panel also addressed security and governance, with Zhou responding to questions about the major security incident in February 2025. He said the incident represented “the ultimate test” of Bybit’s operational discipline and its dedication to user protection. Zhou pointed to a broader industry challenge: the speed at which attackers can move funds across blockchains and through decentralized mixers, often outpacing traditional tracing processes. “When an incident like this happens, it’s really a time race,” he said, noting that decoding transactions can involve a two-day lag , during which “the hacker can simply move money to multiple locations.” To reduce this systemic vulnerability, Zhou highlighted a coordinated industry initiative he referred to as the Lazarus Group — a cooperative effort designed to improve information sharing and response times across exchanges and OTC participants. He said the goal is to ensure that “when another victim happens, the whole industry can respond faster,” strengthening collective defenses against complex, cross-chain attacks. Why Crypto Improves the Future of Payments Discussing the user experience of crypto payments, Zhou said cryptocurrencies offer a more modern and efficient settlement infrastructure. “To me, crypto is just synchronization. It’s modern. It’s 24/7,” he said, noting that vendors increasingly prefer real-time settlement over traditional processors that reconcile transactions only at limited intervals. He added that crypto provides greater access and on-chain transparency , allowing users to transact more efficiently and with fewer intermediaries. Zhou emphasized crypto’s ability to reduce friction across global payment systems. Faster settlement, transparent tokenized systems and decentralized infrastructure together create a more open and efficient payments landscape — one positioned to support the invisible payment experiences users expect as digital finance matures. “As digital assets move further into the mainstream, secure and scalable infrastructure, combined with a strong foundation of user trust, will be key to supporting long-term growth and practical adoption,” Zhou said.

The discussion examined the shifting power dynamics shaping the future of global payments and financial infrastructure. Caption: Bybit CEO and Co-Founder Ben Zhou speaks during a session at Fintech Abu Dhabi, held as part of Abu Dhabi Finance Week (ADFW) 2025. The session, titled “Invisible Payments, Visible Growth: Under the Hood of Today’s Power Plays,” brought together leaders who are helping redefine the modern financial stack. Zhou appeared alongside Hosam Arab, CEO and Co-founder of Tabby, and Mark Rydquist, managing director at Google. The panel was moderated by Lenah Hassaballah, editor at CNN Business Arabic. Set against ADFW 2025’s theme, “Engineering the Capital Network,” the panel explored how financial systems are being redesigned to harness innovation, artificial intelligence and global capital flows, with the UAE and the wider Gulf Cooperation Council increasingly positioned as a hub for finance and investment. Addressing Industry Security Challenges Following the February 2025 Incident The panel also addressed security and governance, with Zhou responding to questions about the major security incident in February 2025. He said the incident represented “the ultimate test” of Bybit’s operational discipline and its dedication to user protection. Zhou pointed to a broader industry challenge: the speed at which attackers can move funds across blockchains and through decentralized mixers, often outpacing traditional tracing processes. “When an incident like this happens, it’s really a time race,” he said, noting that decoding transactions can involve a two-day lag, during which “the hacker can simply move money to multiple locations.” To reduce this systemic vulnerability, Zhou highlighted a coordinated industry initiative he referred to as the Lazarus Group — a cooperative effort designed to improve information sharing and response times across exchanges and OTC participants. He said the goal is to ensure that “when another victim happens, the whole industry can respond faster,” strengthening collective defenses against complex, cross-chain attacks. Why Crypto Improves the Future of Payments Discussing the user experience of crypto payments, Zhou said cryptocurrencies offer a more modern and efficient settlement infrastructure. “To me, crypto is just synchronization. It’s modern. It’s 24/7,” he said, noting that vendors increasingly prefer real-time settlement over traditional processors that reconcile transactions only at limited intervals. He added that crypto provides greater access and on-chain transparency, allowing users to transact more efficiently and with fewer intermediaries. Zhou emphasized crypto’s ability to reduce friction across global payment systems. Faster settlement, transparent tokenized systems and decentralized infrastructure together create a more open and efficient payments landscape — one positioned to support the invisible payment experiences users expect as digital finance matures. “As digital assets move further into the mainstream, secure and scalable infrastructure, combined with a strong foundation of user trust, will be key to supporting long-term growth and practical adoption,” Zhou said.

In a significant move affecting its marketplace, Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has announced it will delist eight spot trading pairs . This action is scheduled for 03:00 AM UTC on December 19th. If you hold any of the affected assets, immediate attention is required to understand the implications and secure your holdings. Which Spot Trading Pairs Is Binance Delisting? The decision impacts a specific set of markets. Binance will remove the following eight spot trading pairs from its platform: AI/FDUSD BICO/BTC DOLO/BNB MITO/BNB MITO/FDUSD MOVE/BTC NEWT/BNB OM/BTC It is crucial to note that this is a delisting of the trading pairs , not necessarily the underlying tokens themselves. However, the removal of these specific markets will directly impact how these assets can be traded on Binance. Why Would Binance Delist Spot Trading Pairs? Exchanges like Binance regularly review all listed trading pairs to ensure a healthy and compliant market. The decision to delist spot trading pairs typically stems from a periodic review. Common reasons include: Low Liquidity and Trading Volume: Pairs that fail to attract sufficient user interest become inefficient to maintain. Project Development and Commitment: Concerns about a token project’s commitment to its roadmap or community. Network Stability and Security: Issues with the underlying blockchain of a token. Poor Quality of Public Communication: Lack of transparent and regular updates from the project team. Regulatory Compliance: Evolving global regulations may necessitate changes. While Binance has not specified the exact reason for each pair, this move aligns with its standard practice of maintaining a robust trading ecosystem. What Should Traders Do Before the Delisting Date? If you currently hold any of the tokens involved in these pairs, you must take action before the deadline. Binance will cease trading for these specific markets at the stated time. Therefore, you have several options: Sell or Convert Your Tokens: Before December 19th, you can trade your holdings for another cryptocurrency within the affected pair (like BTC, BNB, or FDUSD). Withdraw to a Private Wallet: If you believe in the long-term potential of the token, you can withdraw it to a compatible self-custody wallet. Remember to account for network withdrawal fees. Do Nothing (Not Recommended): After delisting, you will still own the tokens in your Binance Spot Wallet, but you will be unable to trade them on the platform. Your only option later would be withdrawal. Proactive management of your portfolio is essential to avoid being stuck with illiquid assets on the exchange. How Does This Affect the Broader Crypto Market? While the delisting of these spot trading pairs is a routine event, it serves as a powerful reminder for all investors. It highlights the importance of due diligence. Trading pairs with consistently low volume often carry higher risk. Furthermore, this event underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency landscape, where exchanges continuously adapt to provide the best user experience and maintain regulatory standing. Conclusion: Stay Informed and Proactive The announcement from Binance to delist eight spot trading pairs is a clear call to action for involved traders. By understanding the affected pairs, the potential reasons behind such decisions, and the steps you can take, you can navigate this change smoothly. Always monitor official exchange announcements and manage your assets proactively to stay ahead in the fast-paced world of crypto trading. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Does delisting the trading pair mean the token is being removed completely? A: Not necessarily. This action removes the specific market (e.g., OM/BTC). The OM token itself may still be listed against other trading pairs like OM/USDT, or it may be available for withdrawal. Check Binance’s full announcement for details on each token. Q2: What happens to my open orders for these pairs? A: All open orders for the affected spot trading pairs will be automatically canceled by Binance at 03:00 AM UTC on December 19th. You should manage your orders before this time. Q3: Can I still withdraw the tokens after delisting? A: Yes, in most cases, withdrawal services for the tokens will remain available for a period after the trading pair is delisted. However, you should confirm this for each specific asset and complete withdrawals promptly. Q4: Will this delisting affect the price of the tokens? A: It often can. The removal of a major trading pair typically reduces liquidity and easy access, which can lead to increased price volatility or downward pressure on the affected token in the short term. Q5: How often does Binance delist trading pairs? A: Binance conducts periodic reviews, so delistings are a regular, though not frequent, occurrence. They are part of the exchange’s strategy to maintain market quality. Q6: Where can I find official announcements about delistings? A: Always refer to the official Binance Announcements page or blog. Avoid relying on unofficial sources for critical financial information. Found this guide on the Binance delisting helpful? Navigating exchange updates is key for every crypto trader.

55913194,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=246215,1765959011,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Massive Bitcoin Transfer: Two Wallets Move $347.6M to Binance, Sparking Sell-Off Fears",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-transfer-matrixport-binance/,"BitcoinWorld Massive Bitcoin Transfer: Two Wallets Move $347.6M to Binance, Sparking Sell-Off Fears A colossal Bitcoin transfer has sent ripples through the crypto market. Blockchain analysts at Lookonchain reported that two wallets, linked to financial services giant Matrixport, moved a staggering 4,000 BTC—worth approximately $347.6 million—to the Binance exchange. Such large-scale deposits are often viewed by traders as a potential precursor to selling, immediately triggering speculation about near-term price pressure. This event highlights how major institutional movements can act as a powerful signal for the entire market. What Does This Massive Bitcoin Transfer Mean? When a significant amount of cryptocurrency moves to an exchange, it typically indicates one of two things: the holder intends to sell, or they are moving funds for safekeeping or other operational purposes. However, given the sheer scale of this Bitcoin transfer , market participants are leaning toward the sell-off interpretation. This single transaction represents a substantial volume that could influence liquidity and short-term price action if executed as a market sell order. Therefore, it serves as a critical data point for traders assessing market sentiment. Who is Behind the Move? The Matrixport Connection The wallets involved in this transaction are “presumed to belong” to Matrixport, a prominent crypto financial services platform. While blockchain analysis can trace funds and link addresses to entities, it’s not always 100% conclusive. This connection is crucial because Matrixport is a major player. Movements from such entities carry more weight than those from anonymous retail wallets. Their actions are closely watched as a barometer for institutional strategy. Understanding the source helps contextualize the potential market impact of the Bitcoin transfer . Why Do Exchange Deposits Worry the Market? Think of a cryptocurrency exchange as a shop floor. Coins in a private wallet are like items in a warehouse—they’re out of the immediate market. The moment they hit an exchange, they become available for sale. A large Bitcoin transfer to an exchange, therefore, increases the immediate sell-side supply. This can lead to several outcomes: Increased Selling Pressure: If the coins are sold, they can push prices down. Liquidity Injection: They can provide much-needed liquidity for large buyers. Sentiment Shift: It can create a psychological effect, causing other traders to sell in anticipation of a drop. The key question is intent, which the blockchain itself cannot reveal. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should you do when you see news of a major Bitcoin transfer ? First, don’t panic. Large movements happen regularly. Use this information as one piece of a larger puzzle. Check other metrics like exchange net flows, funding rates, and overall market structure. Consider if this aligns with a broader trend or is an isolated event. For long-term holders, such events often represent noise. For active traders, they can signal a need to adjust risk management, perhaps by tightening stop-losses. Always verify data from multiple sources before making a decision. Conclusion: Decoding the Signal from the Noise The movement of $347.6 million in Bitcoin to Binance is undeniably significant. It underscores the transparent yet enigmatic nature of blockchain markets, where every move is visible but motives are hidden. While it points to potential selling pressure from a key institution, it is not a definitive predictor of a market crash. Savvy investors will monitor the fallout, watch for absorption of any sell orders, and integrate this event into a comprehensive view of market health. In the volatile world of crypto, context is king. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Does a Bitcoin transfer to an exchange always mean a sale? A: Not always. While it is a strong indicator, institutions may also transfer funds for custody, margin trading, or other financial operations. The intent is not visible on-chain. Q2: How does Lookonchain know the wallets are linked to Matrixport? A: Blockchain analysts use clustering techniques, tracing historical transactions, and linking deposit addresses to known exchange accounts or institutional services to make educated presumptions. Q3: Can a single $347M sale crash the Bitcoin price? A> It’s unlikely to “crash” the market, but it can cause significant short-term volatility and price slippage, especially if sold via market orders in a low-liquidity environment. Q4: Should I sell my Bitcoin if I see such large transfers? A> Making a decision based on a single on-chain event is risky. It should be considered alongside technical analysis, macroeconomic factors, and your own investment strategy. Q5: Where can I track large Bitcoin transfers myself? A> Several blockchain analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Arkham Intelligence, and CryptoQuant track and report on large transactions in real-time. Q6: Has Matrixport commented on this transfer? A> As of now, there has been no official public statement from Matrixport regarding this specific transaction, which is common for institutional players.

The money’s expected from Alphabet, its parent company, plus outside investors betting on the tech. If the deal goes through, it’d value Waymo at $110 billion. That’s a massive jump and shows just how dominant the company’s become in America’s robotaxi race. The cash will help fund an aggressive expansion that’s already burning through serious money. Waymo’s currently got operations, upcoming launches, or active testing in 26 cities worldwide. On Tuesday, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said Waymo should start meaningfully contributing to the company’s bottom line by 2027. This funding round would bring in over twice what Waymo raised last time. That was back in October 2024, a $5.6 billion series C at a $45 billion valuation. Alphabet committed $5 billion as part of a multi-year investment then. Several big names backed that round alongside Alphabet: Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global, and T. Rowe Price. Waymo’s co-CEOs Tekedra Mawakana and Dmitri Dolgov said at the time they’d use it to scale up the service. Service already active in five major cities Right now, you can catch a paid Waymo ride in Austin, the San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, Atlanta, and Los Angeles. Business is growing fast. Earlier this month, reports showed Waymo’s doing around 450,000 paid rides weekly. The company said in December it’s completed 14 million trips in 2025 so far, which puts it on track to cross 20 million total rides since starting in 2020. Next year looks even busier. Waymo’s planning to launch in 11 additional US cities: Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego, and Washington, D.C. Waymo will also expand to London in 2026, the company’s first international market, as reported by Cryptopolitan previously, Tesla and Zoox work to catch up Tesla’s been working to catch up. About six months back, the company started a limited robotaxi service in Austin with safety drivers inside. Now Elon Musk posted on X over the weekend that testing’s underway “with no occupants in the car.” Musk has spent over a decade promising that Tesla vehicles would become fully self-driving robotaxis capable of operating without human supervision. Then there’s Zoox, Amazon’s robotaxi unit . The company launched free rides this year around the Las Vegas Strip and in some San Francisco neighborhoods. Jesse Levinson, Zoox’s cofounder and CTO, told a conference crowd in San Francisco that paid rides should start in Las Vegas early next year. San Francisco’s paid service will come later in 2026. Both depend on getting the necessary federal and state approvals first.

Key Takeaways: Warren is asking whether US authorities are investigating DeFi exchanges over national security risks. She warns DeFi could enable illicit finance as crypto legislation stalls in Congress. The letter raises concerns about political influence and Trump-linked crypto activity. In a letter sent Monday to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Attorney General Pam Bondi, the Massachusetts Democrat asked whether their departments were “investigating significant national security risks posed by decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges like PancakeSwap.” Warren requested a response by Jan. 12, framing the inquiry as part of broader congressional debates over crypto regulation. Warren Warns DeFi Could Be Exploited for Illicit Finance Without Oversight Warren said the public deserves clarity as Congress weighs crypto market structure legislation, including measures aimed at preventing illicit finance. She pointed to concerns raised by national security experts and the crypto industry itself, warning that decentralized finance could be exploited by terrorists, criminals and sanctioned states if left unchecked. The senator also questioned whether political considerations were influencing how crypto-related cases are enforced, citing what she described as selective action under the Trump administration. Her letter referenced reports linking crypto activity to North Korea’s money laundering efforts and flagged claims that enforcement priorities may not be applied evenly across the sector. Warren’s intervention comes as legislative momentum around crypto regulation slows in Washington. SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN SENDS LETTER TO TREASURY & DOJ OVER TRUMP-LINKED $USD1 AND PANCAKESWAP, WARNING OF NATIONAL SECURITY RISKS AND POTENTIAL FOR MONEY LAUNDERING ON DEXS pic.twitter.com/EDhQoZCzpO — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) December 16, 2025 Lawmakers had expected the Senate Banking Committee to advance the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, a key digital asset market structure bill, before the end of the year. However, committee chair Tim Scott confirmed Monday that a markup hearing on the legislation has been delayed until 2026. The letter also highlighted reports alleging that PancakeSwap had been promoting tokens tied to World Liberty Financial, a crypto company linked to the Trump family. Warren said such activity raised questions about conflicts of interest and the president’s potential influence over crypto policy, concerns echoed by other Senate Democrats. The renewed focus on Warren’s crypto stance comes as political dynamics shift ahead of the next election cycle. John Deaton, a lawyer known for representing XRP holders in legal battles with regulators, announced in November that he will run as a Republican for the US Senate in 2026. Deaton previously challenged Warren in the 2024 election and has emerged as a vocal critic of her approach to digital asset regulation. Warren, Reed Urge DOJ and Treasury to Probe Trump-Linked Crypto Firm Last month, Warren and Jack Reed also called on the DOJ and the US Treasury to investigate World Liberty Financial, a crypto company linked to the Trump family, over alleged connections to illicit actors in North Korea and Russia. The senators cited a September 2025 report from watchdog group Accountable.US, which claimed the firm sold tokens to buyers with ties to money laundering platforms, an Iranian crypto exchange and North Korean hackers. World Liberty Financial has denied any wrongdoing or conflicts of interest in response to the allegations. World Liberty Financial lists President Donald Trump as a “co-founder emeritus,” with his sons Donald Jr. and Eric serving as Web3 ambassadors and Barron Trump as a DeFi visionary.

The GMC is Bhutan’s flagship economic initiative, where it plans to harness innovation, sustainability, and financial connectivity to foster national growth and create long-term prosperity for the country’s youth and broader population of roughly 800,000 people, in line with His Majesty King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck’s vision of applying modern digital technologies with care and responsibility. Located in the southern town of Gelephu near the Indian border, the GMC was officially launched in 2024 to reverse the outflow of talent by generating high-value employment opportunities, and also to support Bhutan’s plans to deepen its involvement in Bitcoin mining and broader digital asset infrastructure. According to a December 17 announcement , Bhutan will use up to 10,000 Bitcoin from its national reserves, which is estimated to be valued at roughly $875 million based on current prices. Officials said the country is considering a mix of collateralization, risk-managed yield strategies, and long-term holding plans that prioritize the preservation and compounding potential of its digital asset treasury. “Any use of Bitcoin will be guided by strong governance and prudence, with an emphasis on capital preservation, appropriate oversight, and transparency,” an excerpt from the announcement stated. King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck wants every Bhutanese citizen to benefit from the GMC project and is therefore developing a “new land policy” to ensure broad-based prosperity through shared ownership of the region’s future. “Think of GMC as a company and landowners as its shareholders. Since most land is state-owned, Bhutanese from all Dzongkhags will share in its success,” he said. Bhutan integrates crypto across GMC Bhutan has already begun integrating Bitcoin and other digital assets into GMC’s strategic reserves and has introduced various crypto-based services to support digital asset adoption. For instance, Bhutan launched TER, a sovereign digital token on the Solana blockchain, fully backed by physical gold reserves, earlier this month. The TER token is designed to combine the reliability of gold with the advantages of blockchain-based finance, with DK Bank serving as the exclusive distributor and Matrixdock providing the infrastructure for tokenization and collateral verification. Earlier, the country migrated its entire national digital identity platform to the Ethereum blockchain, making it the world’s first nation to anchor a population-wide identity system on a public network. All of these initiatives are expected to form the foundation of Bhutan’s digital economy as the country steadily builds out the GMC over the coming years. Earlier this year, Bhutan also became the first country to enable nationwide crypto payments for tourism services. To achieve this, the government partnered with Binance Pay and DK Bank to allow international travelers with Binance accounts to pay for everything from hotels and visas to local goods and services using crypto.

In a post on X, Aave founder Stani Kulechov confirmed that the SEC’s investigation, which began around 2021 or early 2022, had concluded and that the regulator does not plan to recommend any enforcement action against the protocol. “DeFi has faced unfair regulatory pressure in recent years … we’re glad to put this behind us as we enter a new era where developers can truly build the future of finance,” he said With all regulatory obstacles now removed, Aave is developing a comprehensive plan for 2026 to expand the lending protocol’s reach and unify real-world assets on its DeFi platform. Fundamentally, this plan has an ambitious target of a $1 billion deposit value in real-world assets. Aave V4 and Horizon set to revolutionize DeFi A key aspect of the plan is the launch of Aave V4 , a significant upgrade to the protocol. This latest version features a “hub-and-spoke” pool structure, in which pooled assets are consolidated into centralized hub pools. At the same time, highly customizable lending markets can still be created through external spoke pools. The design is intended to optimize liquidity, expand borrowing and lending facilities, and establish a robust mechanism for managing larger asset values. V4, Kulechov added, was infrastructure for the next-generation finance platform, although it could also be used by institutional clients, including fintech firms and institutions operating in various new markets. Another significant piece of technology is Horizon, which aims to integrate traditional finance and DeFi. Horizon will raise its existing deposits — which are now in the tens of millions of dollars — further than a billion dollars by partnering with leading banks and fintech companies. The development positions Aave in institutional finance, expanding the range of features delivered by the lending service to business owners, personal users, and startups. Aave’s focus on mainstream adoption was evident with the release of its mobile app at the end of 2025. Describing the app as a “Trojan horse” for mass adoption, Kulechov said it will facilitate DeFi activities like borrowing, lending, and saving. Aave plans to roll out its full platform by early 2026, aiming to target one million users. The protocol aims to make decentralized finance accessible to everyone, including professionals, by prioritizing user-friendly, people-focused design. Through these efforts, Aave seeks to democratize financial services for a wider audience. Together, these initiatives reflect Aave’s ambition to drive growth across the decentralized finance industry by having its platform at the forefront of what looks set to be an exciting year for this industry in the future, creating a more scalable, inclusive, and institutionally connected DeFi environment. SEC ends long investigation, clearing path for growth The scrutiny on Aave closed after four years. Kulechov described the findings of an investigation in a social media post as the beginning of a “new era” for developers building decentralized financial systems. The news drew positive reactions from market analysts and investors alike as it reaffirmed the DeFi space and showcased positive developments for other crypto protocols that are also under regulatory scrutiny. More broadly, the SEC’s closure is expected to have far-reaching effects, encouraging traditional financial and fintech firms to engage with Aave and other decentralized platforms. With this regulatory hurdle cleared, Aave can now move forward with its carefully planned 2026 Vision. As part of its growth strategy, Aave is launching an annual token buyback program to strengthen the AAVE market and governance. The platform is also expanding support for new blockchain networks to drive institutional liquidity. In the last quarter of 2022, it completed the work to fine-tune its strategies for scaling up profitably in high-growth markets.

For cryptocurrency traders watching traditional markets for correlation signals, these currency movements reveal critical insights about global risk appetite and central bank policy divergence. Why Did the Dollar Rebound From Multi-Month Lows? The US dollar’s recovery represents more than just technical correction—it signals shifting market expectations about Federal Reserve policy. After weeks of decline driven by expectations of imminent rate cuts, several factors converged to support the greenback: Resilient US economic data challenging recession narratives Hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials Technical support levels holding at critical price points Global risk aversion benefiting safe-haven currencies This dollar rebound occurred despite ongoing debates about when the Fed might begin easing monetary policy. The timing suggests markets may have been too aggressive in pricing rate cuts, creating conditions for this sharp reversal. Sterling Slumps: How Soft Inflation Data Crushed the Pound The British pound’s dramatic decline followed UK inflation data that came in significantly below expectations. The numbers revealed: Metric Actual Forecast Previous CPI Year-over-Year 3.9% 4.4% 4.6% Core CPI 5.1% 5.6% 5.7% Services Inflation 6.3% 6.6% 6.6% This inflation data surprise immediately shifted expectations for Bank of England policy, with markets now pricing in earlier and more aggressive rate cuts. The sterling slumps reaction was particularly severe against both the dollar and euro, wiping out weeks of gains in mere hours. Forex Market Implications of Diverging Central Bank Policies The contrasting fortunes of the dollar and pound highlight how currency trading strategies must adapt to changing policy landscapes. Key implications include: Increased volatility as markets reassess rate cut timelines Potential for carry trade unwinds as yield differentials narrow Cross-currency correlations breaking down during policy divergence Opportunities in currency pairs beyond major dollar crosses For active participants in the forex market , these developments create both risks and opportunities. The speed of the moves underscores how quickly sentiment can shift based on single data releases. Actionable Insights for Currency Trading Strategies Successful navigation of current market conditions requires specific approaches: Monitor economic calendars religiously – Inflation reports have become market-moving events Watch for policy signal divergence – Central bank communications now matter more than ever Implement strict risk management – Volatility spikes can trigger margin calls quickly Consider correlation hedging – Traditional currency moves increasingly impact crypto markets These strategies help traders capitalize on the opportunities created by events like the dollar rebound and sterling slumps while managing associated risks. FAQs: Understanding the Currency Market Moves What caused the pound’s sudden decline? The British pound collapsed after UK inflation data came in significantly below expectations, suggesting the Bank of England might cut rates sooner than anticipated. Is the dollar rebound sustainable? Sustainability depends on upcoming US economic data and Federal Reserve communications. The rebound reflects market reassessment of overly dovish expectations. How does this affect cryptocurrency markets? Currency movements influence global risk appetite and liquidity conditions, which indirectly impact cryptocurrency valuations and trading volumes. Which central banks are most relevant to watch? The Federal Reserve , Bank of England , and European Central Bank are currently driving most currency market movements through their policy signals. What’s the best approach for retail forex traders? Focus on risk management, avoid overleveraging during volatile periods, and pay close attention to economic calendar events. Conclusion: Navigating the New Currency Landscape The dramatic dollar rebound and sterling slumps serve as powerful reminders that forex market conditions can change with breathtaking speed. For those engaged in currency trading , success now depends less on predicting long-term trends and more on reacting swiftly to data surprises like the recent inflation data shock. The coming weeks will test whether these moves represent temporary corrections or the beginning of more sustained trends, making careful position sizing and continuous market monitoring essential for all market participants.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) or Mutuum Finance (MUTM),https://www.cryptopolitan.com/which-is-the-top-crypto-to-buy-under-0-10-shiba-inu-shib-or-mutuum-finance-mutm/,"Low-cost crypto assets have historically piqued the interest of investors in search of mooning gains, especially when market dynamics start to rotate capital towards emerging projects. Tokens with a price point under $0.10 have found themselves in the middle of this maelstrom, boasting both affordable price points and astronomical returns. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is one such project that finds widespread familiarity within this space, boasting a massive following and a meme-driven reputation which allowed for life-changing returns in years past. Nevertheless, with a more mature market, investors are becoming increasingly focused on core usability, project structure, and early adoption factor when setting out to find what crypto to buy. As such, a new crypto project named Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has firmly placed itself in the limelight with a price point of $0.035, in the middle of Phase 6 of a presale and closing in fast on project allocation at a blistering pace with over 18,500 unique holders and a staggering $19.5 million in strategic capital raised, all in service of a strict decentralized finance application focused on lending, borrowing, and interest generation. Shiba Inu Faces a Defining Moment Amid Price Levels Replacing Hype Shiba Inu (SHIB) is now at a critical point in time after a brutal year with a token price decline of nearly 70% over the last year and over 90% from its all-time high, leaving serious doubts over its viability in light of a passing interest in meme coins. The reality is now very different with chain metrics and pricing much more important than narrative-driven sentiment, and this is clearly evident in SHIB pricing action. SHIB continues to be constrained below an established downtrend, with $0.0000092 establishing itself as a critical resistance level which must be reclaimed if chatter over the token being “dead” continues to gain credibility. A break above this level will likely unlock a path towards $0.000010, $0.000011, and perhaps $0.000014 in line with the last major swing high level but until then, market sentiment is delicate. With investors increasingly becoming far more discerning in their focus on utility, on-chain mechanics, and early-stage potential rather than established meme coin sentiment, they are naturally shifting focus towards other crypto assets such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the top crypto to buy which is positioning for the next phase of crypto adoption. 98% of Phase 6 Presale for Mutuum Finance Sold Out Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is continuing to show excellent performance in each stage of their presale. After the initial sell-out of up to 98% of Phase 6, the project is valued at $0.035 per token and is quickly gaining popularity. To date, the presale event has gathered over 18,500 token holders, generating over $19.5 million. Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized finance with a financial ecosystem where they are creating solutions with tangible real-world usage. $100,000 Token Giveaway Rewards Early Participants As a way to connect with a community, Mutuum Finance is carrying out a $100,000 giveaway . Ten people will win $10,000 in MUTM tokens. Such an event shows the project’s focus on developing a dedicated community. The project wants to reward people for showing interest and engaging with the platform. For their official Bug Bounty Program, Mutuum Finance partnered with CertiK. Bug hunters in this platform can win cash prizes from a total of $50,000 USDT in a program with a well-defined format covering four levels of vulnerability, which include critical, major, minor, and low. Dual Lending Protocol Enables Complete Control and Flexibility Mutuum Finance is a high-performance decentralized lending platform based on the combination of Peer to Contract (P2C) and Peer to Peer (P2P) models. The P2C platform functions using smart contracts that work independently with minimal human interaction. The P2P platform eliminates the middleman and enables lending and borrowing directly. With this model in place, borrowers have control over their funds and gain returns in a safe and flexible way compared to conventional financial services. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is valued at $0.035 with over 18,500+ holders and $19.5M raised. In Phase 7, the pricing increases to $0.04, which marks the final stage before missing out on early access to its lending protocol and interest-bearing tokens. For investors looking for the top crypto to buy or a new crypto, Mutuum Finance represents a high-potential opportunity with real-world utility and strong early-stage growth.

His post describes a 2023 International Monetary Fund (IMF) document that grouped XRP with a narrow set of technologies relevant to future cross-border settlement systems. The source of the publication matters because it shows institutional interest in XRP . Xaif’s comment surfaced at a time when most XRP discussion centers on charts and short-term catalysts. He shifted attention elsewhere, focusing on how global institutions describe settlement infrastructure when they speak to policymakers and financial operators. This context adds weight because the IMF does not publish promotional material. It evaluates systems based on structure, governance, liquidity, and compliance. A 2023 IMF document placed #XRP on a short list of technologies that could support future Cross-border settlement systems. pic.twitter.com/c6CMz5iRQk — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) December 14, 2025 What the IMF Document Says The attached image shows a passage from an IMF paper on fintech and payment systems. The text states that three models are emerging for settlement and marketplaces. One of those models is described as “a private settlement asset and marketplace,” and highlights XRP. The document positions XRP alongside other structural approaches rather than treating it as an experiment or peripheral asset. The document contrasts this model with open-source marketplaces, such as Stellar or other DeFi networks, and with systems based on unbacked crypto assets. It then explains why a public solution, potentially operated by a regulated private entity, carries advantages. These include coordination of participation and liquidity, trusted governance, operational stability, and compatibility with financial integrity standards. These criteria align closely with Ripple’s position on XRP in institutional payments . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why This Matters for Adoption Xaif’s point gains strength because the IMF did not discuss XRP in a retail or speculative context. It discussed XRP as infrastructure. The IMF has recognized Ripple and XRP multiple times, and that distinction matters for adoption. Banks and payment providers do not select systems based on narratives. They select systems that solve coordination problems and meet compliance demands. Appearing in this category validates XRP’s design and highlights its benefits. The IMF text treats XRP as an existing example of a settlement asset, not a theoretical proposal. That status supports the argument that XRP already fits into conversations about future payment rails. Price growth follows usage over time, especially in payment networks. Liquidity-driven assets gain value as transaction volume increases. The IMF reference does not predict price targets, but it does something more important. It reinforces the case for XRP adoption and shows that it can scale within regulated environments. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Despite calls for a bottom, the cryptocurrency does not seem to be heading in that direction, and some analysts have shared reasons as to why this is the case. Crypt analyst Lingrid maps out the trajectory of the Bitcoin price, showing a bullish short-term, but ultimately ending with more declines. Why The Bitcoin Price Could Crash Further Lingrid’s analysis focuses on Bitcoin’s recent price performance, having hit resistance multiple times above the $92,000 level. This comes as the digital asset is “capped below channel border,” something that is inherently bearish for the price, given the recent price action. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts How Low The XRP Price Will Go Before Bouncing The rejections between $92,500 and $93,500, according to the analyst, show that the Bitcoin price is likely to place in lower highs. Thus, even in the event of a recovery trend, this level still remains a significant roadblock to any rally. Furthermore, the crypto analyst adds that the recent slowdown in the Bitcoin price action has pushed it into a tight compression. With the price still sitting above the rising support line while this happens, Lingrid believes that this shows Bitcoin is entering into a state of equilibrium, and not strength. Usually, this means that the Bitcoin price could be headed for “directional expansion.” Presently, all eyes are on the bears and sellers as the Bitcoin price struggles to hold support. There is still the possibility that the price will rise to $92,500 before facing a rejection. In this scenario, it would trigger further decline toward $82,000 to put in lower lows. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Price Still Hit $140,000? What The Global M2 Money Supply Says There is also the possibility that the digital asset does escape this bearish scenario, but the buyers would have to step back in the ring. Mainly, the Bitcoin price must break out and then hold above the channel, sustaining a move above $92,500. If this plays out, then Lingrid believes that the bearish thesis could be invalidated. Such a case would mean that the Bitcoin focus shifts back toward $100,000. However, with the price currently trending below $90,000 and sentiment being mostly negative, the chances of an invalidation remain slim.

The asset is moving sideways after a sharp drop earlier in the month. Despite small bounces, there’s no clear sign of a trend reversal yet. The focus now is on whether Bitcoin can break above $88,000. If not, the move toward lower levels may continue. $88K Stands as the Line to Beat Analyst Michaël van de Poppe noted that BTC is currently undecided, consolidating between support and resistance zones. “Trend remains to be down, and in order to adjust the trend, a breakout above $88K is required,” he stated on X. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Chart 17.12. Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X This week, Bitcoin briefly touched $88,000 before falling back toward $87,500. The 7-day range between $85,100 and $93,000 reflects uncertain movement. With no clear breakout, the lower areas near $83,000 and $80,000 are starting to draw attention. Kamran Asghar, another analyst, believes Bitcoin is searching for a new base after breaking below a long-standing support line. He marked $86,500 as a possible short-term floor, but warned that deeper levels may be tested. He pointed to a zone between $72,000 and $75,000 that hasn’t been touched since the 2024 breakout. That area, often referred to by traders as a key demand zone, could offer support if the decline continues. If the current range breaks, Bitcoin may move toward that lower target range. Long-Term Trend Break Raises Concern Bitcoin has now lost the Supertrend support on the weekly chart for the first time since January 2023. According to a post by Bitcoinsensus, this marks the first major break of structure since the bull cycle began, adding weight to the bearish sentiment currently in play. Adding to this, long-term holders are starting to exit their positions. “Long-term holders are now selling $BTC at their fastest pace in 7 years,” said Ted. This shift adds to the selling pressure and reduces the strength of any bounce attempts. Moreover, the drop in Bitcoin’s price over recent days is being linked to liquidations across leverage-heavy positions. “Bitcoin’s recent price drop was driven by liquidations — not spot selling,” reported Bitcoin Duniya. The move reflects a flush of excess leverage rather than weakness in underlying demand. As CryptoPotato recently reported , current selling pressure is still stronger than demand. Until that changes, price recovery may be limited, and further downside cannot be ruled out.

King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck announced the allocation during his National Day Address, framing the commitment as a generational investment in youth employment and national prosperity tied to a new economic hub in southern Bhutan. The pledge channels Bitcoin holdings into GMC development through mechanisms including collateralized lending, risk-managed yield strategies, and long-term holding approaches designed to preserve capital while financing infrastructure. This development became possible due to a multi-year commitment to leverage Bitcoin’s compounding value over time, rather than converting reserves to cash. Officials said the final implementation details are expected in the coming months, under governance frameworks that emphasize capital preservation, appropriate oversight, and transparency. Source: Breathe Bhutan Sovereign Mining and Clean Energy Foundation Bhutan ranks as the world’s fifth-largest government Bitcoin holder , having mined 13,011 BTC since 2021 using surplus hydroelectric power from Himalayan rivers. The renewable energy-powered mining operation converts excess national grid capacity into digital assets without additional environmental impact, with crypto holdings now exceeding 11,286 BTC, valued at $1.28 billion, according to Bitbo data. Source: Bitbo The Kingdom’s hydroelectric resources at times exceed domestic demand, enabling clean energy to be converted into long-term national assets through the national power generation utility. This mining strategy accounts for over 25% of Bhutan’s GDP while maintaining environmental sustainability commitments central to the nation’s development philosophy, which balances economic progress with ecological stewardship. The Kingdom established Green Digital Ltd through GMC to develop blockchain infrastructure and, recently, partnered with Cumberland DRW on digital asset trading frameworks, sustainable mining expansion, AI compute facilities, and national stablecoin development. Gelay Jamtsho, Green Digital chairman, said the collaboration connects Bhutan’s renewable energy infrastructure with institutional-grade liquidity to support the country’s diversification agenda beyond traditional economic sectors. Blockchain Integration Across National Systems Beyond mining, Bhutan has deployed blockchain-based national identity systems serving 800,000 citizens on Ethereum after migrating from Polygon, with the transition completed in October, enabling Verifiable Credentials and digital signing capabilities. Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay said leveraging Ethereum’s globally distributed network strengthens the security, transparency, and resilience of digital infrastructure serving nearly the entire population. Bhutan has migrated its self-sovereign identity system to Ethereum, enabling 800K citizens to verify their identity on a public blockchain. #Bhutan #EthereumBlockchain #BhutanNDI https://t.co/GxMSpUcuN3 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 14, 2025 Back in May, the Kingdom enabled crypto payments across tourism merchants through partnerships with DK Bank and Binance Pay , allowing visitors to use over 100 cryptocurrencies for everything from airline tickets and hotel stays to roadside fruit stalls. Over 100 local merchants now accept digital assets, with Damcho Rinzin, tourism director, describing the system as advancing innovation and inclusion while supporting sustainable development goals. Most recently, Bhutan launched TER , a Solana-based token backed by physical gold reserves distributed through DK Bank, positioning the nation among the few experimenting with state-backed tokenized assets. Mindfulness City as Economic Catalyst Gelephu Mindfulness City operates as a Special Administrative Region designed to attract international capital through regulatory clarity and modern financial connectivity while preserving cultural values. King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck framed GMC as a shared national enterprise in which citizens function as stakeholders, with new land policies ensuring that Bhutanese from all regions benefit from development proceeds, since most acreage remains state-owned. “ As your King, I must ensure that every Bhutanese is a custodian, stakeholder, and beneficiary of GMC ,” the monarch said. “ Think of GMC as a company and landowners as its shareholders. “ Market Outlook Supports Strategic Holding Bitcoin traded at $87,274 today , up 1.9% in Asian hours as exchange reserves hit record lows and traders awaited US inflation data. Major asset managers, including Bitwise and Grayscale, project that Bitcoin will exceed its previous all-time highs in 2026 , despite traditional cycle theory predicting corrections, as institutional capital inflows through platforms like Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo accelerate adoption. Bitwise and Grayscale predict Bitcoin will break its four-year cycle and reach new all-time highs in 2026 driven by institutional capital and regulatory clarity. #Bitcoin #Bitwise #Grayscale https://t.co/mL6smmtfjl — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 16, 2025 Bhutan’s pledge aligns with the growing sovereign and corporate adoption of digital assets, as global crypto ETPs have attracted $87 billion in net inflows since US products launched in January 2024.

Workers with college degrees are looking at a job market that’s gotten way less friendly than it was just a few years ago. Tuesday’s jobs report didn’t bring good news. The nation’s unemployment rate went up to 4.6%. Industries full of desk workers, tech, finance, that sort of thing, have been cutting positions in October and November. Labor Department numbers show companies that usually hire white-collar employees have been pulling back on hiring this year. More people with college degrees are finding themselves out of work. All this job market worry is making people anxious about the economy in general. The University of Michigan keeps track of how consumers feel about economic conditions, and right now those numbers are sitting near record lows . After almost five years of inflation chipping away at paychecks, lots of Americans are having a hard time financially. College-educated workers used to feel pretty safe from economic problems. Not anymore. Things have changed fast. Just a few years back, these same people were getting promotions and raises pretty regularly. Now they’re just trying to hang onto what they have, scared by all the news about layoffs, artificial intelligence taking over, and how rough it is out there for people looking for work. Fear of job loss hits record levels New numbers from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, gathered in November, show something pretty striking. Workers with bachelor’s degrees or more now think there’s a 15% chance they’ll lose their jobs in the next year. Three years ago, that number was 11%. What’s really wild is that this educated group now thinks losing their job is more likely than people with less education do. That’s completely backwards from how things used to be. And they’re not feeling good about finding new work either. These college-educated workers figure they’ve only got about a 47% shot at landing a job within three months if they got laid off today. Three years ago, they would’ve said 60%. The government doesn’t really have a solid definition for white-collar workers, but basically it means office employees with higher education, bachelor’s degrees or at least some college. By some measures, this group is still doing okay. For workers 25 and older with bachelor’s degrees or higher, unemployment is at 2.9%. That’s relatively low, though it’s up from 2.5% a year earlier. People with college degrees still make a lot more money than those without them. But a lot of folks are starting to feel like something big is shifting. Right after the pandemic, companies were scrambling to hire office workers to deal with all the extra demand. Lately though, big companies including Amazon , United Parcel Service, and Target have been announcing white-collar job cuts. Some of them hired too many people and are fixing that mistake now. Others have hit pause on hiring while they figure out new White House tariff policies and budget cuts. AI threatens to replace office workers Company leaders are putting out warnings about artificial intelligence making the situation even worse . Earlier this year, Ford Motor’s CEO Jim Farley said the technology will “replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.” Data from Indeed shows job postings in some white-collar areas are way below where they were before the pandemic. Software development jobs in mid-December were only at 68% of their February 2020 level. Marketing roles were at 81% of pre-pandemic levels. Healthcare postings have held up much better, mostly because it’s a lot harder to replace those workers with AI. Federal workers also face uncertainty Government workers, who’ve traditionally had job security and good benefits, are dealing with a new reality too. Tuesday’s report showed federal employment dropped by 6,000 jobs in November. That came after a huge loss of 162,000 federal jobs in October, when workers who took a deferred-resignation deal came off the payroll. A lot of those people are scrambling for work now. Private-sector workers who got laid off back in spring or summer are burning through whatever severance they got. Even secure government jobs feel shaky. Priscilla Kloewer, an engineer who works for the federal government in Rhode Island, would’ve put her chances of losing her job at maybe 2% before the recent government shutdown. She didn’t get furloughed during the shutdown, but now she figures the risk is somewhere around 10% or less. Kloewer and her husband have a toddler, and they’re holding off on buying new appliances until Congress passes a longer funding bill. They’re watching prices go up for child care, groceries, and insurance. “I’m in a better position than people I know who are not white-collar workers,” Kloewer told Wall Street Journal. “It still feels precarious.” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",Economy|Amazon|Federal Reserve|Target|UPS|USD,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-17 09:47:30

ADA has been stabilizing near $0.40 following repeated rejections at higher levels, even as on-chain data begins flashing early bullish signals. Still, patience is thinning among bagholders who entered at higher prices. As uncertainty lingers around timing and conviction, attention has been drifting toward a new crypto coin priced under $0.05 that is attracting steady accumulation. This shift is shaping conversations around what crypto to buy now, the best crypto to buy now, and whether recovery focused capital should rotate toward structured early stage opportunities. Cardano On-Chain Optimism Faces Technical Barriers Cardano has been consolidating just above the $0.40 level after failing to sustain a move beyond the upper boundary of a falling wedge pattern. Price action has remained subdued, yet on-chain and derivatives indicators have been quietly improving. Data from CryptoQuant has been showing increased whale sized orders alongside buy side dominance across spot and futures markets, signaling that larger participants are positioning for a potential rebound. Even so, immediate resistance near $0.51 remains intact, and a failure to break higher could still expose ADA to a dip toward the $0.37 support zone. As a result, traders evaluating what is the best cryptocurrency to invest in are increasingly balancing Cardano’s improving signals against its slow execution, prompting some to explore alternatives with clearer timelines. Mutuum Finance Strong Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been emerging as a best cheap crypto to buy now for investors seeking recovery driven upside rather than prolonged consolidation. The presale has reached Phase 6, now 98% filled, leaving limited allocation available at the current price of $0.035. This price represents a 250% increase from the Phase 1 entry of $0.01, highlighting how early positioning has already paid off. Mutuum Finance has raised $19,500,000 since the presale began, while total MUTM holders have grown to 18,480, signaling broad participation rather than isolated speculation. Phase 6 has been selling out fast, and the chance to scoop tokens this cheap is quickly ending. Once Phase 7 opens, pricing will rise nearly 20% to $0.04, reinforcing urgency for those still on the sidelines. The MUTM launch price is set at $0.06, and current buyers are positioning for an estimated 410% upside after launch, a figure frequently cited in discussions around what crypto to buy now before listings reset valuations. Mutuum Finance V1 Protocol Mutuum Finance has been advancing beyond presale momentum by confirming concrete development milestones. The team has announced that the V1 protocol will debut on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025, introducing core components including a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will serve as the initial assets for lending, borrowing, and collateral functions, setting a focused foundation before broader expansion. This announcement has been reinforcing confidence among participants who prioritize delivery timelines when deciding what crypto to invest in during uncertain market phases. Community engagement has also been visible through the launch of a live dashboard displaying a leaderboard of the top 50 holders. The recently introduced 24 Hour Leaderboard has been adding a competitive layer, as the top ranked user receives a $500 MUTM bonus each day after completing at least one transaction. The leaderboard resets daily at 00:00 UTC, maintaining continuous participation and visibility. Mutuum Finance Security Focus Security preparations have remained central to Mutuum Finance’s positioning as a recovery focused DeFi crypto. The project has confirmed that an independent audit is in progress, with Halborn Security actively reviewing the lending and borrowing smart contracts. Code has been finalized and is undergoing formal analysis, a step that has been closely watched by investors prioritizing risk management over hype. This emphasis on verification has differentiated Mutuum Finance from many early stage tokens, especially for buyers asking what is the best cryptocurrency to invest in as the market rebuilds confidence. As Cardano holders weigh patience against opportunity, strategy shifts are becoming more apparent. ADA’s improving data offers potential, yet Mutuum Finance is presenting a defined entry window under $0.05 with visible milestones. For traders reassessing the best crypto to buy now, this contrast is increasingly shaping recovery focused portfolios.

Revenue growth of 235% over 12 months vastly outpaces peers, supporting a Buy rating. Current 39x earnings multiple appears cheap given projected growth and AI HPC positioning. I forecast a $55 price target, implying 49% upside, with risks acknowledged but outweighed by performance. Since my last article on IREN Limited ( IREN ), the stock roughly doubled, and at one point it exceeded my price target of $20 by nearly 4x. On October 15, the company reached a high of $74.15 and has consolidated since then. IREN is currently down 25% over the past month, and I think the pullback has been enough to consolidate the triple-digit percentage rally. IREN: Stock Surged 96% Since My Last Article (Seeking Alpha) I still think that the AI-powered company remains well-positioned to ride high-demand waves of Bitcoin mining and AI HPC. The company has grown its revenue by 235% over the past 12 months , a 26x outperformance versus peers at 9%, making the current earnings multiple of about 39x appear cheap. It heavily focuses on positioning itself to secure a market-leading stance in the AI HPC space, and I believe this could be a foundational industry in the years ahead. It's quite difficult to think otherwise, seeing mega-cap names, such as Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT ), Meta Platforms, Inc. ( META ), and Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) ( GOOGL ), heavily investing in the space. To remind, IREN actually has $9.7 billion contract with Microsoft , and this excites me. It also makes me upgrade my rating from Buy to Strong Buy. I forecast a $55 price target over the next 12 months. This presents 49% upside possibility and broader market outperformance. Q1 2026: It's All About The Scale Now The company delivered Q1 2026 results on November 6, and shareholders were excited to see what kind of progress IREN has achieved over the course of 3 months. Spoiler alert: this was a strong performance. Now, the company generated $240 million in revenue, and that is more than 300% top-line growth over the year. The hype behind the stock is justified, as it has outperformed its peers by 26x versus 9% revenue growth . I think investors are excited to see that the business is well-managed and execution risks tied to scalability are reduced. This is a great head start for an AI business. IREN: Q1 2026 Highlights (IREN Investor Relations) Well, it's also lovely to see that IREN posted a large increase in net income. This reached $385 million mark, a great turnaround from negative performance in Q1 2025. In my opinion, investors are also seeking sustainability, and now that they see a massive increase in profitability while in parallel successfully scaling, that makes IREN a great company and an interesting opportunity for many. I have previously mentioned a multi-year contract with Microsoft, and I think it's very important for the AI infrastructure play. To be frank, in many ways. Now that IREN has a major deal signed from one of the best companies in the world, the market may view IREN as a significant AI infrastructure leader instead of a legacy Bitcoin miner that remains heavily dependent on underlying asset volatility. According to investors, they see a more broadly diversified business operation, which is reducing the risk that IREN's results could dramatically change over the course of months if crypto performs poorly and sentiment remains suppressed. That's not the case anymore. Management said it expects $1.9 billion in ARR from this deal, which would reflect nearly 4x growth versus FY2025 revenue of roughly $500 million. Now, there are not that many companies in the broader markets that are delivering such phenomenal revenue growth. And it's also backed by a contract with Microsoft that needs data center capabilities, and IREN is positioned to supply that. I wouldn't be surprised if tailwinds play out and the global data more than doubles in size, reaching $585 billion by 2032 , IREN becomes a leading name in the AI infrastructure market. So far, it scales fast and has the funds to do so. A few weeks ago, management announced $2 billion convertible offering . The company is raising equity, and some funds could be used for data center buildout. IREN: Q1 2026 Capex And Funding (IREN Investor Relations) I also love to see that management accent it will seek a prudent balance of debt and equity while scaling and meeting its Capex requirements. Based on Oracle Corporation's ( ORCL ) poor recent performance, reflecting more than a 30% drop over the course of a few months, investors are really not happy with getting into severe debt to scale. As long as AI-related spending comes from the companies' earnings, I think that the majority of the investors are cautious but not panicking. Now, from an ORCL perspective, the snip down below shows that free cash flow dropped from $9.5 billion in the positive area to more than $13.2 billion in the negative zone, really making investors worry. They have expressed their frustration with the selling pressure. IREN: Oracle Free Cash Flow Collapsed (Oracle Investor Relations) I believe that IREN, so far, is in the fairly safe zone. As management indicated, it will use a mix of sources to meet Capex demand, from cash liquidity to convertible notes. Also, it posted $142 million in operating cash flow from activities, and that largely eliminates that risk. As I write in the title, it's all about the scale now. If management can minimize any execution risks, scale fast enough to meet the demand, and do it prudently, I believe investors may be happy. I think we should all agree that the data center buildout is a long game, and it's great to see IREN positioning itself to take a large portion of the market share. Can Bitcoin Rebound From Here? Bitcoin mining is still the core business of IREN, although it has pivoted to an AI HPC play. It has generated $233 million in revenue from this business, accounting for 93% of the total revenue. It tells me that the market may view IREN as a legacy Bitcoin miner, and as a result, it is likely going to follow the volatility of the underlying asset. BTC is down approximately 19% over the past 12 months , and this is far from ideal for IREN. Of course, the good thing is that IREN's strength is tied to cheap electricity, and the costs to mine 1 BTC remain suppressed. As the slide below shows, the mining business is still highly profitable, and as long as BTC is trading around $100,000 until its next halving cycle, I don't think investors should worry too much. IREN: Q1 2026 Revenue (IREN Investor Relations) Now, if we turn our focus on the crypto coin itself, it has been a solid year since the beginning of October, but then the trend dramatically shifted. Bitcoin is down 45% since its previous high on October 5 of about $124,000 to the current trading level of $86,000. We are in a bear market , that's a fact. We have passed the 20% eligibility mark for a bear market a while ago. Investors were worried about what would happen with mining companies if Bitcoin entered a bear market. Based on the performance above, IREN is doing just fine. Of course, if BTC-USD trades in the range from $85,000 to $100,000 further, the AI HPC play will take a hit on revenue, but now with the data center pivot backed by a Microsoft contract, I would think that such a partially Bitcoin-driven drop in IREN price appears overly pessimistic. What could make the Bitcoin rebound from here? That's a difficult question, and I think it really depends on a few things. On December 19, the Bank of Japan will announce its decision on interest rates , and I think this has been the key catalyst suppressing the stock over the past week. Now, if they hike, although if it's only a 25 bps increase, this shows policy tightening, which caps the outlook. I also believe that investors remember flashbacks tied to the carry trade, as hikes in Japan could cause some turbulence in financial markets around the world. So if the BoJ decides to pause the hike, we may see a relief rally. Typically, the last three months of the year are a bullish environment for crypto, but that hasn't played out this year. At least, so far. The last time Bitcoin underwent a negative Q4 was in 2022 , but then it rebounded the following quarter with an impressive 77% gain. We never had so many DAT companies, and in theory, they should provide a floor price for the underlying asset, but with significant volatility, there is also a threat. For instance, Strategy is heavily acquiring Bitcoin, but not all the purchases are funded by an ATM. It also has debt tied to convertibles, and if Bitcoin approaches dangerous levels, it may be forced to sell. Obviously, this would heavily suppress sentiment in the crypto space and accelerate the sell-off. Is that a risk? Obviously, but on the other hand, a 45% pullback may seem sufficient. The current administration is pro-crypto, and digital asset adoption has never been less constrained. For instance, Trump signed the GENIUS Act , enabling a clearer framework for stablecoins. Also, based on this article , Harvard owns roughly $500 million in Bitcoin. Yes, the crypto coin remains volatile, but there are obvious signs that adoption has accelerated. Bitcoin is in a bear market. Yes, it's painful for crypto-related equities, but highlighting a relatively low cost to mine for IREN, it's not the end of the world. The segment continues to be profitable, and although it may limit the pace of scalability, the broader picture remains intact. I think investors should view IREN as less BTC-dependent, especially since its AI HPC pivot is backed by a multi-year deal. IREN Is Still Cheap If Growth Delivers I understand that after a 2,600% surge in the stock price over the past 4 years, it could appear strange that I name IREN cheap, but I truly think that's the case. Before jumping into the analysis, I kindly invite you to read my previous article on the AI play , which covers a more in-depth analysis. Now, a few months have passed, and I think the valuation needs an update. IREN currently trades at roughly 38x forward P/E , signaling a 58% premium versus peers, but I don't think that's expensive. The stock trades at roughly 34x versus the fiscal FY2027 EPS estimate, making it appear even more compelling. IREN: Forward P/E (YCharts) The chart above shows that the current earnings multiple is business-typical. There's no extreme fear nor outsized euphoria. Now, I would like you to zoom out from the earnings multiple and think about the company's core focus. IREN is heavily investing in data center capabilities to supply the high demand it experiences, so I would lean toward forward EV/Sales or Price/Sales metrics to describe the valuation. So, on a forward EV/Sales and Price/Sales ratios of 11.41 and 11.47 , respectively, the AI HPC play doesn't look cheap, but roughly 3.3x premium versus the sector medians of 3.46, in my opinion, is insignificant. I would like to remind you that IREN has grown its revenue by 235% over the past 12 months, a massive outperformance compared to peers at 9%. And even if we dismiss this, management said it expects $1.9 billion in ARR from the multi-billion-dollar deal with Microsoft. I argue for further revenue expansion, and from that perspective, IREN is still cheap. One more thing I would like to mention is that IREN operates at above-market margins. That is mainly due to its strength and ability to mine Bitcoin at relatively low cost, supported by my analysis of its recent quarterly performance. But we also need to understand that revenue derived from the AI data center is also tied to premium margins, and actually, in Q1 2026, management said it expects about 85% project EBITDA margin . So, the gross profit margin (TTM) IREN operates now reaches 70% , a 43% advantage over peers at 49%. Also, the net income margin (TTM) of 76% indicates significant outperformance versus the sector median of 5%. I truly think these are outstanding results, which argue for a higher premium. Wall Street expects that IREN may post $1.16 billion in revenue in fiscal FY2026, and $2.70 billion in fiscal FY2027. That's triple-digit growth on back-to-back years. I truly think IREN could achieve these numbers, especially if it avoids execution risks tied to scaling and supplying client needs. On top of that, if Bitcoin behaves and rebounds from here, there is a possibility it could deliver a higher revenue growth than that. At a fiscal FY2027 revenue estimate of $2.7 billion, IREN would trade at 4.88x forward Price/Sales. That's only a 29% premium versus the sector median of 3.46x . Based on the last report, IREN had 283.5 million shares outstanding, and if my expectations tied to the revenue estimate come to fruition, at a forward P/S of 6x, it may reach the price target of $55. This would indicate a 73% premium forward P/S versus peers, but even then, IREN would likely be cheap if triple-digit growth rates become a strong high-double-digit revenue expansion. I Think That IREN Is A Strong Buy Now Yes, I have upgraded my rating, because at the current price, it appears that the market discounts future tailwinds. Don't get me wrong, I think that both risks tied to continued downward momentum in Bitcoin and uncertainty around heavy Capex spending are reasonable. But I also argue they may be a bit overblown. Just think about this, Bitcoin was always a volatile asset, and despite it, IREN mines at a huge profit. Now, AI may be revolutionary, and demand is also backed by a multi-year, billion-dollar contract by one of the best companies in the world. I will not argue that I know better than tech leaders. Now, we also need to account for other risks and concerns, which I think are important. Although it seems that IREN successfully copes with risks tied to execution, unexpected supply issues or a need to raise cash could weigh on the stock. Also, AI HPC revenue is tiny compared to Bitcoin mining, and if the crypto landscape remains suppressed, the downside is not protected. I also think that it may take time for the market to rethink the thesis about IREN; it may be heavily dependent on Bitcoin volatility despite the AI HPC pivot. So, just keep that in mind. I believe AI capabilities are revolutionary, and they are here to stay. Yes, it's natural for sentiment to shift from bearish to super bullish, and vice versa, and I also don't think the gen-AI we see today is the end product. There's a possibility that companies will come up with new AI-driven solutions over the next years, and it is probably more likely that these will require more compute than ever. This is where IREN comes into the broader picture. I have revised my rating to Strong Buy. I forecast a $55 price target over the next year, highlighting a 49% upside potential.

One such case involves a Solana ( SOL )-based trader identified by the wallet address BxNU5a , who turned an initial investment of roughly $180,000 into approximately $3.6 million in less than two months through early accumulation of the AI agent token Pippin (PIPPIN), according to the latest on-chain data retrieved by Finbold from Lookonchain on December 17. On-chain data shows the trader began building the position on October 24 by executing a series of token swaps on Raydium, converting USDT into wrapped SOL (WSOL) and then into Pippin. Rather than deploying the full amount in a single transaction, the wallet accumulated tokens through multiple swaps, each ranging from about $1,000 to $3,000. These transactions resulted in the purchase of approximately 8.15 million Pippin tokens at relatively low prices, when the asset was still trading near its early base levels.

At the time, these purchases reflected modest dollar values but collectively built a sizable position while liquidity remained thin. The wallet has not recorded corresponding sell transactions, indicating the trader continues to hold the full allocation. Understanding PIPPIN’s rally Since then, Pippin has staged a sharp rally. By press time, PIPPIN was trading at $0.4229, down about 10% over the past 24 hours. On a weekly basis, the token is still up nearly 30%, while monthly gains exceed 1,400%.

Source: Coin Market Cap The rally has been fueled in part by aggressive buying from large investors, with whale wallets accumulating roughly $1.5 million worth of tokens and pulling significant supply off exchanges. Notably, more than 44% of the circulating supply has been withdrawn from trading platforms in recent weeks, creating a supply squeeze that amplified demand. The move has also been supported by rising retail interest and broader enthusiasm for AI-linked tokens. However, the surge carries notable risks. Supply data suggests a single entity may control over 70% of PIPPIN’s tokens across multiple wallets, leaving the market vulnerable to sudden sell-offs. While such concentration is common in early-stage projects, limited transparency around distribution and token control raises concerns that sentiment could reverse quickly if large holders begin to exit.

Most larger-cap altcoins are quite sluggish, with ETH slipping to $2,900, while XRP has defended the $1.90 support. BTC Falls to $86K Recall that just a week ago, before and after the Fed’s decision to lower the interest rates, BTC’s price was riding high as it challenged $94,500 on a couple of occasions. However, the subsequent rejections, especially the second one, brought a lot of pain and uncertainty for the asset. It first fell to $90,000 but managed to defend that level by the end of the business week and during most of the weekend. It slipped to $88,000 on Sunday but quickly rebounded to $90,000. The landscape changed for the worse on Monday afternoon when bitcoin suddenly plunged by more than four grand to just over $85,000. It rebounded to $88,000 yesterday but was stopped there and now struggles to remain above $86,000. Its market capitalization has declined further to $1.720 trillion, while its dominance over the alts stands at just under 57%. BTCUSD Dec 17. Source: TradingView PI Rebounds, ASTER Dumps As mentioned above, the larger-cap alts are quite stable on a daily scale, with little to no fireworks. ETH is slightly in the red to just over $2,900, XRP has remained above $1.90, and BNB stands at $860. BCH and XMR have posted the most substantial gains, while CC and TAO have dropped the most. ASTER leads once again on the losing side, with another 8.5% decline in the past 24 hours. PUMP and ENA follow suit. In contrast, NIGHT has gained 6%, followed by SKY and PI, both of which have marked 4% increases. Pi Network’s native token dipped below $0.20 yesterday but now sits inches above that line. The total crypto market cap has lost another $30 billion overnight and is close to breaking below the $3 trillion level. Cryptocurrency Market Overview Dec 17.

The $BTC price is currently at the bottom of a bear flag with a yawning chasm below. Is the king of cryptocurrencies about to fall in, or is there still the possibility of a recovery even now? Bear flag could spell disaster Source: TradingView Bear flags are bad enough at the best of times, and with this current bear flag also having its bottom just below the major trendline, this one could spell disaster. If the $BTC price falls out of the bottom of the flag and confirms below, the least amount of damage is probably the measured move out of the ascending channel, which would potentially take the price down to around $75,500. Notwithstanding, if the bear flag plays out, the measured move would take the price down to the low $50,000s. This would be below the previous bull market top of $69,000, and would have pro-Bitcoiners scratching their heads as to what on earth could come next. However, on the other side of the coin, if the $BTC price can bounce from the bottom of the flag/channel, and show that this is just a bottoming process that is playing out, the adamantine hands that are still holding could perhaps be proved right in the end. Where there is life there is hope Source: TradingView The daily time frame helps to take out some of the noise, and here it can be seen that as things stand the current daily candle body might be peeping below the major trendline, but there is plenty of time left in the day for it to close back above. The downtrend line from the all-time high is not clear cut, and two possible lines can be drawn. The $BTC price remains above the inner but is a good way short of the outer trendline. This outer trendline needs to be broken through for the trend change to begin. While there is life there is hope, and this is the case here, with the price just managing to hold at the major trendline, the bottom of the flag, and at the horizontal support level at $86,000. If these fail, the bull market probably fails with them. A ray of hope is the daily Stochastic RSI, which shows its indicators approaching the bottom. A cross-up of the indicator lines is desperately needed here, and it needs to signal a much bigger bounce than up to now if the bulls are to extricate themselves from this highly perilous position. Trendlines and horizontal support Source: TradingView The weekly chart also shows two trendline possibilities. Looking at the inner, faint dotted trendline, it can be seen that the $BTC price came down through this in mid-November. More touchpoints perhaps make this a more valid trendline. If an arguably more valid trendline has already been breached, and the price has confirmed at least 4 weekly candles below, the price could be in the process of making its way to a bottom. The thing is, where is that bottom? And could that just be a stopping point on the way to a much deeper correction? The debate here so far has been all about trendlines. However, in technical analysis, while trendlines are undoubtedly very important, support and resistance levels have a lot more importance. If one looks at the macro price structure in the weekly chart above, it can be observed that if the price continues to fall it will meet with an extremely strong support band that really could be the make or break for Bitcoin. It is based on the previous bull market top of 2021, plus the top of the 8-month bull flag that stretched through much of 2024. As far as support levels go, this is as strong as it gets. Will the $BTC price reach this level? This remains to be seen. That said, with all Bitcoin’s sound money properties and with the backdrop of major failing economies, if the price did get there, buying could be huge.
